https://www.emergent.info/Foley-ransom	Claim: The US threatened to prosecute the family of slain journalist James Foley	unverified	[]	https://abcnews.go.com/	https://abcnews.go.com/International/government-threatened-foley-family-ransom-payments-mother-slain/story?id=25453963&singlePage=true	2014/09/23	"Video Appears to Show Beheading of US Journalist James FoleyNicole Tung/AP PhotoIn this Nov. 2012, file photo, posted on the website freejamesfoley.org, shows missing journalist James Foley while covering the civil war in Aleppo, Syria.Diane Foley told ABC News earlier this week that warnings over the summer came primarily from a highly decorated military officer serving on the White House's National Security Council staff. James Foley’s brother, Michael, also told ABC News that he was directly threatened with possible prosecution by a State Department official.“It was very upsetting because we were essentially told to trust… that the way they were handling things would bring our son home,” Diane Foley said.The U.S. government did try to rescue James Foley along with other American and European hostages from an ISIS stronghold in Syria in early July, but by the time the elite commandos arrived at the location, the hostages had been moved. Foley was executed weeks later by a self-professed ISIS militant.Digital GlobeThis satellite photo shows a compound on the Euphrates River just south of Raqqah, Syria where ISIS hostages, including James Foley, were believed to have been held in the Spring of 2014 based on descriptions by former hostages.Diane Foley said the family believed they knew where their son was being held prior to his execution, but other than the July rescue mission, it didn’t seem like anything was being done.“But we’re not politicians, we’re not government people, we don’t know,” she said. Diane Foley said the problem was that the family “had no idea” because the government didn’t tell them.At times, Diane Foley said the family “had to beg” the government for information on their son.“We were an annoyance, it felt, at some level… They didn’t have time for us,” she said.Today White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said that government officials were in constant contact with the Foley family and declined to comment on the alleged ransom warnings, telling reporters he’s “not going to be in a position to detail the kinds of conversations that took place so often between members of the administration and the Foley family.”“It is a long standing policy of this administration, it was the policy of previous administrations that ransoms should not be paid to terrorist organizations,” Earnest said before referring more specific questions about the Foley’s situation to the Justice Department .Secretary of State John Kerry today told reporters that he was “really taken aback [and] surprised” by Foley’s allegations. “I can tell you that I am totally unaware and would not condone anybody that I know of within the State Department making such statements,” Kerry said.State Department spokesperson Marie Harf today denied the State Department told the family they could be prosecuted for paying ransom, only that the department helps hostage families “understand what our laws are about terrorists or paying ransom to terrorists.”“But this department would never and did not ever intend nor do we think we ever did anything that we would consider threatening,” Harf said.Obtained by ABC NewsA screengrab from a video posted online appears to show American journalist James Foley shortly before he is killed by a masked captor.Thursday an NSC spokeswoman also said that the Foley family was informed of U.S. laws banning terrorism financing but denied the family was told they could face charges if they made a ransom payment.""Without getting into the details of our private discussions with families, the law is clear that ransom payments to designated individuals or entities, such as ISIL [ISIS], are prohibited. It is also a matter of longstanding policy that the U.S. does not grant concessions to hostage takers. Doing so would only put more Americans at risk of being taken captive. That is what we convey publicly and what we convey privately,"" NSC spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a statement.The spokeswoman also asked ABC News to withhold the military officer's name for fear his personal security could be compromised by those who might wrongly blame U.S. officials for Foley's slaughter at the hands of ISIS militants who may never have considered sparing him for any price.Diane Foley did not disclose how much her family had raised before his high-profile public execution but she and a surviving son, Michael, said that the administration's intimidation tactics succeeded.""It slowed my parents down quite a bit. They didn't want to do anything that could get them in trouble. It slowed them down for months in raising money. Who knows what might have happened?"" Michael Foley said.The family launched the James W. Foley Legacy Fund this week, which in large part is intended to help other hostages' loved ones navigate the frustrating currents they encountered both with the terrorists and with their own government.Two American and several British hostages remain in ISIS captivity.Asked whether she had believed ISIS would accept a ransom payment and free their son, as they had many European hostages liberated for between $2-3 million each, Diane Foley replied, ""I do, maybe -- I mean, who knows?""""ISIS is a very brutal group. They may have already decided, that Jim and the others were Americans and they were going to kill him,"" Diane Foley said.In the end, Diane Foley said she didn't want to blame anyone for what happened to her son, but said that when it comes to the U.S. government’s treatment of the families of hostages, “As Americans, we can do better.”"		1
https://www.emergent.info/apple-watch-customize-crown	Claim: When you buy your Apple Watch you will choose your Crown color	unverified	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Components', 'Dan Moren', 'Six Colors']	https://sixcolors.com/	https://sixcolors.com/2015/02/whats-up-with-apple-watch-editions-digital-crown/	2015/02/12	"Sponsor: Audio Hijack - Jason Snell says it's his ""favorite audio utility."" Why not check it out ?February 12, 2015 1:02 PM PTWhat’s up with Apple Watch Edition’s Digital Crown?By Dan MorenSomething odd struck me recently as I perused the Apple Watch product pages. Several pictures of the Apple Watch Edition —aka the Super-Fancy Gold-That’s-Better-Than-Gold Spectacular model—show the center of the Digital Crown as different colors: I count black, white, navy blue, and red. Generally they seem to be color coordinated with the strap shown in the picture.Okay, sure, that makes sense. After all, the Edition is a piece of jewelry that most people expect is going to cost in the thousands of dollars. Naturally you’d expect a little design flourish here and there. 1I’m mainly curious about the logistics involved: Is each accent color model a different SKU? Can you buy one where the color doesn’t match the band? What if you buy multiple bands? Are the dots interchangeable—are they perhaps little magnetic pieces that click into place? Are the crowns themselves interchangeable? What if the center of the crown is actually a miniature LCD screen that changes color depending on what band you attach?! 2Reel it in, Moren, reel it in. Okay. Let’s go with the simplest solution: you’ll probably pick the accent color when you buy it, and then basically be stuck with it, no matter which band you choose. The thinking perhaps being that most people will stick with a single watchband, viewing the whole watch-plus-band as a single unit (like most fancy watches). 3 Cool as swappable crowns would be, I’m hard pressed to imagine that the crowd Apple wants this model to appeal to—the fashion-conscious market—is going to be keeping track of or swapping out replacement dots/crowns.This contrasts with the Apple Watch Sport, in which the crown is the same color as the case—silver or space gray—and the standard Apple Watch, where the crown is always black. ↩Full credit to my Rebound co-host John Moltz who suggested this particular crazy theory during our most recent episode. ↩Unless, say, they’re swapping to the plastic one for working out, in which case maybe they don’t care if it matches? ↩[ Dan Moren is a freelance writer, podcaster, and former Macworld editor.

https://www.emergent.info/400-men-castrated	Claim: 400 men were castrated on the orders of an Indian spiritual guru	unverified	['Castration', 'Dera Sacha Sauda', 'Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh', 'India']	https://www.hindustantimes.com/	https://www.hindustantimes.com/haryana/dera-sacha-sauda-head-got-followers-castrated-to-protect-sadhvis-from-sexual-exploitation-petitioner/article1-1300920.aspx	2015/03/02	punjabDera Sacha Sauda chief faces castration chargesOn why they agreed to undergo castration, Gurdas Singh Toor alias Bitu (46), a witness in this case, claimed it was done on the pretext that removing testis would lead to salvation.punjab Updated: Dec 28, 2014 01:09 ISTSat SinghHindustan TimesDays after the Punjab and Haryana High Court asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe the mass castration of full-time followers of Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, the petitioner in the case has revealed the castrations were done to safeguard sadhvis (female full-time followers) from possible sexual advances.Hans Raj, the petitioner, told Hindustan Times, “The culture of initiating female devotees as full-timers was started by Dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim and he was concerned about possible sexual advances by male full-timers (sadhus). Such followers, who would become impotent, can be used as potent weapon against his enemies”.Hans Raj was a sadhu in Dera Sacha Sauda from 1996 to 2012 and worked as a musician for Dera chief’s religious programmes.Hans Raj said he was awed by Dera chief’s power. But when one after another sadhus who dared to raise voice against the chief were eliminated, he decided to face his fear by filing petition for a CBI probe in July, 2012.The court had then directed the state government to investigate the case and a medical examination found his testis surgically removed, which is in sync with his claims that over 400 followers were castrated at Sirsa Dera. On why they agreed to undergo castration, Gurdas Singh Toor alias Bitu (46), a witness in this case, claimed it was done on the pretext that removing testis would lead to salvation. “Castrated followers were not allowed to meet their family or venture outside DSS campus on their own,” he said.While handing over the probe to CBI, the HC had observed that Haryana police’s investigation was worthless.Dera Sacha Sauda spokesperson Dr Aditya Insan rubbished the allegations. He said all the allegations were false and baseless and the petitioner in the case had left dera 3 years ago. He said the controversies were the handiwork of drug mafia who were up in arms against them.		1
https://www.emergent.info/miracle-cat-back-from-grave	Claim: A cat that was hit by a car and believed dead dug himself out of his grave	true	['Animals', 'Cats', 'Florida', 'Zombies']	https://humanesocietytampa.org/	https://humanesocietytampa.org/miracle-cat-comes-back-from-the-grave/	2015/01/28	January 26, 2015 February 2, 2017Miracle Cat Comes Back From The Grave!By Humane Society of Tampa Bay In In The News Tags bart the cat , miracle cat , tampa bay , zombie catUPDATE! February 2, 2017 Here is how comfortable Bart feels in his new home: His mom purchased a soft, stuffed elephant as a Christmas present for her baby niece. Bart proceeded to pilfer through the bag, drag the elephant out, carry it to his sleeping spot and snuggle up with it for a nap. It’s been his ever since and is the only toy in the house the other animals don’t dare touch. The niece did receive a holiday gift, just not the elephant.UPDATE! September 14, 2016 It’s Official, Bart is OURS!After 20 months in our care, countless hours of paperwork, and millions of prayers and well-wishes from across the world, we finally have been legally granted ownership of Bart the Miracle Cat to the Humane Society of Tampa Bay! But he was only ours for a few hours as his foster family prepared to make his place in their home permanent. At 1:00pm Wednesday, September 14th at our shelter we celebrated the end of the custody battle and, consequently, his adoption, with a “Gotcha Day” party (“Gotcha Days” are adoption birthdays in the animal welfare world).In January 2015 Bart became an internet sensation after being hit by a car, buried alive, and clawing his way out of his grave. He ended up at our animal hospital where we preformed extensive surgery to repair his broken jaw, remove his eye, and nurse him back to strength and health. The questionable circumstances surrounding his injuries led us to fight for his custody so that we could find him a loving home. To many he became known as “Zombie Cat” but to us he’s always been nothing short of a miracle. Not because we believe he rose from the dead, but because his gentle spirit, will to survive, and resilience in the face of extreme trauma embody all that we love and admire about animals. He is truly an ambassador for second chances and continues to inspire people the world over. We love you, Bart, always and forever.UPDATE! April 24, 2016 We know you haven’t heard from Bart in awhile, but he is still doing GREAT! In fact, he recently got visits from a couple of his fans. First, he and this special young lady really bonded when she was with us for Critter Camp. When he saw her last week he got so excited and rolled right over so that she could pet him. Second, this wonderful lady has been following his story since the beginning and came by to see how healthy and happy he has become. He was happy to show her the ropes of life at HSTB (sleep, eat, play, snuggle, repeat). And, finally, we wanted you to see how exhausting the celebrity life can be; here is Bart mid-yawn and ready for a nap after his morning of socializingUPDATE! February 23, 2016 Bart really is the sweetest thing but, every once in awhile, the cattitude comes out! While being visited by a friend, Bart promptly plopped on top of the toy basket so that the curious interloper would not have access. Silly kitty, we love you!UPDATE! January 13, 2016 See how Bart is doing nearly one year after being hit by a car, buried alive, and clawing from his grave! Thanks to FOX 13 News for shooting the footage.UPDATE! January 1, 2016 Happy New Year from our sweet boy, Bart! As you can see, he is fairly unimpressed with the festivitiesUPDATE! November 29, 2015 Looks like Bart had a little to much Thanksgiving. Well, he deserves it!UPDATE! October 30, 2015 You asked for it, you got it! Many of you have been wondering how our famous, one-eyed friend is doing. Well, he’s fantastic and happier than ever, and we’re still waiting on the courts to decide custody. Here, he is guarding the entrance to the break area where the staff keeps their snacks because, you know, he gets first dibs.UPDATE! September 22, 2015 Here is a picture of handsome Bart taking a moment out of his play time to pose for the camera. Such a silly kitty. He is doing well, loving life and getting more spoiled by the day. Still no news on the legal case with his previous “owner”… so for now he’s still living it up at HSTB.UPDATE! July 22, 2015 It was a snuggle up and nap kind of day for Bart. Or, is that the Princess and the Pea? Whichever, the more layers of fluff, the better the snooze!Still no update on the pending court case, we apologize!UPDATE! June 25, 2015 We post a lot about how much love Bart is getting, and he is! BUT, we may have neglected to inform you about how much love and joy he brings to US! He is a courageous, friendly, silly and affectionate kitty who greets us each day with happy enthusiasm and makes us laugh with his goofy way of jumping on our keyboards and trying to eat our lunches. Here, he made a volunteer’s day by giving her a cuddle and a kiss when she went visited him over the weekend.UPDATE! June 19, 2015 While we don’t have any information to share about the court case (still in process) we do have a cute picture to share. Yesterday, Bart got a visit from an avid fan and had a wonderful time showing off his skills with his favorite toys. The little girl had so much fun, she and her mom went out and bought him a laser toy then came back to give it to him and play some moreUPDATE! June 8, 2015 While there is still no news about the ongoing court case, we can report that Bart is doing very well in our care. He is a happy, playful and affectionate kitty who LOVES to meet new friends, like the little girl pictured here. She came in with her mom to finish registering for Critter Camp and was so excited to meet Bart. They played together for quite awhile and we’re sure she’ll be back to say hello.UPDATE! May 12, 2015 Bart had to share his space with a former adoptable who was visiting for the day. Bert the gentle giant, and Bart the feisty feline were doing great until the unknowing pit mix traveled too close to the room where Bart’s food is kept (behind and to the left of Bart). At that point there was a hallway stare down with kitty growls and doggie whimpers. The poor, intimidated pup quickly loped off to find a different office to nap in while Bart pranced around in victory.Note: Bert belongs to a staff member and is gentle with cats. We know him very well and he was supervised at all times, as was Bart. UPDATE! April 29, 2015 This lovely Canadian family was vacationing in Tampa Bay and took time out of their week to come visit with Bart! He loved meeting them and showing the children how good he was at chasing his toys around the desk. He’s an international star who just wants to be snuggled and loved!UPDATE! April 24, 2015 It’s getting pretty warm here in Tampa Bay, so Bart spent this lazy, hazy afternoon fishing.UPDATE! April 16, 2015 Bart helps comfort a nervous kitten who recently arrived at the shelter.UPDATE! April 14, 2015 Bart got a visit from a two-legged friend who came by to read him a story before his afternoon nap.[easingslider id=”24342″]UPDATE! April 13, 2015 Today, depositions began in the custody case for Bart. Ellis Hutson and Dusty Allbritton were deposed today and HSTB Executive Director Sherry Silk will be deposed next week. We wanted to let you all know that the case is in process. We are still hopeful of a victory so that Bart can continue to thrive (see pictures above) and find a loving forever home.UPDATE! April 2, 2015 Is Jack searching the basket for the perfect toy to share with his friend, Bart? Or is he simply hoarding all the goods? Either way, these two are TOO CUTE together!UPDATE! April 1, 2015 No April Fools joke here, Jack actually allowed Bart to nap in his favorite purple bed! They are becoming fast friends. Unfortunately, our staff member was without a desktop for a little while!UPDATE! March 30, 2015 Bart is a happy camper as he recently got the wires removed from his jaw and received some further repair to his palate. Dr. Justin Boorstein is very happy with his healing progress and how well he came through the surgery, although it will still be quite some time before his mouth is completely healed. He said that Bart should soon be able to start eating dry food again! In the picture above, he is happily giving himself a post-surgical bath while overseeing some of the staff in their office.UPDATE! March 25, 2015 Today, our good friends from Humane Society of Pinellas came by for a visit and got to play with Bart. He showed them his favorite toy and how he has mastered the art of snagging that ribbon!UPDATE! March 20, 2015 Bart got a visit from some young fans today and got to take his first unselfie with them! He continues to do well and will most likely get the wires removed from his jaw in the next two weeks. We’ll keep you updated!UPDATE! March 12, 2015 Bart got a visit from some very generous fans who personally presented him with his very own stroller! They wanted him to be able to get some fresh air, safely! These wonderful ladies from Sunshine Accessories in Tarpon Springs had a great time visiting with Bart and introducing him to his new ride. We can’t thank them enough! UPDATE! March 11, 2015 Today, the author of Buzz Beau Blatt the Wonder Cat sent Dr. Justin Boorstein (Bart’s surgeon) a signed copy of her children’s book In Honor of Bart! As you can see, Bart was much more interested in a snuggle with his favorite doc, but that’s OK; this book will be perfect for our Critter Camp to help teach humane values and the resilience of animals! Thank you, Linda Sumas Blatt!UPDATE! March 9, 2015 Bart has received several wonderful beds from fans across the country. Today, he found this one particularly snuggly. The perfect place to spend a Monday, don’t you think? Many thanks to all the generous folks who have sent him beds, toys, blankets, treats, cards and well-wishes.UPDATE! March 6, 2015 Bart got a luxurious bath today with a safe whitening shampoo to help make him look even more handsome than he already was! He also got a little bling on his collar and a bow to match. But his favorite part of the pampering session was a post-spa snuggle fest with a favorite staffer.UPDATE! March 5, 2015 Today, the legal process to determine custody of Bart began in court. Over the next few weeks our legal team will conduct discovery into the circumstances surrounding his situation. We will provide legal updates as they come available. In the meantime, Bart continues to do well, making great strides in his recovery, lounging in sunbeams and enjoying attention and affection from volunteers and staff.UPDATE! February 27, 2015 Not only is Bart healing well but he is also making friends! Our former feral boy, Jack, who lives at our administrative building was happy to share his favorite desk with a new friend. He didn’t budge from the bed or offer to share, but we’ll give it some time! We’re just happy to see Bart acting like a happy, normal cat again!UPDATE! February 25, 2015 It’s been a busy day for Mr. Personality! He received a letter from a fan in Germany, a new bed and treats from an admirer in Pittsburgh, and this toy from our staff which he LOVED! You can see from the picture the progression from vague interest to “oh I get what I’m supposed to do” to “SUCCESS!”.UPDATE! February 23, 2015 We don’t have much new to report on the custody case but we can say that Bart is doing fantastic. He is still healing and eating well, and has mastered the litter box! We are so proud of him. Above is a picture of him taking a nap in one of our staffer’s laps after eating his lunch.UPDATE! February 16, 2015-Bart is thriving under our care, eating well and gaining weight. He is enjoying more mobility and gets frequent visits from staff, volunteers and visitors. He loves the attention and has become quite the cuddle bug.We know there are questions about Bart’s situation and future stemming from the pending lawsuit with Mr. Hutson. Because this is an open case, there are things about which we cannot go into detail. However, we would like to try and answer some of the most frequently asked questions in the best way we can.QUESTION 1Why did you change your mind about returning Bart to his owner? We received information that the owner was actually present when Bart was buried and there was a witness claiming the cat was still alive. In addition, we discovered that Bart was not brought to us immediately after he crawled out of the grave. He suffered from severe injuries for at least 2-4 days in the care of his owner before the medical treatment was sought; this is against the law.QUESTION 2Hillsborough County Pet Resource Center is stating that they have not filed cruelty or neglect charges against the owner. Is that true? Although no charges have been filed to date, we are still hopeful that the county will file charges based on evidence of violation of the following Hillsborough County Ordinances:Sec. 6-21 Rabies Vaccination RequirementSec. 6-22 Registration & License tags RequirementSec. 6-24 Display of Tag Requirement; Cat IdentificationSec. 6-25 Humane Treatment of AnimalsSec. 6-26 Cruelty to AnimalsSec. 6-28 Confinement to Property; Dogs and Cats at Large QUESTION 3Is the Humane Society of Tampa Bay using Bart to “line their pockets” (raise money)? The Humane Society of Tampa Bay is a Charity Navigator 4-Star Charity for five years running. This is the highest rating possible for fiscal responsibility and transparency. Only 3% of money we receive goes towards administrative costs (including salaries). No one’s pockets are being lined.Most importantly, all money we have received as a result of Bart’s story has gone into a restricted fund called “Save-A-Pet Medical Fund” to pay for Bart’s medical care. This money can only be used to cover the cost of medical care for pets, like Bart, whose owners are unable to afford veterinary treatment. So, in actuality, the money we’ve raised is being given right back to the community by offering free medical treatment to pets in need.In 2014 we provided $53,413 in financial assistance from our Save-A-Pet Medical Fund for the treatment of 261 dogs and cats. QUESTION 4When will the issue of Bart’s custody be resolved? As of today, February 16, 2015, a court date has not been set. We will announce the date once it is determined.QUESTION 5How can I adopt Bart? If you are interested in adopting Bart, please send an email with your contact information to communications@humanesocietytampa.org and we will add you to the list. Please understand that the list of potential adopters for Bart currently stands at more than 100 individuals.UPDATE! February 11, 2015– On Tuesday, February 10, 2015, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay was served with official Hillsborough County Court documents notifying the Society that it is being sued by Ellis Wayne Hutson for the custody of Bart the cat.Mr. Thomas Gonzalez, of Thompson Sizemore, Gonzalez & Hearing , has agreed to volunteer his time to represent the interests of Sherry Silk, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay, and Bart the cat. The Humane Society of Tampa Bay will review all legal options to keep Bart safe and secure. Bart continues his medical treatment and care at the Society’s animal hospital.UPDATE! February 6, 2015– We have some great news about Bart! Check out that empty dish to his right, he is eating like a champ and taking his meds orally with no complaint. When we went to visit him, he was cleaning himself and full of meows and headbutts for us. He is definitely feeling better and his cute little personality is starting to shine through even more. And, we got word from Hillsborough County Pet Resource Center that they will be sending an officer to investigate the situation at the Hutson residence.UPDATE! February 4, 2015– We are so pleased that Bart continues to improve, day by day. Today when we approached his cage, he actually got up and walked to the door to greet us with chirps and meows. He is also showing a good appetite and interest in eating. He still needs the feeding tube and his jaw will remained wired for another 6 weeks, but he is definitely on the mend. We are proud of the little guy!UPDATE! February 2, 2015– Well, Bart surprised us today by taking his first bites of food since coming to our facility on January 23. This is a very good sign of his continued recovery. Because he is unable to eat enough food to sustain him, he will still need his feeding tube for several more weeks. He receives feedings every 4 hours through the tube to ensure that he is getting enough nutrients. We are so proud of this brave boy!UPDATE! February 2, 2015– Bart is resting comfortably this morning but is still unable to eat on his own. Our Director of Medical Operations believes he will need his feeding tube for a few more weeks until his jaw and palate are completely healed.UPDATE! January 30, 2105– New Information About Bart: Recently we have learned new information about Bart’s home environment and the circumstances leading up to his burial. Therefore, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay does not intend to return Bart to the Hutson family. We are prepared to fight for the best interests of this cat. We hope the Hutson family will do the right thing and surrender Bart to our care so that we can find an appropriate environment for him to live out his life.The Humane Society of Tampa Bay’s Save-A-Pet Medical Fund, along with donations for Bart that we have received from generous individuals all over the world, will cover the cost of all medical care required and will help replenish our Save-A-Pet fund for other animals in need. We are not asking the Huston family for any money to cover any costs.The Humane Society of Tampa Bay had no involvement with the creation of the GoFundMe campaign set up to cover the cost of Bart’s medical care, nor have we received any funds from the account to date. Again, Bart’s medical costs are being covered by our own Save-A-Pet Medical Fund. Our concern is for Bart’s future.As always, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay is dedicated to the plight of companion animals in our area and strives to protect and promote their best interests at all times.UPDATE! January 28, 2015– Bart was struggling due to anemia. One of our shelter cats, Draco, was the donor for a blood transfusion to help Bart feel better. The transfusion went well and both cats are happy and resting comfortably.UPDATE! January 28, 2015– Bart came through his surgery very well and is resting comfortably in our care. He will be able to go home in 5-7 days once he is able to eat on his own. Full recovery will take about six weeks. He is a brave boy!UPDATE! January 27, 2015– Bart will be having surgery to repair his jaw and remove his eye today.We have seen many amazing cases at our full-service veterinary clinic, but this situation may take the cake! Our public hospital is currently caring for Bart, a 1.5 year old cat who was found by his owner after being hit by a car. The cat appeared to be lifeless and the owner buried him. Five days later, the cat showed up in a neighbors yard, alive! He had dug himself out of the grave and slowly made his way back home, albeit weak, dehydrated and in need of medical attention.The owner reached out to area veterinary clinics but, unable to afford their fees, brought him to the our Animal Health Center where he is being treated for a broken jaw, open facial wounds and a ruined eye, which will have to be removed. Luckily, the injuries sustained were not more serious. HSTB veterinarians expect him to recover and be able to go back home.CLICK HERE to donate to Bart’s care and to help other animals in need!		1

Since this event is likely to be the springboard for an all-new product line, it's probably going to crowd out most other announcements, which makes this list shorter than it normally is. That said, the timing is right for a handful of other announcements—here's what we think will share the stage on Monday.Apple WatchEnlarge / Don't be sad, Apple Watch! It's almost your ""time"" to shine.Megan GeussNot quite hands-on with the Apple Watch, and the questions it doesn’t answerThis is a gimme. The Apple Watch has already been announced, so we know what it looks like and some basic things about how it works. We know it's scheduled to launch in April, and we have some basic information about what it does. We know it requires an iPhone 5 or better and that it will support Apple Pay even when tethered to older phones. We know the price starts at $349, probably for the aluminum Apple Watch Sport model with a basic band.What we're likely to get on Monday is an actual launch date, more specific pricing information for all three versions of the product and their bands, and some kind of showcase of third-party apps. At iPhone and iPad launches, Apple usually has at least one or two devs come on stage to walk the audience through a demo that shows what the new hardware is capable of. iOS still enjoys the widest and deepest third-party support of any mobile platform, so we'd expect third-party support to be a major selling point for the Apple Watch as well.We don’t know whether the Apple Watch will succeed or not—nobody knows, no matter how many op-eds have already called it one way or the other . In either case, its launch signifies the start of something new for Apple.MacsEnlarge / The 2013 MacBook Air is a year-and-a-half old, mid-cycle processor bump notwithstanding. That's an eternity in computer years.Andrew CunninghamSame wrapper, all-new candy center: The 2013 MacBook Air reviewedMacs aren't the targets of leaks to the extent that iDevices are, so this one is not as sure a bet as the Apple Watch. That said, most of Apple's Mac lineup hasn't been refreshed in well over a year ( blame Intel ). Among those products, there are three for which new Intel processors now exist: the MacBook Air ( Broadwell U or perhaps Core M ), the 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro (Broadwell U again), and the Mac Pro ( Haswell-EP and refreshed workstation GPUs from AMD ). Higher-wattage quad-core parts suitable for the 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro and most iMacs aren't due until midyear .Of those three, the MacBook Air is the only thing we've really heard many rumors about. Earlier this week, we saw convincing screenshots that suggested the current 11- and 13-inch MacBook Airs would be refreshed with Broadwell chips, but not with new designs. Another rumor proposes something totally different— a 12-inch version of the computer that streamlines the chassis and does away with nearly all ports. One USB Type-C port would handle all wired connectivity, and using Intel's Core M rather than the more powerful Core i5 and i7 CPUs would allow it to run without a fan. It may or may not use a Retina-class display; reports are less clear on that one.Even if the latter product exists, we're not sure where it would slot into Apple's lineup. Is it a new product line entirely? Is it intended to be the future of the MacBook Air, leaving power users with the 13-inch MacBook Pro if they want more ports and more performance? We can't say for sure, but remember that Apple didn't replace non-Retina models immediately when it introduced the Retina MacBook Pros and the Retina iMac . There may be a transitional period.However the lineup shakes out, we think MacBook Air news is most likely, followed by everything else we just mentioned, followed by some kind of surprise like a 4K 21.5-inch iMac.iOSEnlarge / The Apple Watch needs an iOS update to work, so we'll probably get one.Andrew CunninghamNewest iOS 8.2 beta spills the beans on more Apple Watch featuresThe Apple Watch requires iOS 8.2, so iOS 8.2 is likely to drop on the day of the event or just after. It's been through five developer betas and a new beta hasn't been issued in a few weeks, which is usually a sign that release is imminent. If you don't care about the Apple Watch, this update probably won't amount to much more than a handful of bug fixes, but that's fine too.Apple is also expected to announce a public beta program for iOS at some point in March, beginning with iOS 8.3 and eventually extending to iOS 9.0 (don't expect word about the next major iOS version before WWDC this summer, though). Launching something like this really doesn't require stage time at a major product event , but we wouldn't be surprised to hear about it.We're not expecting anything in the way of major iOS hardware announcements. Rumors about a new 12-inch ""iPad Pro"" spring eternal, but the newest item from a reputable source says not to expect it before this fall (if we ever actually see it). The current iPads and iPhones are still in the middle of their typical release cycle. Most iOS news is going to be about the way iOS interacts with the Apple Watch.And the restThe Apple TV was last updated in March of 2013 , and there's plenty of new hardware that could speed it up. Apple doesn't seem to have the 4K fever that most other consumer electronics companies are suffering from right now, but it would be a logical next step (the current maximum resolution is 1080p).Most of the Apple TV rumors from the last year or so have revolved around something entirely new, though—not a faster version of the little $99 black box, but some kind of collaboration with content providers that would integrate Apple TV functionality into cable boxes (or maybe the other way around).iPods haven't been touched since 2012, either, but the iPod Touch is the only one that could use new hardware to get better at the stuff it does. Its A5 chip dates back to early 2011, after all. Don't hold your breath, but if Apple intends to drop support for Apple A5 devices in iOS 9, now is the time to start replacing them.And that's the rundown! The Apple Watch is the only sure thing, but Apple usually uses events like these to refresh a few things at once. Whatever happens, we'll be on the ground in San Francisco to liveblog the speech, and we'll go hands-on with anything we can get our mitts on afterward.Listing image by AppleLatest Ars Video >First Look: Xbox Adaptive ControllerArs Technica's Sam Machkovech visits Microsoft for a first-hand look at the company's new controller that focuses on accessibility.First Look: Xbox Adaptive ControllerFirst Look: Xbox Adaptive ControllerArs Technica's Sam Machkovech visits Microsoft for a first-hand look at the company's new controller that focuses on accessibility.Andrew Cunningham Andrew has a B.A. in Classics from Kenyon College and has over five years of experience in IT.

https://www.emergent.info/bosnian-girls-pregnant-school-trip	Claim: Seven underage Bosnian girls got pregnant on a school trip	unverified	['Bosnia', 'Pregnancy']	https://inserbia.info/	https://inserbia.info/today/2014/12/bih-seven-primary-school-students-pregnant-after-five-day-excursion/	2014/12/23	BANJA LUKA – Primary school students from a small town in Bosnia and Herzegovina went to a five-day excursion, and after some time it turned out that seven schoolgirls got pregnant on it.Illustration National Coordinator for Reproductive Health of the Republika Srpska Nenad Babici said that children engage in sexual relations as early as at age of 13 or 14 and added that primary school students from a small town in Bosnia and Herzegovina went to a five-day trip, and after some time it turned out that seven schoolgirls got pregnant on it.He said that the reason for this was neglect of parents, but also educational institutions, toward the education of children.Babic said that early engagement in sexual relations later leads to a series of consequences such as infertility, various diseases, miscarriages and premature births.“In the Republika Srpska between 15 to 18 percent of people are struggling with infertility, we have 15 percent of miscarriages and between 5 to 10 percent premature births,” he said.Only last year, according to the Clinical Center of the University in Sarajevo, 31 minors gave birth, four of them are 15 years old, ten are 16 years old and 17 are 17 years old.The problem of adolescent in Bosnia and Herzegovina is becoming more prominent, but information on the increasing number of sexually active girls aged between 13 and 15 years of age is also shocking.Thus, on a website where girls seek advice from experts, gynecologists, peers, one of them wrote:”I would have sex with my boyfriend, even though I’m only 14… But I am afraid I’ll be judged.”The page also contains information according to which boys engage in sexual relations at age of 11, writes “Dnevni Avaz”.Sarajevo gynecologist Senad Mehmedbasic says that it is terrible that girls aged 13 or 16 engage in sexual relations, but adds that this is something that, unfortunately, is in the trend.He warns that in these cases both pregnancy and child birth are highly risky. “It is obvious that children do not have enough of health education so they engage in such activities, not knowing the consequences. We have to be more direct in the educational system, it must not be allowed that street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life,” he said.		1
https://www.emergent.info/priest-says-god-is-female	Claim: A Catholic priest who was declared clinically dead says he met God and she's a woman	false	['Catholic Church', 'Fake News', 'Hoaxes', 'World News Daily Report']	https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/	https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/catholic-priest-who-died-for-48-minutes-claims-that-god-is-a-woman/	2015/02/22	TweetBoston | A Catholic priest from Massachusetts was officially dead for more than 48 minutes before medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart. During that time, Father John Micheal O’Neal claims he went to heaven and met God, which he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure.The 71-year old cleric was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival.With the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, that kept the blood flowing to his brain, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm.The doctors were afraid he would have suffered some brain damage from the incident, but he woke up less than 48 hours later and seems to have perfectly recovered.Doctors at the Massachusetts General Hospital say that Father O’Neal is extremely lucky to be alive, while he is convinced that it is God who sent him back to tell the world who “she” really is.The elderly man claims that he has clear and vivid memories of what happened to him while he was dead.He describes a strange out-of-body experience, experiencing an intense feeling of unconditional love and acceptance, as well as being surrounded by an overwhelming light.He claims that at that point in his experience, he went to heaven and encountered God, which he describes as a feminine, mother-like “Being of Light”.“Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting” states the Catholic priest. “She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother’s embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn’t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!”The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the Catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days, causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.The Archbishop of Boston, Cardinal Sean P. O’Malley, made a public statement this morning stating that Father O’neal suffered hallucinations linked to a near-death experience and that God clearly isn’t a female.Despite the disapproval of his superiors, Father O’Neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the “Holy Mother”.“I wish to continue preaching” says the elderly cleric. “I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman…”The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston has not confirmed, however, if they will allow Father O’Neal to resume his preaching in his former parish in South Boston.		1

UPDATE: Police confirm the man in question did indeed turn up at the local station.Posted onConstantine let police know he'll be coming in ""Monday morn,"" but the RNC police politely reminded him that their facilities are open 24/7.What proceeded was a weird and hilarious correspondence between police and Constantine in the comment section.Copy LinkAdvertisementThe RNC police told BuzzFeed News that they believe this is their guy, but he has yet to physically turn himself in.Pin""It's hard to say if the person we found is the person, but it certainly seems that way,"" Media Relations Officer Steve Curnew told BuzzFeed News.Curnew also explained that they only turn to their social media outlets as a ""last resort"" if they can't locate them by addresses on file.

https://www.emergent.info/argentina-president-adopts-boy-werewolf	Claim: The president of Argentina became the adopted godmother of a boy to help stop him from becoming a werewolf	false	['Argentina', 'Christina Fernández de Kirchner', 'Werewolf']	https://www.jta.org/	https://www.jta.org/2014/12/25/news-opinion/world/argentinas-president-adopts-jewish-godson	2014/12/29	Argentina’s president adopts Jewish godson under law to counteract werewolf legendDecember 25, 2014 12:17pmArgentine President Christina Fernandez lighting Hanukkah candles with the family of Shlomo and Nechama Tawil, whose son became the first Jewish boy adopted under a law intended to counteract an old Argentine legend.BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (JTA) — Argentina’s president adopted a Jewish godson under a law intended to counteract an old legend about werewolves.President Christina Fernandez described in seven tweets her meeting with her new godson, Yair Tawil, a member of a Chabad-Lubavitch family.The adoption practice derives from an old custom by which the president adopts the seventh son born after six boys with no girls in between to prevent him from becoming a werewolf. Belief in the legend was once so widespread that families were abandoning, giving up for adoption and even killing their own sons.The custom became a law in the 1970s and provided the boys with presidential protection, a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until their 21st birthday. Until 2009, the law only applied to Catholic boys.Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, in 1993 wrote a letter to the president asking for the honor and were denied. But this year, Yair wrote a letter to the president citing the 2009 decree and asking for the designation of godson.On Tuesday, he became the first Jewish godson of a president in Argentina’s history. Fernandez received Yair, his parents and three of his brothers in her office, where they lit Hanukkah candles together.The president in her tweets and photos described to her 3.4 million Twitter followers a “magical moment” with a “marvelous family.” She described Yair as “a total sweety,” and his mother a “Queen Esther.”She tweeted that the Tawils “are a very special family. They have a sort of peace, happiness and a lot of love that is not common.” The tweet included a link to the presidential blog, which includes more photos from the meeting.CORRECTION: The original brief stated incorrectly that Shlomo Tawil was the director of the Chabad House in Rosario, located in central Argentina. The sentence has been deleted. The original brief also stated incorrectly that the original law was adopted in the 1920s. It was actually adopted in the 1970s.

It’s being presented as Trump trying to interfere in an investigation, something Barack Obama actually did with the acquiescence of James Comey to clear Hillary Clinton! Obama actually did what Trump is being alleged to have done. You know this phrase, “I hope you can see your way to letting this go…”? Do you know who often uses a phrase like that? Psychiatrists, to people, patients who are obsessive-compulsives. “I hope you can let this go.” I hope you’re gonna be able to… ‘Cause whatever…I mean, they’re trying to say that Trump was trying to shut down the investigation. How did that work? I think every investigation under the sun is still going on, isn’t it? With no evidence! Trump’s really horrible. If his idea was to shut down investigation of Flynn or of the Russia collusion, they’re both still ongoing, and there’s nothing that has stopped them. And even the FBI’s second in command says that no effort has been made to stop the investigation. That’s the whole premise that the media is relying on with the Comey memo. Yeah.Well, Comey, apparently, is a big believer in self-protection, and every time he had a meeting with a principal, he would go back and memorialize the meeting in a form of a memo to himself. “Dear Self: The president today told me he hopes I can let go of the investigation into Michael Flynn,” and he did this to protect himself. But then how come nobody knew about this until the New York Times told us about it? How come the investigators in the Senate have not been told about this memo by Comey? How come Comey has not spoken up about it himself?If Trump was trying to subvert an investigation and shut it down, shouldn’t the FBI director have said something that very next day? Shouldn’t Comey have gone public (as only he could do) with a massive press conference and resign in great fervor over the idea that this pig had attempted to violate the Constitution and stop his investigation? Why did we not know about this until the New York Times lets it loose? There are countless questions here, my friends, that have answers that blow up pretty much every premise the media is attempting to get you to believe. Some of it’s problematic.Do not misunderstand. I’m not sitting here in abject denial. Some of this is problematic. On the Flynn business, Trump should have known. You know, let them do whatever he wants to do and pardon Flynn later. He doesn’t have to stop the investigation. Pardon him if it happens. Who knows what. I think the truth is I don’t think Trump wanted to let Flynn go. I think he loved Flynn. I think Flynn was loyal. I think he trusted Flynn, and I think the pressure got to him to let Flynn go, and something bothered him.I’m wild guessing ’cause I do not have any inside context on any of this. (interruption) No, no. Obama actually… Well, here’s what they’re trying to accuse Trump of doing. This is the bottom line. What they want to do, ladies and gentlemen… Let me take a break. If I get started on this I’m gonna go way, way long so let me take a break and we’ll come back and I’ll tell you what this whole thing ultimately is about. And it is something that Obama actually did with Comey, to get an investigation of Hillary Clinton stopped — and she was cleared.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: All right, here’s (among many things) what’s going on. Here’s what Trump is alleged to have done here vis-a-vis the Comey memo. Comey memo says that Trump asked him to let it go. Let the Flynn investigation go. I can hope you see your way to let this go. He didn’t do anything. The guy… I love the guy, honest guy. Comey said, “Yeah, I can tell you honest guy, good guy.” And what Trump is alleged to have done is actually no different than what Barack Obama did in April last year when he made it known that he didn’t want Hillary prosecuted.In fact, the Obama situation is actually worse. While Trump indicated he didn’t want Flynn charged, he did not order the case dropped, because it’s still going on. Trump indicated that he wanted Flynn not to be charged, but he did not order the case to be dropped. And the case continues. Grand juries have been impaneled now. In contrast, the FBI and the Department of Justice dropped the Hillary investigation just as Obama wanted them to, and they used exactly the rationales Obama used when he made his public statements.Well, Obama, was saying there was no intent to harm the U.S., the degree of classified emails that Mrs. Clinton was trafficking in is very exaggerated. Obama went public with all this! He went public with his own exoneration and thought that the investigation should be brought to a screeching halt. And it was! Comey got together and they stopped the investigation, and that allowed them and Hillary — for the rest of the campaign — to say she had been cleared. That’s why they got so mad at Comey when he did the July 5th press conference, because back in April, Obama thought he’d taken care of this.The July 5th press conference was essentially to announce that there wasn’t going to be a prosecution of Hillary because there wasn’t any intent. This is what Obama had set up with public statements the previous April, and I know you don’t remember the media being jacked up about this. I know you don’t remember any anonymous sources leaking information to the media that looked bad for Hillary and Obama. You just greeted this with, “It’s the usual Democrat-media corruption.” And they’re saying that this is what Trump was trying to sneak through here. He was trying to get Flynn to be cleared so that he could run around and say, “Flynn didn’t do anything. See? I’m clear!”BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Here’s what the allegation is gonna be, if it hasn’t already appeared the Drive-By Media. The allegation is gonna be that what Trump wanted to do was to have the FBI clear Michael Flynn, and then use the FBI’s clearing him to argue that a thorough investigation had proved nothing bad happened here. All right? Now, why did they think that’s what Trump would do? They’re gonna say that Trump’s plan was to rig the investigation and then exploit the fact that there had been one. By exploiting it, I mean, “Hey, look, man! Look at this detailed investigation! It happened, and my buddy Flynn’s clear.”The Democrats would know exactly how to do it because that’s exactly what Obama did with Hillary. If you’re scratching your heads about this, maybe you remember in April of 2016, when everybody was wondering, “Is Hillary gonna be indicted?” Remember there was a drip, drip, drip? Every day there seemed to be more news about Hillary’s illegal server and classified documents flying around, and every day people speculated who was behind this, and everybody concluded that Obama was. And remember the debates, the questions?“Is Obama trying to take her out? Is Obama trying to destroy her? Is it Obama does not want her to be president, doesn’t trust her with this?” Remember all of this stuff? And on the other side of it people were saying, “Maybe Obama’s trying to inoculate her. Maybe Obama’s trying to just dribble this stuff out so that it doesn’t end up hurting her — a little bit here, a little bit there.” But the conventional wisdom was that if he was doing anything, he was trying to hurt her, because it just prolonged everything.I offer those simply as reference points. You might remember those things being discussed at the time. This is April of 2016. And that’s why the Democrats would know how to accuse Trump. There’s no evidence this is what Trump was trying to do. There’s no evidence for anything here. We have allegations. We have a memo that may or may not exist. We have a memo that may exist without any context. We don’t have anybody that can tell you what crime Donald Trump has committed yet to this day.But Obama actually did, with Hillary Clinton, exactly what they are accusing Trump of trying to do through Comey at that dinner (where Comey only got one scoop of ice cream) to protect Flynn. If you think back to April 2016, there was no way they were ever gonna have Hillary Clinton indicted. Obama ran the DOJ, and he was running Loretta Lynch, and Obama was running Comey, and there was no way Hillary was ever gonna be indicted. You know it and I know it. But they used the fact that the FBI had ostensibly done a thorough investigation in order to clear her.That was the purpose of the drip, drip, drip. The purpose — in retrospect — of the drip, drip, drip was to get all the evidence out there and then claim that it had been investigated, and then Comey magically appears on July 5th to list all this stuff that everybody knew. There was some of it that we didn’t know, but he gets it all out there; then says, “No reasonable prosecutor would proceed,” and, bam! She’s cleared! The difference between Obama and Trump is very simple. Obama’s pressure on the FBI to wipe the Hillary investigation off the map appears to have worked.Regardless of what Trump may have said to Comey, the investigation of Flynn continues. The investigation of the collusion of the Trump campaign in Russia continues. So where is the obstruction? They’re whispering impeachment, obstruction of justice, violation of this and that. Where is it? The investigations are ongoing elsewhere. The House Democrats announced a new one today! Pencil Neck went out there, Adam Schiff, and said, “You know, we’re not gonna wait for a special counsel. We’re gonna do a special commission here in the House!”So they’ve launched another investigation. Investigations aren’t being shut down. Some people, as I was saying, don’t want to sit around and wait for impeachment. They want whatever is gonna happen here to happen before the 2018 midterms. So there are people suggesting — and one of them is Ross Douthat of the New York Times, quote-unquote, “conservative columnist” there. His suggestion — and many have now echoed it — is (paraphrased), “Well, use the 25th Amendment! That’s how we get rid of Trump. “We don’t have to worry about whether Republicans will join us now.“ Just use the 25th Amendment .” What’s the 25th Amendment say? The 25th Amendment says that the cabinet, the president’s cabinet can certify the president’s insane — mentally deranged, deluded, mentally unsound — and get rid of him on the basis that he’s not all there. On the golf course over this weekend and the whole subject of impeachment came up. I said, “I don’t necessarily think that although I wouldn’t be surprised. I wouldn’t be surprised with the way they’re all setting this up. They’re trying to claim, ‘Trump is unbalanced anyway! He never has been all there.'”So there are many areas here at which they’re aiming at Trump. Now, Andy McCarthy has written a column about this Obama precedent that I just talked about, and I want to give you a couple of paragraphs of this piece here just to batten this down because this is important. What they’re accusing Trump of doing has already happened, and it was Obama protecting Hillary and clearing her in the campaign year 2016.“April 10, 2016 — President Obama said Sunday that Hillary Clinton showed ‘carelessness’ by using a private email server, but he also strongly defended his former secretary of state, saying she did not endanger national security…” Again, intent is not an element of the criminal statute. It’s been totally made up by Comey. The statute does not require intent in order for it to be violated. Comey just made it up and attached it, and Obama used it before Comey did. On April 10, 2016, Obama said publicly Hillary had not intended to endanger national security.Of course not!She’s a great Democrat. She’s a secretary of state. She’s from the Clinton dynasty. There is no way Hillary Clinton would intend to endanger national security. “Come on, people,” Obama said (paraphrased), “Who are we talking about here? Are we serious? Mrs. Clinton, Huma Abedin would want to purposely damage national security?” That’s the route they took. Obama suggested that in the greater scheme of things the importance of what Hillary had done here had been way, way overestimated; way, way too amplified.She wasn’t trying to traffic in national security! She wasn’t trying to endanger the United States of America. She wasn’t doing half the stuff she’s been alleged to do. He said all this publicly — and next thing we knew, July 5th, Comey publicly stated (in almost exact words that Obama had used back in April) that Clinton had been “extremely careless.” Obama said she had “shown carelessness.” Comey said Hillary had been “extremely careless” in using a private email server to handle classified information.But Comey insisted that she had not intended to endanger national security — which, again, is not an element of the statute. So you see the pattern? Obama goes public. (paraphrased) “Hey! She didn’t intend anything here. She was just… She showed carelessness.” July, Comey: Hillary was “extremely careless,” but she didn’t “intend” to endanger national security. “Comey acknowledged that classified information had been transmitted via her server, but he suggested that in the greater scheme of things, it was just a small percentage of the emails involved.” Just like Obama said, “It’s been so overstated.”So if anybody’s been working together here to clear a perp, it is James Comey and Barack Obama in April and through July of 2016 — and since that is what happened, the Democrats and the media are now projecting on Donald Trump that which they did. And they are accusing him of wanting to do what they did and claiming that Trump’s desire and effort to try to do this constitutes obstruction of justice and is thus an impeachable offense.And yet at this very moment, nobody can detail for any of us a single crime Trump has committed, other than winning an election that he was supposed to lose in a landslide, unseating the popular (snorts) Hillary Clinton, whose turn it was — and who openly, in his inaugural address, threatened the Washington establishment and told them their days were over. There’s no mystery why we are here today. It’s been one of the easiest thing to predict.And I have to tell you, I’ve been saying all week that one of the major things about this that troubles me is that either Trump or his people didn’t even understand the scope of what they had done and what they were doing in terms of being able to accurately predict the establishment’s reaction. They were just not gonna roll over. These are not the people that accept the results of an election. They just don’t. And this is not the first time in our history that they have acted this way. Florida 2000. They just don’t accept the results of elections when they lose them.So, anyway, July 5th, the case against Hillary is dismissed. Could there be a more striking set of parallels, asks Andy McCarthy? “A cynic might say that Obama had clearly signaled to the FBI and the Justice Department that he did not want Mrs. Clinton to be charged with a crime, and that, with this not-so-subtle pressure in the air, the president’s subordinates dropped the case — exactly what Obama wanted, relying precisely on Obama’s stated rationale.”And the media could not have cared less about actual obstruction, about actual interference. And of course they couldn’t have cared less, because this is the outcome they wanted. Mrs. Clinton cleared, free as a bird, as the nominee of the Democrat Party.Related Links		1

Robin Vos, Speaker of the Wisconsin State AssemblySpeaker Vos,Wisconsins legislature suffers from a serious deficit of democracy. Thanks to restrictive and anti-competitive ballot laws, almost half of Representatives (47 out of 99) were the only name on the ballot in the November 2014 general election. Thats half of voters who got no debate, no discussion, no choice- no real election at all. A similarly large number of races were uncontested in the August primary. In the 12th Assembly District, I was one of many who had no choice in either the primary or the general election.This is compared to just 9 out of 134 Representatives who ran unopposed in Minnesota. In Michigan all 110 State Representative elections were contested by both major parties. It is hard to believe that people in Wisconsin are that much more disinterested in deciding who their legislators are.Voters are, in fact, viscerally disgusted when they go to the polls only to find that their time has been wasted with slates of unopposed candidates. So why do our State Assembly elections look more like the selection of a Soviet Politburo or House of Lords than a freely-elected American state legislature?The problem is simple. For all offices in Wisconsin, the number of signatures required for nomination petitions is too high. These levels are set such that incumbents and candidates with party backing can meet them with ease, but upstart challengers are often scared off from even attempting it. This is often couched in terms of serious candidates only a decision that is surely for voters to make.This policy harms voters by denying them a debate and a choice, but it also wastes taxpayer resources as the Government Accountability Board scrambles to scrutinize tens of thousands of signatures by statutory deadlines. This process, where candidates are invited to try to kick each other off the ballot based on technicalities, serves no legitimate public interest. The argument against an overcrowded ballot strains credulity in the face of severely under-crowded ballots.A simple and obvious measure which could be taken to help fix this problem, before the 2016 election, would be to reduce the number of signatures required on nomination petitions by half, across the board. This would bring Wisconsin in line with the norm in neighboring states, and greatly reduce the number of uncontested elections. Such a modest reform would also not require any other substantive changes to the structure of Wisconsins election laws.All voters should demand free, open, fair, and competitive elections, where all ideas can be heard and considered as part of our civic discourse. Citizens who wish to engage in the democratic process as candidates, should not face unreasonable barriers to entry. Any legislator who ran unopposed in 2014 should be challenged to support this necessary change, as should all Representatives who value the integrity and legitimacy of Wisconsins elections. I urge you to give this proposal serious consideration, before Wisconsin has a State Assembly where an outright majority of Representatives were not meaningfully elected at all.Andy CraigSecretary, Libertarian Party of WisconsinMidwest Regional Director, Our America InitiativeLead Coordinator, Competitive Elections WisconsinWe support election systems that are more representative of the electorate at the federal, state and local levels. ...

New faces should be recruited from unrelated industries — from companies widely respected for excellence in marketing, innovation, creativity and labor relations. The new management must work with labor leaders to see that the enmity between labor and management comes to an end. This division is a holdover from the early years of the last century, when unions brought workers job security and better wages and benefits. You don’t have to look far for industries with unions that went down that road. Companies in the 21st century cannot perpetuate the destructive labor relations of the 20th. This will mean a new direction for the U.A.W., profit sharing or stock grants to all employees and a change in Big Three management culture. The need for collaboration will mean accepting sanity in salaries and perks. At American Motors, my dad cut his pay and that of his executive team, he bought stock in the company, and he went out to factories to talk to workers directly. Get rid of the planes, the executive dining rooms — all the symbols that breed resentment among the hundreds of thousands who will also be sacrificing to keep the companies afloat. Investments must be made for the future. No more focus on quarterly earnings or the kind of short-term stock appreciation that means quick riches for executives with options. Manage with an eye on cash flow, balance sheets and long-term appreciation. Invest in truly competitive products and innovative technologies — especially fuel-saving designs — that may not arrive for years. Starving research and development is like eating the seed corn.

When sales are down, you don’t want to lose the only people who can get them to grow. So don’t fire the best dealers, and don’t crush them with new financial or performance demands they can’t meet. It is not wrong to ask for government help, but the automakers should come up with a win-win proposition. I believe the federal government should invest substantially more in basic research — on new energy sources, fuel-economy technology, materials science and the like — that will ultimately benefit the automotive industry, along with many others. I believe Washington should raise energy research spending to $20 billion a year, from the $4 billion that is spent today. The research could be done at universities, at research labs and even through public-private collaboration. The federal government should also rectify the imbedded tax penalties that favor foreign carmakers. But don’t ask Washington to give shareholders and bondholders a free pass — they bet on management and they lost. The American auto industry is vital to our national interest as an employer and as a hub for manufacturing. A managed bankruptcy may be the only path to the fundamental restructuring the industry needs. It would permit the companies to shed excess labor, pension and real estate costs. The federal government should provide guarantees for post-bankruptcy financing and assure car buyers that their warranties are not at risk. In a managed bankruptcy, the federal government would propel newly competitive and viable automakers, rather than seal their fate with a bailout check.

After it appeared the two-year moratorium on the sale, delivery and transfer of AR-15-style rifles had passed by a voice vote, minutes later, that motion was reconsidered, and ultimately reversed by a roll call vote, with 17 votes in favor of the amendment and 21 against it. But for 15 minutes, as one Democratic aide pointed out, Florida looked like it just might have an AR-15 ban. Democrats had introduced the two-year ban as an amendment to a broader GOP-led bill on gun reforms. The GOP bill imposes safeguards to keep guns out of the hands of mentally ill individuals who might harm themselves or others, and strengthen background checks at the point of sale, among other things. Students and others in Florida have called for stricter gun control measures, in the wake of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting that left 17 dead last month. That battle over tougher gun measures is waging on in Capitol Hill, too, as Congress struggles to determine what it is the president wants. President Trump has said he wants stronger background checks, gun access restriction for the mentally ill and the ability to arm teachers. Mr. Trump also expressed an interest in raising the minimum age for purchasing some firearms to 21, saying Republicans are opposed to considering such a measure because they are ""petrified of the NRA."" But the day after Mr. Trump expressed an openness to gun restrictions in a bipartisan meeting with lawmakers, the president met with the NRA. NRA executive director Chris Cox tweeted Thursday night following that meeting that Mr. Trump will not pursue gun control. Florida's senators don't see eye to eye on gun control measures either. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican, has pushed a bill to enhance criminal background checks, a bill requiring the FBI to tell states when someone fails a background check, a program for intervening when children are potential threats, and some form of temporary gun-violence restraining order. Sen. Bill Nelson, a Democrat, has pushed for a ban on assault-style rifles. On Saturday, lawmakers spent nearly eight hours debating dozens of amendments to the 100-page bill to strengthen school safety procedures and restrict gun purchases. They eventually approved the legislation for a final vote on Monday. It was clear that senators were divided on the bill, and not just on party lines. While crafted by Republicans, some GOP senators still opposed it because they don't agree with raising the minimum age to purchase a rifle -- from 18 to 21 -- or requiring a waiting period to buy the weapons. Democrats believe the legislation doesn't go far enough in some ways and too far in others. And while some oppose the bill, others believe it's at least a first step toward gun safety. The bill includes provisions to boost school security, establish new mental health programs in schools, and improve communication between schools, law enforcement and state agencies. But much of the debate Saturday revolved around gun control and whether people should have a right to own an assault rifle. ""Every constitutional right that we hold dear has a limitation,"" said Democratic Sen. Gary Farmer. ""These are just military-style killing machines and the right of self-defense and the ability to hunt will go on."" Republicans argued that banning such weapons would violate the Second Amendment right to bear arms. ""Our founding fathers weren't talking about hunting, and they weren't talking about protecting themselves from the thief down the street who might break in,"" said Republican Sen. David Simmons. Simmons said people need guns to protect themselves from a tyrannical government. ""Adolf Hitler confiscated all the weapons -- took all the weapons, had a registry of everybody -- and then on the night of June 30th, 1934, sent out his secret police and murdered all of his political opponents,"" Simmons said. ""You think it doesn't happen in a free society? It does."" The Legislature wraps up its annual session on Friday. Lawmakers are scrambling to take some kind of action before then. The full House has yet to take up its version of the bill. Republican Gov. Rick Scott has been lobbying lawmakers to pass his plan to assign at least one law-enforcement officer for every 1,000 students at a school. Scott is opposed to arming teachers."		1

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/may/17/true-american/ohio-opioid-crisis-real-headline-misleading/	"""BREAKING: 60 people just found dead in Ohio"""	false	['Drugs', 'Fake news']	http://24trueinfoamerica.com/	http://24trueinfoamerica.com/breaking-60-people-just-found-dead-in-ohio	2018/05/17	May 13, 2018 Chill USA News 0The death toll in one Ohio town continues to rise as 60 people were just found dead overnight and emergency crews can’t keep up with the calls that continue to pour in. President Trump had warned of what was coming to prevent these deaths and now it’s time to take urgent action as he’s announced in a shocking message to Americans.With all the focus recently being on Chicago and the immense amount of shooting deaths there are in that war zone every day, a bigger issue has presented itself just a couple states away in Ohio. The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner has confirmed that 60 people died in February from the same alarming cause, which brings the total deaths from this to 109 this year for just this one small part of Ohio. However, the issue is widespread across the country and only getting worse, which is why Donald Trump wants to do something about it now.Fatal drug overdoses now surpass car deaths in America thanks to the increased use, availability, and abuse of heroin, fentanyl or a combination of the two that come into the country from wide open borders and unchecked immigrants. With each month comes a new record number of deaths from this drug not just in Ohio, but nationwide.“February’s number could increase because seven cases are still awaiting further toxicology testing. Of the fatalities last month, 36 were Cleveland residents,” Fox 8 reported. Trump is well aware of the opioid epidemic that claimed 52,000 lives in 2015, which was the most amount of overdoses in a single year in U.S. History. This is part of the reason he’s wanting to crack down so hard on the border.During his joint address to Congress on Tuesday, the President said that he will build “a great, great wall along our southern border” — in part to dramatically slow the flow of narcotics pouring into the U.S. at an “unprecedented rate.” “Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop,” Trump promised in his speech, Vox reported. Although a wall won’t stop it completely, he’s the first to address the epidemic that’s gotten worse while it was ignored the last eight years.While Trump was criticized for his comment that the wall would stop the flow of drugs, it’s a step in the right direction and he’s at least ready to do something about it, whereas his predecessor was not. America does not need more of what comes in illegally over the border, whether it’s people, drugs, or both.Join America’s Patriots Media And Share This Article Now!Source: http://www.independent-reports.com		1

Before the rally, she attended a Q&A session with members of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro,...WASHINGTON - Hillary Clinton may be unstoppable in her quest for the Democratic nomination, but Latinos remain up for grabs in remaining contests and Julián Castro is working to persuade them on Clinton’s behalf.Express NewslettersBallet San Antonio dancer faces sexual assault chargesPrint subscribers get a password for your existing account hereOn the eve of the Univision-Washington Post Democratic debate in Miami Wednesday night, Castro, secretary of Housing and Urban Development, offered a scorching assessment of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' record on immigration.“Bernie Sanders voted with Republicans to protect the minutemen, a hate group that used military tactics against our community. Thousands of families have been torn apart due to destructive behavior by Republicans and we cannot have a president who stands by their side,” Castro said Tuesday in a statement put out by the Clinton campaign.Castro, mentioned often as a potential Clinton running mate on the 2016 Democratic ticket, also is expected to travel on Clinton's behalf this week. He campaigned for her in several states previously.The strength of the former San Antonio mayor's statement Tuesday may be a reflection of the Clinton campaign’s frustration over failing to corral Latinos, a voting bloc she is counting on not only in primary contests but also in November if she secures the nomination.In Texas, the Latino vote closely matched her 2-1 victory on March 1. Elsewhere, Sanders’ message on economic issues has appealed to many Latinos.In Colorado’s Democratic caucuses on March 1, Sanders relied heavily on Latinos in easily defeating Clinton. In Nevada, like Colorado a battleground state in November, Sanders won Latinos by 8 percent in Feb. 20 caucuses despite losing overall to the former secretary of state.The Latino vote could be a factor in primaries in Florida and Illinois on March 15 and in Arizona on March 22.In a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, Sanders' strategists contended they are seeing Latinos drawn to the Vermont senator’s call for a $15 hourly minimum wage, single-payer health insurance system and other issues to the left of Clinton.“Our campaign has learned that Latinos are sick and tired of establishment politics because of the countries we come from,” said Arturo Carmona, Sanders’ deputy political director.Earlier in the campaign, Sanders brushed aside assertions like Castro’s that he voted with Republicans catering to the Minutemen, a private militia that spurred controversy in border areas.The issue dates back to Sanders’ days in the U.S. House, when Minutemen claimed that U.S. officials were tipping off the Mexican government about their whereabouts. They won an amendment prohibiting Homeland Security officials from supplying a foreign government with information on activities of civilian groups operating in Texas, California, New Mexico or Arizona.Sanders campaign spokeswoman Erika Andiola said Democrats who joined with Republicans to pass the amendment were told by Customs and Border Patrol that it would have no effect.“The senator did not protect the minutemen,” she said by email. “He does not think private militias are the way to police or protect borders.”bill.lambrecht@hearstdc.com		1

EDTTHE PRESIDENT: This crowd looks fired up. (Applause.) Already, everybody have a seat. Have a seat. You look like you’ve been busy. AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yes!AUDIENCE MEMBER: We’re just waiting on you. THE PRESIDENT: I know that’s right. (Applause.) I know that’s right. (Laughter.) Good afternoon, everybody. Have a seat, have a seat. AUDIENCE MEMBER: I love you, Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT: I love you back. (Applause.) I do. Well, welcome to the White House Summit on Working Families. (Applause.) And thanks to all of you for joining us. I know that for most of you, you are taking time off of work or family, or both, to be here. And I know that’s a sacrifice. And I know just juggling schedules can be tough. And in fact, that’s one of the reasons that we are here today. I want to thank our co-hosts, Secretary of Labor Tom Perez -- give him a big round of applause -- as well as Neera Tanden and everyone at the Center for American Progress for the great work that they did. (Applause.) Thanks as well to all the members of Congress who are participating, especially Nancy Pelosi and the members of the Democratic Women’s Working Group. (Applause.) And a long-time friend and champion of families and women and veterans, Connie Milstein -- we could not have pulled this off without Connie’s great assistance, so we want to thank Connie. (Applause.) So I just walked over to Chipotle for lunch. (Laughter.) I caused a lot of havoc, as you might expect. (Laughter.) It had been a while since I had the burrito bowl, and it was good. (Laughter.) And I went there with four new buddies of mine. One of them is a father of a four year old and a two month old who has worked with his wife to come up with a flexible plan where he works three or four days a week. She works three or four days a week. And the reason is because, as Roger put it, he thinks it’s important that he is able to bond with this kids just as much as his wife is. Lisa you just heard from, who had twins who were prematurely born. And because her company was supportive, she was able to not just thrive and watch her kids grow up, but she’s also been able to be promoted and continue to succeed in her company without being on a slower track while maintaining that life-family balance, which is terrific -- worth applauding. Shirley Young from New York works at a nursing home, and she’s got older children. And she was most interested in talking about the fact that when her son -- it was discovered had curvature of the spine, that she had health care that she could count on. Otherwise, there was no way that she could deal with it. And her benefits on the job were good enough that she could use her vacation time when he had to go to the doctor.And then Shelby from Denver -- (applause) -- Shelby has got a little fan club here. Shelby talked about the fact that on her job it’s been a little more challenging. Her kids are older and she’s going back to school. And it is wonderful that she is actually now taking some classes with her children and they’re helping explain math to her. (Laughter.) On the other hand, she’s also got an aging parent. And when he had to go to the doctor, they don’t have a policy of paid family leave. And since it’s hard making ends meet in the first place, her dad had to end up getting on a bus for eye surgery and come back on his own, because she couldn’t afford to take the time off.Now, each of these folks come from different parts of the country. They have different occupations, different income levels. And yet, what bound all of us together was a recognition that work gives us a sense of place and dignity, as well as income. And it is critically important, but family is also the bedrock of our lives and we don’t want a society in which folks are having to make a choice between those two things. And there are better decisions that we can make and there are not-so-good decisions that we can make as a society to support this balance between work and family. Most of our days consist of work, family, and not much else. And those two spheres are constantly interacting with each other. When we’re with our family, sometimes we’re thinking about work, and when we’re at work, we’re thinking about family. That’s a pretty universal experience. It’s true when you are President of the United States. (Laughter.) Now, I am lucky that my daughters were a bit older by the time I became President, so I never had to meet a world leader with Cheerios stuck to my pants. (Laughter.) That has not happened. And I’m also lucky, because we live above the store, so to speak. (Laughter.) I have a very short commute. (Laughter.) And as a consequence, we’ve been able to organize ourselves to have dinner with Michelle and the girls almost every night. And that’s pretty much the first time we’ve been able to do that in our lives. (Applause.) But before I moved into the White House, I was away a lot sometimes with work, sometimes with campaigning. Michelle was working full-time and was at home with the responsibility all too often of dealing with everything that the girls needed. And so, I understand how lucky we are now, because there was a big chunk of time when we were doing what so many of you have to deal with every day, and that is figuring out how do we make this whole thing work.A lot of Americans are not as lucky as we have been. It is hard sometimes just to get by. Our businesses have created jobs for 51 consecutive months -- 9.4 [million] new jobs in all. (Applause.) But we all know somebody out there who is still looking for work. And there are a whole lot of people who are working harder than ever, but can’t seem to get ahead and pay all the bills at the end of the month. Despite the fact that our economy has grown and those of us at the very top have done very well, the average wage, the average income hasn’t gone up in 15 years in any meaningful way. And that means that relative to 15 years ago, a lot of families just aren’t that much better off. And the sacrifices they make for their families go beyond just missing family dinner.You look at something like workplace flexibility. This was so important to our family when I was away, because if Malia or Sasha got sick, or the babysitter did not show up, it was Michelle who got the call. And, fortunately, she had an employer who understood if she needed to leave work in the middle of the day or change her schedule suddenly. In fact, actually when she applied for the job, she brought Sasha, who was then about six months, in her car seat into the interview -- (applause) -- just to kind of explain this is what you will be dealing with if you hire me. (Laughter.) And so, they signed up for that. And that flexibility made all the difference to our families. But a lot of working moms and dads can’t do that. They don’t have the leverage. They’re not being recruited necessarily where they can dictate terms of employment. And as a consequence, if they need to bring their mom to the doctor or take an afternoon off to see their kid’s school play, it would mean them losing income that they can’t afford to lose. And even when working from home from time to time is doable, it’s often not an option -- even though studies show that flexibility makes workers happier and helps companies lower turnover and raise productivity.The same goes with paid family leave. A lot of jobs do not offer it. So when a new baby arrives or an aging parent gets sick, workers have to make painful decisions about whether they can afford to be there when their families need them the most. Many women can’t even get a paid day off to give birth. Now, that’s a pretty low bar. (Laughter.) You would think -- that we should be able to take care of. (Laughter and applause.)For many hourly workers, taking just a few days off can mean losing their job. And even though unpaid family leave is available, if you can’t pay the bills already the idea of taking a couple days off unpaid may mean you can’t make the mortgage payment or the rent payment at the end of the month. Or look at childcare. In most countries, it costs -- in most parts of the country, it costs thousands of dollars a year. In fact, in 31 states, decent childcare costs more than in-state college tuition -- in 31 states, in more than half the states. I recently got a letter from a woman in Minnesota whose kids’ preschool is so expensive, it costs more than her monthly mortgage payment. Now, she’s made a determination to make that sacrifice for her kids, but a lot of working families can’t make that sacrifice. And, by the way, there are other countries that know how to do childcare well. I mean, this isn’t rocket science. Or look at the minimum wage. Low-wage occupations disproportionately represented by women. Nearly 28 million Americans would benefit if we raised the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. (Applause.) And we’re not just talking about young people on their first job. The average worker who would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage is 35 years old. Many have kids, a majority are women. And right now, many full-time minimum wage workers are not making enough to keep their children out of poverty.So these are just a few of the challenges that working parents face. And every day, I hear from parents all across the country. They are doing everything right -- they are working hard, they are living responsibly, they are taking care of their children, they’re participating in their community -- and these letters can be heartbreaking, because at the end of the day it doesn’t feel like they’re getting ahead. And all too often, it feels like they’re slipping behind. And a lot of the time, they end up blaming themselves thinking, if I just work a little harder -- if I plan a little better, if I sleep a little bit less, if I stretch every dollar a little bit farther -- maybe I can do it. And that thought may have crossed the minds of some of the folks here from time to time.Part of the purpose of this summit is to make clear you’re not alone. Because here’s the thing: These problems are not typically the result of poor planning or too little diligence on the parts of moms or dads, and they cannot just be fixed by working harder or being an even better parent. (Applause.) All too often, they are the results of outdated policies and old ways of thinking. Family leave, childcare, workplace flexibility, a decent wage -- these are not frills, they are basic needs. They shouldn’t be bonuses. They should be part of our bottom line as a society. That’s what we’re striving for. (Applause.) Parents who work full-time should earn enough to pay the bills, and they should be able to head off to work every day knowing that their children are in good hands. Workers who give their all should know that if they need a little flexibility, they can have it -- because their employers understand that it’s hard to be productive if you’ve got a sick kid at home or a childcare crisis. Talented, hard-working people should be able to say yes to a promotion or a great new opportunity without worrying about the price that their family will pay. There was a new poll by Nielsen’s that found that nearly half of all working parents say they have turned down a job not because they didn’t want it, but because it would put too much of a burden on their families. When that many members of our workforce are forced to choose between a job and their family, something’s wrong. And here is a critical point: All too often, these issues are thought of as women’s issues, which I guess means you can kind of scoot them aside a little bit. At a time when women are nearly half of our workforce, among our most skilled workers, are the primary breadwinners in more families than ever before, anything that makes life harder for women makes life harder for families and makes life harder for children. (Applause.) When women succeed, America succeeds, so there’s no such thing as a women’s issue. (Applause.) There’s no such thing as a women’s issue. This is a family issue and an American issue -- these are commonsense issues. (Applause.) This is about you too, men. (Laughter.) Men care about having high-quality childcare. Dad’s rearrange their schedules to make it to teacher meetings and school plays, just like moms. Although somebody pointed out to me -- this is a useful insight -- that when dads say, yes, I’ve got to leave early to go to the parent-teacher conference, everybody in the office says, oh, isn’t that nice. (Laughter.) And then, when women do it, everybody is all like, is she really committed to the job? So there can be a double standard there. (Applause.) But sons help care for aging parents. A whole lot of fathers would love to be home for their new baby’s first weeks in the world. People ask me what do I love most about being President, and it’s true Air Force One is on the list. (Laughter.) The Truman Balcony has a really nice view. (Laughter.) But one of the -- I was telling folks the other day that one of the best perks about being President is anybody will hand you their baby -- here. (Laughter.) So I get this baby fix like two or three times a week. (Laughter.) But the reason it’s so powerful is because I remember taking the night shift when Malia was born and when Sasha was born, and being up at two in the morning changing diapers and burping them, and singing to them and reading them stories, and watching Sports Center once in a while, which I thought was good for their development. (Laughter.) It was. We want them to be well-rounded. (Laughter.) But the point is, I was lucky enough to be able to take some time off so that I was there for the 2:00 a.m. feeding and the soothing, and just getting to know them and making sure they knew me. And that bond is irreplaceable. And I want every father and every child to have that opportunity. But that requires a society that makes it easier for us to give folks that opportunity. (Applause.)So the bottom line is 21st-century families deserve 21st-century workplaces. (Applause.) And our economy demands them, because it’s going to help us compete. It’s going to help us lead. And that means paid family leave, especially paid parental leave. (Applause.) There is only one developed country in the world that does not offer paid maternity leave, and that is us. And that is not the list you want to be on by your lonesome. It’s time to change that, because all Americans should be able to afford to care for their families. (Applause.)It means high-quality early education. We know that the investment we make in those early years pays off over a child’s entire lifetime. And these programs give parents a great place to know that their kids are thriving while they’re at work. Other countries know how to do this. If France can figure this out, we can figure it out. (Laughter and applause.) All our kids need to benefit from that early enrichment.It means treating pregnant workers fairly, because too many are forced to choose between their health and their job. (Applause.) Right now, if you’re pregnant you could potentially get fired for taking too many bathroom breaks -- clearly from a boss who has never been pregnant -- or forced unpaid leave. That makes no sense. Congress should pass the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act without delay. (Applause.)Speaking of Congress, by the way -- (laughter) --AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Booo --THE PRESIDENT: No, don’t boo, vote. (Applause.) As long as Congress refuses to act on these policies, we’re going to need you to raise your voices. We need you to tell Congress don’t talk about how you support families, actually support families. Don’t talk the talk. We want you to walk the walk. In the meantime, if Congress will not act, we’re going to need mayors to act. We’ll need governors and state legislators to act. We need CEOs to act. And I will promise you, you will have a President who will take action to support working families. (Applause.) The good news is you don’t have to do it alone and I don’t have to do it alone. Now that’s part of the purpose of this summit is to recognize that there’s all kinds of exciting stuff going on around the country. We just have to make sure that we lift up conversations that are taking place at the kitchen table every single day. Some businesses are already taking the lead, knowing that family-friendly policies are good business practices. It’s how you keep talented employees. That’s how you build loyalty and inspire your workers to go the extra mile for your company. Some of those businesses are represented here today. So JetBlue, for example, has a flexible, work-from-home plan in place for its customer service representatives. They found it led to happier and more productive employees, and it lowered their costs, which translated into higher profits and lower ticket prices for their customers. It was good business. In 2007, Google realized that women were leaving the company at twice the rate that men left -- and one of the reasons was that the maternity leave policy wasn’t competitive enough. So they increased paid leave for new parents -- moms and dads -- to five months. And that helped to cut the rate of women leaving the company in half. Good business sense. Cisco estimates that by letting their employees telecommute, they save more than $275 million each year. They say it’s the main reason why they’re rated one of the best places to work in America. So it’s easy to see how policies like this make for better places to work. There’s also a larger economic case for it. The strength of our economy rests on whether we’re getting the most out of our nation’s talent, whether we’re making it possible for every citizen to contribute to our growth and prosperity. We do better when we field an entire team, not just part of a team. And the key to staying competitive in the global economy is your workforce, is your talent. Right now, too many folks are on the sidelines who have the desire and the capacity to work, but they’re held back by one obstacle or another. So it’s our job to remove those obstacles -- help working parents, improve job training, improve early childhood education, invest in better infrastructure so people are getting to work safely. Just about everything I do as President is to make sure that we’re not leaving any of our nation’s talent behind. That’s what this summit is all about. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Working families love you, Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you. (Applause.) So we’re seeing businesses set a good examples. We’ve got states who are setting a good example. California, Rhode Island, and New Jersey all gave workers paid family leave. Connecticut offers paid sick days and so does New York City. (Applause.) Since I asked Congress to raise the minimum wage last year -- they’ve been a little slow, shockingly, but 13 states have taken steps to raise it on their own. (Applause.) In my State of the Union address this year, I asked mayors and governors and CEOs -- do what you can to raise your workers’ wages, and a lot of them are. A lot of them are doing it. Because even if Republicans in Congress refuse to budge on this issue this year, everybody knows America deserves a raise, including Republican voters out there. There are a lot of them who support it. And I’ve said I will work with anybody -- Democrat or Republican -- to increase opportunities for American workers. And Nancy Pelosi is ready to work. (Applause.)Now, many of these issues, they’re not partisan until they get to Washington. Back home, to folks sitting around the kitchen table, this isn’t partisan. Nobody says, I don’t know, I’m not sure whether the Republican platform agrees with paid family leave. They’re thinking, I could really use a couple of paid days off to take care of dad, regardless of what their party affiliation is. So even as we’re waiting for Congress, whenever I can act on my own, I’m going to. That’s why we raised the minimum wage for employees of federal contractors. (Applause.) Nobody who cooks our troops’ meals or washes their dishes should have to live in poverty. That’s a disgrace. That’s why I ordered Tom Perez, our Secretary of Labor, to review overtime protections for millions of workers to make sure they’re getting the pay that they deserve. (Applause.) That’s why I signed an executive order preventing retaliation against federally contracted workers who share their salary information or raise issues of unequal compensation --because I think if you do the same work, you should get the same pay and you should be able to enforce it, which is why Congress should pass the Paycheck Fairness Act today for all workers and not just federally-contracted workers. (Applause.) And yes, that’s why I fought to pass the Affordable Care Act, to give every American access to high-quality affordable care no matter where they work. (Applause.) So far, over 8 million people have enrolled in plans through the ACA. Millions with preexisting conditions have been prevented or have been confident that their insurance companies have not been able to block them from getting health insurance. And by the way, women are no longer charged more for being women. They’re getting the basic care they need, including reproductive care. And millions are now free to take the best job for their families without worrying about losing their health care. Today, I’m going to sign a presidential memorandum directing every agency in the federal government to expand access to flexible work schedules, and giving employees the right to request those flexible work schedules. (Applause.) Because whether it’s the public sector or the private sector, if there’s a way to make our employees more productive and happier, every employer should want to find it. And to help parents trying to get ahead, I’m going to direct my Secretary of Labor, Tom Perez, to invest $25 million in helping people who want to enroll in jobs programs, but don’t currently have access to the childcare that they need to enroll in those job training programs. (Applause.) We’re going to make it easier for parents to get the training they need to get a good job. (Applause.) So we’re going to do everything we can to create more jobs and more opportunity for Americans. And then, let me just close by saying that I was interviewed in the run up to this on Friday. Somebody asked, well, it’s well-known that women are more likely to vote for Democrats -- to which I said, women are smarter. This is true. (Applause.) But they said, so isn’t this Working Families Summit political? And I said, no, I take this personally. I was raised by strong women who worked hard to support my sister and me. (Applause.) I saw what it was like for a single mom who was trying to go to school and work at the same time. And I remember her coming home and having to try to fix us dinner, and me saying, are we eating that again? (Laughter.) And she saying, you know what, buddy, I really don’t want to hear anything out of you right now, because I’ve got to go do some homework after this. And I remember times where my mom had to take some food stamps to make sure that we had enough nutritious food in the house, and I know what she went through. I know what my grandmother went through, working her way up from a secretary to the vice president of a bank. But she should have run the bank, except she hit a glass ceiling and was training people who would leapfrog ahead of her year after year. I know what that’s like. I’ve seen it. I take this personally, because I’m the husband of a brilliant woman who struggled to balance work and raising our girls when I was away. And I remember the stresses that were on Michelle, which I’m sure she’ll be happy to share with you later today. (Laughter.) And most of all, I take it personally, because I am the father of two unbelievable young ladies. (Applause.) And I want them to be able to have families. And I want them to be able to have careers. And I want them to go as far as their dreams will take them. And I want a society that supports that. And I take this personally as the President of the country that built the greatest middle class the world has ever known and inspired people to reach new heights and invent, and innovate, and drew immigrants from every corner of the world because they understood that no matter what you look like or where you come from, here in America you can make it. That’s the promise of America. That’s what we’re going to keep on fighting for. That’s what you’re fighting for. That’s what this summit is all about. Let’s go out there and get to work. Thank you, guys. I love you. God bless you. God bless America. END 		1

And one of the many hurdles he faces was front and center Monday when the prominent neurosurgeon announced his candidacy in the city where he was born. Here in Carson’s hometown, there are Ben Carson Reading Rooms and the Benjamin Carson High School of Science and Medicine. The local African-American history museum, the biggest in the country, features him on “this day in history” acknowledgements, sharing space with famed educator Booker T. Washington and popular actress Jada Pinkett-Smith. Yet despite a busy day of announcement events in the place that looms so large in his campaign narrative, his connection to Detroit is badly frayed. He moved away long ago — he now lives in Florida — and hasn’t kept up with community leaders or pastors here. More important, he’s launching his presidential bid as a staunch conservative and a fierce critic of President Barack Obama in a city that is a majority-black Democratic stronghold that gave the president 98 percent of its vote in 2012. In other words, it’s hard to find a place that’s less receptive to his conservative message and firebrand rhetoric — he has compared Obamacare to slavery, drawn parallels between the Obama era and Hitler’s Third Reich and made frequent, personal attacks against America’s first African-American president — than Detroit. “I gotta tell you something. I’m not politically correct,” Carson said during his official presidential announcement at Detroit’s Music Hall. “I’m not a politician. I don’t want to be a politician. Politicians do what is politically expedient. The retired Johns Hopkins neurosurgeon’s team has said he stands out in the crowded Republican field precisely because he can eventually compete in cities like his hometown. Carson, who talks much more about working his way out of poverty than he talks about race, believes that people who have been offended by his more controversial remarks will come to see that he’s right. To which they respond: Not a chance. “I know him through his work he’s done as a surgeon, I think he’s a fantastic surgeon, he’s saved some lives and done some great things,” said Martha Scott, a longtime Detroit politician who serves as a Wayne County commissioner. But she was surprised, she said, when she started hearing about his political views. That’s a familiar refrain in Detroit and also from many in the broader African-American community who knew Carson mostly through his medical work — he earned international acclaim for separating conjoined twins — and his philanthropic efforts. It wasn’t until a fiery speech he gave at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast, decrying the Obama administration as the president looked on, that his conservative politics came to the forefront, catching many more liberal admirers off-guard. “Before Ben Carson took a real political turn, there was a lot of hometown pride,” said Susan Demas, the editor and publisher of the publication Inside Michigan Politics. “He was definitely well-known in Detroit. Carson’s sometimes sharp and over-the-top language — often issued in soft-spoken tones — does, however, play well with the most conservative elements of the GOP base, where Carson has enjoyed some popularity. To them, his lack of office-holding experience is an asset in a field of current and former elected officials. “People say, ‘You can’t do this, you don’t have the experience,’” Carson said in his announcement, a religious revival-style event complete with gospel singers. To his supporters, his politics and personal story, which began here in a dangerous and disadvantaged neighborhood, are compelling enough. But Ron Edwards, an African-American radio host who admires Carson, also lamented that in his hometown, Carson would face an uphill climb, saying he was very skeptical of Carson’s chances in this city. “I pray, hope and believe [the city’s Democratic tendencies] can turn around, but the jury is way out on that,” said Edwards, who attended an event for Carson at the city’s African American Museum, though he is leaning toward supporting Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s likely presidential bid. Carson himself sees Detroit as an obvious choice, even if his politics aren’t a natural fit. “It’s my hometown, it’s where I grew up, where I initially developed a desire to become a physician, it’s where I got my can-do attitude so that I don’t listen to people who tell me something can’t be done, or else I wouldn’t be talking to you today,” he said in an interview Sunday night at a rehearsal for his announcement. He pointed to his appearance several weeks ago at the liberal Rev. Al Sharpton’s National Action Network conference, saying that he ultimately earned a standing ovation there — which happened when he invoked his life story. It’s an account of a man who, through sheer grit, self-reliance and a watchful mother, overcame a deeply troubled childhood in Detroit to achieve international renown as a Johns Hopkins neurosurgeon and a philanthropist. Carson’s allies believe that narrative will resonate with, and inspire, others in poor and minority communities. Those themes figured prominently in his announcement speech, where the slogan is “heal, inspire, revive,” and Carson’s announcement day was constructed with the goal of outreach in mind. Former pediatric neurosurgeon Ben Carson has never held elected office, and several of his key staffers have most recently been taking a break from politics. Here’s a look a few of the people who will matter most in his presidential campaign. Click here to read a fuller list with details. His campaign kicked off Monday with an early breakfast with pastors and community leaders at the Charles H. Wright Museum, the country’s largest museum of African-American history. The breakfast was followed by an assembly at Benjamin Carson High School of Science and Medicine and then his announcement address at Detroit’s Music Hall. Carson is reserved when it comes to working a room, displaying a low-key sense of humor. During his announcement swing, he appeared most comfortable at the high school, where he plopped down next to a ninth grader to chat with her about what book she was reading. At the school, where a plaque bearing Carson’s picture hung on the wall, several students sported scrubs in a show of support. He sat for a 30-minute assembly where he was interviewed by students about life advice. He connected with the crowd by relaying an anxiety dream he had about a chemistry final, to laughs. Carson opened his announcement speech in a slightly more formal setting — onstage at the Music Hall — where he paced back and forth without a teleprompter, recounting his tough childhood, and reflecting on his mother’s example of exhausting work in order to give her children a better life. “Many people are critical of me because they say, ‘Carson wants to get rid of all the safety nets and welfare programs even though he must have benefited from them,’” he said. “This is a blatant lie. I have no desire to get rid of safety nets for people who need them. Carson was scheduled to go on a swing through Iowa immediately after his announcement, but he canceled his Monday events on Sunday after receiving word that his mother, who suffers from Alzheimer’s, is seriously ill. He often talks about his mom on the stump, detailing how she got him to start reading and stay out of trouble, and he’s headed to Texas to see her later Monday. Earlier in the day, he told reporters he expected that this visit to his mother would likely be the last one before she died. After seeing her, he’s expected to do events in Iowa and South Carolina, and next week in New Hampshire. Exploratory committee chairman Terry Giles, who is expected to eventually join pro-Carson super PAC efforts, told POLITICO earlier this year the team expects to raise $65 million between this spring and next year’s Florida primary — an ambitious goal for a long-shot candidate. In the first month of the exploratory committee’s existence, it pulled in about $2 million. His team sees Iowa and South Carolina, places with deep pockets of social conservatives and tea party activists, as particularly good fits for Carson, though a group that initially started as a draft campaign for Carson has laid groundwork in New Hampshire, and has a paid staffer in Nevada. It’s not clear what kind of reaction he’ll receive in those early-voting states — after generating much grassroots buzz in 2014, he hasn’t spent as much time on the trail as activists expected. He waited until May to announce for president because he still had obligations on the paid speaking circuit, something that has not gone unnoticed among early-state operatives. “I don’t know if he missed his moment, but he made his path in Iowa much more difficult by not being more aggressive,” said Craig Robinson, a former political director of the Iowa GOP and the editor and founder of TheIowaRepublican.com, an influential blog. “If you’d asked me about Carson in July of 2014, I would have said, “Hey, really watch this guy, there’s a lot of interest.’ But as the race has started … it’s a little different because he hasn’t been here. Carson on Monday cast his campaign as less of a Republican operation, but as one driven by the need to change the culture of politics. Missing out on the latest scoops?

The protesters were demanding access to Georgia colleges for illegal immigrants and their children, as well as the repeal of the state's tough new immigration law.Authorities say six young illegal immigrants who spoke at the rally were arrested Tuesday afternoon after they sat down in an intersection near the Georgia Capitol. Dulce Guerrero and five others were wearing caps and gowns, chanting undocumented and unafraid. ""I am willing to risk deportation for my community,"" said Guerrero. Police have charged them with blocking an intersection and disorderly conduct. They could face deportation as a result.""I am here to show the government and my community that I am not afraid anymore, that we're not going to stay quiet with this racist legislation and oppression going on in my community. We're not going to stay quiet anymore,"" said Guerrero.The rally was a planned response to a new law that targets illegal immigration. A federal judge in Atlanta has put the brakes on parts of Georgia's new anti-illegal immigration law. The move prevents the law from fully taking effect until a legal challenge is resolved. Governor Nathan Deal says the state will appeal the decision.Judge Thomas Thrash granted a request Monday to block two of the most controversial sections of the law. It prevents a part that penalizes people who knowingly and willingly transport or harbor illegal immigrants while committing another crime. Thrash also blocked provisions that authorize officers to verify the immigration status of someone who can't provide proper identification.Read the entire rulingSeveral groups have protested and even sued to block the new law from taking effect. One of the plaintiffs, ACLU lawyer Azadeh Shahshahani, says this is a major step toward invalidating the law altogether.""I think there is a huge sense of relief within Georgia immigrant communities and communities of color. There was a huge sense of concern about the impacts of this bill and our communities,"" said Shahshahani. State Attorney General Sam Olens says the protests are hypocritical.""If you're from Guatemala and you are found illegally in Mexico, you are automatically jailed. But here we have both Guatemala and Mexico complaining that we have laws to discourage illegal immigrants in our country.State Representative Matt Ramsey (R-Peachtree City) sponsored the law and has already acknowledged it was possible parts of it would not survive the challenge.""At the end of the day July first a huge portion, if not all of this law is going to go into effect. We think it is the right policy for Georgia,"" said Ramsey.However, Shahshahani says the court delivered a very important decision Monday.""The core provisions of the Georgia racial profiling law have been blocked from implementation,"" said Shahshahani.Georgia's immigration law was to have been phased in over the next few years. Most parts of the law were set to take effect Friday, including the provisions giving police the authority to arrest illegal immigrants and barring people from transporting, harboring and luring to them to the state. Tim McMillan owns Southern Grace Farms in Berrien County and he agrees that immigration law should be left to the federal government.""I think the state is trying to fix a federal problem and they are terrifying the hispanics whether they are legal or illegal to the point that they're leaving the state,"" said McMillan.McMillan says his farm tries to hire local people, but he says they're not willing to do the work. He is in favor of Judge Thrash's ruling.""I think it is good news for the farm. It can't hurt, but I am afraid the damage may have already been done,"" said McMillan.Shahshahani agrees the bill has had an impact on scaring people away from Georgia.""A lot of people in the country no longer view Georgia as a welcoming state for immigrants. I think the repercussions of this legislation, even though the core provisions have been blocked from implementation, the repercussions remain,"" said Shahshahani.RelatedPhoto Credit: Pete CombsProtesters rally at near the Georgia Capitol in response to state policies targeting illegal immigration.Immigration Bill Protesters Rally at CaptiolPhoto Credit: Sandra Parrish, News/Talk WSBProtesters took the the streets outside the State Capitol Thursday as lawmakers passed a tough new immigration bill.Read MoreVIEW COMMENTSThere are no comments yet.

Images taken around 2:20 a.m. show a black bear hanging out near the front entrance of the northwest Atlanta jail. “No one knows where the animal came from,” spokeswoman Tracy Flanagan said in a statement. She said the bear “investigated trashcans, planters, and approached the front door before wandering away.” The Georgia Department of Natural Resources was notified, and jail staff reportedly contacted residents in the nearby Howell Station neighborhood. Jail officials say residents should “keep their children and pets close,” secure trash and call 911 if they see the bear. (Presumably to report the intruder for trespassing.)

Update 11:55 a.m. EDT June 1: A man wanted on suspicion of killing a Dickson County sheriff’s deputy earlier this week was arrested without incident Friday morning after he was spotted by a Tennessee state trooper, officials said at a news conference. Sgt. Daniel Baker, of the Dickson County Sheriff's Office, was shot and killed Wednesday morning after he went to check on a suspicious vehicle while on-duty. Authorities arrested a woman, identified as Erika Castro-Miles, on suspicion of murder after Baker’s death and launched a manhunt for Steven Wiggins. Col. Derek Stewart, of the Tennessee Highway Patrol, said a trooper came across Wiggins on the edge of a wooded area off Stinson Road in Hickman County, near the Dickson County line. When the trooper realized the man that he approached matched Wiggins’ description, the trooper took him into custody, Stewart said. “This has been a trying week for each of us,” Dickson County Sheriff Jeff Bledsoe said. He choked up Friday while sharing a statement from the wife of the slain deputy. “There are no words to describe the level of devastation that myself and my family are dealing with,” Lisa Baker said in the statement read by Bledsoe. She asked for the community’s help making sure that her daughter, Meredith, is always reminded of “how amazing and wonderful her father is.” “His service and dedication to his country and community will always be remembered,” Lisa Baker said in the statement. Wiggins was getting treatment after his arrest Friday for injuries that did not appear to be serious, authorities said. He will face one count of first-degree murder in Baker’s death, according to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.

Cumberbatch and his wife, Sophie Hunter, were riding in an Uber when the actor spotted four muggers attacking a Deliveroo cyclist on Marylebone High Street and jumped out of the vehicle, the Sun reported. According to witnesses, Cumberbatch jumped out of the vehicle, yelled at the attackers and then dragged them off the victim. Uber driver Manuel Dias told The Sun that “the cyclist was lucky, Benedict’s a superhero.” Dias, who also got out of the vehicle to help, called the incident surreal. “Here was Sherlock Holmes fighting off four attackers just round the corner from Baker Street,' Dias told the Sun. 'I had hold of one lad and Benedict another. He seemed to know exactly what he was doing. He was very brave. “Benedict was courageous, brave and selfless. If he hadn’t stepped in the cyclist could have been seriously injured.” Deliveroo thanked Cumberbatch in a tweet Saturday. 'Deliveroo riders are heroes -- their safety is our priority and any violence against them is totally unacceptable,' the delivery company said.Many breast cancer patients can skip chemo, big study findsMost women with the most common form of early-stage breast cancer can safely skip chemotherapy without hurting their chances of beating the disease, doctors are reporting from a landmark study that used genetic testing to gauge each patient's risk. The study is the largest ever done of breast cancer treatment, and the results are expected to spare up to 70,000 patients a year in the United States and many more elsewhere the ordeal and expense of these drugs. 'The impact is tremendous,' said the study leader, Dr. Joseph Sparano of Montefiore Medical Center in New York. Most women in this situation don't need treatment beyond surgery and hormone therapy, and 'the rest of them are receiving chemotherapy unnecessarily.' The study was funded by the National Cancer Institute, some foundations and proceeds from the U.S. breast cancer postage stamp. Results were discussed Sunday at an American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in Chicago and published by the New England Journal of Medicine. Some study leaders consult for breast cancer drugmakers or for the company that makes the gene test. MOVING AWAY FROM CHEMO Cancer care has been evolving away from chemotherapy — older drugs with harsh side effects — in favor of gene-targeting therapies, hormone blockers and immune system treatments. When chemo is used now, it's sometimes for shorter periods or lower doses than it once was. For example, another study at the conference found that Merck's immunotherapy drug Keytruda worked better than chemo as initial treatment for most people with the most common type of lung cancer, and with far fewer side effects. The breast cancer study focused on cases where chemo's value increasingly is in doubt: women with early-stage disease that has not spread to lymph nodes, is hormone-positive (meaning its growth is fueled by estrogen or progesterone) and is not the type that the drug Herceptin targets. The usual treatment is surgery followed by years of a hormone-blocking drug. But many women also are urged to have chemo to help kill any stray cancer cells. Doctors know that most don't need it, but evidence is thin on who can forgo it. The study gave 10,273 patients a test called Oncotype DX, which uses a biopsy sample to measure the activity of genes involved in cell growth and response to hormone therapy, to estimate the risk that a cancer will recur. WHAT THE STUDY FOUND About 17 percent of women had high-risk scores and were advised to have chemo. The 16 percent with low-risk scores now know they can skip chemo, based on earlier results from this study. The new results are on the 67 percent of women at intermediate risk. All had surgery and hormone therapy, and half also got chemo. After nine years, 94 percent of both groups were still alive, and about 84 percent were alive without signs of cancer, so adding chemo made no difference. Certain women 50 or younger did benefit from chemo; slightly fewer cases of cancer spreading far beyond the breast occurred among some of them given chemo, depending on their risk scores on the gene test. WILL PEOPLE TRUST THE RESULTS? All women like those in the study should get gene testing to guide their care, said Dr. Richard Schilsky, chief medical officer of the oncology society. Oncotype DX costs around $4,000, which Medicare and many insurers cover. Similar tests including one called MammaPrint also are widely used. Testing solved a big problem of figuring out who needs chemo, said Dr. Harold Burstein of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. Many women think 'if I don't get chemotherapy I'm going to die, and if I get chemo I'm going to be cured,' but the results show there's a sliding scale of benefit and sometimes none, he said. Dr. Lisa Carey, a breast specialist at the University of North Carolina's Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, said she would be very comfortable advising patients to skip chemo if they were like those in the study who did not benefit from it. Dr. Jennifer Litton at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, agreed, but said, 'Risk to one person is not the same thing as risk to another. There are some people who say, 'I don't care what you say, I'm never going to do chemo,'' and won't even have the gene test, she said. Others want chemo for even the smallest chance of benefit. Adine Usher, 78, who lives in Hartsdale, New York, joined the study 10 years ago at Montefiore and was randomly assigned to the group given chemo. 'I was a little relieved. I sort of viewed chemo as extra insurance,' she said. The treatments 'weren't pleasant,' she concedes. Her hair fell out, she developed an infection and was hospitalized for a low white blood count, 'but it was over fairly quickly and I'm really glad I had it.' If doctors had recommended she skip chemo based on the gene test, 'I would have accepted that,' she said.

Investigators said Rodriguez used the names of actual South Florida criminal defense attorneys on the paperwork to make the shipments look legitimate. Rodriguez, who is being held at the Federal Detention Center in Miami, was sentenced in April to three years' imprisonment by U.S. District Judge Jose Martinez for violating his probation in the previous firearms case. Investigators said an accomplice, Lucia Mendez, 46, pleaded guilty in May and is helping authorities build a case against Rodriguez. According to court records, officials at the Federal Bureau of Prisons intercepted a package of Adb-Fubinaca, a cannabinoid that was disguised as legal mail and sent to inmates in April 2017. The couple created legal packets with the names of seven legitimate criminal defense attorneys and built a website that featured actual photos of the attorneys in their offices, the Herald reported. 'Once the packets were created, the documents were impregnated (soaked) with the narcotic and mailed to numerous federal inmates throughout the United States,' the affidavit said. 'Rodriguez often mailed the packages himself, and Mendez accepted payment and laundered those payments through personal business bank accounts.' FBI agents said they seized 33 packages sent to prison inmates by Rodriguez, most of which tested positive for the drug, the Herald reported.Ben Krupinski, 'builder to the stars,' killed in plane crashBen Krupinski, a noted New York builder who constructed homes for Billy Joel, Christie Brinkley, Martha Stewart and other stars, was killed Saturday after his plane crashed into the ocean off an East Hampton Beach, the Long Island Business News reported. >> Read more trending news Krupinski and three others were killed in the crash near Amagansett, New York, the East Hampton Town Police confirmed. The victims were identified as Krupinski, his wife, Bonnie Bistrian Krupinski, and 22-year-old grandson, William Maerov, all of East Hampton, as well as the pilot, Jon Dollard, 47, of Hampton Bays. The Piper PA-31 Navajo plane went down about one mile off shore near Indian Wells Beach at about 2:50 p.m., the New York Post reported. Thunderstorms were in the area at the time of the crash, the Business News reported. The cause of the crash is under investigation, but local pilot Bill Gardiner told the Post the weather had turned stormy. “There was a very nasty thunderstorm going on,” Gardiner told the newspaper. “It was unexpected. There were very strong downdrafts.” “We are stricken by this loss,” Capt. Kevin Reed, commander Sector Long Island Sound, said in a Coast Guard statement. “Our deepest sympathies go out to the families and loved ones of the two recovered individuals.” The couple’s real estate empire is worth a reported $150 million, the Post reported."		1

On Tuesday night, in spite of millions of dollars of negative ads and high-profile criticism by Mitt Romney and others, Trump won four of five primaries and he nearly tripled his delegate lead over Ted Cruz. Establishment republicans are desperate to use any means necessary, candidate collusion, delegate jujitsu, rules changes, anything to deny Trump, in part, because of scenes like this. Last night in Tucson, Arizona. An anti-Trump protester was set upon and beaten up as he was being escorted out of the rally. Now, police arrested and charged the man who assaulted the protester that you see there in that video. And then this was the scene earlier in the day yesterday in Arizona, where protesters blocked a road to a Trump rally. So the rise of Trumpism and the undoing of the Republican establishment has been years in the making. It began in 2007 when conservatives killed President Bush's push for immigration reform, in 2008 when establishment favorite John McCain was clobbered by Barack Obama, in 2010, that came the Tea Party revolt. The party lost control of the primary process, but they won so many seats, they chose to ride the tiger instead of fight it. More recently came the falls of Cantor, Boehner, and even the prevention of Kevin McCarthy getting a promotion. All at the hands of a resurgent, populist, conservative movement. And now, many in the party are trying to stop Donald Trump. But how? Go forward, you have the establishment, they don't know what they're doing, they have no clue. The Stop Trump Movement is limping forward. But though Republican opponents have the will to defeat the frontrunner, it's not clear they have a game plan. There have been meetings, a confab in Washington, two blocks from the White House, calling for a unity ticket. Another meeting of big donors in Florida, and new ads from outside groups. Ask Donald Trump why he sides with Hillary Clinton. But Stop Trump groups spent 13 million dollars in primaries this week and Trump nearly tripled his delegate lead. Still, many Republican voters are not comfortable with Trump. 29 percent of primary voters in Florida said they would seriously consider a third-party candidate. So did 39 percent in battleground North Carolina, and 45 percent in battleground Ohio. But what's the alternative? For me to win 1,237 delegates, I've got to win 78 percent of the remaining delegates. That sounds like a high bar. Mitt Romney is encouraging Republicans to vote for Cruz. Are you sure he's a Mormon? Are we sure? He choked, he choked. It was so sad. But only to force an open convention. A vote for John Kasich is a vote for Donald Trump. But John Kasich is only stepping up efforts to challenge Cruz in Utah, which holds its caucus on Tuesday. Now, many Trump opponents are turning to the convention, hoping to deprive Trump of a clear, 1,237 delegate majority. Nothing has changed other than the perception that this is more likely to become an open convention than we thought before. Trump warns of violence if a floor fight produces another nominee. I think you'd have riots. I think you'd have riots. But for many Republican, denial and anger, bargaining and depression are turning into acceptance. If Mr. Trump does become the president of the United States, he's going to need a Republican majority to govern. And I think he would welcome working with Republican majorities in the House and the Senate. That's an admission that the Republican establishment, long and life support, may officially be dead. Just a reminder, John Cornyn is a Ted Cruz supporter, we think. Joining me now to talk about the Republican establishment's efforts to stop Trump, I'm joined by the men who ran the last two Republican presidential campaigns, Stuart Stevens served as chief strategist to Mitt Romney in 2012, and Steve Schmidt was chief strategist to John McCain in 2008. Gentlemen, welcome to you both. Stu, let me start with you. Prior to last Tuesday, you wrote there was still time to stop Trump. Do you still believe that a week later? Sure, I mean, 40 percent of the people haven't voted. So, you know, we got upset in 2000 when they closed the polls in Florida and they announced it when the panhandle was still open, so I think the 40 percent is still out there, we have to say. I think it's going to be very difficult for anybody else other than Donald Trump to get to 1,237. But there's credible scenarios out there, with 40 percent of the vote out there, that you could easily have Donald Trump, you know, 1,000, 1,100 votes, and Ted Cruz up there around 900, 950. We've done this before. I mean, this was the Ronald Reagan strategy. I mean, he became in 1976, he gets the sitting Republican president. But, you know, Steve, the most expedient way to do this would be to rally around Ted Cruz. And that seems to be something that Washington Republicans can't bring themselves to do. Look, Ted Cruz is exactly right, a vote at this point for John Kasich is in fact a vote for Donald Trump. So, why isn’t the cavalry rallying around Cruz? If you look now, Donald Trump is well on his way to securing 1,237 delegates to be nominated on the first ballot. If Donald Trump gets to 1,237 delegates, he'll be nominated on the first ballot. If he does not, it goes to an open convention. Anything of course can happen. But if you look at the amount of new voters coming into the process this year, for them to be denied what they view as a small-D democratic process, and in fact, these parties, they are the vessels that we advance democracy in America, are not themselves democratic, small-D institutions. So I think the rules would play out, and there was a denial of it, dire consequences for the party and for the Senate majority. Now look, there is a way to do this. And Stuart, you are on the receiving end of some delegate manipulation that could talk place. Ron Paul never won any states, but he came to the convention with majorities of delegates. Let me show some results in Iowa just to show people, this was the Iowa results in 2012. Santorum and Romney first and second, depending on the day they announced their vote. But look at this, Ron Paul had a majority of the delegates by the time the convention rolled around. Louisiana, we had a similar finding here. Ron Paul ended up with 6 percent of the vote in the primary, but look at this, he ended up with nearly I think 40 percent of the delegates once he got to the convention. There is a -and this happened last night in Louisiana. There is a way to elect delegates that are more supportive of Cruz, if you’re the Cruz campaign, to deny Trump this. But then it does undermine what Steve was talking about. You know, I think what we're going to have here is a period where the candidates are really going to be looked at very closely, more closely than they have been before, because there's fewer of them. You're going to have a different threshold for it. I think there's going to be a lot of pressure on Donald Trump to really behave as a frontrunner, as someone who could lead a party. And look, had the Democrats gone through this and John Edwards was leading, and then we discovered this about John Edwards, people would have had second thoughts about going into a party with John Edwards. So I think that it's a real test here. And we're going to have to see how these candidates perform under this test. But Steve, it seems as if, and you'll see, and Mitch McConnell is sticking by the nominee, Paul Ryan, who some people believe right now is the titular head of the Republican party, given his position, he's getting criticized this morning by Ross Douthat, a conservative columnist in The Times going, ""Hey, you know, where are you? You can make a difference here, it seems hesitant."" But we’re not there yet? --about a perspective Trump nomination. So you have people out there saying, ""Anybody but Trump,"" but are also saying, ""I'm going to support the Republican nominee for president."" They've not yet crossed that Rubicon. And so as we go through the next couple of weeks of contests, as Donald Trump I suspect continues to win at the proportion that he has been winning at, and he moves closer to 1,237, it will be interesting to see what the leaders of the Republican party say. Now, what the consequence of it would be, for them to peel off the Republican nomination is to forfeit the election to Hillary Clinton, there would be multiple Supreme Court nominations made by her if she's the next president of the United States, and of course, also, the Republican Senate Majority hangs in the balance here. And it's tough to see how Senate Republicans maintain that majority if the 35 to 40 percent of these Trump voters are feeling disenfranchised from the process and they take a walk. Okay, but then you have 10 percent to 15 percent of the party, maybe more of that, look at those numbers that I showed in the exit polls in battlegrounds Ohio, Florida, North Carolina. These were Republican primary voters, Stuart, who said they'd prefer a third-party option than pick between Trump and Clinton. Yeah, Trump is a disaster. You know, politics ultimately is about addition, not subtraction. And the whole idea of Trump is not that he's going to take these Romney voters and add to them, he's losing Romney voters. Just look at Republican Hispanics. There's not tons of Hispanics in the Republican party. He already has a 60 percent negative with Republican Hispanics. Romney won white women by 12 points. It's going to be very tough for any number to do better than that, but it's going to be necessary for him to do better against Hillary. He's going to do worse. We went ahead and ran the numbers on the exit polls, but using the exit polls from 2012 in Ohio and Wisconsin, just on the white vote. And assuming all things were equal, and here's Wisconsin first, Trump would have to increase the Romney share by 5 percent if he wants to go from 51 percent of the white vote, which by the way, Romney got and still lost this state, 56 percent of the white vote is what Trump would need to flip it. In Ohio, to flip Ohio, he would have to move the Romney white vote number from 57 percent to 61 percent. This assumes that the non-white vote doesn't move at all. This seems like an impossibility. I'm not sure it is an impossibility. I think it's a very difficult task. But he is an asymmetrical candidate. He is so unconventional, we've never seen anything like it. And so when you began the program today, you set looking back from 2007 the rise of the movement that led us to this. But it's more expansive than that. We live in an era where trust has collapsed in every single institution in the country, with the exception of the military. And it's not without cause. --in religion. All of it accumulating to this moment in time where someone has come forward with profound communication skills offering easy answers to people who through these wave elections, have seen no changes. But 37 percent of the people don't trust Hillary Clinton. Huge opportunity for Republicans. So now we're turning to a guy who has 27 percent of the people don't trust him. He's one of the few people in America that is trusted less than Hillary Clinton. You mean to say only 27 percent trust. Only 27 percent trust Donald Trump compared to 37 percent for Hillary Clinton. He's trusted less than Hillary Clinton, which is hard to do. Well, I'm trying to figure out what turnout is going to look like if the two candidates are the two most unpopular among swing voters right now, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. I'm going to leave it there, Stuart Stevens, Steve Schmidt, appreciate you both. One man who's still in the race though against Trump is Ohio Governor John Kasich, whose win in his home state on Tuesday did keep his hopes alive and the hopes of the anti-Trump movement alive in trying to get a contested convention. John Kasich joined me yesterday from Salt Lake City. Why are you in Utah? And I ask that because if you didn't campaign in Utah and Ted Cruz won 50 percent of the vote, then you deny Donald Trump any delegates, which actually helps your path to getting to Cleveland in a contested convention. Hey, Chuck.Chuck, look, I'm in Utah. You know why? Because I'm running for president and because I want people to understand what is a good positive message with a record of accomplishment. But do you want to win? I mean, but Chuck, I'm going to compete across the country and tell people who I am and let the chips fall where they may. And let me also tell you, no one-- no one is going to that convention with enough delegates. I will have more delegates moving in there that will give me momentum. And then the delegates are going to decide who can win in the fall. Because the other guys can't win in the fall. Hillary will be president. And secondly, I've got the record, the experience, and the vision and the ability to bring people together to be a good president. We saw, well, we saw the evidence though of what happens when there's three people in and two anti-Trump candidates split the vote. Missouri and Illinois. Donald Trump cleaned up on delegates. If you go about this in New York and Pennsylvania and some of these other states, you and Cruz could end up handing more delegates to Trump inadvertently. Well, maybe Ted ought to get out because he can't win in the fall. And maybe these people that are hot on that, you know, ought to tell him to do it. You know, they tried to tell me to get out of the race how many times, Chuck? You're right. And now they should be thanking me for staying in. Because if Trump had win Ohio, it would be over. I have a record of accomplishment, a record of bringing people together, a vision for the future of this country. And guess what? In the grassroots, people are getting it. Now, they didn't get it because, frankly, you put me on the tube a lot. But Trump got, you know, $1.8 billion worth of free media. I got none. Okay? People are starting to hear me, and we're starting to rise. Look at what our numbers are. If you thought your candidacy were helping Trump, not hurting him, would you get out? Chuck, I'm running for president. This isn't a parlor game of who gets this or who gets that. No, Chuck. That's the ultimate parlor game. I am not playing a parlor game. The convention is an extension of the process of nominating somebody. I was there in '76 when Reagan challenged the sitting president. They didn't like him doing it either. But you know what? His vision, his message mattered. Listen, nobody's going to that convention with enough delegates. And at the end, do you know why I'll get picked? Because I can win in the fall. And secondly, because I have the experience and the record to lead this country. You know, and Chuck, if I didn't think that, I wouldn't be running. Yesterday, earlier in the week, you totally ruled out ever being Donald Trump's running mate. Yeah. Under no circumstances. Are you people kidding me? All right. What about Ted Cruz? No. Under no circumstances. Just as Shermanesque with Ted Cruz as it is with Donald Trump. Absolutely. You know what? You folks gotta get-- You know, look. You're a great guy. I like you very much. But you guys-- you pundits got to get out of Washington. You don't understand me. You know, the problem is that a lot of people just can't figure that, how could this guy mean what he says? How is it that he's no different than what he appears? You can't figure that out. People are like, ""What's his calculation? What's this or that?"" Folks, I don't have time for that. As you know, Ted Cruz is going to use two issues to try to wedge if it's even a delegate fight. And that's Common Core and immigration. Well, let me just say this. I'll tell you what Common Core is in my state. Our state board of education has approved high standards, and our local school boards are the ones that devised the curriculum. We need high standards for our children in the 21st century. I am for shipping all the federal education programs out of Washington to the states. So look, I'm telling you what we do in Ohio. And at the end of the day, presidents should not run K through 12. Secondly, on immigration, I do not believe it is practical nor doable to search in the neighborhoods and yank the people who came here illegally who have not committed a crime since they've been here and ship them out of this country. That is not going to happen. The plan that I support: Finishing the border, making sure you have a guest worker program, and having the 11 and a half million who came here illegally who have not committed a crime pay back taxes, pay a fine. Let me tell you, they then can have a path to legalization and not citizenship. And any other position than that just isn't going to work, Chuck. I hate to tell you that. It isn't going to work. You talk about yourself as a consensus builder, so I'm curious. What do you make of the Republican Senate strategy on the Supreme Court pick, Merrick Garland? Should the senate at least hold hearings? You know, Chuck. Look, this is one I'm not going to actually answer directly. Because I don't think the senate is waiting there with bated breath for my opinion. But the fact is, I never thought the president should have sent it up. I think they can go ahead and have a meeting with him. The senators can meet with this gentleman. And then maybe ultimately, if I'm president, which I think we have a good shot at being, maybe he'll be under consideration for the Supreme Court. I don't know. But they ought to meet with him. Show him that amount of respect. But what about hearings and all that? Look, the hearings aren't going to mean anything, Chuck. But that's up to them to decide. Ask them. All right. Governor John Kasich, I'll leave it there. Well, stay safe on the trail. Thank you, sir. And you know what? If it's Sunday, it must be Meet The Press. Well, there you go. You can always get extra time by saying that. By the way, following that interview with John Kasich, he walked back his comments on Merrick Garland saying he would not consider Merrick Garland as a potential replacement to Justice Scalia if he’s elected president. All right, coming up, we’ve got a lot more on the 2016 race, but first, the fight over the Supreme Court-- both senate leaders, Mitch McConnell and Harry Reid exclusively right here on Meet the Press. And later, the debate over Hillary Clinton’s speaking style . I’ve never had more faith in our future and if we work together, if we go... We’ve heard the criticism before-- that she sounds shrill, that she shouts, that she doesn’t smile enough. The question: Is this just sexism masquerading as honest criticism? Thank you all so very much! CHUCK TODD: It is time for our Meet the Press Data Download. With March Madness in full swing, we wanted to share some brackets on our own. No I’m not here to brag about Middle Tennessee State and that pick. Instead, here are three scenarios for winning the Republican nomination. Welcome to the Meet the Press big dance and what we’re calling Trump-A-Tology. In bracket 1 it’s Donald Trump receiving a bye while Ted Cruz and John Kasich fight it out through the rest of the primary season. They end up splitting the anti-Trump vote but Trump is able to come away with the majority he needs and hits that magic number of 1237 and he wins the nomination and game over. In bracket number 2 we start with the same standings. But in this scenario Cruz catches fire and wins enough delegates to deny Trump the 1237 that he needs. So we move to an overtime and an open convention. Trump delegates eventually abandon Trump and Cruz emerges as the conservative compromise choice in a buzzer beater. In bracket number 3, this is our cinderella story. It looks familiar at the beginning, Cruz, Kasich, Trump they all compete. And again Trump ends up short of his magic number of 1237, and again we head to an open convention. But in this scenario we go to overtime, and we go to multiple ballots. We go to double overtime actually. Neither Kasich nor Cruz can win the majority and the nomination ends up going to, how about that somebody not running, probably House Speaker Paul Ryan. More Possible than you might think, so who is going to have their one shining moment in Cleveland this July? It’s something that we have a whole rest of a primary season to figure out. We’ll be back in a moment with the battle over the Supreme Court, and the two leaders of the Senate, Mitch McConnell and Harry Reid. If you missed Meet the Press, catch highlights in two minutes on Compressed at meet-the-press-nbc-dot-com. Brought to you by Hewlett Parckard Enterprise, accelerating next. Welcome back. The expression, “Elections have consequences” usually refers to the fact that presidents get to choose who sits on the Supreme Court. Well, when President Obama named Merrick Garland this week to be his nomination to replace Antonin Scalia, Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell immediately announced that Republicans would not even give Garland a hearing. McConnell said the choice should be made by the next president. Well, Democratic Senate Leader Harry Reid immediately criticized McConnell’s move, saying the senate was abdicating its responsibilities. I spoke to both Mitch McConnell and Harry Reid, and I began with a conversation with Senator Reid that took place yesterday. Let me start with a piece of sound on judges that you said over ten years ago. Let me play it and get you to react on the other side. The duties of the United States Senate are set forth in the Constitution of the United States. Nowhere in that document does it say the senate has a duty to give presidential nominees a vote. And yet, 11 years later, you wrote this: ""The Senate's constitutional duty to give a fair and timely hearing and a floor vote to the president's Supreme Court nominee has remained inviolable."" I guess I'm confused. Which is it? What has changed from 2005 when you said, ""There was nothing in the Constitution that said a vote,"" to 2016? This is the same thing as you guys talk about the ""Biden rule."" There is no Biden rule. What happened then was it worked out, and it was an effort to try to get something done. What I have tried to do during my entire career in Congress and in the Senate is to get rid of obstruction. And what we've found the last eight years especially with Republicans, Boehner first and McConnell, is everything was obstructed. That was what they set out to do. And they've done a good job of it. But we have always tried, and I have been part of that for many years, to get rid of obstruction. I don't believe in it. Well then what happened in 2005? I can quote you during the Miguel Estrada hearing. You said, ""There's no reason to mince words around here. We're not going to allow an up or down vote on Miguel Estrada."" That's a form of obstruction back when President Bush was in office. But remember, this man had a full hearing and came to the Senate floor. And all we ask is that if you worked in the White House, you had a lot of legal opinions, we're entitled to see them. That was reasonable. And the White House instructed this good man not to do it. It was unfair to him, but that's what happened. We and the American people were entitled to what he had written in those legal opinions. But I guess I'm going back to, what part of-- what has changed, other than the political party affiliation of the White House? What has changed is, you have to look at what has happened. We have never held up a Supreme Court nomination. Since 1900 in a lame duck session, there have been six they’ve all been approved. But wait a minute. Alito. You did a filibuster for Alito and Roberts. Where is Alito today? He's on the Supreme Court. It failed. It failed, but you wanted one. But that's the point. You can draw all these extracurricular activities that took place, but look at what’s happened. For example, let's look at two very famous cases that came before the Senate. Bork. Bork didn't get enough votes in committee. Neither did Thomas. But we brought them to the floor anyway. We met with them. We had hearings, and even though they didn't get it, it could have been killed in the committee. We believed there should be a full vote. And that's what we should do now. I don't know why McConnell has done this to his senators. He's marching these men, women over a cliff. I don't think they're going to go. He said, ""We're not going to meet with them. We’re not going to hold hearings, we’re not going to have a vote."" But that façade is breaking as we speak. We now have about eight or nine senators who say, ""Oh, yeah, I guess we will meet with him."" We had a senator the day before yesterday that said, ""Let's man up here. We are elected to take votes. We should be voting."" And there's going to be a breakthrough here. Why do you think they're going to get a hearing? How are you going to get a hearing? Mitch McConnell has said, ""No hearing at all."" So why do you think you're going to get a hearing? Mitch McConnell has said a lot of things. But his Republican senators are not going to go over that cliff with him. They're not going to do it. As I told Merrick Garland. ""This is going to break. You're going to become a Supreme Court justice."" And in addition to the people agreeing to meet, we have Republican senators who are veteran senators who said, ""Well, maybe what we should do is do it in a lame duck."" Orrin Hatch, Lindsey Graham, others have said that. But if they're going to do it in lame duck, do it now. Four years from now, and I know you're not going to be Senate Democratic leader four years from now. But four years from now, if you're in the fourth year of a Republican presidency, you don't think the Democrats should do whatever it takes to prevent that Republican president from appointing a Supreme Court justice in a presidential year before the election? Not only do I think they shouldn't do it, they wouldn't do it. Whoever is elected president is elected for four years. Obama was elected for four years. He filled that duty on behalf of the American people. He was re-elected. He has an obligation to do his job for four years, not three years. Do you blame Republicans though for wanting to do whatever it takes? This is going to change the makeup of the court. And they believe this is worth fighting for. Do you blame them for doing this? Absolutely. When you have Orrin Hatch, who was a Chairman of the Judicial Committee, now is Chairman of the Finance Committee, said, ""You could not pick as finer nominee than Garland. Why didn’t you do that?"" He's complaining to Obama. Of course I blame them. Of course I do. You don't think they should fight to prevent the change in the makeup as hard as they possibly can? No. It's not been done in the past. And their excuses are lame. They're going to wind up as a result of this foolishness losing Senate seats they shouldn't have lost. I'm kind of glad they're doing it, but it's so foolish. He is-- McConnell is leading his senators over the cliff. And I am telling everybody that's watching this, the senators aren't going to allow that. And a little earlier this morning, I was joined the Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Senator McConnell, welcome back to Meet the Press, sir. SEN. Good morning. Good to be with you. I want to start with something you said in 2008 about judicial vacancies. Here it is. SEN. Our Democratic colleagues continually talk about the so-called Thurmond Rule, under which the Senate supposedly stops confirming judges in a presidential election year. This seeming obsession with this rule that doesn't exist is just an excuse for our colleagues to run out the clock on qualified nominees who are waiting to fill badly-needed vacancies. Now Senator McConnell, I started my interview with Harry Reid with a similar quote from him, back during the Bush years too. Essentially, you guys have changed places in your position on Supreme Court vacancies. And it seems to me, the only difference is the political party affiliation of the White House. SEN. Well, there was no Supreme Court vacancy in 2008. And that's what we're talking about here, Chuck. You have to go back 80 years to find the last time a vacancy on the Supreme Court created during a presidential election year was filled. You have to go back to Grover Cleveland in 1888 to find the last time a presidential appointment was confirmed by a Senate of the opposite party when the vacancy occurred in a presidential year. We're talking about the Supreme Court here. The election is underway. And what we are using is the Biden Rule in 1992, when Joe Biden was chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He made the point that a vacancy, had it occurred in 1992, would not be filled. Harry Reid, when he was leader in 2005, pointed out the Senate had no obligation under the Constitution to give a nominee a vote. And Chuck Schumer, in 2007, 18 months before Bush's term was up, said if a vacancy occurred, they wouldn't fill it. So we’re talking about Supreme Court vacancy. But Senator, in each of those occasions, Republicans at the time criticized those Senate Democrats for having that position. And frankly, that's what we're seeing here. There feels like there's hypocrisy on both sides. Democrats essentially don't want to confirm a Supreme Court justice if a Republican's doing it, and Republicans don't want to confirm a Supreme Court justice if a Democrat is doing it. Isn't that what we're staring at here? SEN. Nobody's been entirely consistent. So let's just look at the history of it. It hasn't happened in 80 years, and it won't happen this year. The principle involved here, Chuck, when an election is underway, as Joe Biden was talking in 1992, an election's underway, the American people are about to weigh in on who's going to be the president. And that's the person, whoever that may be, who ought to be making this appointment. You know, you said something though, about three months ago you said this: ""My view is, just because there's an election coming up, doesn't mean you're not supposed to do anything."" You even noted, ""We've had an election every two years right on schedule since 1788."" So, I guess, when does a presidential term run out? When does the president lose his authority to make appointments in your view? SEN. Oh, well, the Senate has been quite active. I mean, we had an incredible year last year. This year, we're going to have another year. We've got a great chance at passing every single appropriation bill for the first time since 1994. The Senate's not doing nothing during this election season. But we're not giving lifetime appointment to this president on the way out the door to change the Supreme Court for the next 25 or 30 years. Let me get you to respond to a criticism that George Will has that's all over papers today. And you've probably seen it. But he doesn't much care for your strategy here. He writes this, conservative George Will, ""The Republican party's incoherent response to the Supreme Court vacancy is a partisan reflex in search of a justifying principle. The multiplicity of Republican rationalizations for their refusal to even consider Merrick B. Garland radiates insincerity."" What do you say to George Will? SEN. Well, I just disagree with him. I think when you've got a nominee that MoveOn.org is extremely enthusiastic about, and multiple articles pointing out that if Judge Merrick were in fact confirmed, he would move the court dramatically to the left. I just disagree with George Will. I don't think it's a good idea to move the court to the left. But that's not really the issue here. It's not the person. It's the principle. Who ought to make this lifetime appointment? It's the next president, not this one. Are you completely ruling out a lame-duck scenario if Hillary Clinton wins the November election? SEN. Yes. We're not going to be confirming a judge to the Supreme Court under this president. Even if it means Hillary Clinton nominates somebody even more liberal than Merrick Garland? SEN. Well, it's my hope, it'd be hard to be more liberal than Merrick Garland, but it's my hope that she will not be making the appointment. Let me ask you about who could be facing her in the fall. Are you comfortable with Donald Trump as your party's standard bearer? SEN. Well, I'm going to support the nominee. I've got an obligation to my colleagues and to my party to support the nominee and I fully intend to do that. But what did you mean when you told them privately you could ""drop him like a hot rock?"" Do you think it's appropriate for any of your Republican senators to run against him if necessary? SEN. Well, I think we've got a bunch of Senate races in purple states that are very competitive. And each of those races will be crafted very differently to try to appeal to the people in New Hampshire or Pennsylvania or Ohio, Wisconsin, Nevada, Colorado, Illinois. Every one of those races are going to be individual, standalone contests with people who we think have a great chance of winning in November. And if that means running away from Donald Trump, that should be their strategy? SEN. Oh, I think every campaign will have a different strategy to appeal to different kind of voters that we have in different parts of the country. Are you going-- and one other final thing. Donald Trump is having a meeting with various Republican leaders tomorrow in Washington before he speaks to AIPAC. Are you going to participate in that meeting, sir? SEN. No, I'm in Kentucky. He did call me last week. We had a good conversation. All right, Senator Mitch McConnell, I will leave it there. Thanks for coming on, sir. Appreciate it. SEN. When we come back, when male pundits say Hillary Clinton is shrill or yells too much, is that legitimate criticism or is it sexist? Welcome back. Take a listen to a moment from Hillary Clinton’s victory speech on Tuesday night, when she swept all five primaries. I’ve never had more faith in our future, and if we work together, if we go forward in this campaign, if we win in November, I know our future will be brighter tomorrow than yesterday. Thank you all so very much! So some people saw and heard, they heard a presidential candidate celebrating a huge night in which she took a huge step in winning the Democratic presidential nomination. But when others heard it many of whom were men, when they heard her speak, they called her ""a bit shrill, loud, hyper aggressive.” Some even said she ""lacked grace."" And then there was the admonition that Clinton should smile more, which many women found particularly insulting. When we come back, we're going to talk to the panel about whether male candidates would be subject to the same type of criticism. Welcome back, the panel is here to talk about 2016. Jose Diaz-Balart of Telemundo and NBC News, Molly Ball of The Atlantic, Joy-Ann Reid, MSNBC's national correspondent, and Robert Costa, political reporter for The Washington Post. I want to pick up on what I teased before. Molly, here's what Dana Milbank wrote, ""The criticism is the same as in 2008: She doesn’t connect. She isn't likeable. She doesn't inspire. She seems shrill ... This is the essence of Clinton's trouble: If she can't plausibly offer pie in the sky and she can't raise her voice, how does she inspire people? This hurts particularly with young voters, the same segment that shunned Clinton in 2008."" But in some ways, and this is a male writing this, but in some ways, that she's being graded on a different set of rules, and her style, that this holds her back. Fair? I think it's very difficult to parse what qualities are specific to Hillary Clinton and what qualities have to do with her gender. And, you know, I've looked into some of the political science research on this, which is really interesting. There's been this criticism, for example, that women are more subject to commentary on their appearance. The political scientists studied it and it's not true. Men and women get comments on their appearance at the same rate, and it doesn't hurt women to have their comments on their appearance or in news articles, for example. Women are actually viewed, a default woman, a neutral woman, a made-up woman in political science experiment, is viewed a little bit more trustworthy than a man, because they're seen as outsiders. They're not seen as being part of the system, and there's some sort of positive stereotyping about women. But look, we've never had a woman president. And so I think there's not a mold there. There's not a stereotype that you can fit Hillary Clinton into. And that makes it difficult. And I think particularly older women, Joy, see some of the criticism against Hillary Clinton and truly get offended. Look, here's Barbara Mikulski, she said the following: ""Many of we women feel that there's a double standard. What's being said about Hillary is what women have heard for centuries. You're too loud, you're too aggressive, you're too pushy. Why do you want the vote?"" Senator Feinstein: ""I think women go through a magnifying glass that men do not. Look at Trump. Trump, talk about braggadocio, talk about arrogance, talk about shouting, talk about demeaning, talk about insulting. It's all there."" Yeah. And I think out on the campaign trail, particularly when I was in the Midwest, where I actually finally heard a lot of people who sound like Hillary Clinton. Who have that same Midwestern twang. And I can tell you, you can almost pick them out, whether they like Hillary Clinton or not, particularly if they're women over the age of 60, this really bothers them. This sense that she's being judged differently, because they're also taking in their experiences at the office, where if you're a woman boss, you're judged as being something that rhymes with witch if you are a strong person, whereas a man can be strong. Women who feel undervalued themselves, in their own career path, so younger women who have not maybe experienced that in the workplace yet, and their experience is more in the collegiate world where they predominate, they don't necessarily respond to that argument. But I can tell you, women who have had some years in the workforce and who have dealt with these biases, they definitely feel incensed. You know, Jose, so does this mean any criticism of Hillary Clinton is going to be, is the Clinton campaign going to automatically go, I mean, Emily's List is stoking this right now, almost as a way they’re hoping to galvanize women. When was the last time that we heard a criticism of a man screaming too much? Yeah, well, I mean, and look what happened. I mean, that was just one moment in time. And I was just looking at Joy right now. Joy, you and I use our hands a lot more. I mean, that's a fact of life. I can't tell you how many times I've been told, you know, ""Latinos, you guys are a lot louder, you know, in a public setting."" And, you know, probably we are in a lot of ways. But I'm going to tell you something. I don't understand why Hillary Clinton has to be said she's screaming, she has to smile more. I don't hear men being asked that in the same way. Talking to top Republicans, there's a real fear when it comes to how Donald Trump may approach Secretary Clinton's delivery. They look at the Instagram video he put out this past week which featured Secretary Clinton barking as part of a joke on the campaign trail. And they worry, if you're Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania, you're Mark Kirk in Illinois, Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire, all these senators up in blue states, purple states, how is it going to help you when the party frontrunner is going after Secretary Clinton. Well, and then look at the most prominent woman, he attacks that's not named Hillary Clinton, Megyn Kelly. Right? Which, Molly, got Fox News to do something. When you ever see an unnamed statement from Fox News, you might as well say it's in the name of Roger Ailes, he attacked him in a way that I have never seen a news organization attack a presidential candidate. It was very striking. To accuse him of having a sick obsession. Which, you know, may be true. It's very bizarre, the feud between those two. And it's interesting that Trump keeps picking these fights with the most prominent organ of journalism on the right. I mean, but to your point about the general election and the gender politics there, I think to this point, Hillary Clinton has tried very hard to turn herself into a sort of feminist-identity politics candidate, right? She has really leaned into the woman thing this year, and it hasn't worked. I was just going to say, that hasn't worked, Joy, yet. Yeah, maybe it would. But if Trump is her opponent in the general election, that really turns the tables and that makes this gender politics really intense. Yeah. And Hillary Clinton I think very deliberately ran against the sort of feminist ideal in 2008 because she was trying to be a commander in chief and be credible on that scale. But this time, yeah, she's trying to lean into that part of it. And Donald Trump is a candidate who explicitly uses women's looks and appearance to attack them, the Rosie O'Donnell stuff, the stuff that he did even with Carly Fiorina. He uses this ideal of sort of a young, silent woman as the ideal. And he is stoking a certain base that wants that male, white male primacy back. And that is a core part of his message. Hillary Clinton is in an excellent position to counter that. Right, and it goes back to this Trump issue. And I think that that's, you know, that one ad that was run that hasn't had any money behind it, of women reading the things Trump has said about women-- Can you imagine if they put money behind that ad and ran it for two weeks? Yeah, it's devastating. Northern Virginia, we're going to see a lot, aren't we? Oh, you're going to see a lot of it. And that's the real concern for Republicans. How does Trump play in the suburbs of Northern Virginia, in the suburbs of Philadelphia, these swing areas where the Trump campaign believes they can really rouse the white working-class vote. But they still need to win the suburban voters who went for Mitt Romney. All right. I'm going to take a pause there. We're going to be back in a moment with our endgame segment and talk about something that hasn't happened in nearly 90 years. Not a contested convention, it's when Calvin Coolidge was in office. It's a visit to Cuba by the sitting president of the United States. And it's happening today. Endgame time and the panel is here, Jose, history being made. I have a feeling the Cuban people are going to be more excited about this trip in Cuba than necessarily the entire Cuban population in South Florida. But everybody's looking at this trip. I think it's an important trip, it's a historic trip, let's put a little context in it. The United States, when Castro took power in 1959 had 48 states. Hawaii and Alaska weren't states. Look at you. Oh, I love this. --when the Castro brothers took power. A lot of people in South Florida think that the Castro brothers as Kim Jong Il with a guayabera. The president going in there now, and he is going to be seen as someone by the Cuban people who can speak to them. Let's hope that he uses those words to inspire people. You know, it's interesting, Joy, I've been to Cuba. And Cuban people love America. They love America. They all want to come, all right? They love America, many of them not happy living under the regime they lived in. But the criticism of the President is, too soon for you to be going. Let the vice president go, let Secretary Kerry go. But until those guys release all those political prisoners, don't do it yet. Yeah, and I think there's going to be significant pressure on President Obama to meet with dissidents. There's already been sort of an edict from the Cuban government not to do so. But I think it's going to be really important that he do it. Boy, if he doesn't, I think it'll hurt. It'll be very difficult. And I think he's going to do the baseball game, and I think sports has been really a unifying, along with music, because I know that particularly in South Florida, there's been a lot of unity there. But yeah, I think that the president has to walk a line. The openness to the United States is there. There's been a great Bendixen Amandi Poll that showed that there is a tremendous openness on the island to us, right? But we cannot ignore the issue of dissidence and we cannot ignore the issue of oppression. You have to do both. And this is what's making, I think, the Cuban community in South Florida just anxious. I don't know how else to put it. Is that the fairest way to describe it? There hasn't been an election there since before 1959. People want to see change. Hopefully, there will be change and hopefully the president will help that. All right. Speaking of change, the Republican party is still hoping to change the trajectory of this race. Molly and Robert, you two cover this. The New York Times today claims it's a hundred-day campaign now to deny him. But you just heard, there is no strategy that they can unite around. Well, and this whole thing has been a Keystone-Cops operation from the start. I mean, if there were a Republican establishment that had its stuff together and really wanted to make sure Donald Trump didn't get the nomination, the time would have been six months ago. Instead, they've been running around like chickens with their heads cut off, going in different directions. Even now, this is not unified. And the chances of stopping him are very, very small. And as Donald Trump said, you know, he's gotten a lot of flak for saying, ""Oh, there'll be riots."" But I think it's true that you can't just say to his voters, this large so-far plurality of the Republican party that you don't count, and that we're not going to listen to you. Donald Trump doesn't go away if there's some kind of weird contested convention and they take it away from him. You know, Robert, the thing with all these anti-Trump strategies, none of them talk about how they're going to woo the Trump voter. Forget Trump, but the Trump voter. I hope they can eventually bring the party together on the convention floor. I spent Thursday staking out this anti-Trump meeting, and every person who left the Army Navy Club seemed depressed. The downbeat because they had a presentation about a possible third-party bid. And I realize logistically and financially, as much as they have all these different names they're considering, it's very difficult to do. And the other meeting that bothers them-- Monday at Jones Day, Trump's going to be meeting with some Republicans from Capitol Hill, some long-time party consultants. And there's a fear that as the more it moves closer to nomination, the more the party could rally behind him. It’s all Ted Cruz, yeah. --in your interviews today with Republicans, what you heard was a capitulation to the idea that Donald Trump can lead their party and lead this country. Other than Governor Kasich, there is a complete capitulation that you're seeing in terms of the Republicans. You’re talking relationship to Cruz, right? I mean, the relationship with Cruz has been so severed since the 2013 shutdown, that Cruz doesn't have the political capital he needs with the establishment to really get them to coalesce. Hey, let me close quickly with the Supreme Court. Do you think we'll get hearings? Does anybody here think we'll get hearings? I'm very dubious. But I think that those eight very vulnerable, swing-state Republican senators are going to be in a world of hurt, particularly during this recess. Do you think we'll get hearings though? I think we're going to get meetings, hearings hard to say, because no one wants to get those conservatives, they need the conservatives to come out in a general election. No way they're getting hearings. They're going to get some, I guess, meetings, but no way they're getting hearings. Yeah, Mitch McConnell's very determined. That is true. But Chuck Grassley, if a poll comes back and he's under 50 in his election. So you're saying that you could see him? I think there's more of a chance for hearings than you realize, but it's in the hands of the political-- uh, what-- the political standing of Chuck Grassley in the next six weeks. We'll see if these work. Anyway, great panel, great discussions. That's all we have for this week. We'll be back next week after more primaries. Because if it's Sunday, it's Meet the Press."		1

In the past two weeks, after receiving a...Barack Obama has decided to spend his retirement years planning a coup against his own government. In the past two weeks, after receiving an executive declaration issued by his own hand before Trump took office, Obama has built a $10 billion military that he calls a “security company.” That company, NOS United, is privately owned with nothing other than formalities filed with the US government.“NOS” stands for “Novus Ordo Seclorum,” or New World Order. The O has been replaced with a transformed version of Obama’s campaign slogan, with the American flag replaced by flames. There is also an all-seeing eye in the center. It’s pretty clear what the agenda is of this traitor we knew was an American-hating globalist all along:Along with two small islands due east of Virginia just in international waters, Obama’s “team” has now set up massive complexes with billions in equipment and spying technology outside of Washington DC, New York and Los Angeles. Chicago would have been a better choice for population than Washington but if your end game is to launch a military coup in the nation’s capital, those pieces must be deeply embedded in place.How embedded? Obama himself lives within the city limits. He conducts secret meetings with top-ranking officials from both parties and diplomats from around the world in a mansion that is a part of the old Washington tunnel system, built after the British trashed the city and burned down the White House in 1812.The extent of the tunnels is unknown since they remain the property of the US Government and require codeword clearance. There is no map available. Historians have pieced together several of the stops, however, and Tracey Place — along with just about every other building that houses a public official in DC — is on the list.This is no joke, patriots. If Obama’s military comes to your door in yellow Humvees with that emblem on them, they aren’t your friends. Get out of the house and don’t look back. At some point, their population reduction plan will go into effect and older Trump supporters will be the first ones buried in mass graves.SHARE:		1

Former President Obama’s unlawful action was intended to grant five million illegal aliens in the U.S. lawful-presence status and allow them to apply for work permits.In early 2015, Attorney General Paxton led a 26-state coalition lawsuit against the Obama administration that succeeded in putting DAPA on hold as the case worked its way through the courts.

Both Trump and Lewandowski denied her allegation. Lewandowski claimed the incident never happened and said he had never even met Fields.But the Jupiter Police Department released surveillance footage that appeared to directly contradict Lewandowski's claims.In the footage, Lewandowski can be seen grabbing Fields' arm. Lewandowski was at the Jupiter Police Department on Tuesday morning and was released with a notice to appear in court on May 4. Simple battery is considered a misdemeanor in Florida.Trump came to Lewandowski's defense in a Tweet sent Tuesday, saying the tapes showed there was ""nothing there.""Wow, Corey Lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2016Later Tuesday afternoon, Trump sent two tweets that alleged Fields grabbed him, and questioned whether he should press charges against Fields. Victory press conference was over.Why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions? Can I press charges? pic.twitter.com/qbW2RjkINX— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2016Why is this reporter touching me as I leave news conference? What is in her hand?? pic.twitter.com/HQB8dl0fhn— Donald J.

http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2017/apr/17/jeb-bush/does-school-competition-lift-all-boats-jeb-bush-sa/	"""When public schools face increased competition, they get better and kids learn more."" "	mostly false	['Education', 'Government regulation']	http://www.concordmonitor.com/	http://www.concordmonitor.com/Real-educational-choice-for-NH-families-9083552	2017/04/17	Jeb Bush: Let’s leave education decisions up to New Hampshire familiesBushThursday, April 06, 2017PrintSince our nation was founded, the “Live Free or Die’’ state has stood out for its embrace of individual liberty. This makes pending legislation that would set up Education Freedom Savings Accounts a natural fit for New Hampshire families.The first two words here are key: Education Freedom.The current, outdated model of public education is based on funding government bureaucracies that in turn make decisions best left to families, such as decisions on where kids will go to school and what classes they can take.The proposed accounts would instead fund students directly and let parents make those decisions. If for whatever reason a public school isn’t working for their child, they can find a better fit in another school. They also can access the funds for online classes, tutors and supplies. Or if they are the parents of a student with disabilities, they can use the funds for approved therapies critical to their child’s development.These accounts are an acknowledgement that parents, not government institutions, are the best decision makers for children. They love them the most, know them the best and are the ones most vested in their future success. And therefore, they should be given the freedom and resources to pursue the right education options for them.This legislation is not an attack on public schools. It simply is an acknowledgment that kids are unique individuals and one size does not fit all. Nor will this legislation hurt public schools. In fact, a large body of research, including that done in my home state of Florida, indicates quite the opposite. When public schools face increased competition, they get better and kids learn more. Education Freedom Savings Accounts not only would benefit the children whose parents take advantage of them, but also the children who remain in their traditional public schools.The approach was first introduced in Arizona in 2011, focused on the parents of students with disabilities. In subsequent years, the program was expanded to include students zoned in low-performing schools, the students of military personnel and students living on Native American lands. Based on their success, Arizona lawmakers are now considering making them available to every student.Other states have taken notice. Mississippi, Tennessee, Florida and Nevada all have approved versions of the program, each with its own eligibility requirements. In 2015, Nevada became the first state to make the accounts available to all parents. I encourage New Hampshire to follow suit.Empowering parents with the freedom to choose encourages positive change because the right to educate their children no longer can be taken for granted. It must be earned. I commend state Sen. John Reagan, state Reps. Joseph Pitre and Glenn Cordelli for introducing this legislation, and Gov. Chris Sununu, who has been a passionate advocate for school choice.The issue boils down to this: Do we trust mom and dad, or not?(Jeb Bush, a former governor of Florida, is founder, president and chairman of the board of directors of the Foundation for Excellence in Education.)Opinion/Columns		1
http://www.politifact.com/nevada/statements/2016/may/18/jeff-weaver/allegations-fraud-and-misconduct-nevada-democratic/	"Nevada Democratic Party leaders ""hijacked the process on the floor"" of the state convention ""ignoring the regular procedure and ramming through what they wanted to do."""	false	['Elections']	https://berniesanders.com/	https://berniesanders.com/press-release/statement-nevada/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter	2016/05/18	Email LinkFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. – U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday issued the following statement:“It is imperative that the Democratic leadership, both nationally and in the states, understand that the political world is changing and that millions of Americans are outraged at establishment politics and establishment economics. The people of this country want a government which represents all of us, not just the 1 percent, super PACs and wealthy campaign contributors.“The Democratic Party has a choice. It can open its doors and welcome into the party people who are prepared to fight for real economic and social change – people who are willing to take on Wall Street, corporate greed and a fossil fuel industry which is destroying this planet. Or the party can choose to maintain its status quo structure, remain dependent on big-money campaign contributions and be a party with limited participation and limited energy.“Within the last few days there have been a number of criticisms made against my campaign organization. Party leaders in Nevada, for example, claim that the Sanders campaign has a ‘penchant for violence.’ That is nonsense. Our campaign has held giant rallies all across this country, including in high-crime areas, and there have been zero reports of violence. Our campaign of course believes in non-violent change and it goes without saying that I condemn any and all forms of violence, including the personal harassment of individuals. But, when we speak of violence, I should add here that months ago, during the Nevada campaign, shots were fired into my campaign office in Nevada and apartment housing complex my campaign staff lived in was broken into and ransacked.“If the Democratic Party is to be successful in November, it is imperative that all state parties treat our campaign supporters with fairness and the respect that they have earned. I am happy to say that has been the case at state conventions in Maine, Alaska, Colorado and Hawaii where good discussions were held and democratic decisions were reached. Unfortunately, that was not the case at the Nevada convention. At that convention the Democratic leadership used its power to prevent a fair and transparent process from taking place. Among other things:The chair of the convention announced that the convention rules passed on voice vote, when the vote was a clear no-vote. At the very least, the Chair should have allowed for a headcount.The chair allowed its Credentials Committee to en mass rule that 64 delegates were ineligible without offering an opportunity for 58 of them to be heard. That decision enabled the Clinton campaign to end up with a 30-vote majority.The chair refused to acknowledge any motions made from the floor or allow votes on them.The chair refused to accept any petitions for amendments to the rules that were properly submitted.“These are on top of failures at the precinct and county conventions including trying to depose and then threaten with arrest the Clark County convention credentials chair because she was operating too fairly.”		0

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/11/rod-blum/iowa-gops-blum-gets-it-wrong-acha-effect-employer-/	"""If you’re getting your insurance through (your employer), nothing changes"" under Trumpcare."	half-true	['Health Care']	https://www.washingtonpost.com/	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/05/08/iowa-congressman-walks-out-of-a-tv-interview-and-into-an-angry-town-hall-meeting/?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_blum1210am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.709e2968e652	2017/05/11	DUBUQUE, Iowa — An Iowa congressman walked out of a television interview on Monday, declining to explain why his staff is prescreening constituents who plan to attend his town hall meetings this week. A few hours later, Rep. Rod Blum (R-Iowa) showed up at his town hall meeting where most of the prescreened audience screamed at him. It was a rough start to a recess week for Blum, a second-term lawmaker representing a swing district that voted narrowly for President Trump last year after supporting Barack Obama in 2012. Blum is a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus who initially declined to support the Republican plan to replace the Affordable Care Act but ultimately voted last week for the American Health Care Act. The way Blum struggled Monday night to explain his vote — through the loud boos of rowdy, impolite and infuriated constituents — is just a narrow sampling of the the growing concern and confusion caused by Republican plans to revamp the nation’s health-care system. But it indicates the difficult balancing act many Republican lawmakers from swing districts will need to strike as the complex debate continues in Washington. Blum said that the bill had been improved to his liking, but he agreed with constituents upset about the rush to pass it. He called the legislation “Trumpcare” several times during the town hall meeting, but in an interview with The Washington Post called it “Obamacare 2.0″ and admitted that the bill doesn’t repeal the current health-care law. “This isn’t a repeal and replace. This is Obamacare 2.0. We’ve probably changed 10, 20 percent of the bill is all,” he said in the interview. Footage of Blum’s combative television interview aired just before the town hall meeting started. The reporter, Josh Scheinblum, asked Blum about his decision to hold four town hall meetings this week across Iowa’s 1st Congressional District and why his staff was prescreening attendees to ensure they actually lived within the district’s boundaries. “Some would make the case that you represent all Iowans … shouldn’t all Iowans have a voice at the table or at least have the option to?” Scheinblum asked. “I don’t represent all Iowans — I represent the First District of Iowa,” Blum said. “Would you still take donations from a Republican in Iowa City?” Scheinblum asked. Blum smiled, stood up and removed his microphone. “This is ridiculous. This is ridiculous. He’s just going to sit here and badger me,” Blum said as he walked away. Scheinblum stayed seated, asking Blum to come and finish the interview. Blum headed for the door and waved him off. “Would I take donations?” Blum said. Blum raised more than $1.8 million during his 2016 reelection campaign. His top two donors were out-of-state entities: A PAC controlled by Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the House Freedom Caucus and the conservative Club for Growth. His next three most generous donors were Iowa-based companies, according to Federal Election Commission data reviewed by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. When a constituent later asked Blum whether he would decline to take out-of-district campaign donations if he’s barring out-of-district Iowans from attending his town halls, he demurred. “This is an official event as a congressman, this isn’t a political event — so when we’re talking about contributions coming from outside the district, that’s a political thing,” he told the crowd. That sparked a wave of boos. About 1,000 people showed up Monday night at Dubuque Senior High School to hear from Blum, 62, a former software executive who once coached high school basketball in the gymnasium where he spoke. His son, Taylor Blum, is honored on the walls of the gym for scoring 1,202 points as a member of the basketball team. With his wife and daughter in the audience, people in the prescreened crowd shouted at Blum throughout the evening, complaining that he started late, that he didn’t immediately start answering questions about health care and that he said that his district offices are open and eager to deal with constituent concerns. “You’re never there!” one woman shouted. Eight volunteers checked in constituents as they arrived, while staffers ushered them upstairs to the gym. At least four police officers — including the police chief — stood watch. Blum’s staff banned constituents from waving handwritten posters or campaign signs, so local Democrats distributed red and green sheets of paper. They instructed the audience to hold up the green sheet if they agreed with Blum; the red sheet if they disagreed. Asked about the TV interview, Blum said that he had agreed to be interviewed by KCRG-TV during a visit to the Dubuque Dream Center that assists lower-income, mostly African American children in the city. He added that the station also wanted to interview his wife, Karen, about being a congressional spouse. “Well, we get there and we were ambushed; they didn’t want to do anything on the Dream Center … that became apparent very quickly,” Blum said. “It was very apparent that he had an agenda. Blum defended his decision to hold four town hall meetings this week, noting that other GOP colleagues opt to hold “pop-up town halls” with little notice or small “coffee town halls” with just a handful of supporters. Anticipating detailed questions about the health-care bill, Blum had a copy of the legislation with him on stage plus charts and graphs explaining the changes. “This bill, Trumpcare — whatever you want to call it — is about the individual market only,” he said. “That’s 12,000 people in my district. Twelve thousand people in my district. “That’s not true! That’s not true!” people screamed from the bleachers, waving the red sheets. “If you’re getting your insurance through Medicare, nothing’s going to change. Nothing’s going to change,” Blum said. The crowd drowned him out as he finished his sentence. One woman complained that “You voted on this bill in a rush — there were no committee hearings. This pertains to my life. This is not democracy works and you know that. “We did hold hearings,” Blum told her. “I always said the process was bad. It was rushed. It was rushed and there should have been hearings. And we should have had an open amendment process, which we should have. And I was highly verbal about that. More red sheets. More boos. Dallas Knapp, 22, a local college senior, had asked Blum about his television interview. He was still shaking off the adrenaline after the event. Local Democrats “are getting more interested and engaged or there’s just people who otherwise weren’t paying attention that are now realizing how important a point in time this is for our politics,” he said. But another woman named Ruth, who declined to give her last name, said she had come to support Blum and was disgusted at the overwhelmingly Democratic crowd.		1

This morning at aceremony in Kabul, General David Petraeus formally took command ofinternational forces in Afghanistan, including 93,000 American troops. Petraeus acknowledged gains made by the Taliban, but assured hisaudience that the U.S. was in the nearly 9-year-old war to win. Joining me this morning from Kabul, Senator John McCain. He'sleading a congressional delegation to Afghanistan. Senator, thanks so much for joining us. MCCAIN: Thank you. Good to be with you. TAPPER: Senator, General Petraeus assumed command in AfghanistanPlaySenator John McCain on the War in Afghanistan, General Petraeusearlier today, and here's how he defined what he called a criticalmoment in this fight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETRAEUS: We're engaged in a contest of wills. Our enemies aredoing all that they can to undermine the confidence of the Afghanpeople. In so doing, they are killing and maiming innocent civilians ona daily basis. No tactic is beneath the insurgents. (END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: Senator, I think a lot of Americans are wondering why,after nine years of war, the Taliban has the momentum in this fight. MCCAIN: Well, I'm not sure that the Taliban have the momentum rightnow, Jake. The Taliban obviously are entrenched in places in parts of,actually, the outskirts of Kandahar. There's areas where they are stillin control. There has been some progress. It's been hard-fought andwith great sacrifice. But there's no doubt that we spent a lot of time, effort, Americanblood and treasure on Iraq. And now is the time for us to continue thismission and complete it successfully in Afghanistan. TAPPER: There are currently 93,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, plus43,000 NATO troops. You've said we need more troops because it'sunlikely that NATO will be able to fill its obligation, its pledge of10,000 additional troops. Should President Obama tell the Pentagon tosend even more U.S. troops than he has already ordered? MCCAIN: There will be an evaluation, an assessment made inDecember. I think at that time, we will have a much better idea as tohow the mission is -- is progressing and whether we need more troops andwhether our NATO allies have fulfilled their commitment. But what I worry about more than anything else is the -- the July of2011 firm date, which the president has not -- certainly has not beenpositive as far as our commitment is concerned. In other words, we needa conditions-based situation, not a date for withdrawal. A statement like, ""We're not going to turn out the lights in themiddle of 2011,"" is indecipherable and certainly sounds an uncertaintrumpet. So I'm more concerned about the perception of our friends andour enemies, as well as the people in Afghanistan, as to the depth ofour commitment. Our commitment must be: We will succeed, and then wewill withdraw. TAPPER: Let's talk about that uncertain trumpet that -- that youmentioned. What did the Bush trumpet sound like? There was anunlimited commitment of U.S. troops for an unlimited amount of timethere, and that didn't seem to be effective, and yet you're criticizingthis July 2011 deadline, which would be the beginning of a transitionperiod. What did the previous strategy trumpet sound like? MCCAIN: Well, the previous strategy was failing, and I said that itwas failing, and disagreed with our then-Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld,as well as the president. Then we initiated a surge with GeneralPetraeus in charge, and we succeeded. I just came from Baghdad. I went downtown with my two colleagues toa bakery and to a store. The success there is remarkable. There arestill problems, but the success in remarkable. But we didn't say that we were leaving until we had succeeded. I'mall for dates for withdrawal, but that's after the strategy succeeds,not before. That's a dramatic difference. And I can tell you for sure, our people in the region are not sureabout whether we are going to be here after the middle of 2011, whetherwe have succeeded or not. And it's clear that this strategy has notgone as well as we had hoped, so that right away brings into questionthe middle of 2011. TAPPER: General Petraeus was asked about this July 2011 deadline inhis Senate confirmation hearings this week. Here's what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETRAEUS: Let me be very clear, if I could, Senator. And not onlydid I say that I supported it, I said that I agreed with it. I saw thismost importantly as the message of urgency to complement the message ofenormous additional commitment. (END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: So General Petraeus said that he not only supports it, heagrees with it, that it's a message of urgency to the Afghangovernment. Is General Petraeus wrong? MCCAIN: General Petraeus has repeatedly said that it also has to becondition-based. In other words, it's the president that leads. Thepresident should state unequivocally that we will leave when we havesucceeded. And to somehow put that burden on General Petraeus is notappropriate. He is the military leader. But the fact is that, if you say that you are setting a date certainfor leaving as his key advisers have, including, I think, one on yourshow that said that we were -- that it is a, quote, ""firm date,"" hisspokesperson said it's, quote, ""etched in stone and he has the chisel,""and other statements by his civilian advisers have undermined the beliefthat we will have a conditions-based withdrawal. So I know enough about warfare. I know enough about what strategyand tactics are about. If you tell the enemy that you're leaving on adate certain, unequivocally, then that enemy will wait until you leave. TAPPER: Well, let's talk about the civilian leadership that -- thatyou just mentioned. You seem to have been critical of Ambassador KarlEikenberry and Special Representative Richard Holbrooke. Do you thinkEikenberry should be replaced? MCCAIN: I hope that -- that the ambassador and General Petraeus canwork together. I think that assessment needs to be made. Obviously,the past relationships have not worked out as well as -- as they shouldhave, but I think an assessment ought to be made as to all of thoserelationships, and we have to have the best team in place. The ideal team, of course, was Ryan Crocker and David Petraeus inIraq. Let's hope we can establish that same kind of relationship herein Afghanistan. TAPPER: Almost a year ago, in August 2009, you were on this programand you and George Stephanopoulos had this exchange about the progressyou said you were confident we would see in Afghanistan within 12 to 18months. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEPHANOPOULOS: You say 12 to 18 months. What do we need to see in12 to 18 months to make sure the public and the Congress stay behindthis war? MCCAIN: I think you need to see a reversal of these very alarmingand disturbing trends on attacks, casualties, areas of the country thatthe Taliban has increased control of. In other words, you need to seeall of those things reversed and on a significant downward slope, and Ithink we can do that. (END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: Senator, do you think that we're going to see a reversal ofthose trends in the next seven months? MCCAIN: Well, I hope so. And as I said then, that it -- it needsto happen. As I said earlier in response to your questions, it hasn'tgone as well as we had hoped. There has been some success, althoughit's been bought at great cost in Marjah and other places. And we needto succeed here. We cannot afford to lose. There will be catastrophiceffects in the region, as well as a return of the Taliban and Al Qaida. And the people of -- of Afghanistan do not want the Taliban back. So it -- I would remind you that the situation in Iraq, before westarted that surge, was far worse than the conditions here in Afghanistan. I'm a bit disappointed we haven't seen more progress, but I stillbelieve we can succeed. TAPPER: Senator, the chairman of the Republican National Committee,Michael Steele, was recorded in recent days privately telling Republicancandidates the following about Afghanistan. Quote, ""Keep in mind,again, federal candidates, this was a war of Obama's choosing. This isnot something the United States had actively prosecuted or wanted toengage in. If Obama is such a student of history, has he not understoodthat you know that's the one thing you don't do is engage in a land warin Afghanistan, all right, because everyone who has tried over 1,000years of history has failed,"" unquote. Republicans such as Congressman Tom Cole, William Kristol, LizCheney have -- have said that Michael Steele needs to resign because ofthose comments. Do you think a chairman of the Republican NationalCommittee can be effective if he thinks that the war in Afghanistan isunwinnable, as Steele seems to think? MCCAIN: I think those statements are wildly inaccurate, and there'sno excuse for them. Chairman Steele sent me an e-mail saying that hewas -- his remarks were misconstrued. Look, I'm a Ronald Reagan Republican. I believe we have to winhere. I believe in freedom. But the fact is that I think that Mr.Steele is going to have to assess as to whether he can still lead theRepublican Party as chairman of the Republican National Committee andmake an appropriate decision. TAPPER: Senator, just one last question on Afghanistan, and then Iwant to move on to Iraq. This week, a key House subcommittee blocked $4billion in non-military and non-humanitarian aid for Afghanistan becauseof concerns of rampant corruption in Afghanistan, including Karzaiallies having investigations into their behavior -- into theiractivities being blocked. General Petraeus met with Karzai yesterday,and Karzai called these concerns ""baseless."" Do you support blocking these funds until the U.S. is more confidentthe money is not being stolen? MCCAIN: I think we need to go ahead and spend the money, butcorruption is a problem here in Afghanistan, and it's a serious one, andit begins with the policemen on the beat, and that's why we're beginningto have our military police partner with the police in places likeKandahar. And there has to be a lot of work to be done. There has been some small progress, but a lot more has to be done,but I do not believe that it would -- we would succeed in motivating thegovernment to crack down on corruption if we cut off the funds. But Ialso acknowledge it's a serious problem. TAPPER: You were also in Iraq over the last few days where you metwith local officials. The inconclusive election there has increasedtensions and raised questions about President Obama's plan to end combatoperations at the end of August. Is that deadline still wise, given thelack of a government right now? MCCAIN: The deadline is still wise. And thanks to the securitysituation, it can be met. We will be withdrawing an additional 28,000troops between now and the end of August. We had an inconclusive election in the year 2000, as well, and ittook us some time to sort it out. I think maybe we could look at theglass being half-full in that it was a competitive election and one thatthere was wide participation, something that doesn't happen a lot inthis part of the world. TAPPER: I want to turn to... MCCAIN: And I think they'll work it out. TAPPER: I want to turn to some domestic issues, as long as I haveyou. President Obama delivered a speech on immigration reform thisweek. He mentioned you at one point. Here's part of that speech. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: Under the leadership of Senator Kennedy and Senator JohnMcCain, we worked across the aisle to help pass a bipartisan billthrough the Senate. And now, under the pressures of partisanship andelection year politics, many of the 11 Republican senators who voted forreform in the past have now backed away from their previous support. (END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: Senator, that's you he's talking about. Why have youbacked away from comprehensive immigration reform, which you spoke sopassionately about in 2006 and 2007? MCCAIN: First of all, let me -- and I -- I don't enjoy bringingthis up, but the fact is, then-Senator Obama supported amendments whichwould have gutted the proposal that we had before the United StatesSenate, which he said he would propose, an amendment that basicallygutted the temporary -- legal temporary worker program. But setting that aside, I invite the president to come -- Jon Kyland I invite the president to come to the Arizona-Sonora border. Theviolence is incredibly high. The human smuggling and drug cartels areat a level of violence where 25,000 -- 23,000 Mexican citizens have beenmurdered in the last few years, 5,000 already this year. There's alevel of violence which has increased to a significant degree, whichmakes the situation far different than it was in 2007. We have to secure our borders. When the -- when the -- when ourgovernment has to put up signs in the southern part of our state thatwarns people that they are in a human smuggling and drug smuggling areaand they have to be careful and are warned, then our border is notsecure and our citizens are not safe. We can get the border secure. Jon Kyl and I have a 10-point plan. We can get it secure, and then we can move on with comprehensiveimmigration reform. But I invite the president to come to the border, and he can see forhimself the absolute necessity of getting our border secure before moreviolence spills over onto our side of the border, as this existentialstruggle takes place between the Mexican government and the drug cartelsand the human smugglers, who are now working hand in glove. TAPPER: I only have a couple more questions, Senator. I know yourtime is valuable. Just to follow up on that, in 2007, you were quotedas follows by Vanity Fair. ""McCain had been asked how debate over theimmigration bill was playing politically. 'In the short term, itprobably galvanizes our base,' he said, 'In the long term, if youalienate the Hispanics, you'll pay a heavy price.' Then he added,unable to help himself, 'By the way, I think the fence is leasteffective, but I'll build the goddamned fence if they want it.'""You've long been critical of then-Senator Obama for pandering tounions during the 2007 immigration reform debate. You just talked aboutit a second ago. And -- and you're right. He did vote for amendmentsthat threatened to unravel the coalition. But how is what you're doing now any different, except you'repandering to the other side? MCCAIN: Because, as I said before, the level of violence on theborder, the human smuggling, the fact that Phoenix, Arizona, is thenumber-two kidnapping capital of the world, according to media reports,the fact that a recent -- a ring recently was broken up that broughtpeople across our border to Phoenix, Arizona, where people were -- drugswere distributed all over the country, as well as people, means that thesituation has changed dramatically. That's why I asked the president to come to the border. It is notthe same as it was in 2007. And the people deserve not to have ourranchers murdered, not to have a deputy shot by a drug smuggler with anAK-47 in Pinal County. The situation has dramatically changed, and thestatistics absolutely back that up. TAPPER: All right. Finally, Senator, Senator Republican LeaderMitch McConnell just announced in the last few days that he will voteagainst Elena Kagan's Supreme Court nomination, if her nomination doesget to the floor of the Senate. Have you made a decision about how youwill vote? MCCAIN: Not quite, but I intend to decide this coming week, Jake. TAPPER: All right. Senator John McCain, thanks so much. Safetravels, and thanks for joining us. TAPPER: And we're joined now by our roundtable. First off, formerspokesman for Bush in Iraq and a current member of the Council onForeign Relations, Dan Senor, his book, ""Start-Up Nation: The Story ofIsrael's Economic Miracle."" Also, from Univision, Jorge Ramos, his book -- I feel like Oprah --""A Country for All: An Immigrant Manifesto."" Hopefully, I'll have someOprah effect on you guys. From the New York Times, Paul Krugman. From Bloomberg, Al Hunt. And from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Cynthia Tucker. Bring yourbooks next time. I'll see if I can work my magic. Now, Dan, I'll start with you. Senator McCain seemed to stop justshort of calling for Steele's resignation. What do you think? SENOR: Well, Chairman Steele has been furiously working the phonesthis weekend to try to explain that, at worse, this was a gaffe, atbest, what he said was taken out of context. I think it's important to take a step back and recognize -- hishistorical inaccuracies notwithstanding -- got some basic facts wrong --he did articulate a real point of view. I mean, it's a real point ofview out there by those who are opposed to the war in Afghanistan, thatas he said, for centuries, people have tried to succeed in Afghanistan. Land wars never work in Afghanistan, which was a direct criticism of theMcChrystal-Petraeus counterinsurgency strategy. And it's fine. He's entitled to that point of view. It justhappens to be the point of view of organizations like MoveOn.org, andyou see that point of view articulated on liberal blogs. It's the viewof many of the Democratic members of Congress who voted for a timelinethis past week. So it's one thing for him personally to have that point of view, butfor the chairman of the party to articulate that point of view, toadvance that point of view is indefensible. And I would also say, what we've seen over the last couple weeks isa very sensitive and raw moment as it relates to Afghanistan. And ithas been admirable how serious our leaders, military and civilian, havestepped up. I mean, McChrystal stepping down the way he did, Petraeus steppingin, taking a demotion from his Central Command position to step in,President Obama acting swiftly and recommitting to Afghanistan when hewould have had an inflection point to change policy if he wanted to, allof these people have been acting incredibly seriously. And what's striking about Steele is how fundamentally unserious he-- giving political counsel, how to frame this debate in a politicalcontext for candidates, I think is -- is actually offensive. TAPPER: And you think he should step down? SENOR: There's no -- I mean, I don't think the Republican Party canseriously engage in foreign policy with credibility if its chairman isengaging in this kind of rhetoric. TAPPER: Jorge? RAMOS: Because it's something so fundamental. It's like if 9/11never happened. I mean, that's -- that's -- that's the point. But now, going beyond Steele's comment, what's so interesting isthat I think there's a contradiction in Afghanistan right now. On onehand, how can you be completely fully committed to a war and at the sametime say that you're going to be leaving and setting a deadline? I think many Americans and politicians would be hard-pressed rightnow to -- to know exactly and to explain, what are we doing inAfghanistan? I know obviously we invaded Afghanistan after 9/11. Obviously, we didn't want the Taliban to be supporting Al Qaida andother terrorist groups. But at the same time, what are we doing right now in Afghanistan? Idon't think that's very clear, and I think that's -- that's clearlysetting up other questions. TAPPER: Paul, the spokesman for the Democratic National Committee,Brad Woodhouse, made a comment that aroused the ire of some liberalbloggers. Woodhouse said about Steele's comments, ""The American peoplewill be interested to hear that the leader of the Republican Partythinks recent events related to the war are comical and that he'sbetting against our troops and rooting for failure in Afghanistan. It'ssimply unconscionable that Michael Steele would undermine the morale ofour troops when what they need is our support and encouragement."" Liberal writers such as Greg Sargent at the Washington Post, GlennGreenwald at Salon have -- have criticized that, saying that the DNC isusing Karl Rove-like tactics. KRUGMAN: Yes, and this was wrong. I mean, there's anunderstandable frustration among Democrats with the hypocrisy, right? All during the Bush years, any criticism of Bush's war policy wasunpatriotic, and now the Republicans are happy to criticize the warpolicy of -- of President Obama. But the way you -- you deal with that is by condemning thehypocrisy, not by turning into the Bush people, not by going back toit. So this was a -- this was a bad misstep. It was a cheap shot, whenwhat you really needed was to talk about it seriously. TAPPER: Al, I wonder if Chairman Steele is an outlier or if he isgiving voice to a concern that a lot of Republicans legitimately feelabout this war, which is now America's longest war? HUNT: Yes, Jake, I think that's a good question. First of all, Ithink Michael Steele -- I wonder if he's a Democratic mole. If he hadto resign every time he said something silly, he'd be gone about 15times by now. But I do think there's a larger point here, and that is that asenior member of the House told me, if there had been a private vote onthat supplemental bill for Afghan funding, it would have lost by adecisive majority. Many Democrats and more Republicans than you think-- there's tremendous anxiety. Nobody thinks this war is going wellright now. No one sees the light, if you will, at the end of the tunnel. So I think even though Michael Steele is not a very good or veryarticulate or very credible spokesman for much, if anything, I do thinkthat those reflected that -- that anxiety. TAPPER: Cynthia, you once called -- and let me underline -- youonce called Michael Steele an affirmative action hire gone bad. What'syour take on this? TUCKER: Well, Michael Steele is a self-aggrandizing gaffe-proneincompetent who would have been fired a long time ago were he notblack. Of course, the irony is that he never would have been voted inas chairman of the Republican Party were he not black. Let's remember how the party wound up with Michael Steele. InNovember 2008, the party was devastated that the Democrats had electedthe nation's first black president, while the Republican Party was stuckwith being seen as largely the party of aging white people, with goodreason, a party that was hostile to people of color, especially blacksand Latinos. So the party needed a new face, preferably a face of color, and theydidn't have very many officials to choose from, so they came up withMichael Steele. And it is very ironic, since the Republicans have beenso critical of affirmative action, to watch them stuck with theiraffirmative action hire that they dare not get rid of, because thatwould generate even more controversy. TAPPER: All right. Dan... SENOR: And I just want to come back to something Al said. I mean,you may be right that behind closed doors many Republicans have greatapprehension about Afghanistan. What is, I think, admirable is thatdespite they have that -- despite that they have that apprehension anddespite there -- that there is political liability in sticking with thiswar for many of these members of Congress, that they're still standingwith President Obama and trying to unite the country, actually, behindhis war strategy. That's admirable. And -- and the reason Steele should resign is because he has nobusiness as being the chairman of the party taking on a position thatactually in direct contradiction to that. HUNT: Well, that's one way to look at it. The other way to look atit is, it's Obama's war, so if it goes badly, those Republicans aregoing to get stuck with it. I think -- I think a lot of it has to dowith that kind of calculation, Dan. I don't -- I don't think a lot ofthem are doing it in order to help Barack Obama. SENOR: No, they're not doing it to help Barack Obama. I thinkthey're doing it to -- because they support the war strategy, theysupport our engagement in Afghanistan, they support our troops, and Ithink the country should be united. This is a long -- I mean, this idea of opposition political partiestrying to hang a war on the president in power goes way back. Tom DeLayfamously called the Balkans war Clinton's war. You can -- Grenada wasReagan's war. Panama was Bush, Sr.'s, war. I mean, this goes way back,opposition parties sort of capitalizing on a neo-isolationist politics. This is unique. This is -- this is an extremely sensitive moment ona war that people are tiring of. And Republicans, despite their fiercecriticism of the Obama agenda on a range of other fronts, are actuallystanding with the president on this. And for the chairman of the partyto be -- to be turning that upside down, I think, is -- is dangerous. TAPPER: And just before we go to break, I want to underline thatwhat -- we're unanimous in Steele's assertion that this was a war ofObama's choosing is just crazy talk. SENOR: It's actually factually incorrect. TUCKER: Absolutely. TAPPER: It couldn't be wrong -- it couldn't -- it's wrong in about15 ways. SENOR: Right. Right. TAPPER: All right, but we'll be back with more of the roundtable. Friday's dismal jobs report, is the jobless recovery turning into adouble-dip recession? What will that mean for the midterms? Plus,immigration reform and the Elena Kagan hearings. And later, the Sundayfunnies. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LETTERMAN: Yes, Russian spies tried to blend in. They were actinglike Americans. As a matter of fact, for two weeks, they werepretending they loved soccer. (LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KOHL: What issues motivate you the most? And what excites youabout the job? KAGAN: It's an opportunity to serve this country in a way that, youknow, fits with whatever talents I might have. KOHL: What are the things you feel most passionate about? How areyou going to make a difference as a Supreme Court justice? KAGAN: What motivates me primarily is the opportunity to safeguardthe rule of law. KOHL: I'm sure you're a woman of passion. Where are your passions? (END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: Well, 15 years ago, Elena Kagan criticized Supreme Courtconfirmation hearings as a ""vapid and hollow charade,"" and there you go. Joining us to discuss that and other topics, from the Council onForeign Relations, Dan Senor; from Univision, Jorge Ramos; from the NewYork Times, Paul Krugman; from Bloomberg, Al Hunt; and from the AtlantaJournal-Constitution, Cynthia Tucker. Let's start with more bad news on the economic front. Let me put upsome numbers here. In June, we found out 125,000 jobs were lost, only83,000 private-sector jobs were created, and we also heard that in Maypending home sales were down 30 percent. Paul, have we made any headway in the last six or seven months? KRUGMAN: On the things that matter, no. Basically, we're -- we'reholding. The fraction of the adult population that's employed isbasically flat, which is saying that we're -- you know, we're not --things are not getting worse, but they're not getting better, and we'rein a bad place. So, no, this is not good. TAPPER: And you think we should do what? What do we need to do? KRUGMAN: More stimulus. I mean, we -- we had -- you know, rightfrom the beginning -- you know, luckily, some of us have a trackrecord. Right from the beginning, January-February of 2009, looking atthe scale of the crisis, we said this program -- although it sounds likea lot of money, $700 billion or $800 billion, is actually not enough,that you need something bigger. But for a variety of reasons, we didn't get a program that wasbigger, and we got a program also that starts to fade out just aboutnow, middle of 2010, by which time, you know, the assumption was that --that we'd have a self-sustaining recovery underway, but we don't, whichwas always a serious risk. So, no, this is -- this is a pretty grim situation. We reallyshould be going in for another stimulus program which has a chance forapproximately minus 5 percent of getting through Congress right now. TAPPER: Are we facing a double-dip recession? KRUGMAN: You know, our terminology is not helping us right now. Suppose that the economy grows at 1 percent for the rest of the year ornext year-and-a-half and the unemployment rate rises to 10.3 percent. Probably that won't be considered a recession, because GDP is growing. We're producing more stuff, but we're actually losing ground on thejobs front, so that's the most likely -- you know, I'm not sure it'll be-- unemployment will go that high, but the most likely thing issomething where it isn't formally a recession, GDP isn't shrinking, butthe job market is losing ground, certainly not gaining ground. It'llfeel like a double dip, whatever the recession data say it is. TAPPER: Cynthia, is it even possible to pass another stimulus inthis Congress? I mean, we can't even get passed unemployment insuranceextensions or $50 billion in emergency spending for cities and states. Do you think Congress can pass a stimulus? TUCKER: Jake, I think it is absolutely crazy that the Senate hasrefused to extend unemployment benefits. If they won't do that, it'spretty clear that they won't pass the robust kind of stimulus or jobs bill. I think it's bad news for the Democrats to call it stimulus, becausethat has -- as a brand, that doesn't go over very well with the public. But the jobs bill has gotten smaller and smaller and smaller, and eventhat seems to have very little chance of passing. And it's mysterious why the Democrats are responding in this way. It's no mystery about the Republicans. They don't care if the -- inNovember, for the midterms, the -- the Democrats are facing a reallylousy economy. They figure that voters will take that out on the Democrats. But it's more a mystery why Democrats are responding this way. Theyseem to be frightened of the voters and believe that voters areabsolutely furious about the deficit. But, in fact, that doesn't showup in polls. The vast majority of polls show Americans are more concerned aboutjobs. That's the number-one issue. Concern over the deficit isrising. But in most polls, voters rank concern about jobs over concernabout the deficit. TAPPER: Dan? SENOR: Yes, I would say there -- there's a big question going on inCongress and across the country. Where does this end? I mean, what youand Paul are arguing for is not a -- a difference in strategy. You'rearguing for a difference in degree, amount of spending. The strategy isthe right strategy, is what you're basically saying, the administrationstrategy. Now, there are two models that people are talking about, you hearmembers of Congress talking about. One is Greece. In 2012, the amountof debt that the U.S. government will accumulate will be bigger than oureconomy produces. That looks a lot like Greece or Japan, which hassomething like 200 percent of debt to GDP. I mean, if you look at just the interest payments alone that theJapanese government pays, it accounts for 25 percent -- the interest onits own debt, 25 percent of its national budget. Now, its interestpayment is 1 percent. KRUGMAN: That is not right. We can't do this, Dan, right now, butthat number is not... SENOR: I will -- I will happily provide it for you. KRUGMAN: That's -- that's just not right. SENOR: But the point is, is that... TAPPER: We'll bring in PolitiFact on that one. SENOR: Exactly. You begin to get in a situation where the interestpayments on the debt become unsustainable, the debt becomesunsustainable, and there's a lot of uncertainty. There's uncertaintynow about the Bush -- the expiration of the Bush tax cuts, the impactthat'll have on the economy, the impact on health care, the Obamacarespending, what impact that will have, possible cap and trade. Andpeople are just sitting on the sidelines saying, ""Where does this end?"" RAMOS: But the debate, I think -- the debate is right there. Imean, do we -- do we really need the government right now just moreintervention, more stimulus, or are we going to go just to -- to cut thedeficit? I think we -- we need both, but at this point, in order tojust to have a recovery summer, as Vice President Biden promised, weneed -- we need -- we need more government intervention. KRUGMAN: The economics is really clear. You need to commit todoing something about the deficit once the economy has recovered. Butcutting right now is -- doesn't even do very much for your budgetposition, because it makes the economy weaker, it means less revenues. It's really going to hurt. The -- the arithmetic of budget cuts now isjust terrible. And, you know, you have to have some sense of scale here, right? We're looking at a -- a U.S. government that 10 years from now willprobably owe something like $20 trillion. Whether we borrow another$500 billion now is not going to make a big difference in thatposition. It's really trivial. But it can make a huge difference tothe fate of the -- you know, the 15 million people who are unemployed inthe United States right now. The idea -- people using these long-run budget concerns as a way toargue against helping unemployed, when the average duration ofunemployment now is about 35 weeks, that is -- that -- I don't think --I don't think -- for most of the people making this argument, I don'tthink it's sincere. They're just using the occasion. TAPPER: Al, walk us -- walk us through the politics here. Whycan't they pass unemployment extensions or this emergency spending onCapitol Hill, if Democrats control both the House and the Senate? HUNT: Well, because they need 60 votes in the Senate, and theydon't have 60 votes. I think they will pass that ultimately. They'lldo little things. They won't do the sort of stimulus that Paul istalking about. I think the fundamental problem here, Jake, and -- and, Dan, I thinkwhat you're talking about is 5, 7, 10 years out, not right now. Wecan't walk and -- and chew gum at the same time. We ought to be dealingwith long-term deficits in the long term and short-term stimulus, whichthis incredibly sluggish economy needs right now. The politics just are lousy, though, Jake. The -- I don't know ifit's the Republicans, if it's conservative Democrats, but the -- but theside that talks about the need to rein in the federal government, thisis -- this is not very rational -- has really -- is winning that debate. And when you talk to people about the stimulus, Paul may be right. There should have been a bigger stimulus. Barack Obama thinks thereshould have been a bigger stimulus. The reason there wasn't, becauseyou couldn't get it through, even -- even a year ago. I mean, you know,meet Ben Nelson. But -- but -- but... TAPPER: Or Susan Collins or Olympia Snowe or Arlen Specter. HUNT: But -- but -- but right now, that -- that -- that argumentthat we have to rein in -- because the stimulus didn't work, well, Ithink most economists would say the stimulus did work... (UNKNOWN): It did work. HUNT: ... in the sense it would have been a lot worse if therehadn't been one. But when people talk about the stimulus, theyassociate it with bank bailouts and auto bailouts, which had nothing todo with the stimulus. TAPPER: Let me bring -- let me bring this out, because we -- I hadthis made. This is something that -- in February, the Obamaadministration was very excited. They brought out this icon, whichshows all the jobs being lost, and then the stimulus passes, and how joblosses and now job gains happen. Now we have this. I think I'm doing this correctly. And, Paul,where -- where are we going from here? And how much does this reallybad bar graph impact the stimulus politics? KRUGMAN: Well, I mean, now, we know that that's -- last -- lastmonth, the previous month wasn't as good as it looks and the currentmonth isn't as bad as it looks... TAPPER: Because of the census. KRUGMAN: ... because of census jobs. So it's -- so what's actuallyhappening is the private sector is continuing to add jobs, but slow, notenough to make a dent in the unemployment. Yes, it -- this has been always the -- the track for stimulus. Ifyou -- if you do a half-measure, which is what we did, in the face ofthis incredibly negative shock to the economy, the worst financial shocksince the 1930s, then the odds were even -- in -- in advance, the oddswere pretty good that you were going to end up with a situation wherethings were actually not all that good, even after the stimulus had goneinto effect. And then the argument -- the counterfactual that says, well, theywould be much worse if we hadn't done this, although true, doesn't cutvery much politically. Plus, there's this worldwide panic. I mean, it's not just theUnited States. Everyone out there has been saying, oh, you know, we'vegot to move, because even though the arithmetic says that what we spendon stimulus now isn't really going to matter very much, the bond marketswill turn on us. And this is -- I've been calling it the attack of the invisible bondvigilantes, because everybody is afraid that the bond market is going toturn on us, and they -- they're doing that, even though the actual factis that the bond markets are signaling a willingness to lend the U.S. government lots of money at very low interest rates, because they seethe U.S. government as the only safe thing out there. RAMOS: (inaudible) recovery without -- without jobs. I mean, wehave created -- the private sector created 83,000 jobs. And just tokeep pace with the new workers, we need 130,000 per month. So -- so weare in a really bad situation. But are we going to be cutting deficits right now? I mean, is that-- is that the way to go? KRUGMAN: I'm simply... RAMOS: We -- we can go -- I'm sorry -- we can go the way of Greeceor -- or I don't know if you've seen the (inaudible) coming from PuertoRico, but they've been cutting the deficit, and then we have thisviolent repression of the police against students and demonstrators. (CROSSTALK)KRUGMAN: ... the countries -- the countries that actually have gonethe fiscal austerity route... TAPPER: Germany and Greece. KRUGMAN: Well, Germany is only saying they're going to do it. Theyhaven't done it yet. Greece is a -- Greece is a special case, becausethey really were massively irresponsible, you know, mega times (ph). But look at Ireland, which has been a good soldier in this crisis,has done everything it was supposed to, savage cuts. Their deficit hashardly gone down, because their economy has shrunk so much that therevenues have collapsed. They have mass unemployment. It's -- it's --it's a mess. And the -- and the markets aren't even rewarding them. They're -- you know, the -- the cost of insuring against an Irishdefault has gone up, not down, after the austerity. So there's this --you know, while we actually have some evidence of -- of how this works,and it works terribly. TAPPER: Cynthia? TUCKER: Well, I think that President Obama deserves some of theblame for the politics on this, not the policy. He does want morestimulus, and that's absolutely the right approach, I think. But thepublic is clearly confused about the difference between short-termdeficits and long-term deficits. The -- our problem will become enormous in about 2015 or 2020, butthe very worst way to go about cutting the deficits is to let peoplestay unemployed. If they're jobless, they can't pay taxes. If theycan't pay taxes, the deficit gets worse. And I think that the president could have done a much better job ofexplaining that. I think he still could, but he sent mixed messages. He has a deficit reduction commission. He's talked about cutting orfreezing federal agencies. And people get confused by that, and theythink that problems are immediate. SENOR: He didn't send a mixed message. He actually was veryclear. If the Congress didn't pass the stimulus, unemployment wouldrise about 8 percent. If they passed the stimulus, it would stay below8 percent. His problem is being held accountable to what he said wouldoccur if his bill -- if his stimulus package was passed. And now he's saying, well, it could have been this -- unemploymentcould have been 13 percent, 14 percent or 15 percent, what he said inWisconsin last week. The reality is, you may be right that the crushingeffects of the debt burden won't be felt for some time, but it is havingan effect on investors and lenders and employers today. People know this -- this debt and deficit burden is unsustainablewithout major tax increases in the future. Major tax increases and theuncertainty that's associated with them makes it very hard for theprivate-sector economy to engage. And that's who's on the sidelinesright now. KRUGMAN: I just want to say, that's a -- there is not a hint ofwhat you're saying in the data, not a hint that the debt burden iswhat's discouraging -- businesses aren't investing because they havemassive excess capacity. But let -- let me say, on the politics, there's an interestingcontrast between Obama 18 months in and Ronald Reagan 18 months in. Eighteen months into the Reagan administration, things were terrible. The bottom was falling out of the economy. The unemployment rate hadrisen much more drastically. And in Reagan's case, it was a recessionthat started on his watch, as opposed to -- to the Obama case. Reagan was absolutely, completely defending his philosophy, didn't-- gave no ground whatsoever in his public statements, in his speechesduring 1982. Obama's been trimming the whole way, saying, oh, yes,well, we'll going to -- we're going to freeze discretionary spending... TAPPER: And non-security discretionary. (CROSSTALK)KRUGMAN: ... went on FOX News to say, you know, if we don't balancethe budget, we'll have a double-dip recession, which had all of his --his own economists going, ""Oh, my god. What did he say?"" So he -- hehas been giving mixed messages. His -- his urge to split the difference between the sides, even whenone side is actually certainly, from his own point of view, totallywrong, has certainly hindered. Would it have made a difference if hewas stronger? I don't know. But he's certainly not been strong... (CROSSTALK)TAPPER: I want to -- I want to change topics. I'm sorry. We onlyhave a few minutes, and President Obama this week did something elsesignificant, which he gave his first speech on immigration reform. Jorge, I want to use some tape from an interview you did withthen-Senator Obama in 2008. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: I cannot guarantee that it's going to be in the first 100days. But what I can -- what I can... RAMOS: The first month? OBAMA: ... what I guarantee is, is that we will have in the firstyear an immigration bill that I strongly support and that I'm promotingand that I want to move that forward as quickly as possible. RAMOS: In the first year? OBAMA: In my first year. (END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: So that's known in the Hispanic community as Obama'spromise. Did -- did he keep it? RAMOS: La promesa de Obama, no. President Barack Obama, he brokehis promise. It's -- it's that simple. We were -- we've been waiting for 18 months for change. We haven'tseen change. Not only that, President Barack Obama has deported morepeople in his first year in office than George W. Bush in his last yearin office. And the speech last Thursday I think was a good speech, even a greatspeech at some point, but we needed action. He could have stoppeddeportations for students. He could have stopped deportations for theparents of U.S. citizens. He could have called for a bipartisan meetingat the White House. He could have been much more specific on animmigration bill, and -- and he wasn't. Now, let's -- let's be clear. I mean, he doesn't have the 60 votesin the Senate right now. So there's really nothing he -- he can do. But I wish he could have moved earlier, I mean, when he had the 60votes in -- in the Senate. And the consequences politically are huge. He -- the Hispanic community is -- is really disillusioned, is veryfrustrated. Sixty-nine percent of the Latinos supported PresidentBarack Obama last January, and now it's only 57 percent. TAPPER: In the latest Gallup poll. RAMOS: In the latest Gallup poll. So -- so -- so something is --is -- is (inaudible) he promised change, and change is not here. TAPPER: Al, why is President Obama bringing this issue up now? HUNT: To frame it for November, because -- and to at least addresspart of what Jorge said, that I care, that this is an issue that mattersto me. Look, his docket was full. I -- I have some sympathy for him. I mean, if he was going to do immigration, he has to either -- eithergive up on health care -- I mean... RAMOS: No, he (inaudible) his promise. Nobody forced him to promise. HUNT: No -- no -- no question. RAMOS: He got 67 percent of the Hispanic vote. HUNT: I just don't think the politics are there to load the docketswill all that. And I think now it's being brought up not becausethere's any legislative chance -- there is none -- but it is to framethe debate for the November elections. And I think the -- Obama hopesthat this will energize and get back some of that 12 percent that he'slost among Hispanic voters. The Republicans are counting on the angerof people out there. I must say, John McCain, in his interview with you, Jake, that wasextraordinary to say that crime is up there. He's talking aboutMexico. Crime is down in Arizona. Every single academic study that'sbeen done shows that immigrants commit fewer crimes. RAMOS: That's right. HUNT: We have a system where there are now three-and-a-half-foldmore illegal immigrants than there were 20 years ago. It's a systemthat's broke. And for John McCain to say that there's been a dramaticchange just simply is not the case. TAPPER: Dan, Republicans say that the president is bringing this upfor cynical reasons, to drum up Hispanic voters. SENOR: Right. Well, if he were serious about immigration reform,he would provide some real specifics, a real plan. He didn't do thatthe other day. It was just sort of platitudinal. And -- and particularly against the backdrop of what Senator McCainsaid and others have said, President Obama absolutely played politicswith this issue in 2007 when he was facing a Democratic primary. AndJohn McCain and Ted Kennedy worked out a deal to keep out all theseamendments that could have destroyed the entire McCain-Kennedy package,amendments from the Democrat -- extreme Democrats and extremeRepublicans, and Obama effectively, you know, contributed in blowing --contributed to blowing that up. And so for him now to be lecturing Republicans about not playingpolitics for this issue -- with this issue -- they view it as a littledisingenuous. The reality is -- let me -- the reality is, the bestthing for Barack Obama's chances for success on immigration reform isthe Republicans actually winning majority in Congress. He will lead that... (CROSSTALK)(UNKNOWN): ... never get it done. (UNKNOWN): The Democrats will never pass a bill. HUNT: Dan, you're very smart. You could not be more wrong. TheRepublican Party has been taken over by the nativists, by theanti-immigrant. TUCKER: Absolutely. HUNT: You cannot -- Mitt Romney did a 180 because you cannot lookat John McCain today, the politics, they are nativist. And that's... (CROSSTALK)SENOR: ... majority of Democrats... (CROSSTALK)HUNT: ... Lindsey Graham -- Lindsey Graham is an ally. I'm notdefending the Democrats... (CROSSTALK)TAPPER: Hold on one second. We only got a minute left. Paul, thenCynthia. (CROSSTALK)KRUGMAN: The -- the Republican Party for these past 30 years hasbeen kind of a coalition between a cultural right, which is alsobasically anti-immigrant, and an economic right, which is kind offavorable to immigration reform. What's happened in the last year isthat the cultural right has taken over. The economic right no longercalls the shots. And that's why we can't get immigration legislation. TAPPER: Cynthia, quickly? TUCKER: I was going to say the same thing, that actually this fellapart among Republicans in 2007 with -- those 11 Republican senatorsstepped away from the deal they had previously supported, and thepolitics are even worse now than they were then. (CROSSTALK)RAMOS: I mean, it's incredible that the most powerful country inthe world is prosecuting 11 million people. SENOR: We have a test case on what you're saying, right? It's veryeasy to say that the politics of -- cultural conservative politics havegone native. TAPPER: Dan... (CROSSTALK)SENOR: In California, you had a gubernatorial primary, Meg Whitman... TAPPER: This is going to continue in the green room. (CROSSTALK)TAPPER: I'm sorry. We're going to talk more about that in thegreen room. The roundtable will continue there on abcnews.com, or lateryou can also find our fact checks courtesy of PolitiFact. TAPPER: Good morning, and happy Fourth of July. This morning at aceremony in Kabul, General David Petraeus formally took command ofinternational forces in Afghanistan, including 93,000 American troops. Petraeus acknowledged gains made by the Taliban, but assured hisaudience that the U.S. was in the nearly 9-year-old war to win. Joining me this morning from Kabul, Senator John McCain. He'sleading a congressional delegation to Afghanistan. Senator, thanks so much for joining us. MCCAIN: Thank you. Good to be with you. PETRAEUS: We're engaged in a contest of wills. Our enemies aredoing all that they can to undermine the confidence of the Afghanpeople. In so doing, they are killing and maiming innocent civilians ona daily basis. No tactic is beneath the insurgents. TAPPER: Senator, I think a lot of Americans are wondering why,after nine years of war, the Taliban has the momentum in this fight. MCCAIN: Well, I'm not sure that the Taliban have the momentum rightnow, Jake. The Taliban obviously are entrenched in places in parts of,actually, the outskirts of Kandahar. There's areas where they are stillin control. There has been some progress. It's been hard-fought andwith great sacrifice. But there's no doubt that we spent a lot of time, effort, Americanblood and treasure on Iraq. And now is the time for us to continue thismission and complete it successfully in Afghanistan. TAPPER: There are currently 93,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, plus43,000 NATO troops. You've said we need more troops because it'sunlikely that NATO will be able to fill its obligation, its pledge of10,000 additional troops. Should President Obama tell the Pentagon tosend even more U.S. troops than he has already ordered? MCCAIN: There will be an evaluation, an assessment made inDecember. I think at that time, we will have a much better idea as tohow the mission is -- is progressing and whether we need more troops andwhether our NATO allies have fulfilled their commitment. But what I worry about more than anything else is the -- the July of2011 firm date, which the president has not -- certainly has not beenpositive as far as our commitment is concerned. In other words, we needa conditions-based situation, not a date for withdrawal. A statement like, ""We're not going to turn out the lights in themiddle of 2011,"" is indecipherable and certainly sounds an uncertaintrumpet. So I'm more concerned about the perception of our friends andour enemies, as well as the people in Afghanistan, as to the depth ofour commitment. Our commitment must be: We will succeed, and then wewill withdraw. TAPPER: Let's talk about that uncertain trumpet that -- that youmentioned. What did the Bush trumpet sound like? There was anunlimited commitment of U.S. troops for an unlimited amount of timethere, and that didn't seem to be effective, and yet you're criticizingthis July 2011 deadline, which would be the beginning of a transitionperiod. What did the previous strategy trumpet sound like? MCCAIN: Well, the previous strategy was failing, and I said that itwas failing, and disagreed with our then-Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld,as well as the president. Then we initiated a surge with GeneralPetraeus in charge, and we succeeded. I just came from Baghdad. I went downtown with my two colleagues toa bakery and to a store. The success there is remarkable. There arestill problems, but the success in remarkable. But we didn't say that we were leaving until we had succeeded. I'mall for dates for withdrawal, but that's after the strategy succeeds,not before. That's a dramatic difference. And I can tell you for sure, our people in the region are not sureabout whether we are going to be here after the middle of 2011, whetherwe have succeeded or not. And it's clear that this strategy has notgone as well as we had hoped, so that right away brings into questionthe middle of 2011. TAPPER: General Petraeus was asked about this July 2011 deadline inhis Senate confirmation hearings this week. Here's what he had to say. PETRAEUS: Let me be very clear, if I could, Senator. And not onlydid I say that I supported it, I said that I agreed with it. I saw thismost importantly as the message of urgency to complement the message ofenormous additional commitment. TAPPER: So General Petraeus said that he not only supports it, heagrees with it, that it's a message of urgency to the Afghangovernment. Is General Petraeus wrong? MCCAIN: General Petraeus has repeatedly said that it also has to becondition-based. In other words, it's the president that leads. Thepresident should state unequivocally that we will leave when we havesucceeded. And to somehow put that burden on General Petraeus is notappropriate. He is the military leader. But the fact is that, if you say that you are setting a date certainfor leaving as his key advisers have, including, I think, one on yourshow that said that we were -- that it is a, quote, ""firm date,"" hisspokesperson said it's, quote, ""etched in stone and he has the chisel,""and other statements by his civilian advisers have undermined the beliefthat we will have a conditions-based withdrawal. So I know enough about warfare. I know enough about what strategyand tactics are about. If you tell the enemy that you're leaving on adate certain, unequivocally, then that enemy will wait until you leave. TAPPER: Well, let's talk about the civilian leadership that -- thatyou just mentioned. You seem to have been critical of Ambassador KarlEikenberry and Special Representative Richard Holbrooke. Do you thinkEikenberry should be replaced? MCCAIN: I hope that -- that the ambassador and General Petraeus canwork together. I think that assessment needs to be made. Obviously,the past relationships have not worked out as well as -- as they shouldhave, but I think an assessment ought to be made as to all of thoserelationships, and we have to have the best team in place. The ideal team, of course, was Ryan Crocker and David Petraeus inIraq. Let's hope we can establish that same kind of relationship herein Afghanistan. TAPPER: Almost a year ago, in August 2009, you were on this programand you and George Stephanopoulos had this exchange about the progressyou said you were confident we would see in Afghanistan within 12 to 18months. STEPHANOPOULOS: You say 12 to 18 months. What do we need to see in12 to 18 months to make sure the public and the Congress stay behindthis war? MCCAIN: I think you need to see a reversal of these very alarmingand disturbing trends on attacks, casualties, areas of the country thatthe Taliban has increased control of. In other words, you need to seeall of those things reversed and on a significant downward slope, and Ithink we can do that. TAPPER: Senator, do you think that we're going to see a reversal ofthose trends in the next seven months? MCCAIN: Well, I hope so. And as I said then, that it -- it needsto happen. As I said earlier in response to your questions, it hasn'tgone as well as we had hoped. There has been some success, althoughit's been bought at great cost in Marjah and other places. And we needto succeed here. We cannot afford to lose. There will be catastrophiceffects in the region, as well as a return of the Taliban and Al Qaida. And the people of -- of Afghanistan do not want the Taliban back. So it -- I would remind you that the situation in Iraq, before westarted that surge, was far worse than the conditions here in Afghanistan. I'm a bit disappointed we haven't seen more progress, but I stillbelieve we can succeed. TAPPER: Senator, the chairman of the Republican National Committee,Michael Steele, was recorded in recent days privately telling Republicancandidates the following about Afghanistan. Quote, ""Keep in mind,again, federal candidates, this was a war of Obama's choosing. This isnot something the United States had actively prosecuted or wanted toengage in. If Obama is such a student of history, has he not understoodthat you know that's the one thing you don't do is engage in a land warin Afghanistan, all right, because everyone who has tried over 1,000years of history has failed,"" unquote. Republicans such as Congressman Tom Cole, William Kristol, LizCheney have -- have said that Michael Steele needs to resign because ofthose comments. Do you think a chairman of the Republican NationalCommittee can be effective if he thinks that the war in Afghanistan isunwinnable, as Steele seems to think? MCCAIN: I think those statements are wildly inaccurate, and there'sno excuse for them. Chairman Steele sent me an e-mail saying that hewas -- his remarks were misconstrued. Look, I'm a Ronald Reagan Republican. I believe we have to winhere. I believe in freedom. But the fact is that I think that Mr.Steele is going to have to assess as to whether he can still lead theRepublican Party as chairman of the Republican National Committee andmake an appropriate decision. TAPPER: Senator, just one last question on Afghanistan, and then Iwant to move on to Iraq. This week, a key House subcommittee blocked $4billion in non-military and non-humanitarian aid for Afghanistan becauseof concerns of rampant corruption in Afghanistan, including Karzaiallies having investigations into their behavior -- into theiractivities being blocked. General Petraeus met with Karzai yesterday,and Karzai called these concerns ""baseless."" Do you support blocking these funds until the U.S. is more confidentthe money is not being stolen? MCCAIN: I think we need to go ahead and spend the money, butcorruption is a problem here in Afghanistan, and it's a serious one, andit begins with the policemen on the beat, and that's why we're beginningto have our military police partner with the police in places likeKandahar. And there has to be a lot of work to be done. There has been some small progress, but a lot more has to be done,but I do not believe that it would -- we would succeed in motivating thegovernment to crack down on corruption if we cut off the funds. But Ialso acknowledge it's a serious problem. TAPPER: You were also in Iraq over the last few days where you metwith local officials. The inconclusive election there has increasedtensions and raised questions about President Obama's plan to end combatoperations at the end of August. Is that deadline still wise, given thelack of a government right now? MCCAIN: The deadline is still wise. And thanks to the securitysituation, it can be met. We will be withdrawing an additional 28,000troops between now and the end of August. We had an inconclusive election in the year 2000, as well, and ittook us some time to sort it out. I think maybe we could look at theglass being half-full in that it was a competitive election and one thatthere was wide participation, something that doesn't happen a lot inthis part of the world. TAPPER: I want to turn to... MCCAIN: And I think they'll work it out. TAPPER: I want to turn to some domestic issues, as long as I haveyou. President Obama delivered a speech on immigration reform thisweek. He mentioned you at one point. Here's part of that speech. OBAMA: Under the leadership of Senator Kennedy and Senator JohnMcCain, we worked across the aisle to help pass a bipartisan billthrough the Senate. And now, under the pressures of partisanship andelection year politics, many of the 11 Republican senators who voted forreform in the past have now backed away from their previous support. TAPPER: Senator, that's you he's talking about. Why have youbacked away from comprehensive immigration reform, which you spoke sopassionately about in 2006 and 2007? MCCAIN: First of all, let me -- and I -- I don't enjoy bringingthis up, but the fact is, then-Senator Obama supported amendments whichwould have gutted the proposal that we had before the United StatesSenate, which he said he would propose, an amendment that basicallygutted the temporary -- legal temporary worker program. But setting that aside, I invite the president to come -- Jon Kyland I invite the president to come to the Arizona-Sonora border. Theviolence is incredibly high. The human smuggling and drug cartels areat a level of violence where 25,000 -- 23,000 Mexican citizens have beenmurdered in the last few years, 5,000 already this year. There's alevel of violence which has increased to a significant degree, whichmakes the situation far different than it was in 2007. We have to secure our borders. When the -- when the -- when ourgovernment has to put up signs in the southern part of our state thatwarns people that they are in a human smuggling and drug smuggling areaand they have to be careful and are warned, then our border is notsecure and our citizens are not safe. We can get the border secure. Jon Kyl and I have a 10-point plan. We can get it secure, and then we can move on with comprehensiveimmigration reform. But I invite the president to come to the border, and he can see forhimself the absolute necessity of getting our border secure before moreviolence spills over onto our side of the border, as this existentialstruggle takes place between the Mexican government and the drug cartelsand the human smugglers, who are now working hand in glove. TAPPER: I only have a couple more questions, Senator. I know yourtime is valuable. Just to follow up on that, in 2007, you were quotedas follows by Vanity Fair. ""McCain had been asked how debate over theimmigration bill was playing politically. 'In the short term, itprobably galvanizes our base,' he said, 'In the long term, if youalienate the Hispanics, you'll pay a heavy price.' You've long been critical of then-Senator Obama for pandering tounions during the 2007 immigration reform debate. You just talked aboutit a second ago. And -- and you're right. He did vote for amendmentsthat threatened to unravel the coalition. But how is what you're doing now any different, except you'repandering to the other side? MCCAIN: Because, as I said before, the level of violence on theborder, the human smuggling, the fact that Phoenix, Arizona, is thenumber-two kidnapping capital of the world, according to media reports,the fact that a recent -- a ring recently was broken up that broughtpeople across our border to Phoenix, Arizona, where people were -- drugswere distributed all over the country, as well as people, means that thesituation has changed dramatically. That's why I asked the president to come to the border. It is notthe same as it was in 2007. And the people deserve not to have ourranchers murdered, not to have a deputy shot by a drug smuggler with anAK-47 in Pinal County. The situation has dramatically changed, and thestatistics absolutely back that up. TAPPER: All right. Finally, Senator, Senator Republican LeaderMitch McConnell just announced in the last few days that he will voteagainst Elena Kagan's Supreme Court nomination, if her nomination doesget to the floor of the Senate. Have you made a decision about how youwill vote? MCCAIN: Not quite, but I intend to decide this coming week, Jake. TAPPER: All right. Senator John McCain, thanks so much. Safetravels, and thanks for joining us. TAPPER: And we're joined now by our roundtable. First off, formerspokesman for Bush in Iraq and a current member of the Council onForeign Relations, Dan Senor, his book, ""Start-Up Nation: The Story ofIsrael's Economic Miracle."" Also, from Univision, Jorge Ramos, his book -- I feel like Oprah --""A Country for All: An Immigrant Manifesto."" Hopefully, I'll have someOprah effect on you guys. From the New York Times, Paul Krugman. From Bloomberg, Al Hunt. And from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Cynthia Tucker. Bring yourbooks next time. I'll see if I can work my magic. Now, Dan, I'll start with you. Senator McCain seemed to stop justshort of calling for Steele's resignation. What do you think? SENOR: Well, Chairman Steele has been furiously working the phonesthis weekend to try to explain that, at worse, this was a gaffe, atbest, what he said was taken out of context. I think it's important to take a step back and recognize -- hishistorical inaccuracies notwithstanding -- got some basic facts wrong --he did articulate a real point of view. I mean, it's a real point ofview out there by those who are opposed to the war in Afghanistan, thatas he said, for centuries, people have tried to succeed in Afghanistan. Land wars never work in Afghanistan, which was a direct criticism of theMcChrystal-Petraeus counterinsurgency strategy. And it's fine. He's entitled to that point of view. It justhappens to be the point of view of organizations like MoveOn.org, andyou see that point of view articulated on liberal blogs. It's the viewof many of the Democratic members of Congress who voted for a timelinethis past week. So it's one thing for him personally to have that point of view, butfor the chairman of the party to articulate that point of view, toadvance that point of view is indefensible. And I would also say, what we've seen over the last couple weeks isa very sensitive and raw moment as it relates to Afghanistan. And ithas been admirable how serious our leaders, military and civilian, havestepped up. I mean, McChrystal stepping down the way he did, Petraeus steppingin, taking a demotion from his Central Command position to step in,President Obama acting swiftly and recommitting to Afghanistan when hewould have had an inflection point to change policy if he wanted to, allof these people have been acting incredibly seriously. And what's striking about Steele is how fundamentally unserious he-- giving political counsel, how to frame this debate in a politicalcontext for candidates, I think is -- is actually offensive. TAPPER: And you think he should step down? SENOR: There's no -- I mean, I don't think the Republican Party canseriously engage in foreign policy with credibility if its chairman isengaging in this kind of rhetoric. RAMOS: Because it's something so fundamental. It's like if 9/11never happened. I mean, that's -- that's -- that's the point. But now, going beyond Steele's comment, what's so interesting isthat I think there's a contradiction in Afghanistan right now. On onehand, how can you be completely fully committed to a war and at the sametime say that you're going to be leaving and setting a deadline? I think many Americans and politicians would be hard-pressed rightnow to -- to know exactly and to explain, what are we doing inAfghanistan? I know obviously we invaded Afghanistan after 9/11. Obviously, we didn't want the Taliban to be supporting Al Qaida andother terrorist groups. But at the same time, what are we doing right now in Afghanistan? Idon't think that's very clear, and I think that's -- that's clearlysetting up other questions. TAPPER: Paul, the spokesman for the Democratic National Committee,Brad Woodhouse, made a comment that aroused the ire of some liberalbloggers. Woodhouse said about Steele's comments, ""The American peoplewill be interested to hear that the leader of the Republican Partythinks recent events related to the war are comical and that he'sbetting against our troops and rooting for failure in Afghanistan. It'ssimply unconscionable that Michael Steele would undermine the morale ofour troops when what they need is our support and encouragement."" Liberal writers such as Greg Sargent at the Washington Post, GlennGreenwald at Salon have -- have criticized that, saying that the DNC isusing Karl Rove-like tactics. KRUGMAN: Yes, and this was wrong. I mean, there's anunderstandable frustration among Democrats with the hypocrisy, right? All during the Bush years, any criticism of Bush's war policy wasunpatriotic, and now the Republicans are happy to criticize the warpolicy of -- of President Obama. But the way you -- you deal with that is by condemning thehypocrisy, not by turning into the Bush people, not by going back toit. So this was a -- this was a bad misstep. It was a cheap shot, whenwhat you really needed was to talk about it seriously. TAPPER: Al, I wonder if Chairman Steele is an outlier or if he isgiving voice to a concern that a lot of Republicans legitimately feelabout this war, which is now America's longest war? HUNT: Yes, Jake, I think that's a good question. First of all, Ithink Michael Steele -- I wonder if he's a Democratic mole. If he hadto resign every time he said something silly, he'd be gone about 15times by now. But I do think there's a larger point here, and that is that asenior member of the House told me, if there had been a private vote onthat supplemental bill for Afghan funding, it would have lost by adecisive majority. Many Democrats and more Republicans than you think-- there's tremendous anxiety. Nobody thinks this war is going wellright now. No one sees the light, if you will, at the end of the tunnel. So I think even though Michael Steele is not a very good or veryarticulate or very credible spokesman for much, if anything, I do thinkthat those reflected that -- that anxiety. TAPPER: Cynthia, you once called -- and let me underline -- youonce called Michael Steele an affirmative action hire gone bad. What'syour take on this? TUCKER: Well, Michael Steele is a self-aggrandizing gaffe-proneincompetent who would have been fired a long time ago were he notblack. Of course, the irony is that he never would have been voted inas chairman of the Republican Party were he not black. Let's remember how the party wound up with Michael Steele. InNovember 2008, the party was devastated that the Democrats had electedthe nation's first black president, while the Republican Party was stuckwith being seen as largely the party of aging white people, with goodreason, a party that was hostile to people of color, especially blacksand Latinos. So the party needed a new face, preferably a face of color, and theydidn't have very many officials to choose from, so they came up withMichael Steele. And it is very ironic, since the Republicans have beenso critical of affirmative action, to watch them stuck with theiraffirmative action hire that they dare not get rid of, because thatwould generate even more controversy. TAPPER: All right. Dan... SENOR: And I just want to come back to something Al said. I mean,you may be right that behind closed doors many Republicans have greatapprehension about Afghanistan. What is, I think, admirable is thatdespite they have that -- despite that they have that apprehension anddespite there -- that there is political liability in sticking with thiswar for many of these members of Congress, that they're still standingwith President Obama and trying to unite the country, actually, behindhis war strategy. That's admirable. And -- and the reason Steele should resign is because he has nobusiness as being the chairman of the party taking on a position thatactually in direct contradiction to that. HUNT: Well, that's one way to look at it. The other way to look atit is, it's Obama's war, so if it goes badly, those Republicans aregoing to get stuck with it. I think -- I think a lot of it has to dowith that kind of calculation, Dan. I don't -- I don't think a lot ofthem are doing it in order to help Barack Obama. SENOR: No, they're not doing it to help Barack Obama. I thinkthey're doing it to -- because they support the war strategy, theysupport our engagement in Afghanistan, they support our troops, and Ithink the country should be united. This is a long -- I mean, this idea of opposition political partiestrying to hang a war on the president in power goes way back. Tom DeLayfamously called the Balkans war Clinton's war. You can -- Grenada wasReagan's war. Panama was Bush, Sr.'s, war. I mean, this goes way back,opposition parties sort of capitalizing on a neo-isolationist politics. This is unique. This is -- this is an extremely sensitive moment ona war that people are tiring of. And Republicans, despite their fiercecriticism of the Obama agenda on a range of other fronts, are actuallystanding with the president on this. And for the chairman of the partyto be -- to be turning that upside down, I think, is -- is dangerous. TAPPER: And just before we go to break, I want to underline thatwhat -- we're unanimous in Steele's assertion that this was a war ofObama's choosing is just crazy talk. SENOR: It's actually factually incorrect. TAPPER: It couldn't be wrong -- it couldn't -- it's wrong in about15 ways. TAPPER: All right, but we'll be back with more of the roundtable. Friday's dismal jobs report, is the jobless recovery turning into adouble-dip recession? What will that mean for the midterms? Plus,immigration reform and the Elena Kagan hearings. And later, the Sundayfunnies. LETTERMAN: Yes, Russian spies tried to blend in. They were actinglike Americans. As a matter of fact, for two weeks, they werepretending they loved soccer. KOHL: What issues motivate you the most? And what excites youabout the job? KAGAN: It's an opportunity to serve this country in a way that, youknow, fits with whatever talents I might have. KOHL: What are the things you feel most passionate about? How areyou going to make a difference as a Supreme Court justice? KAGAN: What motivates me primarily is the opportunity to safeguardthe rule of law. KOHL: I'm sure you're a woman of passion. Where are your passions? TAPPER: Well, 15 years ago, Elena Kagan criticized Supreme Courtconfirmation hearings as a ""vapid and hollow charade,"" and there you go. Joining us to discuss that and other topics, from the Council onForeign Relations, Dan Senor; from Univision, Jorge Ramos; from the NewYork Times, Paul Krugman; from Bloomberg, Al Hunt; and from the AtlantaJournal-Constitution, Cynthia Tucker. Let's start with more bad news on the economic front. Let me put upsome numbers here. In June, we found out 125,000 jobs were lost, only83,000 private-sector jobs were created, and we also heard that in Maypending home sales were down 30 percent. Paul, have we made any headway in the last six or seven months? KRUGMAN: On the things that matter, no. Basically, we're -- we'reholding. The fraction of the adult population that's employed isbasically flat, which is saying that we're -- you know, we're not --things are not getting worse, but they're not getting better, and we'rein a bad place. So, no, this is not good. TAPPER: And you think we should do what? What do we need to do? KRUGMAN: More stimulus. I mean, we -- we had -- you know, rightfrom the beginning -- you know, luckily, some of us have a trackrecord. Right from the beginning, January-February of 2009, looking atthe scale of the crisis, we said this program -- although it sounds likea lot of money, $700 billion or $800 billion, is actually not enough,that you need something bigger. But for a variety of reasons, we didn't get a program that wasbigger, and we got a program also that starts to fade out just aboutnow, middle of 2010, by which time, you know, the assumption was that --that we'd have a self-sustaining recovery underway, but we don't, whichwas always a serious risk. So, no, this is -- this is a pretty grim situation. We reallyshould be going in for another stimulus program which has a chance forapproximately minus 5 percent of getting through Congress right now. TAPPER: Are we facing a double-dip recession? KRUGMAN: You know, our terminology is not helping us right now. Suppose that the economy grows at 1 percent for the rest of the year ornext year-and-a-half and the unemployment rate rises to 10.3 percent. Probably that won't be considered a recession, because GDP is growing. We're producing more stuff, but we're actually losing ground on thejobs front, so that's the most likely -- you know, I'm not sure it'll be-- unemployment will go that high, but the most likely thing issomething where it isn't formally a recession, GDP isn't shrinking, butthe job market is losing ground, certainly not gaining ground. It'llfeel like a double dip, whatever the recession data say it is. TAPPER: Cynthia, is it even possible to pass another stimulus inthis Congress? I mean, we can't even get passed unemployment insuranceextensions or $50 billion in emergency spending for cities and states. Do you think Congress can pass a stimulus? TUCKER: Jake, I think it is absolutely crazy that the Senate hasrefused to extend unemployment benefits. If they won't do that, it'spretty clear that they won't pass the robust kind of stimulus or jobs bill. I think it's bad news for the Democrats to call it stimulus, becausethat has -- as a brand, that doesn't go over very well with the public. But the jobs bill has gotten smaller and smaller and smaller, and eventhat seems to have very little chance of passing. And it's mysterious why the Democrats are responding in this way. It's no mystery about the Republicans. They don't care if the -- inNovember, for the midterms, the -- the Democrats are facing a reallylousy economy. They figure that voters will take that out on the Democrats. But it's more a mystery why Democrats are responding this way. Theyseem to be frightened of the voters and believe that voters areabsolutely furious about the deficit. But, in fact, that doesn't showup in polls. The vast majority of polls show Americans are more concerned aboutjobs. That's the number-one issue. Concern over the deficit isrising. But in most polls, voters rank concern about jobs over concernabout the deficit. SENOR: Yes, I would say there -- there's a big question going on inCongress and across the country. Where does this end? I mean, what youand Paul are arguing for is not a -- a difference in strategy. You'rearguing for a difference in degree, amount of spending. The strategy isthe right strategy, is what you're basically saying, the administrationstrategy. Now, there are two models that people are talking about, you hearmembers of Congress talking about. One is Greece. In 2012, the amountof debt that the U.S. government will accumulate will be bigger than oureconomy produces. That looks a lot like Greece or Japan, which hassomething like 200 percent of debt to GDP. I mean, if you look at just the interest payments alone that theJapanese government pays, it accounts for 25 percent -- the interest onits own debt, 25 percent of its national budget. Now, its interestpayment is 1 percent. KRUGMAN: That is not right. We can't do this, Dan, right now, butthat number is not... SENOR: I will -- I will happily provide it for you. KRUGMAN: That's -- that's just not right. SENOR: But the point is, is that... TAPPER: We'll bring in PolitiFact on that one. SENOR: Exactly. You begin to get in a situation where the interestpayments on the debt become unsustainable, the debt becomesunsustainable, and there's a lot of uncertainty. There's uncertaintynow about the Bush -- the expiration of the Bush tax cuts, the impactthat'll have on the economy, the impact on health care, the Obamacarespending, what impact that will have, possible cap and trade. Andpeople are just sitting on the sidelines saying, ""Where does this end?"" RAMOS: But the debate, I think -- the debate is right there. Imean, do we -- do we really need the government right now just moreintervention, more stimulus, or are we going to go just to -- to cut thedeficit? I think we -- we need both, but at this point, in order tojust to have a recovery summer, as Vice President Biden promised, weneed -- we need -- we need more government intervention. KRUGMAN: The economics is really clear. You need to commit todoing something about the deficit once the economy has recovered. Butcutting right now is -- doesn't even do very much for your budgetposition, because it makes the economy weaker, it means less revenues. It's really going to hurt. The -- the arithmetic of budget cuts now isjust terrible. And, you know, you have to have some sense of scale here, right? We're looking at a -- a U.S. government that 10 years from now willprobably owe something like $20 trillion. Whether we borrow another$500 billion now is not going to make a big difference in thatposition. It's really trivial. But it can make a huge difference tothe fate of the -- you know, the 15 million people who are unemployed inthe United States right now. The idea -- people using these long-run budget concerns as a way toargue against helping unemployed, when the average duration ofunemployment now is about 35 weeks, that is -- that -- I don't think --I don't think -- for most of the people making this argument, I don'tthink it's sincere. They're just using the occasion. TAPPER: Al, walk us -- walk us through the politics here. Whycan't they pass unemployment extensions or this emergency spending onCapitol Hill, if Democrats control both the House and the Senate? HUNT: Well, because they need 60 votes in the Senate, and theydon't have 60 votes. I think they will pass that ultimately. They'lldo little things. They won't do the sort of stimulus that Paul istalking about. I think the fundamental problem here, Jake, and -- and, Dan, I thinkwhat you're talking about is 5, 7, 10 years out, not right now. Wecan't walk and -- and chew gum at the same time. We ought to be dealingwith long-term deficits in the long term and short-term stimulus, whichthis incredibly sluggish economy needs right now. The politics just are lousy, though, Jake. The -- I don't know ifit's the Republicans, if it's conservative Democrats, but the -- but theside that talks about the need to rein in the federal government, thisis -- this is not very rational -- has really -- is winning that debate. And when you talk to people about the stimulus, Paul may be right. There should have been a bigger stimulus. Barack Obama thinks thereshould have been a bigger stimulus. The reason there wasn't, becauseyou couldn't get it through, even -- even a year ago. I mean, you know,meet Ben Nelson. But -- but -- but... TAPPER: Or Susan Collins or Olympia Snowe or Arlen Specter. HUNT: But -- but -- but right now, that -- that -- that argumentthat we have to rein in -- because the stimulus didn't work, well, Ithink most economists would say the stimulus did work... (UNKNOWN): It did work. HUNT: ... in the sense it would have been a lot worse if therehadn't been one. But when people talk about the stimulus, theyassociate it with bank bailouts and auto bailouts, which had nothing todo with the stimulus. TAPPER: Let me bring -- let me bring this out, because we -- I hadthis made. This is something that -- in February, the Obamaadministration was very excited. They brought out this icon, whichshows all the jobs being lost, and then the stimulus passes, and how joblosses and now job gains happen. Now we have this. I think I'm doing this correctly. And, Paul,where -- where are we going from here? And how much does this reallybad bar graph impact the stimulus politics? KRUGMAN: Well, I mean, now, we know that that's -- last -- lastmonth, the previous month wasn't as good as it looks and the currentmonth isn't as bad as it looks... TAPPER: Because of the census. KRUGMAN: ... because of census jobs. So it's -- so what's actuallyhappening is the private sector is continuing to add jobs, but slow, notenough to make a dent in the unemployment. Yes, it -- this has been always the -- the track for stimulus. Ifyou -- if you do a half-measure, which is what we did, in the face ofthis incredibly negative shock to the economy, the worst financial shocksince the 1930s, then the odds were even -- in -- in advance, the oddswere pretty good that you were going to end up with a situation wherethings were actually not all that good, even after the stimulus had goneinto effect. And then the argument -- the counterfactual that says, well, theywould be much worse if we hadn't done this, although true, doesn't cutvery much politically. Plus, there's this worldwide panic. I mean, it's not just theUnited States. Everyone out there has been saying, oh, you know, we'vegot to move, because even though the arithmetic says that what we spendon stimulus now isn't really going to matter very much, the bond marketswill turn on us. And this is -- I've been calling it the attack of the invisible bondvigilantes, because everybody is afraid that the bond market is going toturn on us, and they -- they're doing that, even though the actual factis that the bond markets are signaling a willingness to lend the U.S. government lots of money at very low interest rates, because they seethe U.S. government as the only safe thing out there. RAMOS: (inaudible) recovery without -- without jobs. I mean, wehave created -- the private sector created 83,000 jobs. And just tokeep pace with the new workers, we need 130,000 per month. So -- so weare in a really bad situation. But are we going to be cutting deficits right now? I mean, is that-- is that the way to go? KRUGMAN: I'm simply... RAMOS: We -- we can go -- I'm sorry -- we can go the way of Greeceor -- or I don't know if you've seen the (inaudible) coming from PuertoRico, but they've been cutting the deficit, and then we have thisviolent repression of the police against students and demonstrators. KRUGMAN: ... the countries -- the countries that actually have gonethe fiscal austerity route... TAPPER: Germany and Greece. KRUGMAN: Well, Germany is only saying they're going to do it. Theyhaven't done it yet. Greece is a -- Greece is a special case, becausethey really were massively irresponsible, you know, mega times (ph). But look at Ireland, which has been a good soldier in this crisis,has done everything it was supposed to, savage cuts. Their deficit hashardly gone down, because their economy has shrunk so much that therevenues have collapsed. They have mass unemployment. It's -- it's --it's a mess. And the -- and the markets aren't even rewarding them. They're -- you know, the -- the cost of insuring against an Irishdefault has gone up, not down, after the austerity. So there's this --you know, while we actually have some evidence of -- of how this works,and it works terribly. TUCKER: Well, I think that President Obama deserves some of theblame for the politics on this, not the policy. He does want morestimulus, and that's absolutely the right approach, I think. But thepublic is clearly confused about the difference between short-termdeficits and long-term deficits. The -- our problem will become enormous in about 2015 or 2020, butthe very worst way to go about cutting the deficits is to let peoplestay unemployed. If they're jobless, they can't pay taxes. If theycan't pay taxes, the deficit gets worse. And I think that the president could have done a much better job ofexplaining that. I think he still could, but he sent mixed messages. He has a deficit reduction commission. He's talked about cutting orfreezing federal agencies. And people get confused by that, and theythink that problems are immediate. SENOR: He didn't send a mixed message. He actually was veryclear. If the Congress didn't pass the stimulus, unemployment wouldrise about 8 percent. If they passed the stimulus, it would stay below8 percent. His problem is being held accountable to what he said wouldoccur if his bill -- if his stimulus package was passed. And now he's saying, well, it could have been this -- unemploymentcould have been 13 percent, 14 percent or 15 percent, what he said inWisconsin last week. The reality is, you may be right that the crushingeffects of the debt burden won't be felt for some time, but it is havingan effect on investors and lenders and employers today. People know this -- this debt and deficit burden is unsustainablewithout major tax increases in the future. Major tax increases and theuncertainty that's associated with them makes it very hard for theprivate-sector economy to engage. And that's who's on the sidelinesright now. KRUGMAN: I just want to say, that's a -- there is not a hint ofwhat you're saying in the data, not a hint that the debt burden iswhat's discouraging -- businesses aren't investing because they havemassive excess capacity. But let -- let me say, on the politics, there's an interestingcontrast between Obama 18 months in and Ronald Reagan 18 months in. Eighteen months into the Reagan administration, things were terrible. The bottom was falling out of the economy. The unemployment rate hadrisen much more drastically. And in Reagan's case, it was a recessionthat started on his watch, as opposed to -- to the Obama case. Reagan was absolutely, completely defending his philosophy, didn't-- gave no ground whatsoever in his public statements, in his speechesduring 1982. Obama's been trimming the whole way, saying, oh, yes,well, we'll going to -- we're going to freeze discretionary spending... TAPPER: And non-security discretionary. KRUGMAN: ... went on FOX News to say, you know, if we don't balancethe budget, we'll have a double-dip recession, which had all of his --his own economists going, ""Oh, my god. What did he say?"" So he -- hehas been giving mixed messages. His -- his urge to split the difference between the sides, even whenone side is actually certainly, from his own point of view, totallywrong, has certainly hindered. Would it have made a difference if hewas stronger? I don't know. But he's certainly not been strong... TAPPER: I want to -- I want to change topics. I'm sorry. We onlyhave a few minutes, and President Obama this week did something elsesignificant, which he gave his first speech on immigration reform. Jorge, I want to use some tape from an interview you did withthen-Senator Obama in 2008. OBAMA: I cannot guarantee that it's going to be in the first 100days. But what I can -- what I can... RAMOS: The first month? OBAMA: ... what I guarantee is, is that we will have in the firstyear an immigration bill that I strongly support and that I'm promotingand that I want to move that forward as quickly as possible. RAMOS: In the first year? OBAMA: In my first year. TAPPER: So that's known in the Hispanic community as Obama'spromise. Did -- did he keep it? RAMOS: La promesa de Obama, no. President Barack Obama, he brokehis promise. It's -- it's that simple. We were -- we've been waiting for 18 months for change. We haven'tseen change. Not only that, President Barack Obama has deported morepeople in his first year in office than George W. Bush in his last yearin office. And the speech last Thursday I think was a good speech, even a greatspeech at some point, but we needed action. He could have stoppeddeportations for students. He could have stopped deportations for theparents of U.S. citizens. He could have called for a bipartisan meetingat the White House. He could have been much more specific on animmigration bill, and -- and he wasn't. Now, let's -- let's be clear. I mean, he doesn't have the 60 votesin the Senate right now. So there's really nothing he -- he can do. But I wish he could have moved earlier, I mean, when he had the 60votes in -- in the Senate. And the consequences politically are huge. He -- the Hispanic community is -- is really disillusioned, is veryfrustrated. Sixty-nine percent of the Latinos supported PresidentBarack Obama last January, and now it's only 57 percent. TAPPER: In the latest Gallup poll. RAMOS: In the latest Gallup poll. So -- so -- so something is --is -- is (inaudible) he promised change, and change is not here. TAPPER: Al, why is President Obama bringing this issue up now? HUNT: To frame it for November, because -- and to at least addresspart of what Jorge said, that I care, that this is an issue that mattersto me. Look, his docket was full. I -- I have some sympathy for him. I mean, if he was going to do immigration, he has to either -- eithergive up on health care -- I mean... RAMOS: No, he (inaudible) his promise. Nobody forced him to promise. HUNT: No -- no -- no question. RAMOS: He got 67 percent of the Hispanic vote. HUNT: I just don't think the politics are there to load the docketswill all that. And I think now it's being brought up not becausethere's any legislative chance -- there is none -- but it is to framethe debate for the November elections. And I think the -- Obama hopesthat this will energize and get back some of that 12 percent that he'slost among Hispanic voters. The Republicans are counting on the angerof people out there. I must say, John McCain, in his interview with you, Jake, that wasextraordinary to say that crime is up there. He's talking aboutMexico. Crime is down in Arizona. Every single academic study that'sbeen done shows that immigrants commit fewer crimes. HUNT: We have a system where there are now three-and-a-half-foldmore illegal immigrants than there were 20 years ago. It's a systemthat's broke. And for John McCain to say that there's been a dramaticchange just simply is not the case. TAPPER: Dan, Republicans say that the president is bringing this upfor cynical reasons, to drum up Hispanic voters. SENOR: Right. Well, if he were serious about immigration reform,he would provide some real specifics, a real plan. He didn't do thatthe other day. It was just sort of platitudinal. And -- and particularly against the backdrop of what Senator McCainsaid and others have said, President Obama absolutely played politicswith this issue in 2007 when he was facing a Democratic primary. AndJohn McCain and Ted Kennedy worked out a deal to keep out all theseamendments that could have destroyed the entire McCain-Kennedy package,amendments from the Democrat -- extreme Democrats and extremeRepublicans, and Obama effectively, you know, contributed in blowing --contributed to blowing that up. And so for him now to be lecturing Republicans about not playingpolitics for this issue -- with this issue -- they view it as a littledisingenuous. The reality is -- let me -- the reality is, the bestthing for Barack Obama's chances for success on immigration reform isthe Republicans actually winning majority in Congress. He will lead that... (UNKNOWN): ... never get it done. (UNKNOWN): The Democrats will never pass a bill. HUNT: Dan, you're very smart. You could not be more wrong. TheRepublican Party has been taken over by the nativists, by theanti-immigrant. HUNT: You cannot -- Mitt Romney did a 180 because you cannot lookat John McCain today, the politics, they are nativist. And that's... SENOR: ... majority of Democrats... HUNT: ... Lindsey Graham -- Lindsey Graham is an ally. I'm notdefending the Democrats... TAPPER: Hold on one second. We only got a minute left. Paul, thenCynthia. KRUGMAN: The -- the Republican Party for these past 30 years hasbeen kind of a coalition between a cultural right, which is alsobasically anti-immigrant, and an economic right, which is kind offavorable to immigration reform. What's happened in the last year isthat the cultural right has taken over. The economic right no longercalls the shots. And that's why we can't get immigration legislation. TAPPER: Cynthia, quickly? TUCKER: I was going to say the same thing, that actually this fellapart among Republicans in 2007 with -- those 11 Republican senatorsstepped away from the deal they had previously supported, and thepolitics are even worse now than they were then. RAMOS: I mean, it's incredible that the most powerful country inthe world is prosecuting 11 million people. SENOR: We have a test case on what you're saying, right? It's veryeasy to say that the politics of -- cultural conservative politics havegone native. SENOR: In California, you had a gubernatorial primary, Meg Whitman... TAPPER: This is going to continue in the green room. TAPPER: I'm sorry. We're going to talk more about that in thegreen room.

['Fake news', 'Space']	http://mysteriousearth.club/	http://mysteriousearth.club/2018/04/08/cia-release-documents-of-moon-moon-has-more-than-250-million-citizens/	2018/04/13	490SHARESShareYou may think its quite ludicrous to even contemplate that the Moon could be harbouring as many as 250 million citizens, but its not. Although this may not be true, those who have looked into it know that strange anomalies have surrounded the Moon for decades. Contemplation without investigation is the height of ignorance, a quote attributed to Einstein holds true here. If you actually do some independent research, you might be quite shocked with what you find, especially when it comes to the credibility of the sources.As far back as 1970, two well-respected members of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Michael Vasin and Alexander Shcherbakov, created a hypothesis suggesting that the Moon is a spaceship created by unknown beings. Fast forward to today, and we have former high-ranking members of the military and intelligence agencies sharing their knowledge with regards to strange things that are happening on the Moon. A few examples are listed in the articles linked below.Take for example Timothy Good, one of the worlds leading UFO researchers, who has lectured at universities, schools, and many organizations, including the Institute of Medical Laboratory Sciences, the Royal Canadian Military Institute, the Royal Geographical Society, the Royal Naval Air Reserve Branch, the House of Lords All-Party UFO Study Group, and the Oxford and Cambridge Union societies.Good says that a former member of MI6 revealed her conversation with Neil Armstrong at a NASA conference, when he confirmed there were other spacecraft on the Moon when Apollo 11 landed in 1969. Armstrong also confirmed the CIA was behind the coverup. He also goes into more detail about it in this 2013 lecture.Dr. John Brandenburg, the Deputy Manager of the Clementine Mission to the Moon, which was part of a joint space project between the Ballistic Missile Defence Organization (BMDO) and NASA, has also made some fascinating revelations. The mission discovered water at the Moons poles in 1994 (Source: page 16 of 18)(source)(source). But, according to Brandenburg, the Clementine Mission had an ulterior agenda:The Clementine Mission was a photo reconnaissance mission basically to check out if someone was building bases on the moon that we didnt know about. Were they expanding they expanding them? . . . Of all the pictures Ive seen from the moon that show possible structures, the most impressive is a picture of a miles wide recto-linear structure. This looked unmistakably artificial, and it shouldnt be there. As somebody in the space defence community, I look on any such structure on the moon with great concern because it isnt ours, theres no way we could have built such a thing. It means someone else is up there.The quote above comes from the documentary, Aliens on the Moon.Here is an interesting lecture Brandenburg gave with regards to strange anomalies that have been found on Mars. You can read more about that in detail here.Members of the Society For Planetary SETI Research (SPSR) have recently published a paper in the Journal of Space Exploration about certain features on the far side of the moon that appear in the crater Paracelsus C. Titled Image Analysis of Unusual Structures on the Far Side of the Moon in the Crater Paracelsus C, it argues that these features might be artificial in origin, meaning someone other than a human being built them and put them there. It suggest that life could be contained within the moon as well.Keep in mind that there is an entire side of the moon we can never see, unless we use probes. A new study published in the Journal of Space Exploration titled The Mounds of Cydonia: Elegant Geology, or Tetrahedral Geometry and Reactions of Pythagoras and Dirac? has added to the already robust evidence pointing to artificial surface interventions on Mars. The paper also mentions that it adds to the evidence which exists already that strongly point to artificial surface interventions.So you see, youre not crazy if you see a headline above and actually contemplate if its true or not.Related CE Articles that go into more detail about the moon:The United States Tried To Detonate A Nuclear Weapon on The Moon Somebody Responded When We DidTheyre Parked On The Side of The Crater Theyre Watching Us!

He holds 17 world speed records in the Lear Jet and holds every airline certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration. Mr. Lear has flown missions worldwide for the CIA and other government agencies. A former Nevada State Senator candidate, he is the son of William P. Lear, designer of the Lear Jet executive airplane, the 8-track stereo, and founder of Lear Siegler Corporation. Lear became interested in the subject of UFOs 13 months after talking with United States Air Force Personnel who had witnessed a UFO landing at Bentwaters AFB, near London, England, and three small aliens walking up to the Wing Commander.In the video below, he shows several images and describes structures, technologies, city like structures and roads. The study mentioned earlier published in the Journal of Space Exploration also mentions something along these lines. In the lecture linked above by Brandenburg, he describes the same thing on Mars.Below you can watch a lecture given by John Lear regarding his research.The last video is part 1 of a 4 part series done by Project Camelot.Whats fascinating is the fact that a lot of his information actually corroborates with other witness testimony, as well as the studies coming out bringing more attention to strange structures on the moon that appear to be extraterrestrial.Some more related CE Articles:Daily In US		1
http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2013/jun/28/gene-green/gene-green-says-student-loan-interest-rates-will-d/	"	Says student loan interest rates will double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent July 1."	mostly true	['Education']	http://green.house.gov/	http://green.house.gov/press-release/rep-green-statement-student-loan-interest-rate-doubling	2013/06/28	Representing the 29th District of TexasRep. Green Statement on Student Loan Interest Rate DoublingJune 28, 2013Press ReleaseWashington, DC – With only three days left until student loan interest rates double from 3.4% to 6.8% on July 1st, Congressman Gene Green was proud to support H.R. 1595, the Student Loan Relief Act of 2013, by signing Rep. Joe Courtney’s discharge petition to bring the bill before the full House for consideration.As of Thursday, June 27, 196 Members had signed on to the discharge petition for Rep. Courtney’s bill, still 22 shy of the 218 needed to bring the bill to the floor.The Joint Economic Committee’s June 2013 report, “Causes and Consequences of Increasing Student Debt,” found the following data for the state of Texas:• Average Debt: $22,600• Annualized Average Weekly Earnings (graduates under age 30): $49,112• Ratio of Debt to Annualized Earnings: 46%• Percent of Student Loan Borrowers with Accounts 90+ Days Delinquent (borrowers under age 30): 19.7%The report also found that as of the first quarter of 2013, workers with a bachelor’s degree earned 68% more than workers with only a high school diploma.Rep. Green submitted a statement for the record, asserting:I rise today in support of extending the 3.4 interest rate on Stafford Student loans to protect students from seeing their interest rates double on July 1, 2013. As the cost of higher education continues to climb and total student loan debt eclipsed credit card debt for the first time, the consequences of inaction are unacceptable. We need to be making college more affordable for all students, not putting it further out of reach.As an advanced degree becomes more and more of a requirement for well paying jobs, it is vital that low interest loans be available so that students can access an affordable college education. Approximately 60 percent of students take out loans to attend college and increasing the cost of borrowing will prevent millions from being able to obtain a degree.H.R. 1595, the Student Loan Relief Act of 2013, is a clean extension that would freeze the 3.4 interest rate on Stafford loans for two years. I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation to prevent a crippling hike in rates and give Congress time to find a true long-term solution to student loans and college affordability that is worthy of our nation’s young people.A strong middle-class, well educated workforce and the opportunity for upward mobility are the building blocks of a thriving economy. To maintain and strengthen each, every student must have the opportunity to pursue higher education, not just the privileged few.College educated students are the future engine of our country, and anyone who wants to pursue a post-secondary education should have the opportunity to do so without going into crushing debt. I urge my colleagues to stop rates from doubling and extend the current interest rate of 3.4 percent.A full copy of the JEC report can be found here .###		1
http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2011/jun/28/democratic-party-virginia/democrats-say-bob-mcdonnell-tried-raid-education-p/	"	Gov. Bob McDonnell launched a ""raid on public education to pay for roads."""	mostly true	['Education', 'State Budget', 'Transportation']	http://www.washingtonpost.com/	http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/virginia-politics/post/dems-try-to-work-ryan-medicare-plan-into-state-races/2011/06/02/AGdDXGHH_blog.html	2011/06/28	How convinced are Democrats that Republicans have handed them a winner with U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s plan to overhaul Medicare? Convinced enough that the Ryan proposal made an appearance Thursday in an e-mailed appeal from the Democratic Party of Virginia, seeking donations for Democratic candidates for the state legislature in November. Never mind that the Virginia General Assembly will have very little say over Congress’ debate over Medicare spending. “Bob McDonnell’s raid on public education to pay for roads. Ken Cuccinelli’s litigious war on health reform and clean air and water. Paul Ryan’s plan to end Medicare as we know it. The list of the ways in which Republicans are abusing the power they were given goes on and on,” Mills writes. It may be smart politics — after all, unhappiness with Ryan’s proposal is being credited with helping Democrats win a deep red New York House seat that had been held for decades by Republicans. It’s also something of a turnabout on Virginia Republicans, who worked overtime and successfully in 2009 to tie Democratic gubernatorial candidate Creigh Deeds (D) to policy proposals by Democrats in Washington that were equally distant from the state job he sought. They too argued that voters should use the state race to “send a message” to Washington. But will voters choosing a candidate for the state Senate think about Paul Ryan while standing in the voting booth? Check back in November.		1
http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2010/apr/15/bill-white/bill-white-objects-what-he-calls-soviet-style-budg/	"Says Republican state leaders are using ""Soviet-style""  budget management."	pants on fire!	['State Budget']	http://www.texastribune.org/	http://www.texastribune.org/blogs/post/2010/mar/09/2010-white-starts-argument/	2010/04/15	"Find out how you can put this story on your website .Democrat Bill White said he won't rely on ""Soviet-style budgeting"" and ""hot air politics"" if he's elected governor, and said the state should make education its first priority and would be better off with a governor who's got business experience when it comes to economic development.In a wide-ranging interview at the Tribune's ""TribLive"" event this morning, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee said the state has work to do to stay ahead of ""dark clouds"" on the horizon in education and economic development and other areas. He criticized Republican Gov. Rick Perry as a divisive chief executive who wastes more time campaigning and ""railing about things he can't control"" than he does working on state problems like education and controlling dropout rates and making college more affordable. ""Leadership is not dividing people into teams… leadership is finding common ground,"" White said.The candidate said education would be the state's top priority if he's elected, and said Perry is understating the number of students who drop out of high school every year. ""We should treat someone dropping out of school as an emergency, like we treat a broken leg,"" White said.He said the state needs a long-term plan to promote excellence in education, expanding Texas Grants, making school more affordable and making the schools themselves more productive and efficient. ""Don't tell me there aren't some people [there] who haven't retired on the job,"" he said. The state can't afford to ""export"" its best students to out-of-state schools like the University of Georgia, Oklahoma, and LSU, he said. ""We ought to be importing people who are better educated,"" he said. The state should combine limits on increases in tuition with commitments to provide adequate state funding to offset costs, he said.The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one .""This is a great state, but there's dark clouds on the horizon if we don't train and educate our people,"" he said.He criticized the across-the-board five percent budget cuts ordered by state leaders as ""Soviet-style budgeting,"" and touted his record as mayor of Houston, saying the city kept its budget balanced by reacting more quickly to signs of economic downturn, and accomplished cuts with ""productivity improvements"" and renegotiated contracts with vendors and other measures. ""You don't do it with some memo across the board,"" he said, referring to a letter from Perry, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and House Speaker Joe Straus III to state agencies last year.Dewhurst said the Democrat is trying to generate headlines. ""We asked state agencies to tighten their belts and identify five percent savings, without eliminating any essential services,"" the lieutenant governor said in a statement. ""Now, more than ever, Texans are looking for leaders who are willing to make the right decisions and practice prudent fiscal discipline, instead of grandstanding.""White danced around questions on taxes, neither promising to cut them nor to leave them where they are. ""Until you look under the hood… you shouldn't be making that decision,"" he said.That earned him a towel snap from Perry spokesman Mark Miner. “Bill White has a tax problem — he won’t rule out raising taxes for Texans and refuses to release his own tax returns,"" Miner said in a press release. ""His opposition to transparency raises questions about what he is afraid of and what he is hiding regarding his own personal fortune and how he may have profited during his six years as Houston’s mayor.”White dismissed a memo from Dave Carney , Perry's New Hampshire-based chief political consultant, that outlined a line of attack the Republican might pursue against the Democrat. ""Where does he live?"" White joked. ""He's from… New England?""The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one .Carney's memo describes White as a trial lawyer. That's true or not, White said, depending on the definition. ""I have tried cases. I represented businesses… If you say, 'plaintiff's personal injury trial lawyer,' it's not true."" Another Carney suggestion is that White doesn't support gun rights. White disagrees with that characterization, too: ""I support the Second Amendment. I own guns. I don't want to take guns away,"" he said. He expressed concerns about guns in the hands of street gangs but said, ""I don't think we need any new gun laws.""White tried to put some distance between himself and Democratic President Barack Obama, saying ""I hope every president should succeed,"" but adding that he disagrees with Obama about ""the debt, the whole fiscal management of the country."" He compared the debt with the problems in education in Texas. ""We shouldn't eat our seed corn,"" he said. ""… we need to be building for the future and making sure our kids aren't burdened by our spending.""He was critical of Perry's transportation planning, saying the governor has spent too much time on roads designed to move 18-wheelers across the state and too little on mobility for people in major urban and suburban areas. He made an example of transportation debt that's to be paid back using money that would otherwise go to maintenance and operations of roads. ""I don't know what you call that, but it's not conservative,"" White said.He'd like to phase out diversions from the highway fund that provide money to non-highway spending in the state budget, says the state should leave more transportation decision-making to local officials — even letting them do some contracting themselves, and said funding should come from public equity and public debt unless there's proof that other financing is cheaper.And he was critical of Perry's claims of job creation and his boasts that he's responsible for the state's relatively healthy economy. White said unemployment in Texas, in raw numbers, is at a historic high. He said he doesn't blame the governor for that, but also doesn't credit Perry for the state's job growth in recent years, saying ""it sounds like somebody taking credit for somebody else's work."" Some of the job creation the governor claims, for instance, is attributable to local officials, he said, like White himself. He said Houston's growth exceeded the state's until the current downturn, and said they did it ""without giving away tax money.""White said he won't grandstand if elected, suggesting by inference that the current governor does just that. ""I will try to avoid hot air politics.""Texas Tribune donors or members may be quoted or mentioned in our stories, or may be the subject of them.

http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2014/jul/20/blog-posting/bloggers-claim-feds-sued-company-requiring-workers/	The Obama Administration is suing a Wisconsin company for forcing employees to speak English.	mostly false	['Labor', 'Workers']	http://www.rightwingnews.com/	http://www.rightwingnews.com/immigration/feds-suing-county-in-wisconsin-for-requiring-workers-to-speak-english/	2014/07/20	0You’d think for a job in the United States, speaking fluent English would be not only a benefit, it would be a requirement. One Wisconsin county thinks so — and that requirement is getting them sued by the federal government .The United States government is actually suing a private American business for discriminating against Hispanic and Asian employees because they don’t speak English on the job.It involves a Green Bay Wisconsin metal and plastic manufacturer that fired a group of Hmong and Hispanic workers over their English skills, “even though those skills were not needed to perform their jobs,” according to the feds. More importantly, forcing employees to speak English in the U.S. violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, says the Obama administration.×101 Things All Young Adults Should Knowby Sir John HawkinsJohn Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters.Buy NowHere’s the twisted explanation from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency that enforces the nation’s workplace discrimination laws; the Civil Rights Act protects employees from discrimination based on national origin, which includes the linguistic characteristics of a national origin group. Therefore, according to this reasoning, foreigners have the right to speak their native language even during work hours at an American company that requires English.Requirements of English fluency and so-called English only rules are often implemented to make what is really discrimination appear acceptable, says the government attorney handling this case. “But superficial appearances are not fooling anyone,” he assures. “When speaking English fluently is not, in fact, required for the safe and effective performance of a job, nor for the successful operation of the employer’s business, requiring employees to be fluent in English usually constitutes employment discrimination on the basis of national origin – and thus violates federal law.”Have you ever heard anything more ridiculous?! Between this, and enabling the flooding of our borders by illegal immigrants, it’s enough to make one wonder what Obama’s intentions actually are.		1

Copy may not be in its final form.AMY GOODMAN: Congressman Grayson, I assume you heard the story of the gyrocopter that landed on the White House lawn [Capitol lawn]. This mailman named Doug Hughes, basically a flying bicycle, landed on the lawn. He expected to be blown out of the air. But he said he was doing this for campaign finance reform. He had a letter to every member of Congress. I want to ask you, how much does the money that is going to your fellow Democrats and Republicans determine their support for TPP?REP. ALAN GRAYSON: It’s decisive. I am the only member of the House of Representatives—there are 435 of us—AMY GOODMAN: Rather, he landed on the lawn of the U.S. Capitol, so it was even closer to you.REP. ALAN GRAYSON: That’s right. I’m the only member of the House of Representatives who raised most of his campaign funds in the last election from small contributions of less than $200. Thousands of people came to our website, CongressmanWithGuts.com , and made contributions. I am one—one—out of 435. On the other side of the building, over at the U.S. Senate, there’s only one member of the U.S. Senate who raised most of his campaign from some small contributions. That’s Bernie Sanders, who you heard earlier in this broadcast. That tells you something. In fact, to a large degree, in both parties, because of the absence of campaign finance reform, the place is bought and paid for. And the only question is: Do the members stay bought? That’s what the corporate lobbyists stay up late at night wondering about: Is that member going to stay bought?Now, I was actually in the courtroom when this disastrous Citizens United decision was decided five years ago. Mitch McConnell was two seats to my left. We were the only public officials who were in the courtroom. Mitch McConnell was the happiest I have ever seen him that day. He was literally chortling when the decision was rendered. And I said on MSNBC that night five years ago that if we do nothing, you can kiss this country goodbye. Well, pucker up, because right now the millionaires and the billionaires and the multinational corporations are calling the shots with whatever they want in TPP, whatever they want in fast track—more generally, whatever they want. They get the bailouts. They get the tax breaks. They get the so-called deregulation. They get what they want here because they get what they pay for.AMY GOODMAN: Congressman Grayson, very quickly, Bernie Sanders hasn’t yet officially announced that he’s running for president, but what about you? Senator Rubio has announced he is running for president. Will you be running for his seat in Florida?REP. ALAN GRAYSON: I’m giving it a lot of attention. The answer is probably yes, but I haven’t made up my mind yet once and for all. I hope to do that soon.AMY GOODMAN: Well, we want to thank you for being with us, Congressman Alan Grayson, Democrat of Florida’s 9th Congressional District, and Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch.This is Democracy Now!

America needs to get back in control of its own destiny. We are vulnerable to outside forces due to our dangerous levels of debt, burdensome taxes on job creators, and counterproductive energy policies.While pessimism about our current state of affairs is understandable in these challenging times, we can restore confidence and the promise of opportunity for the next generation by taking the necessary steps now. We can once again make America a country where young people graduating from college are limited only by their imagination, hard work and ingenuity.The Blueprint for Americas Comeback is a pro-growth plan of action to get our country back on course by focusing on jobs, competitiveness, freedom and opportunity.Making America Competitive for Job Creators. Key to Americas growth is reducing the U.S. tax on job-creating businesses currently one of the highest in the world to a competitive 20 percent. With this one policy change, America can begin attracting new investment and expansion in the U.S. and allow U.S. businesses, large and small, to raise wages and create over 5 million more jobs over the next 10 years. The Blueprint further helps the economy grow and create jobs with a tax code that is more fair and simple, including a Flat Tax option for individual taxpayers; new tools to put a check on overzealous regulators; and a focus on educating and training Americans to compete for and succeed in the good-paying, high-skill, high-knowledge jobs of the 21st Century.Unleashing Americas Plentiful Energy Resources and Creativity. America can and should do more to conserve energy and apply our ingenuity to bring affordable alternative or renewable sources of energy to market. At the same time, lets not forget that we have the most plentiful resources in the world right under our land and water. Reversing current counterproductive energy policies not only will put America on a path toward energy freedom, it has the potential to create over a million new jobs, add over two trillion dollars to the revenue side of the governments balance sheet without raising taxes, promote national security and help preserve our quality of life which is being threatened by skyrocketing gas prices.Reining in the Over-Reaching, Over-Spending Federal Government. With the national debt at $14 trillion and growing at an alarming rate, America urgently needs to take control of our financial destiny. The Blueprint imposes the fiscal discipline of a Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment on Washington, with Line-Item Veto authority, tax limitation, and taxpayer protection that limits spending to 19 percent of GDP. Under the Blueprints Paycheck Penalty Act, Members of Congress must complete work on appropriations bills on time in order to get paid. The Blueprint reverses the excesses of the Obama Administration, including repealing Obamacare and replacing it with personal, affordable health-care opportunities. The Blueprint further takes aim at wasteful Washington spending with government management reforms modeled after recommendations of Virginias Blue Ribbon Strike Force; a hiring freeze to stop the expansion of bureaucracy and help roll back federal spending to FY 2008 levels; and expansion of the successful welfare reform model to Medicaid and other welfare programs such as food stamps. Recognizing that Medicare taxes and premiums cover only a little more than half the programs actual cost, we must make needed improvements to preserve Medicare for current and future seniors and protect the program from going broke.The path America is on today is dangerous and unsustainable; it will diminish our childrens future and their ability to achieve the American Dream. This Blueprint will change that trajectory and spark an American comeback with a competitive economy that is growing and creating jobs in a country that has so long stood for freedom and opportunity.Continue reading the Blueprint for Americas Comeback 		0

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CANDY CROWLEY, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): Too few? Too many? Too late? Iraq redux. Too few? Too many? Too late? Iraq redux. Today, Senators Rand Paul and Dianne Feinstein on Iraq, the risks of returning, the price of staying home. BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The issue that I keep front and center is, what is in the national security interests of the United States of America? CROWLEY: And 40 years later, Watergate summer. RICHARD NIXON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This principle of confidentiality of presidential conversations is at stake in the question of these tapes. CROWLEY: Bob Woodward And Carl Bernstein join us to talk then and now. Plus: REP. PAUL RYAN (R), WISCONSIN: I just -- I don't believe it. That's your problem. Nobody believes you. CROWLEY: Disappearing IRS e-mails, fading presidential poll numbers and the omnipresent Hillary Clinton, our political panel weighs in. This is STATE OF THE UNION. (END VIDEOTAPE) CROWLEY: Good morning from Washington. I'm Candy Crowley. Four more Iraqi towns have fallen to ISIS, an Islamist militia that is plowing its way through Iraq on the way to Baghdad, this as the initial group of U.S. military advisers is expected to arrive soon in Iraq. Joining me now, Senator Rand Paul, Republican from Kentucky. A rare treat to find you in town, so thanks for being here. SEN. RAND PAUL (R), KENTUCKY: Good morning. CROWLEY: Looking at the situation in Iraq as it is now, what would President Paul do? PAUL: I think we have to understand first how got here and then we have to decide as a country where we are going. I think there's chaos in the Middle East, and I think the chaos is because we have created a vacuum. Before the Iraq war, I think there was somewhat of a standoff between Sunni and Shiite, had been for maybe 1,000 years off and on. But now we have a chaotic situation. We have a vacuum. And I think one of the reasons why ISIS has been emboldened is because we have been arming their allies. We have been allied with ISIS in Syria. They have had a safe haven because we have been arming the rebels to keep Assad away from them. And now they go back and forth. So I think our intervention in Syria has led precisely... (CROSSTALK) PAUL: ... Iraq. CROWLEY: You know, it may have, Senator. But when one's sitting in the Oval Office, you have to think, what do we do now? So, does -- would a President Paul at this moment send U.S. advisers and say, go and see what we can do to help the Iraqi army? Would a President Paul say, I might do airstrikes? PAUL: I think the first thing you would have to do is follow the Constitution. The Constitution says that Congress decides. The president doesn't have the unilateral authority to begin war. And... CROWLEY: But do you think it is a good idea? PAUL: Well, here is what I would say, is... CROWLEY: Some of your Republican colleagues... PAUL: ... this is an incredibly important point. The Reagan doctrine for how we go to war is that you should have a consensus of the people. So, there needs to be a full-throated debate, a full-throated debate in Congress, and Congress has to decide. Militarily, we could go back in. The surge worked. Obviously, we have the military might and power. But the country as a whole has to decide, do we want to send 100,000 troops in? Are we willing to have 4,500 young Americans die to save a city like Mosul that the Shiites won't even save, that they have fled? CROWLEY: What does Rand Paul think at this point? PAUL: No ground troops. I think that we need to see... CROWLEY: Right. And I think most everybody agrees. How about airstrikes? PAUL: I think we need to see what the Shiites will do to defend themselves. If the Shiites aren't willing to fight for their country, it may be that their country is not going to exist. CROWLEY: You know, because by the time you hold a plebiscite and find out how people feel about Iraq, by the time you get Congress to do anything, it is two weeks later, and the ISIS is sitting in Baghdad. PAUL: Right. CROWLEY: So you're going to have to move pretty quickly here. But you're against airstrikes? PAUL: Well, there are times -- there are times when we -- when a president would move quickly, to dispel an imminent threat to our country. But where I disagree with the president is, his theory in Libya was that that there was an imminent threat to Benghazi. That's not what an imminent threat is. It's an imminent threat to our country. And so what I would say is that the Shiites who are ripping their uniforms off and running need to stand up and fight. And could we assist them in some way? I'm not ruling that out. But I would first wait to see, are the Shiites going to fight for their country or not? CROWLEY: Let me play you something that one of your Republican colleagues said, Senator Marco Rubio. He was talking about why this is important, and he does believe that national security is at stake. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), FLORIDA: The reason why we care is because we cannot allow a safe haven to develop there that can be used to carry out attacks that can kill Americans, including here in our homeland. (END VIDEO CLIP) CROWLEY: So, do you believe that the ISIS is a national security threat to the United States? PAUL: Well, do you know where the safe haven is? The safe haven's in Syria. So, those who have been... (CROSSTALK) PAUL: Let me -- let me finish, because the thing is, is that they would not be empowered and in Iraq if we were not providing safe haven in Syria by arming their allies. CROWLEY: So should we go to Syria? I mean, the thing is, we kind of are where we are. So, the question is whether they're a threat. PAUL: No. No. Well, we are where we are because -- we are where we are because we armed the Syrian rebels. We have been fighting alongside al Qaeda, fighting alongside ISIS. ISIS is now emboldened and in two countries. But here's the anomaly. We're with ISIS in Syria. We're on the same side of the war. So, those who want to get involved to stop ISIS in Iraq are allied with ISIS in Syria. That is the real contradiction to this whole policy. CROWLEY: Right. Many of your Republican colleagues would argue that what we should have done in Syria was get rid of Assad, and that would have stopped ISIS in its tracks. But... PAUL: But -- no, but we have done this. Look at Libya. We went into Libya and we got rid of that terrible Gadhafi. Now it is a jihadist wonderland over there. There's jihadists everywhere. If we were to get rid of Assad, it would be a jihadist wonderland in Syria. It's now a jihadist wonderland in Iraq, precisely because we got overinvolved, not because we had too little involvement, but too much involvement. CROWLEY: And here we are. Can a terrorist haven in Iraq -- does a terrorist haven in Iraq, which it may be soon, threaten the national security of the U.S., yes or no? PAUL: It could -- well, it could at some point. I would say, right now, if you are a member of ISIS, you're looking at the Shiites right in front of you and the battles you are fighting. I don't believe that ISIS is right now in the middle of a battle saying, hmm, I think we're going to send intercontinental ballistic missiles to America. So could they be a threat? Yes. But what I would say is... CROWLEY: Shouldn't we stop them now? PAUL: Well, we should have not armed them. If we wouldn't have armed them in Syria, maybe they wouldn't... (CROSSTALK) PAUL: ... in Iraq. CROWLEY: That's the past, right, but now? PAUL: So, the past -- the past is six months ago. CROWLEY: Right. PAUL: The past -- the past is still the current as well. It is the present. We are still arming the radical Islamic rebels in Syria. So, the homeland -- they are going back and forth across the border. They go back into Syria, and that is a homeland that we are helping to defend for them. CROWLEY: But what would you do? How do you stop that? PAUL: Well, let's not be involved in a Syrian civil war, and let's not be involved in the Iraq civil war. I think that... CROWLEY: So, out altogether? PAUL: Well, no, what I would say... (CROSSTALK) PAUL: No, what I would say is that Maliki is an ally, although here's the thing, is, they think they are going to create stability by pushing Maliki out in the middle of a war. So, we push him out and then we have another power vacuum and nobody leading the country at all. What I would say is, and my prediction is that Maliki will stand up and the Shiites will stand up, that ISIS will not be able to take Baghdad, and there will be a civil war over there. But there will be a civil war with feckless people on one side that aren't necessarily great allies of ours, who are allies of Iran, and on the other side, allies of al Qaeda. You have to ask yourself, are you willing to send your son, am I willing to send my son to retake back a city, Mosul, that they weren't willing to defend themselves? I'm not willing to send my son into that mess. CROWLEY: Let me move you to a different subject. And that is, you are working with Senator Cory Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey, on reestablishing federal voting rights to nonviolent felons who have served parole and et cetera. What -- what -- of all the issues facing Congress at this point, what draws you to that? Is this about Republican inroads into minority communities? PAUL: As I have traveled about the country and within my state talking to people, I found a number of people -- in fact, as I have explored the issue, there's nearly a million people in our country who have lost their voting rights. In Kentucky, you lose your voting rights forever. I have a friend whose brother grew marijuana plants 30 years ago in college, has a felony conviction, and still cannot vote 30 years ago. I think that's wrong and unfair. Republicans, I think, have been unfairly tarred as, oh, trying to suppress vote. Here's a Republican who wants to enhance the vote. This is a much bigger problem than anything else limiting voting right now. Nearly a million people can't vote. And I want to help people get their right to vote back. CROWLEY: And, as we know, African-Americans, percentage-wise, certainly make up a larger percentage of folks being incarcerated. I think the NAACP has estimated about a third of young black males are in jail. Is this a way for the Republican Party to begin outreach, which they have said for decades they needed to do, into minority communities? PAUL: Well, I think it is both. I believe in the issue, but you are right. It is opening the door for me to talk to communities. Three out of four people in prison are black or brown for nonviolent drug use. However, when you do surveys, white kids are doing drugs at an equal rate, and they are a much bigger part of the population. So, why are the prisons full of black and brown kids? It is easier to arrest them. It is easier to convict them. They don't get as good of attorneys. And, frankly, they live in the city in a much more collected fashion than in the suburbs, and so the police are patrolling the city more. But it is unfair. The war on drugs has had a racial outcome, unintentionally, but it has a racial outcome. And I want to try to fix it. CROWLEY: And we should say, your bill in fact does change some drug laws in order to try to even out the punishment for similar drugs. PAUL: Yes. Yes. CROWLEY: Last question, quickly, just because this brings up the whole idea of voter registration and getting people out to vote. Hillary Clinton recently proposed that there should be an automatic registering of voters once they turn 18. What do you think? PAUL: I think voting should require a little bit of effort, but I am for people voting. Registration is not as big a deal for me, how we do it. In fact, I have talked with other senators about maybe online registration to make it easier. But voting needs to be in person. I don't like the concept of, you don't even have to get off your couch to vote. So, I am for going to the polls. But I'm also giving their voting rights back. And I'm for everyone voting, no matter who you are, whether you're Democrat, Republican, independent. I think more, the better. CROWLEY: Senator Rand Paul, some of your proposals coming up in the Senate this week, I understand. PAUL: Yes. CROWLEY: So, we will be watching that closely. PAUL: Thank you. CROWLEY: Thank you so much for being here. PAUL: Thank you. CROWLEY: Next up: Senator Dianne Feinstein has seen the intelligence on Iraq for more than a decade. She will tell us if the U.S. dropped the ball again. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: There's no amount of American firepower that's going to be able to hold the country together, and I made that very clear to Mr. Maliki and all the other leadership inside of Iraq. (END VIDEO CLIP) CROWLEY: Joining me now, Senator Dianne Feinstein. She is chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Thank you for being here. SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-CA), SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIR: You're welcome. CROWLEY: And that's where I want to begin, because I -- I didn't take a poll or anything, but I imagine that most Americans were surprised to learn 10 days ago or a week ago that something called the ISIS had taken over a third of Iraq. Did U.S. intelligence spot this problem? Did you know of it ahead of time? And was the severity of it obvious through the intelligence? FEINSTEIN: Well, obviously, we know about ISIS. We have seen its developments in Syria. We're aware of the fact that they are recruiting fighters in Europe. There have been arrests in Spain, France and Germany. They have tried to assassinate the head of security in Beirut. And they were responsible for the killing of three or four people at a Brussels synagogue. They are vicious. They have killed thousands of people. They have cut off heads. They are a major threat. CROWLEY: So, we knew they were a brutal bunch and a major threat. FEINSTEIN: We knew they were a brutal bunch. CROWLEY: Did we know that a third of Iraq could be taken over so quickly? Did we see that coming? FEINSTEIN: I would have to say no. But I think it is a real wakeup call for the United States, because they do want to develop the caliphate. They do want to -- and they now have just about destroyed the border with Syria. I think the president is doing the right thing. He's being a bit circumspect. He's being thoughtful. I think we're building our so-called ISR assets... CROWLEY: Right. FEINSTEIN: ... so that some pinpointed action can be taken. But I think the most important thing that I can say today is that the Iraqi state, as a state, is in danger, that there is a limited period of time, that Ayatollah Ali Sistani and his message that we cannot repeat the mistakes of the past, that this Iraqi government, newly reorganizing, has to move and develop a coterie of leaders that can quickly reach out and reconcile, or else we are in the middle of a major Sunni-Shia war. That's my hope. (CROSSTALK) CROWLEY: Right. Now, let me -- let me just go back to the first point. It is a little startling to me that, after some intelligence failures in the past, that the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee says, yes, it was a surprise to find out that it could move that quickly and kind of buzz their way through Sunni territories quick, but, nonetheless, so quickly and get so close to Baghdad. What happened here? Isn't here -- does that upset you? Is that a failure? FEINSTEIN: Well, let's look at this practically. You either have to have the technical means up in the sky or in other places, or you have to have assets, people who will give you human intelligence. This is a different culture. It is very difficult to pierce. The piercing, intelligence-wise, from the position of human intelligence, has been very difficult all along. So I think there is a view that, well, we're always going to criticize. And we just can't do this. We have to build up the diversity of our intelligence assets and see that they're adequate. (CROSSTALK) CROWLEY: ... a local culture. (CROSSTALK) FEINSTEIN: Yes, we have lackings in North -- North Africa, in Yemen. The world is a big place, Candy. And this is extraordinarily difficult to do. CROWLEY: Is the ISIS an immediate threat to U.S. homeland security? FEINSTEIN: Well, I believe it can be. I believe that they're recruiting in Europe, there's no question, in these three places, Spain, Germany, the number of passport fighters. We know there are at least 100 Americans that have gone to the arena to fight who have an American passport, who are going to try to get back. We know that they can go back to the European country, and, if it is a visa waiver country, come right in to the United States. So this is where I think we need to build our intelligence to see that we can disrupt the plot in this country before it happens, because there will be plots to kill Americans. CROWLEY: And, worst-case scenario, ISIS runs through Baghdad, you get the sectarian war that you are talking about, Iraq becomes a terrorist haven. What's the U.S. contingency plan here for a group that you say threatens U.S. shores? FEINSTEIN: Well, what is the U.S. contingency plan for this? Candidly, I don't know what the U.S. contingency plan is for a complete takeover of Syria and Iraq. I do know that what we're on the foot of is a major Sunni-Shia war. So, the question comes -- what John Kerry is doing is important. He's in Cairo. Hopefully, he's going to meet with the -- with Qatar, with Saudi Arabia, with other Sunni nations and say, look, we need your help. At the same time, I think -- and this is my view -- that we should be talking with Iran. You have to realize, Sunnis are in the majority in the world, and the Shia now, with the mobilization of Muqtada Sadr's Mahdi army, that will be tens of thousands of Shiite fighters. And we are on the verge of something very serious. And I think we have to meet it. I think our allies have to help us. And I think Iran can play a major role in moving out Maliki and developing a reconciliation government. That is if there is the desire to maintain Iraq as a state. CROWLEY: The supreme leader in Iran has said the U.S. needs to stay out of this, Maliki can handle this, Iraqi troops can handle this. How much credence should we give that? FEINSTEIN: Well, I think we should stay out of it right now. I think the reconciliation has to be done through a new government in Iraq. And it has to be effective. We have got to keep the Kurds. We have got to enable them to have some share of oil, get outstanding tax receipts. Do those kinds of things. And I think there has to be Sunni participation in the government. Otherwise, it is a real problem. CROWLEY: And, finally, I have to ask you. The former Governor of Montana Brian Schweitzer, a fellow Democrat, was discussing your role in the NSA and surveillance, et cetera, et cetera, and what you knew and didn't know, but used really unflattering terms, likening you to something which I'm not going to repeat, because everybody can look it up on Google. I know that you said he better not come in a room with my husband. Brian Schweitzer has apologized. But I want to know just flat-out, what was your first reaction when they told you what he said? FEINSTEIN: Well, my first action -- reaction was that I laughed, to tell you the truth. And he's got a -- clearly, a rather large mouth, and all sorts of things come out. I think that's really too bad, but it is the way it is. CROWLEY: It is the way it is, and women kind of -- that have been in power for a long time understand, sometimes, these sorts of things happen. FEINSTEIN: Yes, exactly. Yes. CROWLEY: Let me just ask you quickly, has he called you to apologize? FEINSTEIN: No. CROWLEY: Would that help? FEINSTEIN: No. It -- but it says something, doesn't it? CROWLEY: It does. Senator Dianne Feinstein, thank you so much. Happy birthday to you on this day. FEINSTEIN: Well, thank you very much. CROWLEY: And we appreciate your coming... FEINSTEIN: Thank you. CROWLEY: ... and sharing a part of your birthday with us. FEINSTEIN: Thank you. I appreciate that, Candy. CROWLEY: Thank you. FEINSTEIN: Thank you. CROWLEY: Now, what is the one thing George W. Bush warned about Iraq before he left office? Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein have the answer, and they're next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CROWLEY: Joining me now, two journalists whose reporting brought down President Nixon and forever changed the relationship between politicians and the media, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, out with the 40th edition of their book ""All the President's Men."" Goodness, 40 years. (LAUGHTER) CROWLEY: Makes me tired thinking of it. CARL BERNSTEIN, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well put. CROWLEY: I wanted to start with the subject du jour, which is Iraq and what's going on in Iraq. And in ""The War Within, what you wrote about what was going on inside the Bush administration when these decisions were being made, you said, ""'Not as a Democrat or as a Republican, but as the president"" -- this is you to Bush -- ""What are you going to say to the new leader"" -- Obama -- ""about what you are handing off in Iraq?' He"" -- President Bush -- ""thought about it for a moment. 'What I will say is, don't let it fail.'"" BOB WOODWARD, ""THE WASHINGTON POST"": Yes. Wasn't that interesting? CROWLEY: Yes. So, I think my question to you both first is, knowing what we know now, is Iraq failing? And write me some history already. Who's going to get blamed for it? WOODWARD: Well, everyone is to blame. And it's clearly a mess. But, if you look at it, I mean, as Senator Feinstein said, they didn't really see this coming. I think, in our business, the news business, we didn't do enough reporting. We kind of absorbed President Obama's state of mind. Oh, well, it's over. We're getting out. And, clearly, it is not over. And so, again, this goes back to the fundamentals of journalism. Did we spend enough time in Iraq? Did we really do the excavation to understand what was going on and what was U.S. policy and really what was driving it? CROWLEY: And apparently... (CROSSTALK) CROWLEY: ... Syria. BERNSTEIN: We have to go back to -- back to the original war in Iraq, when the press did the same thing. We went to war under false pretenses. President Bush took us there, he and Cheney, the neoconservatives. And we hadn't done our homework about the realities of what was going on in Iraq about weapons of mass destruction. And this is one of the great disasters ongoing now through two administrations, through two terms of two administrations each, a great disaster for this country. CROWLEY: So, if President Bush clearly got us into this, do you both -- now, as you know, there is this great war going on between Republicans and Democrats, well, he lost Iraq. When we look at it 10 years from now, is one responsible for getting us in and the other responsible for not getting us out properly? WOODWARD: Well, I think if you look at -- and, again, this is reporting. And I agree with Carl, and I fault myself mightily on the weapons of mass destruction belief we had at the time of the war. And I and people in -- I, in particular, should have been much more aggressive on this. But we should have been aggressive when the president said, oh, we're getting out. There were people in the military strongly advocating, let's keep 10,000 troops there as an insurance policy. And we know we -- we all live on insurance policies. And this is a case where they didn't do it. Would it have solved the problem and made that much of a difference? We don't know. But the experts, the generals were saying -- I mean they were almost on their knees, keep some troops here and we left zero. CROWLEY: (INAUDIBLE) Carl, a former vice president, Dick Cheney, threw sort of gasoline on the fire this week, wrote an op-ed in the ""Wall Street Journal."" Among other things -- this was titled ""The Collapsing Obama Doctrine."" He and his daughter Liz wrote, ""Terrorists take control of more territory and resources than ever before in history, and he goes golfing. He seems blithely unaware or indifferent to the fact, that a resurgent al Qaeda presents a clear and present danger to the United States of America."" I don't even have to ask you a question, do I? BERNSTEIN: Well, actually, there really is something off the wall about what Cheney is doing and saying here given his responsibility for this. I think the psychiatrist would call it projection. Blaming President Obama for this morass that we are in, largely of his and his colleagues' making but Bob is absolutely right here. You said about 10 years. What's it going to look like 10 years from now? We don't know but we need to start doing real reporting in this town about what the hell is going on and start to come up with a notion of how various institutions are addressing real problems in real time. We're not doing it. I mean, if you look at everything we've seen on this show this morning, it is indicative of that. WOODWARD: Yes. And if you look at the Eric Cantor loss, primary loss, ending his career as the house majority leader in a district in Richmond that there should have been reporters all over that story and everyone was caught by surprise because people weren't there, people weren't knocking on doors, people were not listen in this -- the theme here is not listening and not taking the time, sitting at the computer, looking for a clever tweet or to say something on a blog rather than going out -- when we were working together on the Nixon case, we could work two or three weeks on a story. Editors would look at a draft and say, now wait, what about this? Get more sources. Drive in to this, make sure you are on solid ground. Now if you have an advance on a story, they're in your office saying get it on the Web site in one hour. CROWLEY: Exactly. And do you -- I mean, it is a matter, first of all, sometimes of economics. We all know papers, as well as cable broadcast, everybody is working with limited budgets now and yet, you know, more and more you see all of these things. It reminds you that Watergate was such a template for a scandal, right? In the sense of now everything that somebody wants to have appear like a scandal or is a scandal ""gate"" comes at the end of it. In your opinion, what is out there that's a real ""gate""? Are there other Watergates out there and we are simply missing them or do we actually know what they are and just aren't -- BERNSTEIN: I think we ought to get back to basics. It's interesting where this whole discussion is going. Let's look at what this 40th anniversary edition of ""All the President's Men"" is. What is this book? It is really a kind of primer about basic reporting if you look at it after 40 years. Yes, it shows that the Nixon administration and President Nixon was a criminal president such as we've never had in our existence in this country. It was a criminal presidency from his first days in office until the end. And it's the same time you see an institution of the press, not through a lot of hocus-pocus, not through spending a fortune, incidentally, through very basic -- we were very low paid at the time. And what did we do? We went out and knocked on a bunch of doors at night of people who worked for are President Nixon and his re- election committee. And voila, what happened? Well, people wanted to tell the truth as they saw it and we sat there and listened. It is kind of basic. And I think if you look at the way resources are distributed around this town particularly now, journalistic resources, I'm not so sure the problem is institutional lack of financial support. I'm not sure what all of these thousands of reporters -- I don't want to sound like an old guy complaining here -- which, maybe I am -- I'm not sure what they're doing. So much is going into commentary. What are the institutions that have a fortune that could finance more reporting than we've ever seen in the history of the business? The three television networks. They require that their news divisions make money like they're entertainment divisions. They could finance 400 reporters each of those networks. WOODWARD: And to answer your question about what's out there, I mean take Benghazi, a highly politicized issue. And I've looked at all those e-mails that were released. It takes a day to make sense of them. And if you dig into it, there are unanswered questions. And Hillary Clinton was out saying, oh, you know, I'm not going to deal with this, this is politics, and so forth, and she's modified her position saying, there are things we don't know. There are unanswered questions. And Carl's exactly right, you put 10 people on that and you say, go to work. You don't have to give me the answers tomorrow or the next day, but take your time. The same on the IRS scandal. That is a real issue. Some people should move to Cincinnati and get hotel rooms and say, we're going to talk to everyone who worked in that division of the IRS. BERNSTEIN: Also, as happened in Watergate, let some Democrats get up and say, we want a real bipartisan investigation of what happened in Cincinnati, in the IRS. Get it out in the hands of the Republican grandstanders who are trying to make political points instead of conduct a serious investigation, and put together and start to get some facts as happened in Watergate. CROWLEY: Carl Bernstein, Bob Woodward, we are coming up on the 40th anniversary of the resignation of Richard Nixon. I hope you'll come back in August. And by the way, the book is tremendous. I mean, not just journalism students. Everybody ought to read it again if they haven't already but it is a great book. Thank you both for being here. IRS e-mails wanted by Congress go missing. Does the agency's explanation pass the smell test and what does it mean for the fall election elections? Our panel is next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CROWLEY: Joining me around the table, S.E Cupp, host of CNN's ""CROSSFIRE."" Penny Lee, Democratic strategist and former adviser to Senator Harry Reid. Republican pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson, and CNN political commentator, Donna Brazile. Thank you for being here. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Good morning. CROWLEY: So, I want to pick up where Woodward and Bernstein left off, which was with the IRS. Just from a political point of view, I found it fascinating that Paul Ryan, who may or may not want to run for president in 2016, Republican, basically said to the IRS guy after we learned about the missing e-mails, you know, no one believes you, you know, you're not believable and I don't believe you. That struck me as kind of a moment in the campaign. S.E. CUPP, CNN CROSSFIRE HOST: Yes. Paul Ryan is not a grandstander. He's not one of the guys that takes every opportunity he gets to have a moment. This struck me as very genuine and what I get the sense is, Paul Ryan went home to Wisconsin and heard from a lot of angry constituents. And the American people feel as though they've been stone walled on the IRS from the beginning. The administration was quick to offer up low leveled bureaucrats in the Cincinnati office that never passed the smell test. Then we got Lois Lerner who clammed up, wouldn't say anything. And now suddenly the emails are gone. So, I think that was a very visceral reaction to probably reactions (INAUDIBLE). DONNA BRAZILE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: But the Republicans are hell-bent on finding a conspiracy or identifying a scandal so they have something to talk about rather than jobs and the economy which most Americans want to talk about. The only lie here is to lie that I think conservatives are telling and saying that somehow another this was a conspiracy against conservatives. They also investigated liberal groups, groups that have progressive in their name, groups that had Israel in its name. So the IRS was basically looking at everybody because they were trying to figure out where all of this fake, phony, secretive money was flowing in the last election cycle. KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: (INAUDIBLE) then what doesn't make sense is why not just be forthcoming? Why did the emails disappear? I think that's the problem. If conservatives are - (CROSSTALK) ANDERSON: If conservative are really wrong (ph), if these are all really scandals where there's no (INAUDIBLE) then these consistent sort of e-mails, the dog ate my homework is sort of a bizarre response. But I think that's why there are a lot of -- BRAZILE: 67,000 e-mails between 2009 and 2011. Then there was a crash in June of 2011 on the hard drive. Any of us with computers know that sometimes they fail. That's why I switch computers. (CROSSTALK) CROWLEY: (INAUDIBLE) computer think it never goes away that's (INAUDIBLE). PENNY LEE, FORMER DIRECTOR, DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION: I think the irony was almost too rich. I mean, here is the one department had asked for you to keep five, six, seven, eight, 10 years' worth of receipts. And then all of a sudden the dog ate their homework and all of it couldn't be revealed. I actually think in this case the administration would do right to bring forth an independent auditor themselves to say, where is it? And if the hard drive has in fact crashed and the records aren't there, have that independent validator validate that point because right now we are in a little bit of a morass. There is some question being called into it. Rightly so. And so I think that would actually bode well to the administration CROWLEY: How about being proactive? Because otherwise, I think Democrats maybe are looking at a fall. Let's see the pre-election period of Benghazi and IRS? BRAZILE: Candy, I don't think so. There are so many unknowns between now and November 4th. And so I don't think those are the only two issues. Those are the two issues that the Republicans feel comfortable talking about because they have no (ph) other (ph) - (CROSSTALK) CROWLEY: I don't think the voters are (INAUDIBLE). BRAZILE: They don't want to talk about substance. They don't want to have a deep conversation about what do we do now in terms of the economy. This is all about let's find a scandal, let's find a gap, let's find something else -- (CROSSTALK) CUPP: Donna, no offense. No offense. BRAZILE: I won't take offense at you. CUPP: You don't have to go very far to find the scandal. I mean, whether it's the IRS, which is looking very, very real now. I mean conspiracy theories are not. It is getting really hard to believe anything that we hear. You have the V.A. scandal which has not gone away. We have not gotten to the bottom of that. That's a non-partisan scandal. That is a horrifying situation and the American people want answers. You have Iraq is exploding. There is a lot, unfortunately for the American people to think about in addition to jobs and the economy. BRAZILE: S.E., you're right, people are going to be dissatisfied. Those are very important issues. I hope we get to the bottom of the IRS scandal after they review all of the emails and come up with something other than (INAUDIBLE) targeted tea party groups. (INAUDIBLE) targeted everybody. IRS does not target one side of the street. The second thing on the V.A. scandal, that is absolutely horrible that men and women who served our country cannot come back and get the health care they need. We need -- (CROSSTALK) CROWLEY: -- who should be fired? BRAZILE: But Candy, why is everything a finger pointing as opposed to let's solve the problem and move the country forward? Get back to jobs and the economy. CROWLEY: Now that we've mentioned a lot of different things that have come up. I just want to show you a poll number. This is from ""NBC News/Wall Street Journal."" The question was, can President Obama lead the country and get the job done? Yes, 42 percent. No, 54 percent. Is this lame duckism kicking in a little early, as in pre-mid- terms? Is this a trough that he'll come out of? How does he combat this? That's pretty serious. BRAZILE: You know what? He should move the White House. He should move the White House to Springfield or some other capital in the country because it is about Washington, D.C. I mean, people are tired of D.C. ANDERSON: It is not just about Washington, D.C. anymore. So the president's job approval numbers have been trending on the downward for a little while and they used to be about -- in line with where people said, you know, we don't like how he's handling the economy. But now his job approval on foreign policy has actually his historic lows. You can't just point your finger at Congress for that one. People wonder if the president has the ability to lead on the whole spectrum of issues that fall on his plate. And I think with this lack of confidence voters don't seem poised to give him a more favorable Congress coming up here in the mid-term. BRAZILE: You know, you would see problem if the Republicans would not stand in the way. Their own job approval is so low that people know they are not worth talking about. But the truth is, Candy, is that it is tough. It is tough to bring Washington together. It is tough to get things done. I guess Candy would agree with me, if I stop talking. It is rather tough to try to move an agenda forward when the other side just want to obstruct and you know (INAUDIBLE). CROWLEY: That's why they pay presidents the big bucks. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Cry me a river. CROWLEY: How long can you go on and say, well, this person's fault. I mean, at some point it does -- (CROSSTALK) LEE: Sure and we do play this unfortunate parlor game, how fast can we declare the lame duck presidency. Is it the day of the inauguration? Or maybe we'll wait until the day after. And so we do are caught up in this parlor game but I think the president has shown through -- as he said from his State of the Union address, he is going to take the pen. He's going to pick up phone. And he is executing on certain things whether it'd be for advocating for the minimum wage, whether it'd be to put an executive order to allow students to be able to repay their loans at (ph) a better way (ph). So, there is action that he is doing. Unfortunately, it doesn't always hit the headlines. And unfortunately a lot of the issues that -- (CROSSTALK) CROWLEY: Well, because Republicans would suggest it might be off the headline and that's what makes it looks like some kind of a disconnect. LEE: For Democrats in vulnerable red states they're actually not with him on some of those things that they're doing. So that -- CUPP: Nor are -- nor are Republicans in blue. CROWLEY: Right. LEE: Sure. Sure. CROWLEY: I got to get all of you to just hold on with me just for a second because I have to take a quick break. And when we come back I want to ask you about the Hillary Clinton -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yay. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, good. CROWLEY: We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CROWLEY: We are back with S.E. Cupp, Penny Lee, Kristen Soltis Anderson and Donna Brazile. OK. Just want to show a couple things to the audience. First of all since the book launch 10, 12 days ago Hillary Clinton has visited 10 cities. BRAZILE: Great. CROWLEY: She has given 11 interviews just on various forms of TV. This doesn't count radio. It doesn't count print media. And now we're getting the headlines of the overexposed Hillary Clinton. So, which is it, smart move to do this intense of a book tour or a little too much too early? BRAZILE: Oh, no way. She has -- she put a lot of ink out there. I am glad that she is out there because for four years she traveled the world and we didn't really hear from her. We didn't know her views on these important issues like same-sex marriage and we didn't know her views on paid maternity leave. Now we know her views on these issues. And I think it's important that she's out there, that she's traveling the country, that she's talking, reacquainting herself with the American people. This is good stuff. God bless Hillary Clinton. More, more, more. ANDERSON: So I disagree. It's not necessarily that -- you can be out there giving a lot of interviews but you have to be saying something that's really interesting and most of the headlines have been around the gaffes, the things that she said that have been sort of off message. And the book sales have actually not been great compared to her previous book. Because this is a book that was very carefully vetted so that everything is perfect. The perfect political statement. And I think people are tired of hearing the same old same old. They're not going to, you know, shell out 20, 30 bucks for a book that is a bunch of political stuff that they can hear anywhere. And I think Hillary Clinton is going to be out there, you know, in America's face for the next couple of months. She has to have something that seems authentic and is fresh to say. And I don't know that we got much out of that -- LEE: So, I guess debuting at number one on ""The New York Times"" best sellers' list and having thousands of people standing in line just isn't enough - (CROSSTALK) I think the American people do want to hear from her and what she is saying is, you know, I will do any interview and I will answer any questions and that is -- that is what the American people have wanted to -- have wanted from her. So I think it's a great thing. I think her tour has been phenomenally successful. I imagine in the next month we'll be asking, where is Hillary? Is there something nefarious going on that she has come off her book tour? CUPP: Let me just say I would love her book sales. I would take them. But, you know, if you were a strategist before this book tour and you were advising Hillary, OK there are a couple of things Hillary Clinton should watch out for because of the 20 years that we've known her these are the things that she has the tendency to sort of fall into. Don't be so hostile with the press. That doesn't look good. Soften that up. Be a little less arrogant. Don't look above everybody else and like the rules don't apply to you. And maybe don't look so out of touch with the American people. I think all three of those things showed up in this book tour at some point or another. It's early enough that she can correct but this is an ingrained behavior. I don't think -- BRAZILE: But it happened in 2014. CROWLEY: She's got time to recover. Donna Brazile, Penny Lee, Kristen Soltis Anderson, S.E. Cupp, come back. Thank you for being here. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you. CROWLEY: And thank you all for watching. I'm Candy Crowley in Washington and we will be right back."		1
http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2016/apr/06/other-98/facebook-post-exaggerates-discrepancy-between-us-m/	"""Last year (the U.S. women’s soccer team) generated $20 million more than the men’s team and were paid almost four times less."""	mostly false	['Income', 'Sports', 'Women']	http://fivethirtyeight.com/	http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/women-earn-the-glory-while-men-earn-the-money-in-u-s-soccer/	2016/04/06	The U.S. women’s national soccer team won the World Cup title in 2015 — an achievement never equaled by a U.S. men’s team — but the glory doesn’t come with full benefits. On Wednesday, five women’s team players filed a complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission claiming that the U.S. Soccer federation engaged in wage discrimination by paying the women far less than the men. The complaint, filed by Hope Solo, Carli Lloyd, Megan Rapinoe, Becky Sauerbrunn and Alex Morgan, says the men’s team takes home far more than the women’s team for no discernible reason other than being male. After the filing, the soccer federation issued a statement wherein it highlighted its support for women’s soccer in the United States and across the globe. It did not address the specific allegations of pay discrepancy. The complaint also contains the minutes from a federation meeting in which the budget shows the federation expects the women’s team to produce more revenue than the men’s team in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. Based on our findings — using financial statements released by the soccer federation for fiscal year 2015, along with the USWNT’s collective bargaining agreement and memo of understanding released in court after the federation sued the players union over an earlier negotiating dispute — top men’s players earned almost twice as much as top women’s players from the federation during their respective World Cup years, despite the women’s victory in 2015 and the men’s early knockout elimination in 2014. We compared the differences in how male and female players are compensated by the federation under similar working conditions — namely, preparations for and participation in the 2014 FIFA men’s World Cup in Brazil and the 2015 FIFA Women’s World Cup in Canada. Because not every member of a national team is paid the same, and to properly compare apples to apples, we focused on two similar sets of players from the women’s and men’s national teams — Lloyd and Solo for the women, and Clint Dempsey and Tim Howard for the men. Here, we have two major goalscoring threats and two veteran goalkeepers who played every minute (or, in Dempsey’s case, all but three minutes) of their respective World Cups. The first thing we need to do is set aside the salaries that Lloyd and Solo earn, because USWNT compensation works a little differently than setups across the world. Typically, a club pays a player a salary, and a national federation compensates the player for caps and other appearances. For the USWNT, however, it’s the federation that pays the club salary; the women then draw a second salary for their national play — a departure from the U.S. men. (If you think this arrangement is odd, you’re not wrong. Now that we have salaries separated out, we can see from the collective bargaining agreement and memo of understanding that the women’s national team is paid in a similar fashion as the men: appearance fees for U.S. Soccer sponsors; bonuses for qualifying for major tournaments (along with bonuses based on tournament finishes); a share of ticket revenues in friendlies played on U.S. soil; and bonuses for winning those friendlies. The USWNT also earned a $1.8 million bonus for the Victory Tour, 10 friendly matches played in the U.S. from August through December of last year. This is an itemized breakdown of the projected non-salary earnings for Lloyd and Solo in 2015, based on all the data contained in the memo of understanding. When it comes to shared bonus pools, we assume the money is being divided evenly among all players on the roster. However, that may not be true, as there is no language in either the collective bargaining agreement or the memo of understanding that would stipulate even distribution. In fact, based on comments Solo made in her 2013 memoir, veteran players may get a larger share of the bonus pools. Below we compare Lloyd’s and Solo’s estimated 2015 earnings with Dempsey’s and Howard’s earnings for 2014, when the U.S. men’s team lost in the World Cup’s round of 16. The men’s earnings are based on U.S. Dempsey is pocketing almost $200,000 more than Lloyd; Howard gets almost $160,000 more than Solo. How can that be? (U.S. While the men’s team’s bargaining agreement with U.S. The men’s shared bonus for qualifying for Brazil totaled $2 million. The women’s total qualifying bonus for Canada was $300,000. The men played 16 qualifying games, whereas the women played only five, but that is still a difference of $125,000 per game vs. $60,000 per game. The men’s bonus for being named to the final 23-player World Cup roster was $55,000 each; the women earned $15,000 each. In addition to the share of ticket revenues for home friendlies, the men earned $1,500 per game in the three-match send-off series leading up to the World Cup. The women earned $1,350 per game, and only if they won them. For each friendly, including the send-off series, the men earned between $7,500 and $14,100 per win, based on the FIFA ranking of the opponent. They earned between $5,000 and $6,500 for draws and $4,000 for a loss. The women earned $1,350 for wins, receiving no bonus for draws or losses. The men earned bonus money for every point earned in the World Cup group stage, as well as $5,500 for each group-stage match for which they were rostered. The women earned no such bonuses. The caveat here, of course, is that the women draw a salary for playing on the national team, while the men are only paid by U.S. Soccer for participation in camps, friendlies and tournaments. While U.S. Soccer is not responsible for FIFA prize money, it’s worth noting that the men’s prize money for losing in the round of 16 amounted to $9 million. The women’s prize money for winning the whole tournament was $2 million. If we distribute these totals evenly across the 23-player rosters, Lloyd’s and Solo’s earnings increase to $326,976 each. Dempsey’s and Howard’s, meanwhile, increase to $819,326 and $789,799, respectively. The 2014 men’s World Cup generated approximately $4.8 billion in revenue for FIFA. Revenue for the 2015 Women’s World Cup have yet to be reported but will certainly be much lower. On top of the specific financial disparities laid out above, the women’s inability to specify what kind of field surface they play on, when such consideration is offered to the men, is surely a sore spot, one that blew up in December when the USWNT boycotted a friendly over concerns about the quality of the artificial turf at Honolulu’s Aloha Stadium. Another footnote in the memo of understanding concerns travel arrangements. The women’s national team is booked to fly economy for the majority of its travel, while the men exclusively fly business class. Granted, the women’s and men’s national teams both collectively agreed to these respective compensation structures — and since the men are neither salaried by the federation nor play in a league owned and operated by the federation, it could be argued that their compensation should be distributed differently than the women. But it is interesting to observe the discrepancies in areas where one would assume they would be equitably compensated. Also, the USWNT players’ complaint to the EEOC could expose the lack of transparency by U.S. Soccer relative to the revenues the women’s national team generates, which may have artificially depressed the players’ market value. The court will decide whether U.S. Soccer’s memo of understanding with the players union is a valid labor agreement at the end of May; dates for potential action on the EEOC complaint have yet to be determined. Regardless of either outcome, it appears that the U.S. women’s national team has a real case regarding the gender pay gap. Negotiations for their next collective bargaining agreement will continue all year, and the likes of Lloyd and Solo intend to leverage their recent success for better treatment by their employers.		0

EDT MR. CARNEY: Everyone ready? Good morning. Thanks for being here. Before I take your questions I just wanted to let you know that the President not long ago finished a phone call with Prime Minister Erdogan of Turkey. He called to congratulate the Prime Minister on his party's recent victory in parliamentary elections. Other than that, I would note that the Vice President's negotiations with members of Congress on the deficit reduction plans continue today at 2:00 p.m. And that is all I have for you. Fire away. Q During that phone conversation did they talk about Syria and the -- MR. CARNEY: We may have a readout later, but my understanding is this was a fairly brief congratulatory phone call. Q Can you tell us what the agenda is for today, what they're going to discuss? MR. CARNEY: As you know, Alister, we have carefully abided by our commitment and I believe the commitment shared by other members in the room not to get into specifics about what's happening and what the topics are in the negotiating room, precisely because we think that enhances the chances that they'll produce a resolution and an agreement. Q Can you talk much, Jay, about why the President is traveling to Puerto Rico? What is his trip about? MR. CARNEY: The President looks very much forward to making the first official visit of a President of the United States to Puerto Rico in 50 years. The last time was when President John F. Kennedy visited the island in 1961. Obviously there are Puerto Ricans who contribute to the United States both who live on the island and -- 4 million on the island, 4 million on mainland -- and he is very interested and looking forward to talking to them, and talking to leaders on the island. As you know, the President, in December of 2009, renewed the President's -- let me get the name right -- the President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status. He signed an executive order to renew that and to expand it so that the task force would look not only at issues of Puerto Rico's status, which is obviously of great interest and concern to Puerto Ricans, but also to economic issues, because Puerto Rico, as you know, was hit hard by the recession, and the President wanted to expand the task force's mandate to look at economic issues. So that task force provided a report to him in March -- if you don't have it probably in your materials, the letter he wrote, the attachment that went with it -- but the President noted that the task force provided an important road map to addressing the concerns and aspirations of the Puerto Rican people regarding their status. So he thinks that's been an important contribution. Q Could you also talk to us about immigration? Where do we stand with comprehensive immigration reform? Is that likely to come up on this visit? MR. CARNEY: I don't believe that immigration is a planned topic of conversation, but of course, in his meetings with leaders here that could arise. Obviously, as you know, Puerto Ricans themselves don't have issues of immigration. They're free to -- those who live on the island are free to travel to the mainland and are citizens. So the -- but obviously that could be a topic. In terms of the status of comprehensive immigration reform, the President continues to push very hard for and continues to work through different agencies and through the White House to energize people who are committed to it and hopes very much that Congress will address comprehensive immigration reform in the bipartisan manner and with the bipartisan support it once enjoyed. Q On the debt talks -- yesterday in his interview with NBC he said that -- he said, I don't want to see the United States default on our obligations. And he said that we could see a reprise of the financial crisis if we play this too close to the line. So is each day that we get closer to August 2nd, does the President think that there is a greater possibility that the debt ceiling won’t be raised? MR. CARNEY: Well, as a matter of the ineluctable march of time, I think the answer is, yes, that the closer you get to the deadline, the closer you get to the possibility of default. However, the President -- Q But does that mean he’s losing confidence -- MR. CARNEY: No, no. The second part of my answer is that the logical answer to your question is, of course, the closer we get, the greater the risk. The second part is the President does believe and takes -- as I think he said in the interview yesterday -- that he takes the words of congressional leaders seriously that they are committed to ensuring that we do not default on our obligations, and Congress will take this vote to ensure that we do not throw the U.S. and global economy into turmoil. Q But he seems to be speaking more hypothetically about this now, as opposed to saying that he won’t let the United States default on its obligations. MR. CARNEY: Well, I honestly wouldn’t read too much into that in the sense that he’s -- I think he’s been very consistent. We’ve all been saying very much the same thing, which is it’s simply not an option to default and it’s -- and we take the words of Republican and Democratic leaders in the Senate seriously when they say that we will raise the debt ceiling and fulfill our obligations. And I would just remind people that the vote to raise the debt ceiling is not a vote for spending. It is a vote to pay our debts, to pay our obligations. And we are the largest economy in the world, the most important economy in the world, absolutely vital to the successful functioning of the financial markets. And this is about being responsible. Q Jay, in that interview, in talking about the budget talks, he also said that Republicans have a difficulty dealing with revenue issues. And short of an overhaul of the tax system, which the Bowles-Simpson commission had discussed but which is a long-term process, what generally does the President look at as potential revenue enhancers that could emerge out of these budget negotiations? Realizing you don’t want to be specific, but in terms of what are the areas that -- where revenue exists? MR. CARNEY: Again, making clear that I am not discussing what’s happening in the room, I think the President has, in the proposal he laid out at George Washington University, made fairly clear where we can find savings through the tax expenditures, and that includes, obviously, not extending again the Bush tax cuts -- unpaid-for Bush tax cuts -- to the wealthiest Americans, millionaires and billionaires. It includes ending the $4 billion subsidy to oil companies that we simply -- you cannot plausibly argue that we need that subsidy when oil companies are reporting record profits and gas prices are as high as they are. So those are two areas. But obviously there are others that -- loopholes and others that are essentially spending through the tax code. And the President believes that, again, with the example of -- the big example being the oil company subsidies, that that kind of loophole should be closed. Q Jay, yesterday during the Jobs and Competitiveness Council meeting, the President said that with the debt -- with the deficit talks going on, he wants to make sure that the focus is still accelerating the recovery, and he wants to make sure that any compromise includes measures to do that. Was he talking about making sure that that doesn’t make cuts to investments like education, infrastructure? Or was he saying he wants it to include some of the proposals that he's talked about extending from the 2010 tax cut deal, like the payroll -- extending like the payroll tax break, or the bonus depreciation measures? MR. CARNEY: What the President has said about the latter issue is that he is open to ideas. He believes that the employee side payroll tax cut has been an important factor in maintaining economic growth and producing the jobs creation, and that we should certainly look at whether or not that should be extended. That’s an idea. And then others have talked about expanding it to include employer side, and again that’s an idea that’s been -- that’s had bipartisan support in the past; it's certainly worth looking at. Whether or not that’s part of the negotiations led by the Vice President I think is an open question that I’m not going to answer here. The President does approach this with a singular concern, which is that the outcome of the deficit reduction talks produce a result that significantly reduces the deficit while doing no damage to the economic recovery and no damage to our progress in creating jobs -- because if you get that balance right, the agreement itself will, he believes, instill confidence that Washington is getting control of its fiscal matters, and that that confidence will help encourage growth and encourage job creation, if you will, indirectly. But the important -- it is a vital concern of his that we not do anything through these deficit reduction talks that reverses the progress we’ve made, that slows growth or slows job creation. Q Yesterday in the NBC interview, why did the President just not outright say that Anthony Weiner should resign? MR. CARNEY: The President was asked this I think in a follow-up question. I think he made clear that he has a lot of things on his plate, a lot of priorities and -- that begin with, the economy, job creation, he mentioned Afghanistan, security of the United States and of Americans everywhere. He expressed his point of view about how he views public service and if it were he, what he would do, but I don’t think I can improve upon the answer he gave. Q Jay, on the IMF, the IMF has put forward two candidates, short-listed -- French finance minister (inaudible.) Does the President endorse either one of these candidates? MR. CARNEY: You have a peculiar Groundhog Day-like obsession with the -- you might call it a fetish -- with the -- sorry, inappropriate word -- but with who will be the next IMF head. I don’t -- we are where we were, which is we support a process that will produce the best possible candidate. Q There was a story in The New York Times two days -- or yesterday about a meeting he had with CEOs in the White House. I don’t think that was on the public schedule. Why would something like that not have been -- MR. CARNEY: I’m not aware -- I don’t remember -- I actually wasn’t in this position. But what needs to be made clear is, contrary to suggestions otherwise, this was not a fundraiser. And the fact that a President meets with his supporters in the business arena to solicit ideas about how to improve the economy is surely a dog-bites-man story. It’s something that Presidents of both parties have always done. So I don’t know what else to say about it. Q Back to Puerto Rico. As you know there’s 4.8 million Puerto Ricans in the mainland -- a million more than in the island itself. What’s the message of the -- from the President to -- MR. CARNEY: The expert is correcting me. Q What’s the message to the people of the mainland, of Puerto Ricans in the mainland, that the President wants them to take -- MR. CARNEY: I think Puerto Ricans on the mainland care very deeply about the island, have relatives, have, in some cases, economic ties. And I think he wants to convey the message to all Puerto Ricans that he is focused on Puerto Rico and its economic development, and on helping Puerto Ricans decide for themselves their status, because I think he made clear in the letter that is attached to the task force's report, that ultimately he believes that Puerto Ricans need to be -- the process needs to be put in place that allows them to make the decisions about the island’s status going forward. And I think that’s an issue that is of concern to Puerto Ricans not just living on the island but those living on the mainland. Q How much of this is -- is 2012 politics a part of this trip to the island? MR. CARNEY: The President is making the first official visit since 1961 of a United States President to the island. He thinks the issue of resolving its status is very important, of dealing with the economic hardships on the island are very important, and he’s very excited about being here. Q So there's no -- MR. CARNEY: Well, as you know, on the schedule he’s got -- he does have a campaign event, a political event, but there are many elements to this trip. Q Last night Debbie Wasserman-Schultz said, we have turned this economy around, as she introduced the President. Does he agree with that, this economy has been turned around? MR. CARNEY: Well, again, going back to literal interpretations of that, when he took office, the economy was in a nosedive downward in terms of growth -- severe contraction, something like 6.7 percent contraction in whichever quarter it was; the loss of over 600,000, and I think close to 700,000 jobs -- maybe more than 700,000 in one month. We have for the past seven quarters experienced economic growth. That is a turnaround, reversing the direction of the economy, and obviously created more than 2.1 million private sector jobs. Quite a turnaround from losing, hemorrhaging 700,000 jobs a month. So I think it is absolutely correct that the trajectory of this economy has turned around. The President makes clear every time he talks about this that we are far from done, that we have a lot of work to do; that the hole that was dug by this recession, by the financial crisis and the greatest recession since the Great Depression is very deep; and that the -- and took many years to dig and will take a significant amount of time to climb out of completely. We lost 8 million jobs because of that recession. And while the creation of more than 2 million private sector jobs is highly significant, it is not enough. The math makes clear that that's not enough. And the President is focused every day -- every day -- on -- it's a conversation he has most frequently with his team, jobs and the economy. So I think it is both wholly accurate to say that we have turned around the trajectory of this economy, the President has since taking office, and entirely accurate to say that he will not rest until we have the right kind of economic growth in a sustained way that produces enough jobs so that every American who wants a job can find one. Q Did the President watch last night’s Republican debate or any of the highlights from it? MR. CARNEY: The President did not watch, as you know, since he was otherwise occupied. Q It was replaying -- MR. CARNEY: And I’ve spoken to him this morning, and he did not see any of it. I did not either work on or cover the campaign, but he never watched his own debates, so he’s not spending a lot of time watching other debates. I would note as an observer, having caught up with the replay and the -- that it was -- I was struck by the fact that over the course of two hours, the phrase “middle class” and the word “education” did not pass anyone’s lips that I heard, which was striking to me because the middle class is obviously, to our mind, the primary focus of everything that we do in terms of the economic policies we pursue and the concerns we have. The middle class not only suffered tremendously during the great recession and is suffering as we emerge from it, but was under a great deal of pressure even prior to the recession. While incomes were growing rapidly under the previous administration and the economy was expanding, middle-class incomes were flat, stagnant, and even dropping. So that was one observation. And another is that on -- as the President talks about a lot, education could be ""the"" key, ""the"" defining element of whether or not the United States of America can compete globally in the 21st century -- compete and win. We think it’s a high, high priority. And I was struck by the absence of attention to that very key issue last night. Q Jay, you were talking earlier about the areas of savings in the tax code that the President is looking at. Today, the Senate -- MR. CARNEY: -- thinking about a very narrow tax hike on journalists, just to -- there’s been an expansion in the market lately -- Q Does that still apply to you then? (Laughter.) MR. CARNEY: I’m already under -- I’m under a pay freeze. Q The President said yesterday he didn’t like taxes -- having to pay taxes either. Q Journalists aren’t people. MR. CARNEY: The President made clear that, as I think most Americans feel, he doesn’t like paying taxes. Nobody does. But he is committed to the growth of the American economy and the health and welfare of the American people. And as he made the point as somebody who's been very fortunate and succeeded financially, that he does not need hundreds of thousands of dollars in additional income through tax cuts that would be paid for by seniors in the cost of their Medicare and health care going up dramatically. Q Anyway, back to my question -- MR. CARNEY: Sorry, what was the question, sir? Q The Senate today is voting on the elimination of an ethanol subsidy, and the White House opposes that. And I wondered why isn’t that the kind of saving in the tax code that the President can support? MR. CARNEY: Well, two things on that. First of all, the President has a comprehensive energy policy and approach to this, and it's focused on the development of alternative fuels, domestically developed alternative fuels -- it includes biofuels -- also focusing on increasing domestic production of oil and gas, and on increasing efficiency in our automobiles, which is something we’ll see play out as new, more fuel-efficient cars begin to roll off the assembly line this year. On that specific issue, we are for reforming it, but we are not for repealing it. And we are for reforming it in a way that can cut costs, but not for complete repeal. Q Leon Panetta went to Pakistan a couple of days ago -- MR. CARNEY: I read that somewhere, yeah. Q Do you have any readout or any kind of briefing on how that went? MR. CARNEY: I don’t. I think he’s -- I saw some things that he said, I believe, but I don’t have anything for you on that. Anything else? Muchas gracias."		1

He focuses on the government’s all-out response to the immediate crisis, the steps being taken to make sure such a crisis does not happen again, and the longer term crisis of America’s reliance on fossil fuels.Ed. Note: Moments after the speech concluded, Press Secretary Robert Gibbs took questions submitted and voted on by the American public, see the full video of that broken down by question as well.[[nid:13455]]Having just returned from his fourth trip to the Gulf Region, the President addressed the American people for the first time from the Oval Office. He focused on the government's ongoing all-out response to the immediate crisis, the steps being taken to make sure such a crisis does not happen again, and the longer term crisis of America’s reliance on fossil fuels. And for the Gulf Region in particular, which has gone through the toughest of times in recent years, he announced that he has tasked Ray Mabus, the Secretary of the Navy and a former governor of Mississippi, with developing a long-term Gulf Coast Restoration Plan as soon as possible in conjunction with states, local communities, tribes, fishermen, businesses, conservationists, and other Gulf residents.On the immediate crisis:Already, this oil spill is the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced. And unlike an earthquake or a hurricane, it’s not a single event that does its damage in a matter of minutes or days. The millions of gallons of oil that have spilled into the Gulf of Mexico are more like an epidemic, one that we will be fighting for months and even years.But make no mistake: We will fight this spill with everything we’ve got for as long as it takes. We will make BP pay for the damage their company has caused. And we will do whatever’s necessary to help the Gulf Coast and its people recover from this tragedy.Tonight I’d like to lay out for you what our battle plan is going forward: what we’re doing to clean up the oil, what we’re doing to help our neighbors in the Gulf, and what we’re doing to make sure that a catastrophe like this never happens again.First, the cleanup. From the very beginning of this crisis, the federal government has been in charge of the largest environmental cleanup effort in our nation’s history -- an effort led by Admiral Thad Allen, who has almost 40 years of experience responding to disasters. We now have nearly 30,000 personnel who are working across four states to contain and clean up the oil. Thousands of ships and other vessels are responding in the Gulf. And I’ve authorized the deployment of over 17,000 National Guard members along the coast. These servicemen and women are ready to help stop the oil from coming ashore, they’re ready to help clean the beaches, train response workers, or even help with processing claims -- and I urge the governors in the affected states to activate these troops as soon as possible.Because of our efforts, millions of gallons of oil have already been removed from the water through burning, skimming and other collection methods. Over five and a half million feet of boom has been laid across the water to block and absorb the approaching oil. We’ve approved the construction of new barrier islands in Louisiana to try to stop the oil before it reaches the shore, and we’re working with Alabama, Mississippi and Florida to implement creative approaches to their unique coastlines.On making sure it never happens again:A few months ago, I approved a proposal to consider new, limited offshore drilling under the assurance that it would be absolutely safe –- that the proper technology would be in place and the necessary precautions would be taken.That obviously was not the case in the Deepwater Horizon rig, and I want to know why. The American people deserve to know why. The families I met with last week who lost their loved ones in the explosion -- these families deserve to know why. And so I’ve established a National Commission to understand the causes of this disaster and offer recommendations on what additional safety and environmental standards we need to put in place. Already, I’ve issued a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling. I know this creates difficulty for the people who work on these rigs, but for the sake of their safety, and for the sake of the entire region, we need to know the facts before we allow deepwater drilling to continue. And while I urge the Commission to complete its work as quickly as possible, I expect them to do that work thoroughly and impartially. One place we’ve already begun to take action is at the agency in charge of regulating drilling and issuing permits, known as the Minerals Management Service. Over the last decade, this agency has become emblematic of a failed philosophy that views all regulation with hostility -- a philosophy that says corporations should be allowed to play by their own rules and police themselves. At this agency, industry insiders were put in charge of industry oversight. Oil companies showered regulators with gifts and favors, and were essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections and write their own regulations. When Ken Salazar became my Secretary of the Interior, one of his very first acts was to clean up the worst of the corruption at this agency. But it’s now clear that the problem there ran much deeper, and the pace of reform was just too slow. And so Secretary Salazar and I are bringing in new leadership at the agency -- Michael Bromwich, who was a tough federal prosecutor and Inspector General. And his charge over the next few months is to build an organization that acts as the oil industry’s watchdog -- not its partner.On turning from our reliance on fossil fuels to a clean energy future:For decades, we have known the days of cheap and easily accessible oil were numbered. For decades, we’ve talked and talked about the need to end America’s century-long addiction to fossil fuels. And for decades, we have failed to act with the sense of urgency that this challenge requires. Time and again, the path forward has been blocked -- not only by oil industry lobbyists, but also by a lack of political courage and candor. The consequences of our inaction are now in plain sight. Countries like China are investing in clean energy jobs and industries that should be right here in America. Each day, we send nearly $1 billion of our wealth to foreign countries for their oil. And today, as we look to the Gulf, we see an entire way of life being threatened by a menacing cloud of black crude.We cannot consign our children to this future. The tragedy unfolding on our coast is the most painful and powerful reminder yet that the time to embrace a clean energy future is now. Now is the moment for this generation to embark on a national mission to unleash America’s innovation and seize control of our own destiny.This is not some distant vision for America. The transition away from fossil fuels is going to take some time, but over the last year and a half, we’ve already taken unprecedented action to jumpstart the clean energy industry. As we speak, old factories are reopening to produce wind turbines, people are going back to work installing energy-efficient windows, and small businesses are making solar panels. Consumers are buying more efficient cars and trucks, and families are making their homes more energy-efficient. Scientists and researchers are discovering clean energy technologies that someday will lead to entire new industries.Each of us has a part to play in a new future that will benefit all of us. As we recover from this recession, the transition to clean energy has the potential to grow our economy and create millions of jobs -– but only if we accelerate that transition. Only if we seize the moment. And only if we rally together and act as one nation –- workers and entrepreneurs; scientists and citizens; the public and private sectors. When I was a candidate for this office, I laid out a set of principles that would move our country towards energy independence. Last year, the House of Representatives acted on these principles by passing a strong and comprehensive energy and climate bill –- a bill that finally makes clean energy the profitable kind of energy for America’s businesses.Now, there are costs associated with this transition. And there are some who believe that we can’t afford those costs right now. I say we can’t afford not to change how we produce and use energy -– because the long-term costs to our economy, our national security, and our environment are far greater.So I’m happy to look at other ideas and approaches from either party -– as long they seriously tackle our addiction to fossil fuels. Some have suggested raising efficiency standards in our buildings like we did in our cars and trucks. Some believe we should set standards to ensure that more of our electricity comes from wind and solar power. Others wonder why the energy industry only spends a fraction of what the high-tech industry does on research and development -– and want to rapidly boost our investments in such research and development. All of these approaches have merit, and deserve a fair hearing in the months ahead. But the one approach I will not accept is inaction. The one answer I will not settle for is the idea that this challenge is somehow too big and too difficult to meet. You know, the same thing was said about our ability to produce enough planes and tanks in World War II. The same thing was said about our ability to harness the science and technology to land a man safely on the surface of the moon. And yet, time and again, we have refused to settle for the paltry limits of conventional wisdom. Instead, what has defined us as a nation since our founding is the capacity to shape our destiny -– our determination to fight for the America we want for our children. Even if we’re unsure exactly what that looks like. Even if we don’t yet know precisely how we’re going to get there. We know we’ll get there. It’s a faith in the future that sustains us as a people. It is that same faith that sustains our neighbors in the Gulf right now. "		1

We're winning by a lot. We're kicking ass, I'll tell you. Trump keeps winning. G.O.P. leaders are falling in line, and neither Cruz nor Kasich are gaining momentum. Is it possible this ""Stop Trump"" movement has been stopped? Plus, my sit-down with Bernie Sanders. I will do everything that I can to make certain that-- Donald Trump is not elected president. The senator from Vermont on Trump, his chances of winning the nomination, and why he thinks he's losing to Hillary Clinton. Well because poor people don’t vote. I mean, that’s just a fact that’s a sad reality of American society. Also, is the U.S. helping to cover up a Saudi Arabian government role in 9/11? There are 28 pages that may have the answers. Should they be declassified? And joining me for insight and analysis this Sunday morning are Robert Costa of The Washington Post, MSNBC's Joy-Ann Reid, Republican strategist Nicolle Wallace, and Jose Diaz-Balart, of NBC News and Telemundo. Welcome to Sunday. It's Meet the Press. From NBC News in Washington, this is Meet the Press with Chuck Todd. Good Sunday morning, with Bernie Sanders’ prospects for taking the Democratic nomination from Hillary Clinton getting slimmer by the day. Sanders told me yesterday that he's fallen behind because in his words, poor people don't vote. There's a lot more in that interview, and we're going to get to it later in the show. And we're going to get to the Democrats as well. But we begin with the Republican race. It is no stretch to conclude that when it comes to Donald Trump, the Republican party has slowly been working its way through the classic five stages of grief. The first one was denial, ""Trump can't be taken seriously,"" the second one, anger, ""What makes this guy think he is even a Republican or a conservative anyway?"" The third, bargaining, ""Let's take it to the voters, they'll reject him, right?"" The fourth, depression, ""Oh my God, he's actually winning this thing."" And now the fifth stage, the hardest one of all, acceptance. Why? Trump just won big in New York. He's expected to win big in the five primaries that are held this Tuesday, which include Pennsylvania, where our new NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll has Trump with a double-digit lead, sitting at 45 percent, over Ted Cruz at 27, John Kasich at 24. And yes, if you add up Kasich and Cruz, it's a majority. Which of course, is going to make the ""Stop Trump"" people hit their head against the wall. For the anti-Trump loyalists who are counting on Indiana nine days later to be their firewall, consider this: the only poll we've seen out of Indiana in the last week came out Friday. And it shows Trump leading by just six points. But the fact that he's ahead is a big deal, 37-31, Kasich sitting at 22, again, Cruz and Kasich, together, over 50. Throw in a Republican establishment though that seems more cowed now by Trump than energized to defeat him, and the G.O.P. does look more and more as if it's ready to accept the man whose name often appears after the word, ""Never."" And presidential's easy. With ""Stop Trump"" going nowhere, this week, three signs that Republicans are now tiptoeing towards acceptance, coming to terms with the fact that Donald Trump may be the party's nominee. Sign number one, evidence of surrender by the party's leaders. At the R.N.C. spring meeting in Florida, Republican chairman Reince Priebus warned ""Stop Trump"" sympathizers to get in line. Politics is a team sport. And we can't win unless we rally around whoever becomes our nominee. And the party went out of its way to disprove Trump's charge that it's rigging the game. It rejected changes to convention rules. SEN. I'm increasingly optimistic that there actually may be a second ballot. --he quickly walked that back. SEN. What I said somewhat inartfully is that we'll have a nominee once we get to 1,237. With Republicans, including former nominee John McCain, threatening skip to convention, House Speaker Paul Ryan urged his party to be there. I think it could be a great, historical exercise. I mean, it could be something that you'll remember for the rest of your lives. Sign number two, the ""Stop Trump"" movement isn't spending. Not a dime on TV ads in New York. Just $300,000 in this Tuesday's primaries, which Trump is expected to dominate. Instead, holding its fire until the May 3rd Indiana primary. To stop Trump, vote for Cruz. Sign number three, the failure of an anti-Trump alternative to launch. John Kasich is an honorable and decent man, whose only role in this election is as a spoiler. If he was saying that if I couldn't mathematically win the nomination, I should get out, he can't mathematically win it. To make acceptance easier to swallow, Trump's team is softening his image, promising a more disciplined, professional candidate who can work with the party. We’re here really to let them know that we're going to run a traditional campaign with them. And behind closed doors, Trump's new campaign chief went further. And when he's out on the stage, when he's talking about the kinds of things he's talking about on the stump, he's projecting an image that's for that purpose. You'll start to see more depth of the person, the real person. But on Saturday, the new Trump sounded a lot like the old Trump. Lyin’ Ted Cruz, right? He said, ""He is saying,"" you know, with that horrible flourish, you know the hands? He walks in, bible held high, then he puts the bible down, and then he lies. He's a liar. Oh, good old Trump. I'm joined by Katie Packer. She's been a key figure in this ""Never Trump"" movement. She runs an anti-Trump PAC called Our Principles PAC. And Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee. I want to bring in the panel in a few moments here. But Kate, let me start with you. You're the most-prominent face these days from ""Never Trump."" Why are you the most-prominent face? I say that with all due respect. You're not an elected official, you're not running for president, you've worked for people that have run for president. Why are Republican officials afraid of being the face of a ""Never Trump"" movement? I'm not sure. I'm not sure I can answer that question. I think that a lot of them frankly are sort of hoping upon hope that this goes another direction and that they don't alienate the supporters of Trump in the process. But certainly, there are a lot of people behind closed doors that are expressing real concern. Because they tell you one thing. And then you say, ""Great, tell the people."" And they’re like ""Well, geez, I've got scheduling commitments."" Well, these are smart people. And they understand that with Trump at the top of the ticket, we not only lose the White House, we definitely lose the Senate, we very likely lose the House, and we probably lose elections for a generation because we have somebody that’s known to be a sexist, very likely a racist at the top of our ticket, and it's very damaging to the party. Michael Steele, you and I have had conversations. You seem to be in a different place here, that yeah, you're not enthusiastic about him, but you're accepting the idea that he's going to be the nominee. Yeah, look, this has been a process that has unfolded, starting, going back to June of last year. And all that time, there have been a myriad of efforts and opportunities to stop Trump. But they haven't worked. Why? And the one thing about these movements and the folks that we're talking about seem to don't understand or be able to answer the question, why do people continue to vote for him? What is it about what he's saying and doing that still attracts the core base of the G.O.P.? Yes, it's 35 percent, 45 percent, whatever, it's less than 50 percent. But when when you look at the totality of the movement and the effort that he's put out there, there is a response to it. So why aren't they responding to Kasich? Why aren't they responding to Cruz? Why aren't they winning and Trump is? And that's the core question that nobody in Washington seems to want to wrap their head around. Which is why Donald Trump is in the space he's in. Katie, I guess you seem to be running, The Hill I think captured it really well, they had a headline that said, ""Never Trump,"" in quotes, referring to your group, essentially, your goals are colliding with the goals of Kasich and Cruz. And we saw it here, you know? Cruz has the best shot in Indiana, so you're hoping Kasich doesn't campaign there. Kasich has the best shot at Maryland, you're hoping Cruz doesn't campaign there. But the two campaigns aren't listening. Well, and that's a frustration for sure. What we've seen historically though is by this point in time, the election does come down to two candidates. It was Romney and Santorum, it was McCain and Romney. And at that point in time, somebody begins to coalesce support. Somebody begins to win a majority. Trump is nowhere near that. If you look at McCain and Romney's numbers as they progressed through the primaries, they were ramping up. Trump is in a total flat-line. That’s fair, but Cruz and Kasich have not been able to galvanize either side. Absolutely, absolutely. And it's a total frustration. But, our message is, let's take it to the convention. Let's let this process play itself out. If you don't like Ted Cruz and you don't want to vote for him, that's okay. You're not going to give this to him by voting for him. He's not going to get to 1,237 before the convention. But let's do what we can to get this to an open convention, and then duke it out. Michael Steele, and I want to bring in the panel after this. But it was Chairman Priebus this week that I felt like started to wave the white flag when he said, ""We're not going to make any rules changes."" If the party wanted to stop Trump, why not make a rules change? Yeah, that's effectively how you would do it. I mean, look, we saw them do it to Ron Paul in 2012. If they want to stop somebody, they can. If they can stop someone, they can stop him. But it goes back to what Katie was saying. They recognize that what Donald Trump has done is galvanized a whole new level of voter out there. Folks who've sat on their behinds for the last six, eight years, not participated, now coming out. But the other thing to keep in mind is just because Cruz and Kasich are at 51 percent together, don't assume that those voters, Trump isn't their second choice either. So don't assume that that 51 percent is going to be there should one of them drop out. Let me bring in the panel, and they can start to bother you with some questions. Nicolle Wallace, of course, Republican strategist and NBC News analyst, former President Bush/John McCain strategist. Jose Diaz-Balart, a colleague of mine both at NBC News and Telemundo, Robert Costa of The Washington Post, and Joy-Ann Reid, also a colleague of mine at MSNBC. Nicolle, you've been in acceptance mode of Trump for quite some time. Yes, thanks to you and your colleagues I have had to live out all five stages in weepy real time. I think that one of the-- I'm very sympathetic to what you're trying to do. I think that one of the challenges is that the solution to the problem that you rightfully diagnose isn't any more appealing than the problem itself. Republicans aren’t any more enthusiastic or more optimistic about the outcome of Cruz at the top of the ticket. So what do you say to them? Well, I would say just what I said to Chuck. And skip Trump and skip Cruz and get to door number three? Potentially. Potentially. If you're not happy with any of the choices, the last time we had a convention like this was 1976. But it was very different, because everybody was virtually in one camp or the other. There are a lot of people that are in none of these camps. And to those voters, we’d say, ""If that's the camp you're in, you're not happy with your choices, then vote for Cruz, vote for Kasich, because that'll get what's behind door number two."" And we don't know what that is, but it's better than the option we have in front of us. But isn't the main problem here though that any of the solutions that you would come up with that's not Donald Trump, is going to take that, let’s say it's 30 to 40 percent of the Republican base that are white, blue-collar voters, white working-class voters who are clearly enraged, primarily at the Republican party. Any outcome but Trump may alienate those voters in such a way that it dooms the party in November no matter what. I think the problem is, is that the party is the problem. It's the 40-some odd years of promises that were not fulfilled even by the tea party, because eventually they even went Washington to a lot of these voters. So I think that these voters are so angry that you almost have to give them Donald Trump in order to satiate that anger. Well, I think that's naïve though to suggest that you're not going to have 35 to 40 percent of the party that stays home if it's Trump. I mean, we've got real data to demonstrate that, that there's real frustration, and people saying, ""I'm not going to vote for Trump in the general election, even though I'm a Republican."" Let's remember that this process started with about 200,000 Republicans running for president. There were more people running for president than you see at a quinces party in Little Havana. And yet, the voters during that process, whittled it down to three, and really, down to one. So this concept that now somebody else is going to come up, there were 17. There was African-Americans, there was two Latinos, there were, you know, women. And yet, it's all down to Trump. Let's not forget that. And the scene at the RNC, it told us so much. I was standing outside of the meeting room when Paul Manafort stepped out. And I was looking at my notebook, what I had recorded that day, and it was all RNC members giving out their business card to the Trump campaign. In Hollywood, Florida, white sand beaches, everyone's relaxed. Hey, Mr. Manafort, don't forget my name. Really? Oh my word. And I sat up in Priebus’ suite. And what is the first thing he told The Washington Post was he had a great phone call with Donald Trump this past week congratulated him on New York. All right, let me throw something out here in a bit. Do we believe there has been a new Trump? I'm going to play for you. Cruz doesn't believe it, and then you'll hear Trump's response to it. Here it is. They were saying, these are their words, that all of this was just a show. That he doesn't believe anything he's saying. He's just trying to fool gullible voters, and he's not going to do any of it. He's not going to build a wall, he's not going to deport anyone. He is telling us he is lying to us. Well, Trump, of course, the new Trump, was the old Trump. Take a listen. So Cruz picks it up, Lying Ted, he goes, ""Donald Trump is kidding everybody. He's different on the trail."" He said, ""And he said that he's going to do things differently and he's not going to build the wall."" What the hell does this have to do with the wall? Believe me. I'm building the wall. All right, Michael and Katie, I want to hear from the two of you first. Michael, is this a new Trump? I mean, Paul Manafort promised a more-- Trump with more depth. That didn't stop, that sounded like the old Trump. Well, it's new wine and an old wine skin. I mean, basically, the outward side of Trump is still going to be Trump. He's still going to go riff on the party and riff on the politics of the party. But when he needs to be in that zone, where he wants to specifically communicate, I think you will see it. And I think we've already seen him at times try to do that. But he mocked it. He mocks it but that’s what people like Chuck, they like that. Listen to what he said about being presidential. Watch this. Presidential's easy. You know what presidential is? I walk on. So you walk on. Ladies and gentlemen, of Waterbury. It is a great honor to be with you this morning. Katie, he mocks the process. And he actually mocked his own guy, Manafort. Well, it would be funny if it weren't so frightening. I mean, this is a guy that's running to be the leader of the free world. He's not running to play a part on a reality TV show. And I do think he's mocking the process. And the notion that you're going to take a guy that's 70 years old, and he's going to adopt a whole new personality, he doesn't even know that what he's doing is offensive. So the idea that he's going to somehow change it along the way is impossible. You can’t beat something with nothing. You cannot beat something with nothing. And at the end of the day, you can say that, you know, that these voters are diluted, that they're being taken in by show biz, but you cannot beat that with nothing. And the problem with the ""Stop Trump"" movement is that you're offering nothing. You're saying, ""Just don't give us this guy because there's something wrong with him."" Well, obviously the voters who are preferring him are saying he's offering an Occam's-razor solution to their existential crisis of economic want, of feeling that they've been left behind by the party. He's offering them something. And your side is offering them nothing. Most Republican strategists though, they worry. As much as Trump changes his temperament, in a general election, he still has to carry the burden of the Muslim ban, he still has to carry the burden of his policies on the wall. Those are not temperamental changes. And the real conversations, you both know this, that are taking place are how we lose. Do we lose with Cruz? I mean the reality we can try to-- We can try to spin it into something else. It's do we lose with Cruz, who we know will not appeal to the people who determine the outcome of elections, largely women, largely independents and swing voters, or do we roll the dice on Trump? Trump's strength is pulling the curtain down on the process. The process is a lot of poof. All right. Final question and word to the two of you, Michael I'll go with you, and Katie get the last word. John Kasich is the only candidate we can find that beats Hillary Clinton in our Pennsylvania poll. Hillary Clinton has double digits over both Cruz and Trump. Why isn't this ""Stop Trump"" movement uniting behind the one guy that has the electability argument in his favor? First Michael, then Katie. I have to admit, that is the one thing that has made no sense to me at all, because the guy standing in front of you, which every poll shows can defeat, and that I've heard from Democrats who say, ""Look, if you'd nominate Kasich, this becomes a different race for me in November."" And yet, the ""Stop Trump"" folks want to focus on people who cannot win a general election against Hillary Clinton. It is befuddling. All right, so Katie, last word. Why aren't you guys the pro-Kasich movement, not the ""Stop Trump"" movement? The ""Stop Trump"" movement is about keeping Donald Trump's head down and keeping the pressure on him and hopefully one of these candidates will do what they need to do to draw voters to them. But the reality is, that in a state like Indiana, Kasich isn't going to beat Trump. So we have to put our support behind Cruz and hope that those voters come together behind Cruz. You know, it's not a choice that we'd like to be making. I don't know why our voters ignored the 15 candidates that might have been able to beat Hillary Clinton and narrowed it down to a couple that probably can't. But that's where we are. Four years from now, we will have the quinces caucus first. I think that is the one thing we’ve determined there. Anyway, Katie Packer, Michael Steele, thanks very much. I think Katie, you got bombarded here left and right on your movement. But you took it well. Thank you for joining us. When we come back, my sit-down with a conciliatory of sorts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Take a listen. Look at the polls. Bernie Sanders runs better against Trump in almost all of these polls than does Hillary Clinton. If you listen carefully to this interview, you might hear Sanders accept that he's not likely to be the Democratic nominee. Coming up. Welcome back. Bernie Sanders is spending the weekend campaigning in Maryland ahead of Tuesday's primary. It's been a tough week for Sanders. His chances of beating Hillary Clinton received a near fatal blow after he was convincingly beaten in the New York primary. Sanders has vowed to fight on. But he needs to win the remaining contest by some big margins to have any chance of catching Clinton at the Philadelphia convention. I sat down with him in Baltimore yesterday, and I started by asking him about his differences that still remain with Hillary Clinton. SEC. And to all the people who supported Senator Sanders, I believe there is much more that unites us than divides us. Do you agree with her on that? I think there is a lot that unites us. I think there's a lot that divides us. I think the fact that all of us are in agreement that Donald Trump would be a disaster for this country if he became president unites us, the fact that we understand, for example, that climate change is real while our Republican opponents ignore that reality unites us. But on the other hand, I think what divides us is the understanding on the part of millions of people who are supporting my candidacy that it really is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. We have to deal in a very substantive way with income and wealth inequality. We need to understand why we're the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all people, not to have paid family and medical leave. And that we have to deal aggressively with a corrupt campaign finance system which allows big money interest to buy elections. Those are areas I think of difference. Well, it's interesting you say they're differences. If she were here she'd say, ""I agree with you on campaign finance. No, no. She would say she would agree with those goals. Well, but we all agree with goals. I mean, I suppose everybody has general understanding, you know, that we don't want to see a nuclear war and so forth. But I think that I believe in a Medicare for all, single-payer program that guarantees health care to all people. I have not only shown by talk, but by walking the walk that you can run a campaign -- a strong, winning, national campaign -- getting millions of individuals to make small campaign contributions. That has not been Secretary Clinton's approach. We have not been dependent on big money interest. And that is perhaps the most important thing. Because I'm not quite sure that you're ever going to change this country, you're ever going to take on the billionaire class, ever going to create a government that works for the middle class, so long as you're dependent on Wall Street money and big money interest. You wake up the day after the convention and you're not the nominee. Do you look in the mirror and say, ""This was a successful campaign?"" Well, obviously our goal now is while we have a narrow path to victory, we're going to fight for and through that path. We hope to win. But I think the fact that we have shown that there is massive dissatisfaction in this country with the status quo, that people want to think bigger, that people understand that when you have 20 people in this country owning more wealth than the bottom 150 million people, that people are showing in this campaign-- the desire to stand up and fight back. The fact that we have brought millions of young people who I think many of the pundits had thought were kind of apathetic, not interested in politics. Well, you know what? These young people know they're the future of this country. They want to shape the future. And I'm very proud that we have been able to bring them into the political process. You just described it as a narrow path. So what is it? Explain it to me? Well, we're going to have to do-- obviously win big in the number of the primaries and caucuses that yet remain. A poll came out yesterday that has us within striking distance in California, a larger state. I think we can do very well in California. It means-- well, bottom line, the arithmetic is you got to win delegates, that's what it means. And in this case, it means big primary wins? Right. We have won 1,200 delegates. And by the way, when we talk about the campaign, you know, we started this campaign 60, 65 points behind Secretary Clinton in national polls. Now many of these polls have us even, a few points ahead perhaps. Many of the polls now show us-- and this is an important point, Chuck -- when Democrats look out into the horizon, what unites us is the understanding that Trump would be a disastrous president. Look at the polls. Bernie Sanders runs better against Trump in almost all of these polls than does Hillary Clinton. But she runs well, too? She runs well, too. I mean, so does that hurt your cause a little bit? It's like, yeah, you do better. But she runs pretty well, too. Well, I think the answer is depending on the polls. And polls are polls. I don't want to go crazy on polls. But I think many Democrats are convinced that what is most important is defeating Donald Trump. And I believe the objective evidence is that I'm the stronger candidate. So, I was just going to say, at the end of the day, you feel like you were given a fair shot at this nomination? Yeah, we took advantage of the opportunities in front of us. We are in this race. We are not writing our obituary. We're in this race to California, and we're proud of the campaign we ran. We crunched some interesting numbers here. So 17 of the 25 states with the highest levels of income inequality have held primaries. Sixteen of those 17 states have been won by Hillary Clinton, not by you. Why? Well, because poor people don't vote. I mean, that's just a fact. That's a sad reality of American society. And that's what we have to transform. We have one-- as you know, one of the lowest voter turnouts of any major country on Earth. We have done a good job bringing young people in. I think we have done-- had some success with lower income people. But in America today -- the last election in 2014, 80 percent of poor people did not vote. You feel as if you could find a way to get people that are fighting at that poverty line-- you know, either just below it or just above it, if they were getting engaged in the process, you would do better? If we can significantly increase voter turnout so that low income people and working people and young people participated in the political process, if we got a voter turnout of 75 percent, this country would be radically transformed. President Obama's getting a little bit of criticism in the U.K. for speaking out against-- he doesn't want to see British citizens vote to take the U.K. out of the E.U. First of all, where are you on that? And second of all, would you insert yourself into this campaign? Well, let the British people make their own decisions on that. So you don't think the president should be commenting on this? The President has every right to comment on what he wants. Though I'm a candidate for president right now, I'm not going to. So as president you would not have a--? I didn't say that, no. He is the president. I am a candidate for president. Right, do you have a view on this? Not a significant one, no. Let the people-- I think the European Union obviously is a very, very important institution. But ultimately, the people of Britain are going to make their own decisions. I would hope that they stay in, but that's their decision. --that would pay for Pre-K? Universal Pre-K. Hillary Clinton's for it. Yes. I'll tell you why. Because it is a totally regressive tax and right now, at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, when the wealthy are getting wealthier-- many of them pay an effective tax rate lower than working people. You have large multinational corporations not paying a nickel in federal taxes. That's where you get the money. Somebody's making $20,000 a year and they buy a bottle of soda, I don't think you charge them $0.30 more for that bottle of soda. --absolutely something that I strongly agree. And I applaud the mayor there for coming forward. But raise the money in a way that is progressive, not on the backs of low income or working people. So you must be against cigarette taxes, too, then? No, I'm not. Cigarette taxes are-- there's a difference between cigarettes and soda. I am aware of the obesity problem in this country. I don't think Michael Bloomberg would agree with you on that one? Well, that's fine. He can have his point of view. But cigarettes are causing cancer, obviously, and a dozen other diseases. And there is almost the question as to why it remains a legal product in this country. Let me wrap up the question this way. Do you feel as if Hillary Clinton is the Democratic nominee and you're not, but Donald Trump is the opponent, do you have a responsibility to do what it takes to get your voters to support Hillary Clinton? I will do everything that I can to make certain that Donald Trump is not elected president. But if that scenario plays out, the major responsibility will be on Secretary Clinton to convince all people, not just my supporters, that she is the kind of president this country needs to represent working people in this country, to take on the big money interests who have so much power, to fight for what the American people want. Your supporters are, for the most part, very skeptical of Hillary Clinton. Very, very skeptical. Tougher on her, frankly, than you ever are. You know, people talk about all this back and forth. What do you think she-- what's your advice to her on winning your voters over? Well, I think she's going to have to be very explicit about supporting a program, which stands up for the needs of the middle class and working families, which, most importantly, makes it clear that she is prepared to take on Wall Street in a very clear way, take on the billionaire class, come up with a program that makes health care for all in this country a right within the next several years. I think those are some of the issues she's going to have to bring forth. So did we just hear, intentionally or not, the Bernie Sanders exit interview? We'll get to that later in the show. Also, why did Donald Trump's magic number to win the nomination, why is it that it might be lower than 1,237? I’ll explain. And we are back. Data download time. We've been hearing a lot about the so-called magic number of delegates needed to secure the Republican nomination. It's 1,237. It's pretty much tattooed on the foreheads of everybody in the NBC News political unit. But Trump's magic number could be less. In fact, it could be a lot less, because he's likely to pick up these so-called unbound delegates. These are the people that can do whatever they want on the first ballot. They can vote for whoever, regardless of how their state voted. So how does it all happen? Here's our back-of-the-napkin math. We're going to start with this magic number of 1,237, and then subtract from that the number of unbound delegates that we're estimating Trump's likely to pick up. So we're going to start with nine unbound delegates from the collection of Colorado, Wyoming, and Guam contests. They haven't been awarded to a single candidate yet. So in our breakdown, we're going to assume that Trump can negotiate his way to three of those folks. Now, there are the Rubio delegates. NBC has reported that 34 of the delegates Marco Rubio earned during the primary season will be unbound on that first ballot, negotiating his way to some Rubio supporters, we think Trump can pick up seven of those folks. Not a lot, but a handful. Well, now we go to the 54 Pennsylvania delegates who won't be bound to any candidate after Tuesday's primary. About 60 percent of those running for delegates have indicated publicly that they will either support Trump or whoever wins their congressional district. Which if you believe our polls is likely to be Trump. So we're going to put 34 out of those 54 delegates in Trump's column for now. So all told, that's 44 unbound delegates Trump could pick up, a conservative estimate mind you. So subtract that from 1,237, and we get a new magic number: 1,193. So that's probably the maximum that he needs here. That's the real number Trump will need before he starts picking up what we think are those unbound delegates. Now again, we think this is a conservative estimates. It's possible Trump can win more of these votes. Because Trump's expected to sweep all five states on Tuesday. And then momentum could take over. He could pick up more of those folks and then his magic number could drop from 1,193 down to 1,150 after the last primary. And in fact, it may be very hard for the ""Stop Trump"" movement to keep Trump below 1,150. Either way, while Trump technically still needs 1,237 in that first ballot, it's clear he does not need that many pledged delegates by the end of voting in June. And that's what makes the ""Stop Trump"" forces even more nervous. Up next, Donald Trump's campaign says he's just been playing the part of a candidate. That we'll soon see a new Trump. Well, if that's true, how do you explain this moment yesterday? He can't win with the popular vote, because he's got zero personality, because he lies like a thief, okay? Welcome back. The panel is back. Let's start quickly with some reaction to Bernie Sanders. Joy? Poor people don't vote? An interesting new excuse from Bernie Sanders. And then some Hillary supporters have pointed it out, ""Oh, first it was the South, now it's poor people."" Yeah. And it really got a huge reaction, just when the preview of the sound came out in just my social media world. And I think part of the problem is the word you use, the excuses. That you're saying you're running a political revolution, but you keep parsing, ""Well, we don't have just the right kind of voter motivated enough or informed enough. You know, they're too old-fashioned, or they're too conservative."" And in this case, sort of putting it off on poverty, I don't think he meant to disparage, clearly, people, and impugn people who are poor. But the idea is if you are truly running a revolutionary movement, based on lifting up people at the bottom, then they should be hearing your message or you might not be doing something correctly. You know, look, I think at another time and in another conversation, this would have been an important conversation to have. I think it's a fact of life that in the United States, the amount of people who were citizens in the United States, who aren't registered to vote, and could vote, are huge. And this country would look differently if from our elected official if everybody voted. I mean look, at Telemundo, we have a campaign, yo resido , it's bringing in people to register to vote. It would be a different country if everyone was registered to vote. It's just that conversation at the time you had it. But the only people who give excuses for why they're losing are the people who should probably be out. And I can't understand why there isn't more pressure on him to get out. Well, she did. And she was still winning. She didn’t. She went to the end. Forty million plus a month? Other than the chaos on the Republican side for him staying in and doing her damage. Nicolle, he's getting millions and millions of dollars in small contributions. To what end? He can't be the nominee, and he can't win. People believe in him. But you know what, the reason for him to continue though is that you still have, you have a small number of states left. But we've come this far in the process. There's nowhere to go, Joy! What about California? California. Democratic voters have made it very clear that they all want to weigh in. I think, you know what? It's called democracy. It's called democracy. He's not going to be the nominee. If you listen to the end of the interview, he's quite positive about the future of the party. He's oddly conciliatory at the end. Yes. He's conciliatory. Because he knows he’s going to lose. But he's also willing to offer the branch to Secretary Clinton and say, ""If she wins the nomination, Trump is the main target for Democrats, and the party will come together."" And I was just struck by that moment at the end, in spite of all the animus we've seen, that's his closing statement. By the way, I want to go, let's turn back to the Republicans here. I want to play, it was interesting to see, is Trump pivoting to a general election, and it had to do with comments he made about Caitlyn Jenner and bathrooms. First of all, let me play that excerpt from The Today Show town hall earlier in the week. You leave it the way it is. There have been very few complaints the way it is. People go, they use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate. There has been so little trouble. So if Caitlyn Jenner were to walk into Trump Tower and want to use the bathroom, you would be fine with her using any bathroom she chooses? Well, the Cruz campaign has unloaded on those comments. Nicolle, let me show it to you. Guess who's joined the ranks of the P.C. police? People go, they use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate. Donald Trump can't be trusted with common sense. Why would we trust him in the White House? Nicolle, we haven't seen an attack ad from Cruz on Trump in a long time. It feels like it's been a while. And that's what he chose to do. Effective or no? Well, here's where Trump is an insult wrapped in a riddle wrapped in an opportunity. I mean, Trump's answer made so much sense, and I think what is also on the line in this cycle is the power and the saliency of social issues. And I think if Trump wins, it delivers a massive blow to the idea that you have to be up and down on social issues to be the Republican nominee. I was just surprised by Cruz's decision to do that. Robert? To be able to win these coming states, Cruz needs to rouse the social conservatives. I think Trump's answer tells us a lot about how he would be in a general election. This is someone who has not climbed the ladder, forming relationships with social conservatives along the way. He's someone forged in New York's tabloid business culture, he has relationships with all kinds of people, he's not just someone who surrounds himself with Republicans and conservatives. And that actually strangely worries Democrats, that he wouldn't be appealing to moderates. Joy-Ann, I'm going to have you chime in, but I want to play what Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton has a web video out, also using The Today Show moment to make a different point from Ted Cruz. Watch. I will be changing very rapidly. I'm very capable of changing to anything I want to change to. --and Santorum back in the day. Well, because Donald Trump is clearly, he has exposed the fact that a lot of the base of the Republican party are not movement conservatives who have spent their entire lives pouring over the doctrinaire minutia of conservative beliefs. And what he said was common sense. I think that is the big risk of Trump. He could be anything in the general election. He could pivot back on social issues to a place where he's not offending Democratic voters. Don’t forget, most of the immigrants across the border are rapists and murderers. That would come back. And that would come back. The bathroom issue brought Cruz and Clinton together. Sort of. But I think Trump's answer-- Trump’s answer got him a lot of credit with a lot of people. It did. All right, I've got to take a quick break. When we come back, U.S. insists there's no evidence that any high-level Saudi Arabian government officials played a role in plotting 9/11. So why does the American government refuse to release 28 pages of a congressional report that could tell a different story? President Obama's been on the world stage this week, meeting the Queen of England, and a future king, Prince George even stayed up past his bedtime to meet the President. But he got a somewhat chilly reception early in the week in Saudi Arabia, where he was greeted on the tarmac by a relatively minor member of the royal family. Just the governor of Riyadh, roughly the equivalent of the United States sending a local governor to greet a major foreign leader when they land on U.S. soil. U.S./Saudi relations are strained, to put it mildly, at the moment. With renewed calls in Washington to declassify 28 pages of a congressional report on 9/11 that some believe allege some direct links to the Arab kingdom when it comes to the 9/11 attacks. It's a link the Saudis have strenuously denied for years. Well, I'm joined by one of the chief proponents of declassifying those 28 pages, former Senator Bob Graham of Florida. He served as co-chair of that congressional inquiry, was chairman of the intelligence committee for that period of time, a familiar face at that period of time. Senator Graham, welcome back to Meet the Press. All right. Let's go right to the specifics of these 28 pages. What is in them that the American-- high levels of American officials and Saudi officials fear will change things if they become public? Chuck, to me, the most important unanswered question of 9/11 is did these 19 people conduct this very sophisticated plot alone, or were they supported? I think it's implausible to think that people who couldn't speak English, had never been in the United States before, as a group were not well-educated could have done that. So who was the most likely entity to have provided them that support? And I think all the evidence points to Saudi Arabia. We know that Saudi Arabia started Al Qaeda. It was a creation of Saudi-- of Saudi Arabia.. And when you say Saudi Arabia, are you saying the government? Or are you saying wealthy individuals who happen to be Saudi Arabian? That is a very murky line. Saudi Arabia has made it murky by its own legal action. Whenever a U.S. group sues a Saudi Arabian entity, whether it’s a bank, a foundation, a charity, immediately, the defense of sovereign immunity is raised. The Saudis don't recognize the difference between a royal decision and a societal decision in the same way that other countries might. So I think it covers a broad range, from the highest ranks of the kingdom through these, what would be private entities. Okay. If this gets released publicly, and again, I know you don't want to say what's in it, you don't want to-- but let me ask you this. One description that has been made of these 28 pages is that it's basically an initial police report that if you looked at it, you would say, ""Wow, we should investigate that, that, that and that more."" Is that the best way to describe this? No. This report was 850 pages. This is 28 pages out of that. There's been no questions raised about the professionalism and quality of the other 820 pages of this report. And this chapter followed the same standards that they did. Instead of debating what might be there, why don't we let the American people read the 28 pages, and the other thousands of documents that have been withheld that relate to the Saudi involvement in 9/11. And then make up their own mind. What keeps this from-- why do I feel like candidate Barack Obama or Senator Barack Obama might be in a different place? What is it within the minute somebody gets into the executive branch, Republican or Democrat, there is this consensus publicly to protect Saudi Arabia? I think it goes back to the fact that 60 years ago, Franklin Roosevelt and the King of Saudi Arabia entered into a special relationship. We provided them with security, they provided us with petroleum. And that has affected the culture and the attitude around this relationship. But I think it's fundamentally changed, it's changing almost on a daily basis, as we are less dependent on the Saudis for petroleum, as some of the things that the Saudis are doing are so dramatically adverse to our interests, such as training the next generation of the young terrorists in their mosque in schools -- their madrasas. The schism between the United States and Saudi Arabia is now very apparent. And I think this is the time to inject the truth of that relationship in the process of deciding what we should be doing in the future. The president, can he order the declassification on his own? Yes. The president has the full responsibility and the authority to do so. --and two of his henchmen, and a prominent Saudi family living in Sarasota. On a scale of one to ten, the release of these pages, how would you rate the impact on U.S. - Saudi relations if they go public? Very accurate there. So pretty, you think it will have a high level negative impact? All right, Senator Bob Graham, I'm going to leave it there. You'll see, you think you'll get it done? You think you'll get these released? I think so. The President's staff at least has said that they will make a decision by June. And I hope that decision is to honor the American people and make it available. Senator Bob Graham, thanks for coming in. Good to see you, sir. We'll be back in just 45 seconds, a little endgame segment. And the game that at least gets played late in presidential primary campaign, veep stakes. It's a weird one this year. Who will Hillary Clinton pick as a running mate? We'll be right back. Endgame time, the panel is here. Boy, part of me wants to delve more into the Saudi thing. You know, there's a lot there. But let's go to The New York Times threw out the first of the veepstakes when it comes to at least Hillary Clinton. And I think we have an idea of what the Hillary Clinton short list is, and then the people that they have to publicly say they're vetting. Let me put up the first five that were mentioned, because this feels like an actual Clinton official saying, ""This is who the first five preferences are."" The two Virginia senators and former governors, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, obvious Virginia swing state. Sherrod Brown, progressive activist, and from a swing state in Ohio. Former Governor Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, somebody that many Obama people wish ran for president. And the Labor Secretary Tom Perez, who Joy, I want to start with you, and I want to start with him. Because he has basically earned his way onto the Clinton campaign's decision to make him on the shortlist. This came from a Clinton official. And it was Perez that they put on there initially. You're not hearing as much about Julián Castro, the HUD secretary that everybody fell in love with as the Latino V.P. of the future. Tom Perez is somebody is very much respected by Obama world, clearly. And so I think that there is this thinking that either the Clinton campaign, in just in sort of talking to the Clinton world, that they either feel like they need to have a Latino to pair with him, to galvanize the Latino electorate, or they need to fix what you could call their ""white male"" problem. And go with somebody that is a progressive white male like a Sherrod Brown or like an Al Franken even, somebody like that that would be outside the box that could help her there. Let me put up, I should put on that the Clinton campaign then said, ""Oh sure, we might look at Elizabeth Warren."" She's on this list. There were other names that were thrown on there, Julián Castro, Elizabeth Warren, I think publicly have to get vetted for political reasons. Somebody threw out an Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker, senator from New Jersey. For Florida, but it was thrown in for another reason. Apparently, Hillary Clinton loves the idea that both Bush and Obama have had running mates who basically were not going to pursue the presidency while being vice president. And she kind of liked that. That's interesting. I think Ross Perot said when he was running for president that in his corporate life, he never hired anybody who didn't want his job, because that's the way they all grew. This is the antithesis of that. You don't want to hire someone who wants your job. And maybe that would be someone like Senator Nelson of Florida. But don't rule out Secretary Castro either. He's an extremely charismatic person. And I've got to tell you something, Tim Kaine speaks perfect Spanish, reaches out to the community through, the Hispanic community through Telemundo regularly. These are people who may be hidden, have hidden weapons. I'm hoping it's Brown, because I can do a Sherrod Brown. Just for impersonation. Deval Patrick though, that was intriguing to me. The identity politics just reek of incredible cynicism to me. Oh, and you don't think we're going to see identity politics on your side? Well listen, the debate on the Republican side isn't who will they pick, it's who would do it. I mean, I'm sorry, we're in a totally different place. Being honest. But the identity, this is where Republicans pull their hair, there's such an opportunity on the Republican side, because this is all about identity politics. It feels very cynical, it feels very Clinton-esque. Wait a minute, the entire Marco Rubio boomlet was about identity politics and about saying, ""If we just throw a Latino at the electorate, it will mesmerize Hispanics."" You saw how it ended, Joy. Republicans don't fall for it. But Republicans ostentatiously did identity politics. Well no, I think she's right. The leadership did, the voters rejected it. Robert, where is running mate going on the Republican side? In 1976, Ronald Reagan running against the incumbent president, Gerald Ford, picked Richard Schweiker of Pennsylvania heading into the convention. Down at the RNC, a lot of the RNC members and campaign associates were saying Cruz and Kasich are considering picking a running mate heading into Cleveland to try to get a bounce for their campaigns. All right. Well, that is going to be fun. We get four veepstakes instead of two. Anyway you guys are terrific. I appreciate it. Finally though, in memory of Prince, Bruce Springsteen started his show last night by playing a Prince classic, Purple Rain. So we're going to end our broadcast the same way, with Bruce playing Prince. And of course, as always if it's Sunday, it's Meet the Press."		1

While horse meat, technically, can’t be legally sold in the United States for human consumption, it may still turn up in the US food supply because it can be sold to Mexico, then re-labeled and shipped back to the USA as a low-cost meat filler. This has already been documented occurring in Europe, where meatballs sold in European grocery stores were found to be made with horse meat .Where do these horses come from?While horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration, the ban expired in 2011 under President Obama’s watch, thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations.Reuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico — and it seems the United States wants a huge chunk of that business, as well.Not-so-fun fact: Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons, such as illness, injury, or simply because they cannot afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore.Many of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount. Yep, you read that right: They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant, only to be slaughtered mercilessly around several other screaming horses.Do keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your family. Raising one requires a tremendous amount of effort, so be a responsible horse owner. Don’t let your pet get slaughtered once you get tired of it — because if you do, it might eventually end up on your plate the next time you purchase some meatballs for your spaghetti.Source used:		1

Thad Allen and Sens. John Kerry and John CornynJune 6, 2010 TAPPER: Good morning. For the first time, we've been told the flow of oil gushing from the well has slowed thanks to that containment dome. Yet on the surface, oil is now washing ashore in four Gulf states, including Florida, as more than 20,000 workers scramble to keep pace with the spreading slick.Joining me this morning, the man leading the massive federal response, Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen. Admiral, thanks for joining us.ALLEN: Good morning, Jake.TAPPER: So what's the latest on the containment dome? How much oil is it containing?ALLEN: In the last 24 hours from midnight last night to midnight this last night, they collected just about 10,000 barrels.TAPPER: OK, and the CEO of BP, Anthony Hayward, has said he anticipates it will be able to contain the majority of the oil. Do you agree?ALLEN: That's correct if it's operating properly. What they're trying to do is take the pressure in the wellbore and actually produce oil -- take the pressure off and to evacuate the oil. We're not going to know how much oil is coming out until we're able to optimize the production, and that's what they're doing right now. They are slowly raising production. It was 6,000 a day before and it was 10,000 yesterday.TAPPER: We heard a lot of talk about in 1993, the Saudis had an oil spill and they used these huge tankers to vacuum up the oil. How come that isn't being done with this spill?ALLEN: We actually talked to those folks. There are a couple of issues with that. Number one, the tankers actually have to be modified. They're not ready to go right now. Number two, we don't know what those modifications will do to the stability of the vessels and how they operate. Number there, the area of operation is very, very different. We've got anywhere from 20 to 30 vessels within a one square mile over the top of that well at any particular time, managing remotely operated vehicles, doing the drilling the relief wells and so forth, so it's not -- I'm not sure it's the right application for that technology.TAPPER: I just got back from Grand Isle, Louisiana. When I was down there, I was told about the huge oil slick headed towards the coast. I was told it was four miles wide, 30 miles long, maybe four to 12 inches thick. What can you tell us about that?ALLEN: Well, what we're trying to do is fight this thing offshore. And this is a war. It's an insidious war, because it's attacking, you know, four states one at a time, and it comes from different directions depending on the weather. Offshore skimmers are the way to handle it, because we can do in situ burning above the well. But once it gets close to shore, it's got to be mechanical skimming and getting it as far offshore as we can.TAPPER: Is there a big oil slick that size coming--ALLEN: There are a number of slicks. One of the problems with this entire spill is it's not a monolithic, huge spill. Depending on when the oil came to the surface and the wind and the current, it's disaggregated itself into hundreds, maybe thousands of smaller pieces of oil. So we're trying to fight it on a lot of different fronts.TAPPER: What about these enormous underwater plumes we keep hearing about?ALLEN: Well, there has been some reporting from some of the local university research vessels of higher-density clouds below the surface. I've done a lot of work with Jane Lubchenco on this, and NOAA has taken the lead. They dispatched research vessels to start taking samples of the percentage of hydrocarbons in the water column at various depths, and they're putting together a massive model of what the Gulf looks like, and that is in progress right now.TAPPER: BP has constantly downplayed the severity of the leak. They've denied the existence of the underwater plumes, they've refused to release underwater video. They've downplayed the risks of various efforts to contain the leak. You in the federal government have relied and continue to rely on their information. In retrospect, have you been too trusting of BP?ALLEN: I'm not sure it's a matter of trust, and I hear that word a lot. We have to work in parallel, in a cooperative manner to get this thing done, because they own the means of access.TAPPER: But are they always honest with you?ALLEN: When I ask them for something, I get it.TAPPER: But including correct information?ALLEN: Correct.TAPPER: OK. If you have all the resources you need, as you've said, why is there still massive amounts of oil coming onto the shore and coming into the marshes?ALLEN: The reason is this spill is just aggregated over a 200-mile radius around the wellbore, where it's leaking right now, and it's not a monolithic spill. It is literally hundreds of thousands of smaller spills. And it could be anywhere from 20 to 100 yards to several miles in length, and we are conducting surveillance. What we're going to have to do is not only be prepared to deal with the oil onshore, we are going to have to push it out to 50 miles offshore and basically have skimming capability that runs from southern Louisiana to Port St. Jill, Florida, and we are in the process of putting those things in place right now. We can't wait for it to get close to shore. We've got to skim it further out.TAPPER: But do you have all that you need in order to keep this oil from hitting the shore?ALLEN: Well, what we're doing right now, we're bringing all the skimming equipment in the United States that is not being used for anything else and bring it to bear down there. And frankly, the further this gets disaggregated from west to east, it's going to create a continual demand so there will always be an unmet demand for skimming capability, in my view.TAPPER: Lastly, I saw firsthand when I was down in Louisiana over the weekend, all the workers there, whether they work for the governor or for BP or for private contractors who work for BP, they've all been told not to talk to the press, not to talk to the public about their work. Shouldn't they be allowed to share with the public the work that they're doing?ALLEN: I put out a written directive and I can provide it for the record that says the media will have uninhibited access anywhere we're doing operations, except for two things, if it's a security or safety problem. That is my policy. I'm the national incident commander.TAPPER: Well, I can tell you firsthand people are not -- people are not following that.ALLEN: You take (ph) the information and you tell me where it's at, and we'll get the word to them.TAPPER: All right, Admiral Allen, thanks so much for joining us.TAPPER: This week, President Obama used the gusher in the Gulf to push the Senate to move on a comprehensive energy bill which Democratic Senator John Kerry introduced earlier this year. He joins us from Concord, New Hampshire now. Also joining us this morning, Republican Senator John Cornyn, chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which helps elect Republicans to the Senate.Senator Cornyn is in Austin, Texas this morning. Senator Kerry, Senator Cornyn, thanks for joining us.KERRY: Thank you. Glad to be with you.TAPPER: Senator Kerry, starting with you. Do you think the Obama administration has been too cozy or too trusting with BP?KERRY: No, I think they are holding BP's feet to the fire, but obviously this has been, as you just heard Admiral Allen say, it's continued to dissipate, it continues to provide challenges. I think they've got an extraordinary number of workers, 17,500 National Guard, over 20,000 workers, almost 2,000 vessels. It's growing. They are growing to meet the demand. And I am convinced you're going to see the Congress of the United States and the administration together hold BP and the drilling process accountable.TAPPER: Senator Cornyn, how would you rate BP's response? Should its CEO, Tony Hayward, stay or should he go?CORNYN: Well, BP's response has been lousy. They are the ones that started this problem, and unfortunately, Jake, here we are 48 days into it, and I'm glad to hear Admiral Allen saying we've accumulated the human and physical assets we need to deal with this problem, but it sure has taken a long time. And I think a lot of the confusion has been because no one has really known who's in charge. Is it the president of the United States? Is it the CEO of British Petroleum? Who is it? Is it Admiral Allen? So I think really, we need the president to step up and assert himself and to say, let's cut through the red tape, let's cut through the chain of command, and let's get the assets where they need to be in order to protect the beaches and the people of that important region.TAPPER: Senator Kerry, you were smiling during that. You want to respond?KERRY: Well, it's sort of fashionable (inaudible) right now to try to blame the Obama administration for this disaster, which occurred because of a drilling problem that occurred with BP and Transoceanic (sic) and so forth. From day one, from the first moment, from within hours of this happening, President Obama was notified. The next day, he held the principals meeting in the White House. He's been down there three times. Every major person in the administration has been there. You have the best minds in the country being brought to bear on this. But everybody understands, the government of the United States doesn't do the drilling. The government of the United States doesn't have the technology. They have been racing to try to make up for BP's mistakes and for the absence here of a sufficient level of emergency.Frankly, we had eight years, as many of us remember, of secret oil industry meetings where they wrote the oil laws, where there was an incestuous relationship with the MMS, and everybody understands this relationship has to change.I think it is changing now.Here's what's important. Not to be throwing the blame around, but to put America on the course to true energy independence and self-reliance and to begin to wean ourselves from our addiction to oil. And the Congress has staring it in the face an opportunity to catch up to the rest of the world. China, India, Germany, Japan, other countries are using American discovered technologies in solar and wind, and they're rushing them to the marketplace. The United States is losing a major economic transformational moment. Until we begin to do something -- you know, since 9/11, we now actually import more oil than we did before 9/11. It's insulting to common sense.And what we need to do is pass an energy comprehensive policy that prices carbon and begins to move America to the future so we can get into the marketplace. We'll have less pollution, better health, better national security, better competitiveness, increased ability to provide our own national energy policy, and we will create millions of jobs.TAPPER: Senator Cornyn, your response? Senator Kerry obviously advocating for his energy bill.CORNYN: Well, there are parts of the bill that Senator Kerry and Senator Lieberman have introduced that I think are positive steps. The acknowledgment that we can't completely cut off ourselves from domestic sources of oil and gas. That we need to explore nuclear power. That's certainly an important part of the overall picture.But where I disagree with them is that we need to tax the American consumer and the American business at a time when -- with an energy tax -- a new energy tax, when unemployment is at 10 percent.You know, if we do that then we're going to kill a lot of jobs that currently exist. And together with the moratorium that is of uncertain duration, particularly in the Gulf states, Governor Jindal and others have expressed their concern, I share that concern, that a lot of people who make their livelihood in the oil and gas industry are going to be out of work.So we need to be very careful here. I think rather than try to hit a grand slam home run, I'd like to work with Senator Kerry and others to try to do -- you know, hit some singles and develop nuclear power, battery technology that will help us deal with our environmental concerns. And then let's look to divert more of our demand to natural gas, which we have in plentiful supply. It's American, and it's much less of an emissions problem than other forms of energy.TAPPER: Senator Kerry, I want to let you respond to the...KERRY: Well, you know, Jake, if I...TAPPER: Go ahead.KERRY: Yes. Well, if I can just say quickly, look, I'm delighted to hear John say he'd like to work with us. And obviously I've been working with Lindsey Graham, Joe Lieberman, we want to reach across the aisle and we want to reach accommodation.But let me tell you, you know, Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams and Babe Ruth never stepped up to bat in the World Series and said, I want to try to hit a single. The fact is, the United States right now is behind in an enormous challenge globally where China, India, and others are spending billions of dollars to take the discoveries that we made, and they're taking them to the marketplace.The fact is, we're in a race against the science. The science tells us we need to reduce the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and there are many, many -- every major study that has been done by a legitimate group, most recently the Peterson Institute of Economics, shows that there are hundreds of thousands of jobs to be created if you pass our legislation, and if you wind up pricing carbon.Now there is no tax in our bill. Unfortunately, there are some folks who call anything and everything that's dreamed up in Washington a tax. There is no tax. What we do is have a system where those who are polluters in a country have a requirement to reduce their pollution.And in doing so, we create any numbers of jobs by moving to natural gas, to nuclear, to alternative and renewable energy, to energy efficiency, to conversions of vehicles to natural gas, to retrofitting homes and reducing our energy use.There are countless ways in which we can put America work with jobs that stay in America. And every one of those studies says this will not raise the cost of energy for most Americans. And it will in fact protect the consumers even as we create those jobs.TAPPER: All right. I want to move on. We have a lot to talk about today. I want to move on to the situation in the Middle East right now, if I could.Senator Cornyn, if I could start with you, although the details are still murky, it has become clear that Israel killed a U.S. citizen in international waters with this flotilla incident. What should the U.S. response be when an ally kills a U.S. citizen?CORNYN: Well, like you said, Jake, we don't know all of the circumstances yet. But it appears to be a premeditated provocation of Israel, and to attempt to run the blockade that has existed since Hamas took over the -- took over Gaza.Hamas, of course, is a -- was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by Bill Clinton in 1995...(CROSSTALK)TAPPER: They took over Gaza...(CROSSTALK)TAPPER: They took over Gaza through elections, I mean, we should point out. Elections pushed by the Bush administration.CORNYN: Well, they are a terrorist organization, no matter how they came to power. And so you can understand why an organization committed to the elimination of Israel, our only reliable ally in the Middle East, is a matter of some concern to them.And they are entitled, as a matter of their self-defense, to look to see whether weapons or other items were being smuggled in. Egypt has the same sort of blockade, although there are numerous tunnels going beneath the border there between Egypt and Gaza.So this was pretty clearly a premeditated provocation, and it's unfortunate that lives were lost. I think, you know, it should have been a situation like it had been before. If the people organizing this flotilla had been committed to a peaceful activity as opposed to provocation, this would not have occurred and Israel would have been able to examine the contents of the flotilla and they would have been delivered to the people in Gaza who needed help.TAPPER: Senator Kerry, General David Petraeus recently said that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict ""foments anti-American sentiment, due to a perception of U.S. favoritism for Israel. Arab anger over the Palestinian question limits the strength and depth of U.S. partnerships with governments and peoples in CENTCOM's area of operations and weakens the legitimacy of moderate regimes in the Arab world.""And the head of the Mossad, Israeli intelligence, Meir Dagan, said this week, quote, ""Israel is gradually turning from an asset to the United States to a burden.""Do you believe the state of Israel has become a strategic liability for the United States?KERRY: No, I don't believe that. But there are obviously tensions with respect to certain policies. We've seen that.But let's begin at the very beginning of a big picture here. Israel has every right in the world to make certain that weapons are not being smuggled in after the thousands of rockets that have been fired on it from Gaza.And Israel has every right in the world, as recognized by the international community -- because it is not just Israel conducting this blockade; it is Israel and Egypt. So you begin that Israel has this right to protect itself.Now, that said, Gaza is a -- is a humanitarian challenge, and Israel understands that, I think. And this has underscored it.(CROSSTALK)TAPPER: But, why...(CROSSTALK)TAPPER: If I could just interject for one second, Senator, if I could, you were there; you were in Gaza in 2009. You found that they could not even bring pasta into Gaza. It was on a list of prohibited items. You went to the Israelis and you said, what gives? They -- I think they bent on that and allowed pasta in.What is the situation in Gaza that the Israelis won't even let pasta in?KERRY: There are still items -- there's confusion in the process. And I've talked to Prime Minister Netanyahu. I've talked to Defense Minister Ehud Barak about this. I believe that Israel is working now to try to put together -- and we need to work with them to make this happen. We need to guarantee that the supplies for building can go in to Gaza for reconstruction but that they are not going to be able to be used by Hamas either to build rockets or bunkers or to augment Hamas's position in Gaza.So I think there is a way to do this. I think that what we need to do in the days ahead is put out a list of the things that cannot go in and have a clarity for those groups trying to get things in as to what can go in, and get back to the movement and access cooperation that existed previously, where we really have a better flow of goods.Let me just tell you, it is in Israel's interest in its security and national defense interest, to deal more effectively with the Gaza situation.Right now, you have Hamas building a seaside resort using goods that are smuggled through the Rafah tunnels, while the United Nations entity in Gaza has 40,000 kids on a waiting list to go to school, and they're trying to build 15 schools this year.That is not in Israel's interest, in our judgment. And so I believe we need to work with Israel diligently in these next few days and get those goods moving.But we also need to remember that -- that Iran is trying to foment a next intifada. There's nothing they'd like more than to create a violent explosion. And the tension is real enough that there is the threat of war in the Middle East. We need to work extra-hard in these next days to bring the parties together and to try to move the proximity talks to final status discussions as fast as possible.Nothing would do more to address the concerns expressed by General Petraeus, to build trust and to diminish the ability of Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran and others to cause mischief than to get to the final status issues as fast as possible.TAPPER: We only have a few more minutes. I want to switch to politics if I could.Senator Cornyn, two weeks ago, you said about Connecticut Democratic Senate candidate Richard Blumenthal that he damaged his reputation by misrepresenting his war record, falsely claiming that he'd been in Vietnam during the Vietnam era.You said, ""the public is looking for candidate and office holders that they can trust and that have integrity.""Illinois Republican Senate candidate Mark Kirk this week admitted he'd misrepresented his war record. He claimed he was personally awarded a medal he did not win. There are other matters like that. Do you have a different standard for Republicans who misrepresent their war records?CORNYN: No, Jake, and Mark Kirk made clear that his company or his organization got that medal and not him personally, and he apologized for any misunderstanding.I think the problem with Mr. Blumenthal was that when he misrepresented his service in Vietnam, he had a press conference shortly thereafter and said that he had misspoken. You know, that's like shooting yourself in one foot and reloading and shooting yourself in the other foot. I think, you know, people are human, they make mistakes. They ought to admit it, and hopefully people will forgive them and they can move on.There are a lot of other very important issues in the Illinois race, and we do expect Mark Kirk to be the next United States senator from Illinois in the seat formerly held by Barack Obama.TAPPER: Senator Kerry, last question. I assume you disapprove of what Mr. Kirk has done. What about Mr. Blumenthal? You are a decorated Vietnam War veteran. You served in Vietnam. Did that not offend you?KERRY: Well, I think every veteran have their own personal feelings about it, and obviously it did not sit well with a lot of folks. But I think these candidates are dealing with it at the local level. I think that the electorate in both states will make their own judgments. And the only thing I would disagree with John Cornyn on is that I think Alexi Giannoulias will be the next senator from Illinois, but other than that, I agree with him.TAPPER: But just very quickly, we only have less than a minute left. As a decorated Vietnam War veteran, what do you think? How do you feel when Mr. Blumenthal falsely claims to have been in Vietnam?KERRY: Look, again, as I said, let the voters at the local level sort this out. I think all of us who served have witnessed over the last 30 or 40 years strange aftermaths surrounding Vietnam, as I think Rich Armitage said a couple of years ago when I was involved in the race for presidency, Vietnam seems to be the gift that keeps on giving. So we all have to sort of work our way through whatever it is that surfaces about it. But the voters in those states, you know, Dick Blumenthal has a long and distinguished record. He's been a terrific attorney general. I think the people in that state respect him. He stepped over a line. He's apologized for it, and it's time to move on.TAPPER: All right, Senator Kerry, Senator Cornyn, thank you so much for coming with us -- coming onto our show today. We really appreciate it.Our roundtable is next. George Will, Arianna Huffington, Liz Cheney and Markos Moulitsas provide their analysis of the week's news. And later, the Sunday Funnies.TAPPER: Scenes from the perfect game that wasn't -- one of many topics we will tackle today on our roundtable with George Will, Liz Cheney from Keep America Safe, Markos Moulitsas from DailyKos and Arianna Huffington from The Huffington Post.Guys, I'm going to start with the oil spill. We'll get to the baseball game in a second. Here is BP CEO Tony Hayward one week ago today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TONY HAYWARD, CEO, BRITISH PETROLEUM: There's no one who wants this thing over more than I do. You know, I'd like my life back.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: I'd like my life back? Well, $50 million of advertising later, here is Tony Hayward today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HAYWARD: For those affected and your families, I am deeply sorry. The Gulf is home to thousands of BP employees, and we all feel the impact. We know it is our responsibility to keep you informed and do everything we can so this never happens again.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: George, President Obama expressed some dismay about this ad campaign. What do you think?GEORGE WILL, COLUMNIST: Well, BP has a fiduciary responsibility to its shareholders, and it's trying to preserver value when the value is leaking away as fast as the oil is leaking out of the bottom of the Gulf. This week, this crisis became a competitive display of emotions.It was reliability reported from the White House Press Room by Mr. Gibbs that the presidential jaw clenched this week. Now, we live in a therapeutic society, and the president is supposed to be therapist in chief, but this is somewhat ridiculous.We have a terrible technological problem, and getting the president feelings shared appropriately is not high on the list.TAPPER: Liz, I'll get to the president's emotions in one second, but what do you think about this ad campaign, is it appropriate?LIZ CHENEY, BOARD MEMBER, KEEP AMERICA SAFE: You know, I don't think so. I think that at a time when you've got the state of Louisiana waiting for money from BP to build berms, frankly, it doesn't accomplish what BP is trying to accomplish here, by preserving shareholder value -- which is a completely legitimate thing to do, as George points out.You know, I think BP would be much better served if they had, for example, a daily briefing. If they had a daily briefing where they stood, they said here's what we've done today, here's what we're going to do tomorrow, here is the response that we've made, if they actually were responding here. But the notion that they're spending an awfully lot of money worrying about their own image when people are suffering, when livelihood is being lost, does exactly the opposite, and I think it's pretty hard to defend.TAPPER: Markos, I want to ask you about the president's emotion. Here is one of President Obama's biggest supporters in the celebrity community, Spike Lee, on CNN on Wednesday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SPIKE LEE, FILMMAKER: He's very calm, cool, collected. But one time go off, and if there's any one time to go off.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: And here's President Obama the next night on CNN.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: I would love to just spend a lot of my time venting and yelling at people, but that's not the job I was hired to do. My job is to solve this problem, and ultimately this isn't about me and how angry I am.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: You and I were talking about this. A few days ago, you would have dismissed this emotional criticism that he's not being demonstrative enough. But you're not so sure anymore.MARKOS MOULITSAS, FOUNDER, DAILY KOS: Well to a certain degree. I mean I don't think there's any doubt that the polling is slipping for Obama. People are angry. I don't know if it's about him not showing an emotion. But I think people are really worried that BP, yet another corporation, is going to get away with pillaging and destroying a valued and beloved part of America.I mean, we spent the last two years talking about -- listening to conservatives talk about how Obama is a communist because he wants too much regulation, and they've been talking about drill, baby, drill. And I think the people are realizing that maybe drill, baby, drill is not such a good idea.Maybe they're realizing that regulation is OK in a situation where the government is protecting the American people from corporations like BP or banks on Wall Street.TAPPER: Arianna, do you think the Obama administration has been too close to BP in this whole situation?ARIANNA HUFFINGTON, FOUNDER, THE HUFFINGTON POST: Well, definitely at the beginning. They listened to BP, they bought what BP was saying, and it turned out it wasn't accurate. And BP consistently underestimated the severity of the problem, the progress that they were making, and even now we have -- on your show -- we have Admiral Allen saying that he trusts BP.Well, I don't know why he continues to trust BP and why he continues to trust Tony Hayward. This is not just the first time that BP has been in trouble and caused trouble. After all, it has had over 700 egregious violations before this spill.So this is really part of the problem of our whole regulatory system which was dismantled during the Bush-Cheney years, and Obama did not fast enough turn things around.TAPPER: Well, that's --WILL: Well, if the president --(CROSSTALK)CHENEY: You know, it's not actually true that it was dismantled, and there's a very interesting piece this morning in the New York Times about exactly what happened in terms of what exceptions were granted for this BP well and when they were granted which turns out to be during the Obama Administration.But on the issue of the president's emotion, if the president were projecting cool, calm, collected competence, I think people would say that's great. The problem is this notion, this sort of sense that he's detached while he's not able to produce, while he's not able to response effectively on the ground.You know, you had the people of Louisiana ask for these berms, and for three weeks there were meetings and seminars and discussions -- and yes, I'm going to use the word dithering here -- in Washington while the people of Louisiana waited and the oil got closer to the shore.WILL: This is what the president has said, ""The American people should know that from the moment this disaster began the federal government has been in charge of the response effort. Make no mistake, BP is operating at our direction.""Now, with regard to whether we should regulate, this is a regulated industry. The Minerals Management Service evidently didn't do a very good job. Now sooner or later we'll blame this on George W. Bush, but right now, it is a regulatory agency of the Obama Administration that seems to have failed.WILL: At a moment when the federal government has taken over 1/6th of the economy in health care, it is saying we have a 1,000-page bill because we just know how to turn down the thermostat on the planet.Lord knows what else they're doing to rationalize American society at a moment when the country is saying maybe the regulatory state isn't all that it's cracked up to be.HUFFINGTON: George, the truth is that right now we have precisely the regulatory system that the Bush-Cheney Administration wanted -- full of loopholes, full of cronies and lobbysists filling the very agencies they're supposed to be overseeing --WILL: So it's Bush's fault.HUFFINGTON: -- the industry.WILL: Just clear this up.HUFFINGTON: It is absolutely 1000 percent Bush-Cheney's fault, plus the fact that the Obama Administration has not really done enough fast enough to change what's happening at the MMS agency, at all sorts of other agencies. Not just when it comes to the energy problems, when it comes to Wall Street, all over, we are seeing the complete success of the kind of regulatory system that Bush-Cheney wanted. And we're seeing this is the inevitable result of what they wanted.CHENEY: You know, it's truly amazing. I mean I actually heard George Bush was responsible for the breakup of Tipper and Al Gore's marriage too. I mean it's incredible the extent to which people are now trying to shift blame. And frankly --MOULITSAS: Did you fact check that?TAPPER: We'll get that fact.CHENEY: I heard it. I don't know. I think it was on ""The Daily Kos."" But at any rate, I think that, you know we got to look at what's happening going forward, and you've got to look at the facts. I mean, the left is going to try -- you guys --HUFFINGTON: This has nothing to do with the left.CHENEY: -- have for years been demonizing Bush and Cheney, and I'm sure you will continue to demonize them for years going forward, but we have got now a catastrophe on the Gulf Coast, a catastrophe that happened on this administration's watch which this administration is failing to clean up and be responsive and lead, frankly.And it is a problem we're seeing with this president across the board. A president with no leadership experience.HUFFINGTON: Right here, we have the poster child of Bush-Cheney crony capitalism. Halliburton involved in this, and we haven't said about that. They after all were responsible for cementing the well. Here's Halliburton, after it defrauded the American taxpayer hundreds of millions of dollars --CHENEY: Arianna, I don't know what planet you live on, but that's not --HUFFINGTON: -- it's involved again. I'm living on this planet. You're living in a planet that is --CHENEY: -- it's -- Arianna, what you're saying --HUFFINGTON: -- continuing --CHENEY: -- has no relationship to --HUFFINGTON: It is completely --CHENEY: No relationship to the effects --HUFFINGTON: -- Halliburton was involved in this. How can you say it is not?TAPPER: Well, Halliburton was cementing the pipe.HUFFINGTON: How can you say Halliburton has no relationship?CHENEY: Her assertion that Halliburton defrauded the U.S. government --HUFFINGTON: It did. It did.CHENEY: It was Bush-Cheney cronyism is the left talking point --HUFFINGTON: It was -- hundreds of millions of dollars in Iraq.CHENEY: Arianna, is absolutely not true. It is absolutely not true.HUFFINGTON: OK, I'm so glad Politifact is going to be checking this. I'm so glad.CHENEY: Good.TAPPER: Markos, I just want to give you one more last chance to weigh in. You've been suspiciously quiet on this roundtable so far. When the American people see what's going on in the Gulf and they see that it's not being solved, and they hold the president in charge -- the current president.MOULITSAS: I would say that that's absolutely true, and I think the reason that sort of, Obama is slipping I think like I said is that they're afraid that yet another corporation is going to take advantage of lax regulation, it's going to take advantage of a pro-business climate and basically get away with -- maybe not murder. This is not Katrina. -- But with the defiling and the destruction of the economies and the beauty and the coastline of multiple U.S. states.And that's the fear, because they've seen it in Wall Street. They saw Wall Street get away with it, and now they're afraid that BP is going to get away with it. Because certain companies are too big to be held accountable, and that's the problem, that's what people fear.I don't think they want a temper-tantrum from the president. They want accountability and right now, we haven't seen that yet.CHENEY: But I think what people really fear frankly now economically, Markos, is that the president's moratorium on offshore drilling is going to compound the economic damage that's been done by this spill.MOULITSAS: Actually, the latest polling --CHENEY: If you look at the jobs numbers, 430,000 new jobs created last month. 400,000 of those we know were temporary Census jobs. Thirty thousand private sector jobs. It is in fact entirely likely that this moratorium on offshore drilling is going to completely wipe out those private sector jobs.TAPPER: Let's turn to the economy as long as Liz has brought it up. The May jobs number report came out showing 431,000 jobs were created. Only 41,000 of them were in the private sector. The unemployment rate is 9.7 percent, and 46 percent of the unemployed have been jobless for 27 weeks or more. George, this is not good news.WILL: It's terrible news. In May, the private sector essentially stopped producing jobs. It was one-fifth the job creation of April. The 41,000 created in the private sector is less than half as many jobs that have to be created in order to keep up with the natural growth of the labor force.Now the question is why is this happening? One answer might be that we're seeing now the prospect of a jobless recovery because of what happened with the late New Deal when business threw up its hands and said there's too much uncertainty.WILL: The Bush tax cuts are going to expire. Interest rates have to go up sooner or later. The House, just before going on recess, passed a so-called jobs bill with $80 billion more dollars of taxes in it. There may be climate change regulation. No one knows quite how Obama Care is going to effect the private sector. In pandemic uncertainty, capital goes on strike.TAPPER: Arianna, I know you agree with your disappointment in the jobs report, but I'm guessing you disagree with the diagnosis.HUFFINGTON: I actually agree that the Obama Administration has not done enough on jobs. There's no question about that; that they've basically focused too much on making things good for Wall Street and ignored Main Street, and now we're paying the price for that.This is a structural problem. This is not a cyclical problem, as Larry Summers has been claiming it is. It has been the loss of manufacturing jobs for over 30 years now. We need to throw everything at the problem, including a payroll tax holiday, including creating jobs the way we did during the depression.Because what is happening is really the assault on the middle class. We are looking at families that can not send their kids to college. We're looking at the long-term unemployment that you mentioned, the 99-ers who have been on unemployment benefits for 99 weeks who can have no possibility of extending them. So this is a real calamity.TAPPER: All right, moving to another big item in the news this week, the raid on the flotilla. I want to show you two clips showing differing points of view of the flotilla attack. The first is an Al Jazeera newscast reporting the violence and deaths on board.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The organizers on board after two people have been confirmed killed by the Israeli army have now asked all the passengers to go inside. They've raised the white flag. This after Israeli commandos defended upon the ship in international water....(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: And the second video we're going to show right now is from the Israeli Defense Forces. It shows troops being attacked as they descend on the boat with highlights from the IDA. The Obama Administration has not condemned Israel; is one of the few Western countries in the world, if not the only one, that has not.But you have criticized President Obama for using the word tragic to describe the incident. Why?CHENEY: Well, the Obama Administration actually did sign on to a presidential statement at the U.N. Security Council which requires --TAPPER: After watering it down.CHENEY: -- Yes, but the language in there still condemned what happened, called for an investigation. This isn't complicated. Israel is under attack by Hamas, which uses Gaza as a platform from which to launch attacks against Israel.They want to destroy the state of Israel and they are supported in that by the countries Iran, Syria, and now it looks like Turkey as well. This flotilla, had it really been committed to providing humanitarian relief to Gaza could have taken the Israeli government up on the offer to dock and take that relief in. They didn't do that.It was clearly a propaganda ploy. Clearly you had members of Muslim Brotherhood on board. You had people who were armed, ready for the Israeli commandos to arrive. The United States has to stand with Israel. If the United States, in a choice between Israel and Hamas tries to stand above it -- which is what this president likes to do on every issue, sort of be detached and say on the one hand, you know as he said in his Cairo speech a year ago.On the one hand you have the Holocaust. On the other hand, you've got Palestinians living under occupation. That kind of moral equivalence is very -- not only is it wrong, not only is it shameful, but it is dangerous for the United States of America not to be standing with Israel.And when we don't stand with Israel in the face of this kind of an attack, by Iran, by Syria, by Turkey, we send a very clear message that those nations can in fact attack Israel with impunity, that they can in fact threaten to destroy Israel with impunity, and that the United States won't stand by its more important ally in the Middle East.TAPPER: Markos, whether or not this was a propaganda push by the people on the flotilla, it worked.MOULITSAS: Well, you know, first of all, the with us or against us approach which is what got us in a lot of the trouble that we are in today. I mean the fact is whether Israel had the right to do what it did or not, they handled it so poorly that they basically alienated much of the world. They alienated an important Arab ally in Turkey, and they put the United States in a really difficult position.And if the goal was to enforce the embargo, the blockade, they failed because now each has to open up the border. So they handled it so clumsily and so incompetently, that they actually worked against their own interests. CHENEY: Markos, what you just said demonstrates exactly the problem that Israel faces. The government of Turkey supported the launching of this flotilla. The government --MOULITSAS: The government of Turkey had military --CHENEY: The government of Turkey has stood up and said Hamas is not Hamas is not a terrorist organization. The Turks themselves have aligned themselves with Iran and with Syria.MOULITSAS: Turkey is a NATO ally.(CROSSTALK)CHENEY: And for you to be blaming -- that's right, and for you to be blaming Israel for that alienation tells you what Israel faces --TAPPER: Arianna?(CROSSTALK)HUFFINGTON: The truth is that the long-term security interests of Israel, in the same way the long-term security interests of the United States depend on marginalizing more of the extremists and bringing more of the moderates on our side.HUFFINGTON: And what Israel is doing now is completely counterproductive in terms of this very simply goal, because if we fail to bring more moderates in the Middle East to see the world the way we're seeing the world, and we push them more and more into the arms of extremists, we are never going to have peace or securityTAPPER: George?WILL: To the extent that that fiction we call the international community makes it impossible for Israel to conduct this kind of boycott, to prevent Hamas from being rearmed, two things happen. You hasten the coming of the next Middle Eastern war, because SCUDS are coming to Hezbollah from Syria in the north. Weapons will pour in to Gaza from which 6,000 rockets have been fired at Israel.So Israel will have to take active defense and go in again to Gaze and into southern Lebanon. Furthermore, no Israeli Prime Minister is going to allow a two-state solution. If a Palestinian state based on the West Bank can not allow some kind of armed presence on its eastern border to prevent the influx of arms into the new Palestinian state.Therefore, a two-state solution becomes impossible, and the next war becomes likely all because people are trying to undermine the legitimacy of Israel's self-defense.HUFFINGTON: But what is happening in Gaza right now, Senator Kerry said earlier, when you asked him about. It's a real humanitarian disaster in violation of the Geneva Convention that forbids collective punishment. What is happening in Gaze is collective punishment.And if you look at the list of things that are not allowed to go into Gaza, you understand why there is such a there.TAPPER: But Senator Kerry did point out that it was -- some of the --HUFFINGTON: That they had --TAPPER: No, no, but that the Hamas government was responsible as well for the humanitarian crisis.HUFFINGTON: Absolutely. The Hamas government is a terrorist organization. Nobody's saying anything contrary to that. The Hamas government is an organization that won an election, an election the Bush-Cheney and Condy Rice encouraged to happen.TAPPER: That is what -- let me ask you about -- You were at the State Department in 2005-2006 when these elections were pushed forward and some were saying don't do it, they're not ready for it. Do you think that was a mistake in retrospect?CHENEY: I do. I don't think they were ready for it. I don't think we should have pushed it. And I think that Senator Cornyn's point earlier though was a very important point, which is no matter how they came into power, they're a terrorist organization.And if you look at the difference between life on the West Bank and life in Gaza, I think it puts the lie to this notion that somehow the Israelis are responsible for the conditions inside Gaza. Hamas is running Gaza, and essentially the position that you guys are taking says that Israel does not have the right --MOULITSAS: Who said that?CHENEY: -- to stop a flotilla.MOULITSAS: Nobody said that.CHENEY: To stop a flotilla from --MOULITSAS: Nobody said that.CHENEY: -- from -- well, but your criticism -- no, no --MOULITSAS: I said they handled it in such a way that was so incompetently that it backfired on Israel.CHENEY: Okay, did you --MOULITSAS: Not that they didn't have a right to do so.CHENEY: So you agree that they had a right to stop that flotilla?MOULITSAS: There's ways to do it that weren't as aggressive and counterproductive. If they did it in the middle of the night, over the air. I mean there's ways to handle blockades in international settings.CHENEY: Yes, but Markos --MOULITSAS: You can -- boats can be stopped; to redirect --CHENEY: This was not a peaceful -- this was a not a peaceful flotilla. You just had a flotilla yesterday that in fact was peaceful and that landed with no incident. So for you to second-guess and to sort of say there are ways they could have done this --MOULITSAS: I don't understand how a flotilla is not peaceful when it doesn't have --CHENEY: The people on board were armed and ready to meet the Israeli commandos --TAPPER: I do want to move on to one subject, because we're really running out of time, and I would be remiss if I didn't get one of America's foremost baseball writers to weigh in on what happened Wednesday night, and I'm sorry about the awkward segue way, but Detroit pitcher Armando Galarraga pitched a perfect game on Wednesday and yet, the record books are not going to record that he pitched a perfect game.George, does this not show that A, we should have instant replay in baseball, and B, didn't Bud Selig mess up by not awarding him the game retroactively?WILL: No, and no. By the way, if you award him the game retroactively, what do you do about the man who made the 28th out? Does the pitcher get credit for making that out or do you just pretend it never happened?To all those who are hysterical about the outcome of this game and who are, I would note, more hysterical than the pitcher himself who took this in good grace, I say this: Would you rather have had a 21st perfect game since 1880 -- and the third in a month by the way.Would you rather have had a 21st perfect game or this wonderful example of sportsmanship and maturity? The pitcher taking it in good grace. The umpire being a model of manly responsibility. The Detroit Tiger fans giving the umpire a standing ovation the next day, and Jim Leland, more old school baseball man there is not in the world -- Jim Leland manager of the Tigers sending the pitcher out with the lineup card to home plate to put his arm around and affect the umpire.What would you rather have? The perfect is the enemy of the good. You strive for perfection in anything, in baseball, anything else, and you're going to destroy the rhythm of the game and the human element that we love in the game.TAPPER: Markos, you are my condolences, a Cubs fan, but you are a baseball fan. Are you torn on this?MOULITSAS: Torn, I mean, the heart says, Selig should have given the perfect game. I mean, I was -- on Mother's Day I was in Oakland, and I witnessed at the stadium that perfect game. And it's incredible. And I think he would probably take the perfect game over the sportsmanship.But the head says that it would be a terrible slippery slope that would turn the commissioner's office into the supreme court of baseball, and what happens in a World Series game, game seven, a disputed call causes the game to be called a certain way, do you then appeal to the commissioner's office and try to change the result of the game? You cannot do that.WILL: In the most important perfect game ever pitched, 1956, Don Larsen in the World Series. The 27th out was made by Dale Mitchell, wonderful batter's eye he had. He struck out 119 times in 4,000 Major League at-bats. The umpire, it was his last game, by the way, called the strike three on Dale Mitchell. It was a foot and half probably high and outside. He was so eager to get the game over.Now suppose the commissioner is sitting in the stands. Is he supposed to say, oh, no, back to the mound, Mitchell, back to the plate, we didn't like that call?TAPPER: All right, we're running out of time, so this roundtable discussion and also some conversation about politics will continue in the green room on abcnews.com, where later you can also find our fact checks. We've teamed up with Politifact to fact-check the newsmakers.Copyright © 2018 ABC News Internet Ventures"		1

She served on the Metropolitan Transit Authority board from April 2010 until December 2013, when she resigned to attend a fellowship program at Harvard University.Most PopularAfter decades of sewing up children shot accidentally, a...""I realize how critical effective, excellent transit is - making sure all of our citizens in the greater Houston area have excellent transit and we build for the future,"" said Patman, who will be the first woman to lead the transit agency board.Board members are limited to four 2-year terms for a maximum of eight years. Patman's previous service means she is eligible to serve an additional four years.RelatedTurner calls for change in transportation philosophy""She is a visionary leader capable of collaborating with all the different community stakeholders,"" Turner said.The mayor has the option of replacing four other Metro board members - Christof Spieler, Diann Lewter, Barron Wallace and Sanjay Ramabhadran - or retaining them. Turner said he expects to make other Metro appointments in the next two weeks.Patman's appointment requires confirmation by the City Council, then approval of the Metro board. Current chairman Gilbert Garcia's term expires in April.Shake-ups in transportation-related matters are not new for Turner. In his inaugural address, he said the city would respond to citizen-reported potholes within 24 hours, which has been achieved. Turner also encouraged pro-transit and anti-sprawl interests in late January when he told the Texas Transportation Commission that the state's practice of addressing congestion by expanding suburban highways was not sustainable.""We can't overlook commuter rail, we can't overlook light rail, we can't overlook park and ride,"" Turner said, saying Metro was a vital partner in addressing congestion. ""There are a number of options that are out there.""Metro is a different agency today than the one Patman joined six years ago, when its light rail program and budget were in disarray. Now its finances are stable and ridership on buses and trains is growing after a two-year redesign of local service. Two new light rail lines opened last May.""I think they are going to be inheriting the strongest Metro there has ever been and I am proud that is the handoff,"" said Garcia, who was appointed with Patman by former Mayor Annise Parker when she assumed office.Moreover, Garcia and one of the agency's staunchest critics, Rep. John Culberson, R-Houston, achieved a truce, if not complete agreement on policies. Cooperation also has improved among the city's five appointees, two selected by Harris County and the two chosen by the other 13 cities served by the agency, Garcia said.TranslatorTo read this article in one of Houston's most-spoken languages, click on the button below.""That is a very good thing for the region because transit is not just a Houston issue, it is a regional issue,"" he said.Metro still faces challenges, however. An overpass along Harrisburg to complete the Green Line light rail is months behind schedule, and the delay has infuriated neighbors. The local bus system redesign remains a work in progress, and some concerns remain that Metro is focusing too much on attracting new riders to the detriment of transit-dependent communities east and northeast of downtown.During her previous tenure, Patman said, the bus system changes were necessary, but Metro needed to be careful in redesigning a network riders had come to depend upon. In many cases, people made residence choices based on proximity to bus and rail lines.Providing that critical service, she said Friday, would be challenging but achievable.""Right now, we don't have as much grant money coming in and obviously some of the local revenues are down given the challenges in the economy,"" she said.Patman has been involved in Democratic Party politics for most of her life. Her father, Bill Patman, was a former state senator and congressman. Her mother, Carrin Mauritz Patman, managed all of Bill Patman's campaigns and was a state and national Democratic Party official.Carrin Pattman and her husband, attorney Jim Derrick, hosted a fund-raising reception for Turner after he was sworn in."		1

Christie, traveling to another political event,” Buono says in front of a backdrop of Christie campaigning with former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and at a fundraiser for conservative U.S. Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa).“He’s got plenty of time for Iowa, but what about Irvington,” Buono says as the images shift to a blighted urban New Jersey neighborhood. “Guess what, governor? There’s no fried butter in Newark. Just 13 percent unemployment. No corn stalks in Clifton, just families being crushed by soaring property taxes”Buono wraps up the 34-second spot by saying “I’m sure Iowa’s lovely this time of year, but as your governor you’ll find me right here in New Jersey working for you.”The long shot Buono trails Chrsitie in the polls by 30 points or more and has struggled in fundraising. Buono’s website appeals to donors to contribute so that the ad can air on television.Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts said the support of nearly three dozen Democratic elected officials testifies to what he's done for New Jersey.""From holding the line on taxes, balancing budgets and reining in property taxes, Governor Christie has a proven record of putting people over politics to get things done for the people of New Jersey,"" Roberts said in a statement.

A wave of legislation, introduced in more than two dozen states, would allow people to discriminate against their neighbors. Some, such as the bill enacted in Indiana last week that drew a national outcry and one passed in Arkansas, say individuals can cite their personal religious beliefs to refuse service to a customer or resist a state nondiscrimination law. Others are more transparent in their effort to discriminate. Legislation being considered in Texas would strip the salaries and pensions of clerks who issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples — even if the Supreme Court strikes down Texas’ marriage ban later this year. In total, there are nearly 100 bills designed to enshrine discrimination in state law. These bills rationalize injustice by pretending to defend something many of us hold dear. They go against the very principles our nation was founded on, and they have the potential to undo decades of progress toward greater equality. America’s business community recognized a long time ago that discrimination, in all its forms, is bad for business. At Apple, we are in business to empower and enrich our customers’ lives. We strive to do business in a way that is just and fair. That’s why, on behalf of Apple, I’m standing up to oppose this new wave of legislation — wherever it emerges. I’m writing in the hopes that many more will join this movement. From North Carolina to Nevada, these bills under consideration truly will hurt jobs, growth and the economic vibrancy of parts of the country where a 21st-century economy was once welcomed with open arms. I have great reverence for religious freedom. As a child, I was baptized in a Baptist church, and faith has always been an important part of my life. I was never taught, nor do I believe, that religion should be used as an excuse to discriminate. I remember what it was like to grow up in the South in the 1960s and 1970s. Discrimination isn’t something that’s easy to oppose. It doesn’t always stare you in the face. It moves in the shadows. And sometimes it shrouds itself within the very laws meant to protect us. Our message, to people around the country and around the world, is this: Apple is open. Open to everyone, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, how they worship or who they love. Regardless of what the law might allow in Indiana or Arkansas, we will never tolerate discrimination. Men and women have fought and died fighting to protect our country’s founding principles of freedom and equality. We owe it to them, to each other and to our future to continue to fight with our words and our actions to make sure we protect those ideals. The days of segregation and discrimination marked by “Whites Only” signs on shop doors, water fountains and restrooms must remain deep in our past. We must never return to any semblance of that time. America must be a land of opportunity for everyone. This isn’t a political issue. It isn’t a religious issue. This is about how we treat each other as human beings. Opposing discrimination takes courage. With the lives and dignity of so many people at stake, it’s time for all of us to be courageous.		1

Tom voted for disaster relief and full funding of FEMA. Senator Pryor, start focusing on the real issues. Leave our community and our tragedy out of your campaign.”The ad highlights Cotton’s votes in support of full funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), including the FY2014 Department of Homeland Security appropriation, from which FEMA derives its funding. In addition, Cotton worked hand-in-hand with the rest of Arkansas’s federal delegation to get federal support to the communities affected by April’s storms, supporting all five disaster relief declaration letters of support.Tom Cotton said: “Senator Pryor should be ashamed of his false attacks that politicize a horrible tragedy in an attempt to score political points.

Fifty years ago, I was a little girl who got scolded by a teacher for speaking Spanish during recess. I also know that those sentiments are not indicative of who we are as San Antonians.That's why I'm hopeful the San Antonio City Council will pass updates to the city code ensuring that the city, and those who contract with the city, will not discriminate against their employees because of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or veterans' status. These common-sense updates also ensure fair treatment in housing and public accommodations and will bring San Antonio in line with the codes of cities such as Dallas, Fort Worth, and Austin. But, they'll also make sure our city's laws reflect our city's values.I was fortunate, in an age when women weren't always allowed the same opportunities as men, to have parents who convinced me that I could do anything. As an educator, my mother pushed me academically. And, whenever people would comment to my father that I was pretty, he would reply, “She's the smartest in her class.” These are values our city should promote — ensuring equal access to opportunities based on dedication and talent, not on who we love or who we are.With respect to those who have come before us, we know that change is constant. The image of Texas is of cowboys — vaqueros — fighting to tame a wild frontier. But now we have a 21st century powerhouse economy. Our small-town past steadily changed into a high-rise present — and today, six of the 20 largest cities in the United States are right here in Texas.We'll continue to change — I believe for the better. I can't think of any better time in history to be living in Texas than right now. Texans have always boasted that this is a land of opportunity, and this has never been truer than today.As chairwoman of the Senate Veteran Affairs and Military Installations Committee, I was blessed to meet Staff Sergeant Eric Alva . In 2003, this San Antonio native became the first Marine to be seriously injured in the Iraq War, when he stepped on a land mine and lost his right leg.He fought for us. He fought for you. He very nearly died for our country, and still suffers for it every day. And yet, here in his home state and his home city, he can be denied or fired from a job just because he is gay. It's not right that a man who fought to protect this country is not protected at home — that a man who loves his country is discriminated against because of who he loves.Updating the city's non-discrimination ordinance acknowledges the importance of ensuring that all members of our community are treated with fairness and dignity. Together we can make this possible, together we will erase harmful inequalities that threaten our city's quality of life.Thankfully, I will not have to stand alone, because San Antonians are with us. We all know and respect people like Eric.Share your comments		1

It doesn’t mean that I expect Republicans to agree with all my prescriptions, but it is to say that the central problem we face and the one that we faced now that the immediate crisis is over is how do we build a broad-based prosperity. And I want to make sure that all of us in Washington are investing as much time, as much energy, as much debate on how we grow the economy and grow the middle class as we’ve spent over the last two to three years arguing about how we reduce the deficits. NYT: But do you worry, Mr. President, that that description of that sort of standing pat, what happens if you stand pat and the sort of slower than expected -- do you worry that that could end up being your legacy simply because of the obstruction that -- and the gridlock that doesn’t seem to end? MR. OBAMA: Well, let’s separate it from me for a second, because I think if I’m arguing for entirely different policies and Congress ends up pursuing policies that I think don’t make sense and we get a bad result, it’s hard to argue that’d be my legacy. And so I’ll worry about my legacy later or I’ll let historians worry about my legacy. I do worry about what’s happening to ordinary families here is Galesburg and all across the country. When we know that rebuilding our infrastructure right now would put people back to work and it’s never been cheaper for us to do so, and this is all deferred maintenance that we’re going to have to do at some point anyway, I worry that we’re not moving faster to seize the moment. When we know that families are getting killed by college costs, for us not to take bold action -- which means that young people are graduating with massive debt, they can’t buy a home as soon as they want, they can’t start that business that they’ve got a great idea for -- that worries me. So as I suggested in the speech, what I want to make sure everybody in Washington is obsessed with is how are we growing the economy, how are we increasing middle-class incomes and middle-class wages, and increasing middle-class security. And if we’re not talking about that, then we’re talking about the wrong thing. And if our debates around the budget don’t have that in mind, then we’ve got the wrong focus. NYT: Well, you said it yourself in the speech that Washington has taken its eye off the ball. Do you have any -- are you culpable at all in that? Did you -- it’s six -- it’s July now, it’s almost August. Do you wish you were giving a speech like this earlier and done it more often? MR. OBAMA: If you look over the last six months, we right away delivered on the promise to make sure that our tax code was more reflective of our values; that middle-class families locked in relief that they needed; folks like me, at the very top, paid a little bit more. That, by the way, was a fundamental shift that was a decade in the making. That was a big argument. Immediately after that, obviously, we had the tragedy in Newtown and the need for a response. And my wish and hope had been that that was a quicker piece of business and that we had gone ahead and moved forward on that. Immigration reform actually squarely fits into what I’m discussing right now. As I indicated before, we know the economy will grow faster if we get immigration reform done. We know that Social Security will be shored up if we get immigration reform done. And the Senate’s done the right thing by passing a strong bipartisan bill. So what I will absolutely admit to is that I’ve been here – I’ve been in Washington long enough now to know that if once a week I’m not talking about jobs, the economy, and the middle class, then all manner of distraction fills the void. NYT: Is there any part of your agenda moving forward that you think you are willing to move to the backburner so that you can spend more time on the economy? MR. OBAMA: Well, immigration reform we’ve got to get done, and that right now is just a matter of the House Republicans recognizing that both the American people, businesses, labor, evangelicals -- there’s a broad consensus to go ahead and pass that bill, and if that bill was on the floor tomorrow it would pass. Beyond that, though, we’re working on a range of other issues -- from climate change to reforming government to reducing the backlog in the VA. So there’s a bunch of stuff we’re going to be doing. I will be spending my time over the next several weeks talking about the issues in more detail that I discussed today so that by the time Congress gets back in the fall, I want to make sure that the American people are paying attention and asking themselves, are we doing everything we can to boost middle-class incomes, ladders of opportunity, and middle-class security. And if we’re doing that, then ultimately I think that we won’t get everything done that I want to see done, but we will have shifted away from what I think has been a bad – a damaging framework in Washington, which is to constantly think about is there more we can do to cut the deficit without asking are we making the right cuts, the smart cuts that actually help people in their own lives and help us grow over the long term. NYT: Well, in contrast with the jobs plan that’s now what you’re reflecting today, it’s almost two years old now, and which would measurably add to employment the studies show. MR. OBAMA: Right, because of the sequester. NYT: -- that you and Congress agreed to -- right -- and some of the laws -- the payroll tax cut, and the increase in upper-end taxes to some extent -- but all of those things are by any economist’s measure a drag on the economy. There’s not a day goes by I don’t get some analyst saying that -- and that the Fed is pursuing expansionary policies to offset that. How can you -- how are you going to -- what exactly can you do between now and the end of the year to overcome the Republicans’ opposition and change that, to end sequester? MR. OBAMA: Well, let me back up, Jackie. First of all, as the economy got stronger during the course of my presidency, I had always committed to a responsible reduction in the deficit. I think that was the smart thing to do, the right thing to do, and good for our growth. And if we’re growing faster, if businesses and the markets have more confidence, then ultimately that benefits middle-class families as well. So I make no apologies for putting forward budgets consistently that, as I had promised, would gradually reduce the deficit. Now, the sequester I did not want to be in place. When you say I agreed to it, what happened, as you will recall, in 2011 is, is that we had the prospect of either default or a willingness on the part of Republicans and Democrats to spend a year and a half trying to come up with a sensible way to reduce the deficit. The sequester was supposed to be something that was so damaging to the economy that both parties would want to avoid it. The fact that Republicans embraced the sequester as what they consider a win during the course of this year, despite all the damage that they said they wanted to avoid, for example, to our military, is different from me agreeing to the sequester. All right? So that’s point number one. Point number two, every economist will tell you that if we are being smart about growth and we’re thinking about jobs and we’re thinking about the middle class, but we’re also thinking about fiscal responsibility, then what we should be doing is making sure that the drop-off in government spending on vital things like education and infrastructure don’t go down too fast, and that rather we look at what the real problem is, which is long-term health care costs. Because of the Affordable Care Act and a lot of changes that are taking place out there among providers, we’re starting to see health care costs slow. That’s a positive. If we can build on that, then we can capture the same amount of savings that we’re capturing through the sequester and use those to make sure that we’re not cutting vital investments that I talked about today, and we can help middle-class families. NYT: Who are still embracing sequestration and who are still willing to use the debt limit to go to the mat. MR. OBAMA: Well, this is what they say. On the other hand, we also have a number of very thoughtful and sensible Republicans over in the Senate who have said that we should not play brinksmanship, that we should come up with a long-term plan. I met with a couple of House Republicans over the last several weeks who would like to see that happen. They’re not the loudest voices in the room at the moment. And part of what I’d like to see over the next several weeks is, if we’re having a conversation that’s framed as how are we growing the economy, how are we strengthening the middle class, how are we putting people back to work, how are we making college more affordable, how are we bringing manufacturing back -- the answer to those questions I think force a different result than if we are constantly asking ourselves how can we cut the deficit more, faster, sooner. NYT: Have you yielded anything from your outreach to Republicans? And do you still have hope for a 10-year deal by the end of the year? MR. OBAMA: I think it’s still possible. There are certainly Republicans who are deeply concerned about the effects of sequester. It’s been interesting -- I’ve talked to a number of them who are from deeply red states, consider themselves very conservative, who say it doesn’t make sense for us to cut discretionary spending more; it doesn’t make sense for us to cut education further -- because they’re seeing the impacts in their districts. Certainly there are a bunch of Republicans who say for us to hollow out our military as steeply, drastically as we’re doing if sequester stays in place for next year makes no sense. So if the American people have confidence that there’s a path that will grow the economy faster, put more people back to work, that doesn’t involve massive new federal spending programs, but instead just make sure that we’re investing in the right things, and if we’re being attentive to debt and deficits over a 20, 30-year time horizon, then potentially some of those Republicans start giving voice to their concerns a little more loudly than they’re doing right now. But one of the challenges, as I said in the speech, is that there’s almost a kneejerk habit right now that if I’m for it, then they’ve got to be against it. And I think there are a lot of Republicans who are frustrated by that, because they want to be for something, not just against something. But they’ve got to work through that pattern that’s developed over the last couple of years. NYT: A couple of slightly different topics. On the economy, the Fed is obviously an important player. You’ve got a big decision ahead of yourself in terms of the chairman. What are you looking for in a chairman? And there were reports yesterday that you are very close to naming Larry Summers as the new Fed chairman. True? MR. OBAMA: I have not made a final decision. I’ve narrowed it down to some extraordinarily qualified candidates. NYT: Do you want to say who? MR. OBAMA: No. MR. OBAMA: And what I’m looking for is somebody who understands the Fed has a dual mandate, that that’s not just lip service; that it is very important to keep inflation in check, to keep our dollar sound, and to ensure stability in the markets. But the idea is not just to promote those things in the abstract. The idea is to promote those things in service of the lives of ordinary Americans getting better. And when unemployment is still too high, and long-term unemployment is still too high, and there’s still weak demand in a lot of industries, I want a Fed chairman that can step back and look at that objectively and say, let’s make sure that we’re growing the economy, but let’s also keep an eye on inflation, and if it starts heating up, if the markets start frothing up, let’s make sure that we’re not creating new bubbles.

You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times's products and services. Thank you for subscribing. An error has occurred. Please try again later. You are already subscribed to this email. NYT: And do you have a timeline in mind for announcing that? MR. OBAMA: I think you can anticipate that over the next several months, an announcement will be made. Ben Bernanke, by the way, has done a fine job as Fed chairman. And when you look at Ben Bernanke’s testimony, not just last week but over the last couple of years, what he’s consistently said is right now, our priority needs to be growing the economy faster and strengthening incomes for ordinary Americans. If we do that, our deficits come down because we’re bringing in more revenue. If we do that, it becomes easier for us to handle the long-term fiscal challenges. And one of the interesting things that we don’t talk about enough is the contrast between what’s happened in the United States and what’s happened in a lot of other developing countries, Europe in particular. It's pretty rare where we have the chance to look at two policy approaches and follow them over several years and see which one worked. And the fact is there are a lot of European countries who followed the prescription that the House Republicans are calling for right now, and not only have they lagged well below where we've gone in terms of growth, in many cases their debt and their deficits have actually gone up because their economy is still effectively in recession. And although we haven’t been growing as fast as we would like, we have consistently outperformed those countries that followed the recipe that the House Republicans are offering right now. Now, I’m more sympathetic to those European countries because they, in some cases, didn’t have a choice. They don’t have the dominant world currency. They don’t have people who want to invest in their countries the way folks around the world still want to invest in ours. But in some ways, we've got evidence here. This is not an abstract argument. We know what's needed to make our economy grow right now. And if we grow our economy, and middle-class families are doing better, and housing prices are stronger, and young people are starting families of their own and they’re jobs at good wages, that’s the thing that will bring deficits down the fastest. NYT: A couple other quick subjects that are economic-related. Keystone pipeline -- Republicans especially talk about that as a big job creator. You've said that you would approve it only if you could be assured it would not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon in the atmosphere. Is there anything that Canada could do or the oil companies could do to offset that as a way of helping you to reach that decision? MR. OBAMA: Well, first of all, Michael, Republicans have said that this would be a big jobs generator. There is no evidence that that’s true. And my hope would be that any reporter who is looking at the facts would take the time to confirm that the most realistic estimates are this might create maybe 2,000 jobs during the construction of the pipeline -- which might take a year or two -- and then after that we’re talking about somewhere between 50 and 100 [chuckles] jobs in a economy of 150 million working people. NYT: Yet there are a number of unions who want you to approve this. MR. OBAMA: Well, look, they might like to see 2,000 jobs initially. But that is a blip relative to the need. So what we also know is, is that that oil is going to be piped down to the Gulf to be sold on the world oil markets, so it does not bring down gas prices here in the United States. In fact, it might actually cause some gas prices in the Midwest to go up where currently they can’t ship some of that oil to world markets. Now, having said that, there is a potential benefit for us integrating further with a reliable ally to the north our energy supplies. But I meant what I said; I'm going to evaluate this based on whether or not this is going to significantly contribute to carbon in our atmosphere. And there is no doubt that Canada at the source in those tar sands could potentially be doing more to mitigate carbon release. NYT: And if they did, could that offset the concerns about the pipeline itself? MR. OBAMA: We haven't seen specific ideas or plans. But all of that will go into the mix in terms of John Kerry’s decision or recommendation on this issue. NYT: And then -- I’ll let Jackie go -- but on the employer mandate, I don’t think you’ve been asked the question directly why you made the decision to delay it, and whether, given your criticism of President Bush over the years for potentially exceeding his executive authority, there’s been a lot of folks out there on the Republican side who claim that somehow you’ve exceeded your authority on this. Is there anything to that? MR. OBAMA: Well, this was a very practical decision that actually doesn’t go to the heart of us implementing the Affordable Care Act. The majority of employers in this country provide health insurance to their employees. And the number of employers who are potentially subject to the employer mandate is relatively small. The way the law was originally written, it did not take into account the fact that we don’t necessarily need to load up the vast majority of companies that are already doing the right thing with a bunch of additional paperwork; are there simpler ways for us to allow them to certify that they’re providing health insurance? And if they do that, then the purpose, the spirit of the law is met, and we can concentrate on the few bad actors who are unwilling to provide health insurance to their employees even though they can afford it, and they’re relatively large employers. And businesses came to us and said, listen, we were supportive of providing health insurance to employees, in fact, we provide health insurance to our employees; we understand you want to get at the bad actors here, but are there ways to provide us some administrative relief? And what we said was, given that that is not critical to standing up the marketplaces where people are going to actually be able to buy lower-cost, high-quality insurance and get the tax credits that make it affordable for them, we thought it made sense to give another year not only for companies to prepare, but also for us to work with Treasury and others to see if there are just ways we can make this a little bit simpler for companies who are already doing the right thing. This is the kind of routine modifications or tweaks to a large program that’s starting off that in normal times in a normal political atmosphere would draw a yawn from everybody. The fact that something like this generates a frenzy on Republicans is consistent with the fact that they've voted to repeal this thing 38 times without offering a alternative that is plausible. And from what I understand, based on recent reporting, they’ve just given up on offering an alternative. So essentially -- their central economic plan that they’re currently presenting involves making sure that 50 million Americans cannot get health insurance; that people with preexisting conditions are potentially locked out of the market; that the rebates that people have received from insurance companies are sent back; that young people who are right now on their parents’ plan because they’re 26 or under, that they suddenly don’t have health insurance. I do not understand the argument that that somehow grows the economy or strengthens the middle class. And during the course of implementation, are there going to be some glitches? Are there going to be some complaints from employers who are still trying to figure it out and may not know what subsidies are available to them? Absolutely. Are there some folks who may say, we're going to try to figure out ways not to provide health insurance to our employees? Yes. But that’s a small proportion of our overall economy, and the principle that everybody should be able to get health insurance is one that the vast majority of Americans agree with. NYT: People questioned your legal and constitutional authority to do that unilaterally -- to delay the employer mandate. Did you consult with your lawyer? MR. OBAMA: -- but where Congress is unwilling to act, I will take whatever administrative steps that I can in order to do right by the American people. And if Congress thinks that what I’ve done is inappropriate or wrong in some fashion, they’re free to make that case. But there’s not an action that I take that you don't have some folks in Congress who say that I'm usurping my authority. Some of those folks think I usurp my authority by having the gall to win the presidency. And I don't think that's a secret. But ultimately, I’m not concerned about their opinions -- very few of them, by the way, are lawyers, much less constitutional lawyers. I am concerned about the folks who I spoke to today who are working really hard, are trying to figure out how they can send their kids to college, are trying to make sure that they can save for their retirement. And if I can take steps on their behalf, then I’m going to do so. And I would hope that more and more of Congress will say, you know what, since that’s our primary focus, we’re willing to work with you to advance those ideals. But I’m not just going to sit back if the only message from some of these folks is no on everything, and sit around and twiddle my thumbs for the next 1,200 days. NYT: Polls this week have shown your health care law has lost support. What are you going to be doing to build support? MR. OBAMA: We’re going to implement it. NYT: Are you going to be getting out on the road? MR. OBAMA: Here is what will build support, given that we’ve been outspent four to one from the other side with all kinds of distortions about health care. Here is what we’re going to do to beat back that misinformation. On October 1st, people are going to be able to start signing up. And if right now they’re buying insurance on the individual market, they’re going to get on those computers or they’re going to make a phone call to one of these call centers and they’re going to find out that they can save 20 percent, 30 percent, or 50 percent on their premiums. And people who have not been able to get insurance before are going to be able to finally get insurance. And people who lose their jobs in the interim and find out that they’ve got a preexisting condition, it’s hard for them to get insurance or they can’t afford COBRA, they’re going to have a place to go. And over the course of six months to a year, as people sign up, and it works, and lo and behold, the people who already have health insurance are not being impacted at all other than the fact that their insurance is more secure and they are getting free preventive care, and all the nightmare scenarios and the train wrecks and the “sky is falling” predictions that come from the other side do not happen, then health care will become more popular. But until then, when we’re getting outspent four to one and people are just uncertain about what all this means for them, we’re going to continue to have some polls like that. And me just making more speeches explaining it in and of itself won’t do it. The test of this is going to be is it working. And if it works, it will be pretty darn popular. NYT: March on Washington coming up soon. Are you going to do anything to mark it? Are you planning on being a part of the 50th anniversary? MR. OBAMA: Absolutely. It’s obviously a historic, seminal event in the country. It’s part of my generation’s formative memory and it’s a good time for us to do some reflection. Obviously, after the Trayvon Martin case, a lot of people have been thinking about race, but I always remind people -- and, in fact, I have a copy of the original program in my office, framed -- that that was a march for jobs and justice; that there was a massive economic component to that. When you think about the coalition that brought about civil rights, it wasn’t just folks who believed in racial equality; it was people who believed in working folks having a fair shot. It was Walter Reuther and the UAW coming down here because they understood that if there are some workers who are not getting a fair deal then ultimately that’s going to undercut their ability to get a fair deal. And if there’s one thing that I wanted to try to emphasize today in this speech, it is that America has always worked better when everybody has a chance to succeed. I had a conversation a couple of weeks back with a guy named Robert Putnam, who I’ve known for a long time. NYT: He was my professor actually at Harvard. MR. OBAMA: Right. I actually knew Bob when I was a state senator and he had put together this seminar to just talk about some of the themes that he had written about in “Bowling Alone,” the weakening of the community fabric and the impact it’s having on people. And the work he’s doing right now has to do with this issue of inequality. And it applies to a city like Galesburg, where 30 years ago, anybody in this town who wanted to find a job, they could go get a job. They could go get it at the Maytag plant. They could go get it with the railroad. It might be hard work, it might be tough work, but they could buy a house with it. The kids here all went to the same school -- the banker’s kid and the guy working at the Maytag plant’s going to the same school. They've got the same social support. College is affordable for all of them. They don't have to take out $100,000 of debt to do it. And there was a sense of not upward mobility in the abstract; it was part and parcel of who we were as Americans. And that’s what’s been eroding over the last 20, 30 years, well before the financial crisis. Now, the financial crisis made things a lot worse. And so I had to spend the first four years in my presidency getting us back to ground level. We had to make sure the banking system wasn't collapsing. We had to make sure the auto industry didn't collapse. We had to make sure that we put people back to work short term and boosted demand until the markets got going and consumers got more confident and housing started to recover. And so here we are, having dealt with this massive crisis, but those trends -- that erosion of what a Galesburg or a [Port]* Clinton, Ohio, where Bob Putnam lived -- those trends have continued. And that’s what people sense. That's why people are anxious. That's why people are frustrated. That's what they talk to me about and that's what they write to me about: “I'm doing okay right now, but what I've seen over the last 20 years and what I learned profoundly during this crisis is that the ground under my feet just isn't as secure, and that the work I'm doing may not be rewarded.” And everything that I am proposing and everything I will be proposing over the next three years goes right at that issue. And if that’s not what Washington’s talking about, then we will be missing the boat. And racial tensions won’t get better; they may get worse, because people will feel as if they’ve got to compete with some other group to get scraps from a shrinking pot. If the economy is growing, everybody feels invested. Everybody feels as if we're rolling in the same direction. And so a lot of the other issues that we’re talking about -- whether it’s climate change or immigration, or how we manage our trade relations -- all those are eased if we’ve got our economic act together. But that’s not what we talk about. And it's true that Congress moves at such a glacial pace these days that sometimes if you start a bill like immigration and you're thinking this should be done by now, it seems to take a year of folks just sitting around spinning their wheels, that can be frustrating. But we should be able to attend to some of these other issues even as we’re staying focused on this central issue. That’s at least what I’m going to be doing. NYT: Thank you, Mr. President. MR. OBAMA: Thanks, guys. Appreciate you.		1
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/11/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-says-government-jobs-have-fallen-half/	"""There are actually half a million fewer government employees now than there were when (President Barack) Obama took office."""	true	['Economy', 'Government Efficiency', 'Jobs', 'Pundits', 'Workers']	http://www.nytimes.com/	http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/11/opinion/11krugman.html?ref=opinion	2011/07/11	Fear the bond market. Two years ago The Wall Street Journal declared that interest rates on United States debt would soon soar unless Washington stopped trying to fight the economic slump. Ever since, warnings about the imminent attack of the “bond vigilantes” have been used to attack any spending on job creation. But basic economics said that rates would stay low as long as the economy was depressed — and basic economics was right. The interest rate on 10-year bonds was 3.7 percent when The Wall Street Journal issued that warning; at the end of last week it was 3.03 percent. How have the usual suspects responded? By inventing their own reality. Last week, Representative Paul Ryan, the man behind the G.O.P. plan to dismantle Medicare, declared that we must slash government spending to “take pressure off the interest rates” — the same pressure, I suppose, that has pushed those rates to near-record lows. It’s the workers’ fault. Unemployment soared during the financial crisis and its aftermath. So it seems bizarre to argue that the real problem lies with the workers — that the millions of Americans who were working four years ago but aren’t working now somehow lack the skills the economy needs. Yet that’s what you hear from many pundits these days: high unemployment is “structural,” they say, and requires long-term solutions (which means, in practice, doing nothing).

Well, if there really was a mismatch between the workers we have and the workers we need, workers who do have the right skills, and are therefore able to find jobs, should be getting big wage increases. They aren’t. In fact, average wages actually fell last month. We tried to stimulate the economy, and it didn’t work. Everybody knows that President Obama tried to stimulate the economy with a huge increase in government spending, and that it didn’t work. But what everyone knows is wrong. Think about it: Where are the big public works projects? Where are the armies of government workers? There are actually half a million fewer government employees now than there were when Mr. Obama took office. So what happened to the stimulus? Much of it consisted of tax cuts, not spending. Most of the rest consisted either of aid to distressed families or aid to hard-pressed state and local governments. This aid may have mitigated the slump, but it wasn’t the kind of job-creation program we could and should have had. This isn’t 20-20 hindsight: some of us warned from the beginning that tax cuts would be ineffective and that the proposed spending was woefully inadequate. And so it proved. It’s also worth noting that in another area where government could make a big difference — help for troubled homeowners — almost nothing has been done. The Obama administration’s program of mortgage relief has gone nowhere: of $46 billion allotted to help families stay in their homes, less than $2 billion has actually been spent. So let’s summarize: The economy isn’t fixing itself. Nor are there real obstacles to government action: both the bond vigilantes and structural unemployment exist only in the imaginations of pundits. And if stimulus seems to have failed, it’s because it was never actually tried. Listening to what supposedly serious people say about the economy, you’d think the problem was “no, we can’t.” But the reality is “no, we won’t.” And every pundit who reinforces that destructive passivity is part of the problem. A version of this op-ed appears in print on July 11, 2011, on Page A19 of the New York edition with the headline: No, We Can’t? Or Won’t?.		1

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. [09:00:07] (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): Whiplash. Donald Trump changing his position on abortion.DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You have to ban it. TAPPER: Twice in two days. TRUMP: The laws are set. I think we have to leave it that way. TRUMP: How will voters respond to the front-runner's flip-flopping? And delegate derby. SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Our path going forward is to get 1,237. TAPPER: But if no one makes it to that magic number, who will win? The stealth strategies under way to swing the convention. Plus, under her skin. HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about that. I'm sick of it. TAPPER: Clinton accusing Sanders of lying and playing games over a New York debate date. SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: My understanding is, she would like to do it in Brooklyn. I was born in Brooklyn. Let's do it. TAPPER: Will they face off again? And the best political minds will be here with insights from the campaign trail. (END VIDEOTAPE)TAPPER: Hello. I'm Jake Tapper in Washington, where the state of our union is getting testy. With the Wisconsin primary just two days away, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders spent the weekend sniping at each other. He demanded an apology for being called a liar. She called him desperate. She says he's playing games over a debate day. He says she's the one blocking it. Last night, they took to the same stage, and each insisted the other will lose to Donald Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SANDERS: For the Democratic Party to succeed, we need a vibrancy, and we need an energy, and we need a level of grassroots activism that we do not have at this moment. CLINTON: I think we need a nominee who's been tested and vetted already.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) CLINTON: And for 25 years, they have thrown everything they could at me, but I'm still standing. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: Joining me now is Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Senator, thanks so much for joining us. We appreciate it. SANDERS: My pleasure. TAPPER: You have gotten into a back-and-forth with Secretary Clinton about money from the fossil fuel industry. Hillary Clinton says she is sick of your campaign lying about her. You demanded an apology. Her campaign is now calling you desperate and says that you have clearly decided your only path to victory is through misleading attacks. (LAUGHTER)TAPPER: I want to give you an opportunity to respond. SANDERS: Well, according to a Greenpeace analysis of campaign finance reports, the Clinton campaign, in the broader sense, including their super PAC, have received $4.5 million from fossil fuel interests; 43 paid lobbyists of the fossil fuel industry have made maximum contributions, the maximum contributions they could to the Clinton campaign. No, we were not lying. We were telling the truth. And the point here is that climate change is one of the great crises facing this country. We have got to stand up to the fossil fuel industry, transform our energy system, not take money from paid lobbyists from that industry. TAPPER: Now, the fact-checker at ""The Washington Post"" took a look at the exact claims you made just now, and they wrote -- quote -- ""The Sanders campaign is exaggerating the contributions that Clinton has received from the oil and gas industry. In the context of her overall campaign, the contributions are hardly significant. It's especially misleading to count all of the funds raised by lobbyists with multiple clients as money given by the fossil fuel industry.""And they gave you three Pinocchios, sir. SANDERS: Well, let the voters decide whether paid lobbyists who represent the fossil fuel industry, 43 of them give maximum personal contributions to the Clinton campaign, and whether or not these same people are out in some cases muddling, trying to bring in even more money. I don't think that we are distorting reality. That's the simple reality. TAPPER: But you have taken $50,000 from individuals who work for the oil and gas industry. Why is it OK for you and not for her? SANDERS: Because I take money in, and she takes money in from individuals. That's right, workers in an industry, nothing wrong with that. Jake, that is very different from taking money from lobbyists, people who are working day and night in defense of that industry. And that has been a confusing point. Workers, yes. We get money from workers in every industry in the country. So does Clinton. But there is a difference between getting money from a worker and somebody whose job it is, is to represent that industry. I believe we have got to take on the fossil fuel industry. I think that their greed and their willingness to acknowledge the crisis of climate change is something that has to be dealt with, and I am prepared to do that if elected president. [09:05:05] TAPPER: You have said that you're not going to make an issue out of the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's e-mail server. But a high-profile surrogate of yours, the actress Rosario Dawson, she brought it up this week at one of your rallies in New York. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROSARIO DAWSON, ACTRESS: Shame on you, Hillary. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)DAWSON: Oh, sorry. Hold on. Let me watch my tone. Well, yes, she is under FBI investigation, thank you. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)DAWSON: That's not getting promoted very much, but she is about to be interviewed in a little bit. (END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: Now, when it comes to the FBI investigation, are you trying to have it both ways? You don't make any accusations against her, but one of your highest-profile surrogates does? SANDERS: Hey, Jake, Jake, we have dozens of surrogates, and Rosario is doing a great job for us. She was with me in the South Bronx when we had 18,000 people coming out to start our campaign in New York. We have many, many surrogates who say many, many things. Many of these surrogates do not agree with everything I say. And I do not agree with every approach and everything that they say. And that's the simple reality. What we have done -- and, by the way, there are a lot of people who say, Bernie, why don't you go after her on her FBI investigation? Why don't you go after her on the Clinton Foundation money? We have chosen not to do that. What we have chosen to do is run an issue-oriented campaign as to why for 30 years the middle class of this country has been disappearing, why we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, why we are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee paid family and medical leave, why health care to all our people. Those are the issues that we have been focusing on. TAPPER: So you would rather your surrogates not talk about the FBI investigation, though? SANDERS: Look, we have people who are volunteering their time. As you know, Rosario is a very well-known actress. She has been kind enough to stand with me. She will say what she wants to say. That is not what I want to be focusing on, and I would hope my surrogates do not focus on that issue. We have enormous issues facing the American people. One of the issues we're talking about every day is kids leaving college $40,000, $50,000 in debt, which is why I want to make public colleges and universities tuition-free and have Wall Street tax on speculation pay for that. TAPPER: Let's talk about taxes, specifically about your tax returns. I have to say, I'm kind of surprised that you haven't gone further on transparency. You released the summary page of your 2014 tax returns. Hillary Clinton has posted on her Web site the last eight years of her personal returns, all of the returns. Before the New York primary, will you match her? Will you post your full returns for the last eight years? SANDERS: You know, we are not -- you know, to be very honest with you, you know who does our tax returns? My wife does our tax returns. We have been a little bit busy lately. So, we will get out as much information as we can. There ain't going to be very much exciting in that. I get a salary from the United States Senate. You know, there's not going to be anything new in it that there hasn't -- people haven't seen for the last many years, but we will get it out as soon as we can. TAPPER: But nobody -- nobody has seen them at all, I guess, is the point. And whether or not there's anything exciting in them...SANDERS: No, that is not true. That is -- that is not true. Of course, we have released them in the past. Our financial situation, to the best of my knowledge, has not changed very much, but we will get out all of that information as soon as we can. TAPPER: You and Hillary Clinton have been trading fire over the timing of a potential debate. You said it was ludicrous for her to propose debating tomorrow night, which, of course, is the final night of the NCAA Finals, Nova vs. Chapel Hill. Hillary Clinton said this morning she's up for debating on Thursday, April 14. Are you in? SANDERS: I'm not quite sure how that works on our schedule. We may have a major rally being scheduled. We have been talking, I think, to NBC and to CNN, and we're working on a number of dates. First, I'm very glad that the secretary has accepted the challenge to debate in New York. I think we can work out a date that works for her schedule, that works for my schedule. Doing it during the NCAA Finals or whatever makes no sense. Doing it in the morning, when people are going to -- not going to be watching it in large numbers, makes no sense. But I'm confident we work -- will work out a time that's good for both of our schedules and when large numbers of people will be watching. TAPPER: Do you think she proposed tomorrow night because it was competing with the NCAA finals, that she was trying to avoid a lot of viewers? SANDERS: Well -- well, I think, you know, who knows? But, you know, if you look at some of those Democratic debates that we have had in the past, many observers have noted that they're often scheduled on days when the voter turnout -- the viewer turnout would not be particularly high. So, I would hope that she would agree with me, let's do it in a mutually convenient time. She has a rough schedule. I have a rough schedule. Let's get it on a network where people are going to be watching it, at a time when people are going to be watching it. I think we can work that out. [09:10:03] TAPPER: Amen to that, hopefully here on CNN. Senator Bernie Sanders, thanks for joining us. We appreciate it. SANDERS: Thank you. TAPPER: In the Republican race for the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination, every single one of them matters. There are 25 delegates up for grabs today in North Dakota. We will go there live for an update after this quick break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) TAPPER: Welcome back to STATE OF THE UNION. I'm Jake Tapper. This weekend's biggest Republican primary isn't a primary at all; 25 of North Dakota's delegates will be picked in Fargo, North Dakota, today, not by voters, but by the state's party insiders. And when those delegates who are chosen today get to the Republican Convention in July, they will be able to support whomever they like, which makes them a very hot commodity. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It is entirely possible the men and women gathered here will decide this entire primary, will decide this nomination. I am here asking for you to stand with us. (END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: Our Phil Mattingly is live in Fargo, where the election's about to begin. Phil, these delegates could actually be very crucial. PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that wasn't hyperbole by Ted Cruz there, Jake. And here's why. [09:15:01] The 25 delegates that will be selected today, 28 in total coming from this state, will be unbound. That means they're free agents. And when they get to Cleveland in July, they could break any way. So, say, hypothetically, Donald Trump needs 15 or 16 delegates to get to that magic 1,237 number continue, if he can lock up that number of delegates out of this group in North Dakota, that could help him secure the nomination. Or Ted Cruz could use that number to help block that. So, that's why we have seen, Jake, behind the scenes has been amazing, not just on the convention floor, but the lobbying over at the Ramada Inn just three miles away. There's hospitality suites from all three Republican campaigns. Ben Carson holding private meetings all night last night for Donald Trump, Carly Fiorina doing the same for Ted Cruz, all trying to secure the support, if not publicly, at least privately from the delegates, that are likely to come out of this convention today, Jake. TAPPER: Ah, the wheeling and dealing at the Fargo Ramada. Phil Mattingly, thank you so much. And joining me now is the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus. Reince, good to see you. Thanks for joining us. REINCE PRIEBUS, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: Hey, Jake. TAPPER: So, if Donald Trump secures the nomination, he would start this general election campaign as the least popular candidate in modern times. Take a look at this from the latest ""Washington Post""/ABC News poll -- quote -- ""Three-quarters of women view him unfavorably. So do nearly two-thirds of independents, 80 percent of young adults, 85 percent of Hispanics, and nearly half of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents.""How do you begin to turn those numbers around, sir? PRIEBUS: Well, I think in a general election campaign, all the candidates know that, you know, that it's a little bit different, and the message has to be very broadly-based, not just at the base of the Republican Party and participants in the primary process.But, look, our party's the party of the open door. And the only way we're going to grow is by adding people in the door, and not subtracting and dividing people out. So, I think there will be plenty of time to speak to the general public. But, right now, we're having a conversation within a pretty confined space. TAPPER: How does that open door figure with the giant wall that Mr. Trump wants to construct? Because he's certainly sending a message that is apparently, according to polls, chasing away a lot of potential Republican voters, Latinos, Muslims, independents, women, Republican-leaning independents. Are they going to be able to make their way to that door? PRIEBUS: Well, look, I think that immigration and a secure border is something that every American's worried about. And if you look at the numbers, you're seeing lots of independents and Democrats saying, yes, I think that we need to secure that border. They're not happy with the president's policies on immigration. And, quite frankly, if you look at the people that are coming into the Republican Party, we have got the first-time voter registration edge on Democrats in over, like, 25 years in battleground states, Jake. No one can deny the fact that we're seeing record turnout. We're up 70 percent. The Democrats are down by 30 percent. And who knows? I mean, you might be talking about an open convention on the Democrats' side if Hillary Clinton gets indicted or charged. Who knows? Maybe they will open up the delegates on their side and Joe Biden will reappear. It's possible. I'm not just saying it in tongue in cheek. I think it's possible. TAPPER: It's certainly possible, but let's turn back to the Republicans, because you're talking about securing the border, and I take your point.But it's been three years since you and the GOP put out your autopsy report, looking at the reasons why you felt the party lost the 2012 election. And the report said that the party needs to improve its image with Latino voters. This is what you said back in 2013 on the issue of immigration -- quote -- ""Using the word self-deportation, it's a horrific comment to make. I don't think it has anything to do with our party. When someone makes those comments, obviously, it hurts us.""In retrospect, self-deportation compared to what we're hearing from Mr. Trump on the campaign trail, I mean, that's practically La Cucaracha. (LAUGHTER)PRIEBUS: Well, look, as a party -- as a national party, one of our problems was that we weren't in Hispanic and black communities on a full-time basis. And the big changes we have made here is getting to a place where you have got 10 people every 10 blocks in Cleveland, in Cincinnati, in Pueblo County, Colorado. I mean, if you look at what we have done as a party, we had 46 percent of the Hispanic vote in Colorado in 2014. We spent about $7 million or $8 million on the ground there. We got 28 percent of the black vote in Ohio. That didn't just happen by accident. It happened because we were committed to communicating and getting Hispanic and black voters to the polls and telling them about our party of equality and freedom and opportunity. That's some of the biggest changes we have made in our party. But, sure, candidates have to watch their mouth. They have to watch their tone and their tenor. And the only way you can be the party of the open door is if you keep that in mind. And so, you know, it's going to be my job, and it's our obligation here to work with our candidates when we get to the general election and make sure that we're doing our best and putting our best foot forward in communicating our message to every American, no matter who they are or where they live. [09:20:05]TAPPER: Have you communicated to the front-runner that perhaps he needs to watch his tone and tenor when it comes to this general election electorate that is paying attention and, according to polls, not liking what they hear from him? PRIEBUS: Well, I mean, obviously, we have got to talk to all of our candidates about those things, and I think I have. And it's been, in some cases, pretty well-documented that I have. But, look, we're in the middle of a pretty tight race right now. And, as you know, people are talking about the potential for an open convention, and no one really knows, obviously, who's going to be the nominee. But it's our job to be fair and give credence to the voice and vote of our delegates and voters across the country. TAPPER: People in Washington, D.C., are waking up to this headline at ""The Washington Post,"" ""The Future According to Trump: Massive Recession."" Are you concerned at all about that message, a message of doom and gloom? PRIEBUS: Well, certainly, people are afraid in this country, and they're angry with the president that hasn't delivered. And whether you're on Main Street or whether you're in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, or wherever you're from, things have not improved. And so I think, you know, when people are afraid and when they're angry, sometimes, people say things that they regret. But the truth is, is that people are concerned about the future. And every candidate is going to communicate their message differently. But it's up to us to choose a nominee along with the voters across the country, and then get our message out to the people and win in November. I think we're going to do that. You look at Hillary Clinton, she's in the ditch. Her numbers are backwards. She's losing to a socialist in Vermont. I get that we have got some drama on our side of the aisle. I won't shy away from that. But, certainly, when you look at the -- what's going on on the Democrats' side, I think they're on the verge of a fiasco at their convention. And I don't know what Comey is going to do at the FBI either. TAPPER: On Thursday night, there was a town hall meeting, and Donald Trump was asked about whether he -- not -- whether or not he thought women who get abortions should be punished. And he said, yes, there has to be punishment. Now, he's since walked back that answer. But Rush Limbaugh, who is a major conservative voice, as I'm sure you know, expressed real concern about what that answer will mean to Democrats. Take a listen. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: I'm telling you, what happened last night was huge in terms of rejuvenating the Democrats. They were moribund. They were falling asleep. They were depressed. They don't have a candidate they could give a damn about. They're excited not at all. Their turnout is nothing. Now they're energized. (END AUDIO CLIP)TAPPER: Are you concerned at all? Is Rush Limbaugh right? PRIEBUS: Well, he's right about the first part, that they have nothing to be excited about. (LAUGHTER)PRIEBUS: He said it better than I could. But, look, I mean, he's since walked that back. Of course, we don't want women prosecuted. But, again, as I said before, we're the party of the open door. That means anyone can come in. Obviously, we have our principles that we're a pro-life party. We believe that. I expect that, obviously, to be the case moving forward. And I'm happy he clarified his comments. TAPPER: Former Bush adviser Karl Rove said this week that a fresh face might be the thing that could give Republicans a chance in November. John Boehner has said that that person should be Paul Ryan, your fellow Wisconsinite. From the standpoint of the party rules, is there a possibility that House Speaker Paul Ryan could end up as the Republican nominee maybe on the fourth or fifth ballot, something of a consensus candidate? PRIEBUS: No, because, number one, he doesn't want to do it. And I know Paul very well. And, you know, he doesn't seek out these things. He's one of the unique people in Washington where, you know, his ego is, like, not even there. And he's not selfish. And he doesn't think like that. So, here's the thing. If anything like that were to happen, which I think is highly, highly unlikely, I think our candidate is someone who's running, OK? That's pretty obvious. But, number two, even if something like that were even remotely possible, that candidate would actually have to have a floor operation and an actual campaign going on with the delegates to make something like that possible. And Paul's not going to do that. So, my answer is no. But, clearly, there's a lot of information out there that people are spreading around to cause a lot of confusion. But I think that our candidate is someone who's running. TAPPER: All right. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, thank you so much. Always a pleasure to have you on, sir. PRIEBUS: You bet, Jake. TAPPER: Coming up: A Badger State crowd warmly welcomes Ted Cruz, but did they give Trump loyalist Sarah Palin something of a cold shoulder? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SARAH PALIN (R), FORMER ALASKA GOVERNOR: I didn't get booed. I don't know. (END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: Will Wisconsin slow Trump's momentum? (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [09:28:58] TAPPER: Welcome back. It's a rare political feat. Donald Trump angered both abortion rights supporters abortion rights opponents this week when he said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC HOST: Do you believe in punishment for abortion, yes or no, as a principle? TRUMP: The answer is that there has to be some form of punishment. MATTHEWS: For the woman? TRUMP: Yes, there has to be some form. (END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: Pressed again about abortion laws on Friday, Trump said this:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: At this moment, the laws are set. And I think we have to leave it that way. (END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: The Trump campaign responded with a clarification that the GOP front-runner gave an account of the laws today, but he would seek to change them through his judicial appointments as president. Here to break down the week, Andre Bauer, the former lieutenant governor of South Carolina and a Trump supporter, Nina Turner, former Ohio state senator and Bernie Sanders supporter, and CNN political commentators Amanda Carpenter, who is a former communications director to Ted Cruz, and Bakari Sellers, former South Carolina state representative and Hillary Clinton supporter.Thanks, one and all, for being here. So, let me start with you. As the Trump supporter, are you at all troubled by the fact that he's given so many different answers about abortion this week? [09:30:00]And while every time he's landed where the pro-life community wants him to be, it does seem to signal to a lot of pro-life supporters that he doesn't really have a lot of principle on this issue? Thought process? I mean, what do you think is going on here?ANDRE BAUER, FORMER SOUTH CAROLINA LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: You know, I think, again, as a businessman, it's a misstep, no question. He should have really worked on, I'm going to be the guy that appoints the right judges. I'm going to be the guy that works with Congress. If they bring me a bill, we have a Republican-controlled Senate and House. I want to work with those guys. We're going to get things done.So it was not the best week for Donald Trump. TAPPER: What do you think, you're somebody who is against abortion, and you oppose Mr. Trump as well. What do you think this week has been about? AMANDA CARPENTER, FORMER COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR TED CRUZ: Well, here's the thing. A gaffe is bigger than a gaffe when it taps into a broader concern about a candidate. And the thing that happened with Donald Trump here is that he was unable to clearly articulate and defend a conservative position in the face of liberal opposition, which was Chris Matthews here.Chris Matthews baited him into adopting the most extreme position on abortion that really is out of step with the pro-life community. And so this really gets to Donald Trump as a candidate. People are worried that he's going to fold under pressure. He likes to tell people what they want to hear, and that's exactly what he did in that interview.TAPPER: Well, you know, but what's interesting, though, Bakari, is that network, NBC, MSNBC, they have asked that exact question of Republican presidential candidates before, anti-abortion ones, whether Huckabee or Santorum, I think Russert (ph) did it once and David Gregory did another time, and both times those candidates had an answer, no, you don't punish the woman.BAKARI SELLERS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: You would think running in this Republican primary, you would have an answer for that. You would have an answer on abortion. And this is not, you know, the first month into the race. We are a month away from -- or two months away from the Republican convention and you are the presumed front-runner.I don't understand how you give an answer that literally makes Mike Huckabee look like a social moderate. I mean, he went to the right of Mike Huckabee on abortion, and that's very difficult to do. It was completely out of step. And I think that he's attempting to repair that, but it also goes to show another problem that Donald Trump has, which is why he has such high unapprovals amongst women. I mean, people are really concerned about the words that come out of his mouth. And rightfully so.TAPPER: Although I have to say, Hillary Clinton also attacked Bernie Sanders on this issue because Bernie Sanders, when asked about it, he condemned what Mr. Trump said, but then ultimately went on to say something along the lines of but the press has to stop covering every single thing out of Donald Trump's mouth. That's a distraction. Clinton said, this is not a distraction. This is a big issue. And she went after Sanders.NINA TURNER (D), FORMER OHIO STATE SENATOR: Well, the senator's remarks should not be measured by what the secretary believes he should say or should not say. He did condemn Mr. Trump, but he went on to say that we do have other problems that go along with that like income inequality, you know, making sure that people have universal health care in this country, taking care of the business of this country.Women care about other issues, too. They care about the economics. They care about a future for themselves and their children or people in their neighborhood. So I think Senator Sanders was just right on that.He does not have to say what the secretary wants him to say. He speaks his mind on these issues and all of them are vitally important. And he has 100 percent record with the pro-choice community. SELLERS: But it does highlight an issue that many of us bring out when talking about Senator Sanders, which is that it's one note that when talking about any issue, it's pivoting right back to income inequality.And what Senator Sanders left out of that answer and what Secretary Clinton hit him on was the fact that abortion is an issue of income inequality. Abortion is an issue of access. Because many times you have poor women, many times women of color, who don't have access, and that is a fundamental issue of income inequality. And that is the message. That you just can't pivot to income inequality when we're talking about an issue that is that near and dear and of that outmost (ph) importance (ph). TURNER: But Bakari, he does not have to measure his remarks based on what the secretary --(CROSSTALK)SELLERS: I agree.TURNER: He has 100 percent record with the pro-choice community. So he was saying yes, that is important. And his point about the fact that I think Mr. Trump has gotten almost $2 billion worth of air time, I mean, every time -- this man sneezes, if he trips, whatever he does, the media is going to cover it. And I think that what Senator Sanders --(CROSSTALK) TAPPER: We'll talk about the Democrats in the next block.Andre, I want to ask you about a question about something that I thought was interesting in the Trump interview with Maureen Dowd in ""The New York Times"" this morning.Quote -- ""Given his"" -- this is Maureen Dowd now, not me. ""Given his draconian comments sending women back to back alleys, I had to ask, when he was a swinging bachelor in Manhattan, was he ever involved with anyone who had an abortion?"" ""Such an interesting question,"" Trump said. ""So what's your next question?""Does that bother you?BAUER: Clearly it bothers me. I didn't see the footage, so it's hard for me to respond on it. You know, it's kind of like tweeting these days. You don't really know what somebody is saying till you actually see it.TAPPER: Yes. It was just a newspaper column and I'm just reading it verbatim.I mean, it seems to me like he's avoiding the question altogether. Is it relevant if Donald Trump as a bachelor ever was involved with a woman and a woman then aborted her pregnancy?BAUER: When you're running for president, everything is relevant.[09:35:01]TAPPER: What do you think?CARPENTER: Yes, I mean, Donald Trump has a history. He was pro- choice. You know, in the past, it's not -- I mean, it's likely that he would be OK with a woman doing that, but that's not something he's going to talk about now.But it gets to the issue, who is Donald Trump? What are his values? Can you trust him to defend a conservative position should he become president? And when he just walks away from a question like that, I mean, Maureen Dowd put it in a column because it's powerful that he wouldn't address it. So that naturally is just going to invite more questions. SELLERS: I think even Amanda and I agree on this, which we won't probably agree on politically but it's breaking news, Donald Trump has no principles.I mean, Donald Trump will say whatever it takes to become the president of the United States.CARPENTER: Yes. SELLERS: I think that is what drives Republicans crazy. That's what makes Democrats fear him. I mean, that's what we highlight on issues like this. I mean, he literally has no principles. CARPENTER: Well, I do think it's going to hurt him now because his brand is so strong as being the guy who tells it like it is, doesn't back down. But really when you take a closer look at his statements, you see that he just tells people what he wants to --(CROSSTALK) TAPPER: Andre, get in here a little bit. This is your guy they're talking about (ph).BAUER: Yes. I'm sitting here thinking Bakari is beating on Trump. His candidate has -- whew!(CROSSTALK)TAPPER: We'll get --(CROSSTALK)TAPPER: ... in the next panel, but, I mean, this is -- I'm sure you hear this from other Republicans, although Trump won South Carolina quite handily, that he doesn't have any principles, he'll say whatever he needs to say to get elected. You obviously don't believe that. BAUER: That's not what I'm hearing. I'm hearing folks that never got involved in a primary before say, finally somebody's willing to take on the establishment within the party and within Washington. We're tired of the same old thing.Quite frankly when I checked out of politics five years ago, you know, I disengaged a little bit. But I've become frustrated as so many just working Americans that don't engage in party politics every day, and that's why it has been so good, I think, for the Republicans. The record turnouts -- nobody has gotten more votes in a primary in South Carolina history ever than Donald Trump. And so he is invigorating people that feel like government's left them and they have no chance to have a voice.TAPPER: And is that fact, that he is taking on the establishment, is that almost more important than anything else including whether or not he answers abortion in five different ways, the question about abortion in five different ways over three different days, whether or not he refuses to answer a question about whether or not a woman he has ever been involved with had gotten abortion? That stuff doesn't even matter anymore even in a pro-life state like South Carolina?BAUER: Well, it definitely matters. No question it matters.But the large percentage of the voters that are coming out now have gotten so frustrated -- look, politicians have told them everything they've wanted to hear for years. It hasn't changed what's happened. The results are not getting any better. So any politician, anyone -- anybody representing up here can say whatever they want, but they haven't gotten -- she's not happy. We're not -- everybody up here says Washington's not working like we want it to. And so people are so refreshed to see something different, somebody says, look, I'm beholden to no one. I'm up here to really make a difference and not support big business, corporate lobbyist, whomever. And that's refreshing.(CROSSTALK)CARPENTER: The strength and weakness of Donald Trump's candidacy, it is built solely on his personality. It's not about a campaign infrastructure. He hasn't been fund-raising, it is just about him. And ultimately that's going to be the hardest box for him to get out of because he doesn't have principles. He doesn't have a uniting vision for the country. It's just about Donald Trump. And I think there's a pretty hard ceiling on that, which we'll see what happens in Wisconsin. TAPPER: Nina, we'll bring you in in the next panel. We're going to take a very quick break. When we come back, no more Mr. Nice guy. Hillary Clinton accusing Bernie Sanders of lying and Sanders is firing back as the Democratic race heats up. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[09:42:41](BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If you protect -- with climate change, will you act on your word and reject fossil fuel money to pay for your campaign?HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I do not. I have money from people who work for fossil fuel coops. I am so sick -- I am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about that. I'm sick of it!(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: Ouch. That was Hillary Clinton unloading on a Greenpeace activist. Tensions between the Clinton and Sanders camps rose this week with both campaigns accusing the other of lying.We're back with the panel. Nina, I'll start with you. It really is getting very ugly between Clinton and Sanders. And you heard Sanders earlier on the show...TURNER: Yes.TAPPER: ... saying that the charges are completely accurate, even though ""The Washington Post"" fact checker gave him three Pinocchios on his accusation against Clinton taking oil and gas money.TURNER: Well of course, you know, we don't agree with ""The Washington Post"" and the senator was very clear about what he had to say.There is a difference between -- he has signed a pledge with Greenpeace that says any donations that come from an executive of that industry or lobbyist, that he will not take. There is a big difference. And the fact that people are bundling money for her in that industry is very clear about who they want to be the commander in chief and what they think may or may not happen if she's there.TAPPER: Bakari?SELLERS: I mean, I understand Hillary Clinton's frustration.Back in May when Bernie Sanders launched his campaign for presidency, he said it wasn't going to be about Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, it was going to be about the American people and we were going to have a substantive debate about issues.The tenor of his campaign has changed. Whether or not it's surrogates or whether or not it's the candidate himself. And I think that Representative Barney Frank actually hit the nail on the head that it's these McCarthyite type attacks. That if you're going to challenge Hillary Clinton's character, if you're going to challenge her character and say that for somehow because these people are contributing to her that her character's going to be compromised, then show us over her two decades-plus of service where her character has been compromised and the campaign hasn't done that. They failed on that.In fact, you know, we talk about the fossil fuel industry that Bernie Sanders has taken money from, Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, laid the framework for this international compact to combat climate change.TAPPER: Are you worried that Sanders is hurting Hillary Clinton...SELLERS: Not at all.TAPPER: ... in such a way that if she gets the nomination, damage will have been done? SELLERS: No because -- and this may be my youthful naivety, but I believe that there will be a moment that Nina Turner and myself and Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton and Michelle and Barack Obama will stand on a stage together, unite the party. And we're not at that point yet but we will get to that point and then go out because we have a fight literally for the soul of this country versus Donald Trump or Ted Cruz.[09:45:08]CARPENTER: Yes. Well, in the meantime, I think you guys should have a debate about it. There's so much...(CROSSTALK)CARPENTER: ... in the Republican side. But really, there's some substance to be drawn out between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders on this issue. And it should just be caught on a hot mic moment. Let's have a full debate. I'd love to watch.(LAUGHTER)TAPPER: Let me ask you a question, Andre. When you watch Bernie Sanders' attacks against Hillary Clinton, and I know you support Donald Trump and you don't like either one of them or you don't care for their politics anyway, do you think Sanders is doing damage against Clinton? Because a lot of Democratic officials out there are saying, OK, Senator Sanders, now you're actually doing Donald Trump's work for him for November.BAUER: Well, absolutely he is. But that's what primaries do. Everybody goes -- comes out of a primary damaged in some way. And Sanders is doing a good job of that right now. TURNER: It's a contrast, though, Jake. I mean, for us, again, Secretary Clinton becomes the center of the universe. Is Senator Sanders doing damage to the secretary? Well, how about the other way around?I mean, you had surrogates come out, Bakari, to try to impugn the record -- the civil rights record of Senator Bernie Sanders. You had surrogates come out to say that he was going to take away CHIP and the Affordable -- TAPPER: The Children's Health care program. TURNER: -- and the Affordable Care Act, all which are wrong knowing his solid progressive credentials on every single one of those issues. So to me, this is not about damage to one or another. This is about contrast.TAPPER: What do you say to that?SELLERS: It's more than that, though. I mean, whether or not -- it's the illusion. It's the proximity, too.I mean, it's challenging her, when you challenge her on Wall Street, you simply -- you make this illusion. You draw this framework that all of a sudden while as secretary of state, she was trying to chip away Dodd-Frank or something. Or she's going to repeal a roll back many of the progresses we made on Wall Street reform and that's just not the case.And I understand the frustration. I mean, that is not a valid line of attack, and that is what we're seeing right now. ""The Boston Globe"" called it best. They said that the tenor has ratcheted it up. And this is coming from Senator Sanders who stated at the beginning of his race that it is above people. That it's about issues. And his campaign is not making it about issues.BAUER: And I would disagree. I think he's showing, look, I'm someone that isn't going to be controlled by Wall Street, and she is.I think there's a clear delineation there of fair shot, and if she can't take that...(CROSSTALK)TAPPER: That's right --(CROSSTALK)BAUER: ... whoever the Republican --(CROSSTALK)SELLERS: I mean, that -- you see that again is absurd because we -- people say that all of a sudden Hillary Clinton needs to get thicker skin. I've heard some reporters say that. But we're talking about the same woman who's been attack for over two decades. And she's still here. From 1992 before there was Obamacare and it was Hillary care, when they went to war, when the Republican Party went to war with Hillary Clinton and she's still here. So I don't think she needs to get thicker skin. I think she's prepared for anything.TAPPER: But don't you think that the attacks coming against her from Bernie Sanders are likely the same ones that you're going to hear from either Donald Trump or Ted Cruz?SELLERS: I think they -- to be honest with you, I think they pale in comparison to whatever we may hear from Donald Trump. I don't think --(CROSSTALK)SELLERS: I agree with that. If anybody knows what Donald Trump is going to say -- TAPPER: I could agree with that -- no, it's a g-rated version. SELLERS: It's a g-rated version.TAPPER: Yes.SELLERS: I do agree with that. And listen, but all I'm saying is we deserve -- the Democratic Party deserves to have a debate about the issues, unlike what the Republican Party is having.I mean, the Republican Party is in the mud. And my father always told me, you know, you don't play in the mud. You don't wallow with the pigs. And that is what's happening. And we want to make sure that we stay above fray. And that's all I'm saying. We can have a debate about issues. Bernie's having a great debate about issues. CARPENTER: But I will say...(CROSSTALK)CARPENTER: ... (INAUDIBLE) someone else comes up, Donald Trump is unpredictable, but Republicans are most certainly going to make the Wall Street critique and will certainly going to go after on speaking fees and will certainly going to go after e-mails. You know, things that Bernie Sanders would not touch. And so if I were advising Hillary Clinton, I'd say figure out a way to handle this now. Get it out there.(CROSSTALK)TURNER: This is a real reality that money is now speech in this country. And so the middle class is gone. Let's just be honest. We have those who are ultra wealthy and those who are poor and those who are barely hanging on. And a lot of that has to do with a corrupt system that rewards money as speech.And what Senator Sanders has been consistent on this, he has been an honest broker on this. He doesn't change based on polls. He doesn't change based on what audience he's talking to. This is his thing. And that's simply all that he is saying. This is contrast. This is not attacks. SELLERS: But it was false. ""The Washington Post""...(CROSSTALK)SELLERS: ... call it had false.(CROSSTALK)TAPPER: I have to say what a great panel. What a great panel. You guys, I love you. TURNER: I love you, too, Bakari.TAPPER: Thank you so much. Very lively and welcome. Campaigning in Wisconsin turning predictably cheesy.

And she described what some Wisconsinites might consider the perfect meal.CLINTON: We had about 15 courses of cheese.[09:55:05]I mean, it was cheese stuffed in things, it was cheese on top of things. It was melted cheese, it was hard cheese. It was unbelievable.TAPPER: But with the cheese comes cheese heads. Those die hard Green Bay Packer fans who can be very sensitive.

He now lives with his wife, April and two children, Sie’anna and Karson in Fitchburg.Mahlon followed in his older brother’s footsteps when he became a fire fighter in Madison twenty years ago. His two brothers are fire fighters in Atlanta and St. Paul. These careers came out of a family that instilled values of service and working for others.This sense of service is also exemplified in Mahlon’s other activities. He was a counselor at the Wisconsin Alliance for Fire Safety’s Burn Camp, which he also directed for five years. This summer camp worked with burn-injured youth to help them cope with their unique situation and build a network of support.Mahlon also worked as a street outreach coordinator with Briarpatch and Youth Services of Southern Wisconsin, where he linked at-risk youth with services from their community.When the fight over collective bargaining and Scott Walker's Act 10 law began in 2011, Mahlon led the fire fighters in a monumental stand of solidarity with other public servants. Despite being exempted from the bill, Mahlon and his fellow fire fighters marched on the Capitol with fellow working families that were threatened by the Budget Repair Bill.Mahlon took the opportunity to travel the state as a fire fighter spreading the word about Scott Walker’s divisive policies. Mahlon ran for Lieutenant Governor as the Democratic nominee in the 2012 recall election.Recently, Mahlon was instrumental to passing two pieces of legislation that were a huge victory for fire fighters across the state. The Infectious Disease Presumption fought to make sure fire fighters are covered if they contract a disease or disability on the job. Additionally, the legislature passed a bill that ensures families and spouses of fire fighters who die in the line of duty will have their health insurance premiums covered.Mahlon Mitchell for Wisconsin,		1

This dangerous problem is destroying communities in my state and across the nation, so I thank you for your attention.Last year, throughout my campaign, and in the months since I was sworn in as Florida’s Governor, I have heard firsthand the heart wrenching stories from family members and friends of those who have lost their livelihoods, and, tragically, their loved ones to prescription drug addiction. And, Chairman Bono Mack I know you have been personally touched by this epidemic.Florida, like much of the nation, has a long history of criminal drug enterprises. The drugs have ruined lives and threatened the safety of our fellow citizens. Across the decades, the names of the drugs have changed, but the problem has remained.Today, one of the most common names when it comes to the diversion of legal pharmaceuticals for illegal use is Oxycodone. If you consider some of the statistics from my state, the scope of our problem is made clear.Consider these facts that come from an analysis of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency’s (DEA) data:• 98 of the top 100 doctors dispensing Oxycodone nationally are in Florida – concentrated in the Miami, Tampa, and Orlando regions. (see Chart #1 attached)• 126 million pills of Oxycodone are dispensed through Florida pharmacies – most of them are in or near the Tampa, Orlando, and Miami regions. (see Chart #2 attached)• By far, more Oxycodone is dispensed in the state of Florida than in the rest of the nation. (see Chart #3)When confronted with these numbers, a serious problem is plain to see. However, the nature of our response to the problem is sometimes less clear.The targets for law enforcement have often been the street dealers and addicts – essentially the bottom level of the distribution chain. In fact, one tool that focuses on end users is a database focused on the patient level. This month in Florida, my Department of Health began implementation of such a database.As the database implementation moves forward, I must draw your attention to a serious risk that I believe databases like this pose to the privacy of individuals – most of whom are law-abiding individuals.As you know, in 2009 the Associated Press reported a massive privacy breach when hackers broke into Virginia’s prescription-drug database. They obtained more than 8.2 million patient records and a total of nearly 36 million prescriptions.So, while the database in Florida is brought online, I continue working with my legislative partners to find solutions that protect patient privacy.More important than computer databases, though, is focusing the resources of my administration on a law enforcement solution that starts at the top of the distribution chain – instead of the bottom.Every day, we see that pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers turn a blind eye when massive amounts of narcotics stream into the same regions of Florida week after week. Meanwhile, unscrupulous doctors work with storefront pill mills masquerading as legitimate health clinics. Each of these levels (see Chart #4) provides an opportunity for law enforcement to intervene and stop the illegal flow of drugs into our communities.Since my first days in office, I was told by law enforcement professionals at the state, county and local level that we needed a coordinated, law enforcement response to this criminal plague. Something that, according to law enforcement, had been lacking in Florida.So, recently, I had the privilege of standing alongside representatives of Florida’s law enforcement community, some of the best professionals in the nation, to initiate an immediate law enforcement response to criminal drug trafficking in Florida.This action, the creation of a Statewide Drug Strike Force, meant that from the highest offices of statewide law enforcement down to the street cops in our cities, we would open the channels of communication and ensure multiagency cooperation. The goal is clear: target the sources of these drugs before they hit the streets.Until recently, the burden of enforcement has primarily fallen on local jurisdictions. However, our local sheriffs and police chiefs simply cannot continue to tackle this mounting issue alone. They need the assistance of a statewide coordinated effort that provides intelligence, analytical, and investigative support.Today in Florida, local law enforcement strike teams are working to identify, investigate, and apprehend those in the medical and pharmaceutical distribution chains who are facilitating the abuse of prescription drugs. Commissioner Gerald Bailey of Florida’s Department of Law Enforcement serves as the statewide coordinator to support the work of local law enforcement, and local strike teams are co-led by Florida’s sheriffs and police chiefs.In addition, I directed all of the state agencies in Florida that are under my purview to identify investigative resources, licensing and registration information, and analytical research that can be used by law enforcement.Specifically, I have directed the Florida Department of Health and the Agency for Health Care Administration to provide regulatory and licensing personnel; the Department of Business and Professional Regulation Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco to provide sworn investigators. Plus, my colleagues on the Florida Cabinet have authorized the Florida Highway Patrol’s participation, and investigators from the Division of Insurance Fraud are supporting this effort. Attorney General Pam Bondi is working with prosecutors across our state to ensure these criminals are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I am grateful to all of these professionals for their commitment to this important work.Not only are these efforts focused on Florida, but we are also coordinating with other states to shutdown a national prescription drug pipeline that some have called the “Oxy Express.”In these first days, I can report that a strike force in Central Florida has already assisted in an out-of-state case last week. Just the other day, I was disappointed to learn that a Deputy Sheriff in South Florida was the first drug trafficking arrest made since the initiation of the Strike Force. At this point it is too early to go into details on these cases, but I can tell you investigations are underway and we expect arrests to continue.I believe these efforts are the crucial and necessary tools to turn off the supply of drugs into and out of Florida. But there is more for Florida to do.With my partners in the Florida Legislature, we are moving legislation to limit how doctors dispense narcotics and making sure doctors divest from pharmacies. The role of doctors who have forsaken their commitment to people’s health in exchange for the quick buck of unethical and criminal dispensing cannot be overstated and absolutely must be put to an end.We will also closely review the activities of wholesalers in Florida, and we will put in place tough penalties for those manufacturers and distributors who fail to help us turn off the illegal supply chain.Let me conclude by telling you I believe we can fight this problem and, with the right strategy, I believe we can win. In my opinion, that strategy is centered on a law enforcement solution that focuses resources at the top of the distribution chain rather than the bottom.I applaud this committee for taking a serious look at the issue and would ask you to also focus your energy at the sources of this problem. Together, if we hold the manufacturers, wholesalers, doctors and pharmacies accountable, we can win this fight.Thank you.		1

Can the G.O.P. plan pass? Some Republicans say their bill is too harsh. I cannot support a piece of legislation that takes insurance away from tens of millions of Americans. Others say it does not go far enough. Maybe we'll have to pass whatever this is. But it's not going to fix the whole problem. While Democrats and the left are unanimously opposed. Thousands of people will die. This morning, I'll talk to Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, and independent progressive Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Plus, the Democrats' loss in Georgia leads to calls for Nancy Pelosi to step down. You've got to beat the Republican and you've got to carry this very toxic Democratic brand on your back. But Pelosi says she's not going anywhere. I think I'm worth the trouble, quite frankly. For Democrats to win the House, do they need a new candidate for speaker? Democrats on both sides of the issue join me this morning. Also, Russian election meddling. In this stunning statement from an Obama-administration official, ""I feel like we sort of choked."" What we now know about what the Obama White House knew and when it knew it. Joining me for insight and analysis are syndicated columnist George Will, Helene Cooper of The New York Times, NBC News chief White House correspondent Hallie Jackson, and Mark Leibovich of The New York Times Magazine. Welcome to Sunday. It's Meet the Press. From NBC News in Washington, the longest-running show in television history, celebrating its 70th year, this is Meet the Press with Chuck Todd. Good Sunday morning. This was a week that brought into focus more clearly than ever the hardening of our political cultures. One left, one right, one blue, one red, one liberal, one conservative. From the special congressional election in Georgia to the debate over health care, to the Russian investigation, and even to the shooting at that Republican baseball practice, Americans watched their favorite cable channels, clicked on their top news site, and spoke and listened primarily to those who already agreed with them. Our NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll bears this out this week. 38 percent gave President Trump a positive rating, 38 percent believe the economy has improved and that the president deserves the credit, 38 percent believe Obamacare is a bad idea, and 38 percent want efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare to continue. Do you notice a pattern? That 38 percent largely packed into Republican districts, maybe just enough to push the Republican healthcare plan and President Trump's priorities over the line. And it's just another data point that illustrates why these days, to many voters, it may be less satisfying to win than to see the other side lose. I'll tell you about the Democrats. I am making it a little bit hard to get their support, but who cares? Americans' distrust in institutions is becoming an old story. But now the most basic institution is crumbling: the trust Americans have in each other. The Democrats are making it divided. Instead of working together, they're fighting. The Republicans are honestly, they're looking out for their interests. The Democrats are so nasty. It bothers me that we're so separated as a nation. The right and the left don't just disagree on solutions, they can't agree on fundamental facts. We elected Trump. We have to take what he says and believe what he says. Just 26 percent of Republicans say they believe Russia interfered in the presidential election, compared with 78 percent of Democrats and 53 percent of Independents. They have phony witch hunts going against me, they have everything going. And you know what? All we do is win, win, win. Washington has been captured by these tribal tendencies, producing a healthcare debate which is less debate and more all-out rhetorical brawl. SEN. These cuts are blood money. People will die. You know what blood money is? Blood money is the money Democrats are raising since their recent attempted massacre of those Republicans at the baseball practice. On Friday, Hillary Clinton tweeted, ""Forget death panels. If Republicans pass this bill, they're the death party."" The hardening polarization of Congress has led to a process where healthcare legislation has been crafted by one party in secret over just 52 days. Even some senate Republicans acknowledge this is no way to govern. I think it's being written by someone somewhere, but I'm not aware of who or where. We used to complain like hell when the Democrats ran the Affordable Care Act. Now they're doing the same thing. A long list of healthcare advocacy groups oppose this bill, which would slash Medicaid spending in part by putting caps on how much federal money states can receive. All of that, despite Candidate Trump's campaign promises. I'm not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid. Every other Republican's going to cut. The Senate bill would also deliver roughly a trillion dollars in tax cuts over ten years. And it would allow states to drop many of the benefits required by Obamacare, like maternity care, emergency services, and mental-health treatment. In the end, Senate Republicans are speaking to a single audience, the 38 percent of voters who make up the president's base. I think they should vote for the healthcare bill and then make changes to it as they can, because Obama's bill is dead. We've identified eight Republican senators whose vote is currently in question as the healthcare vote draws near, four from the moderate end of things, Susan Collins, Dean Heller, Lisa Murkowski, and Cory Gardner; and four conservatives, Rand Paul, Mike Lee, Ron Johnson, and Ted Cruz. And Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin joins me now. He calls himself a ""no"" on the healthcare bill. Sen. Johnson, welcome back to Meet the Press, sir. Good morning, Chuck. Well, what I'm actually saying is I'm not a ""yes"" yet. Fair enough, fair enough. So a little bit different. Let me start first with process before we get to the substance. In fact, you yourself seem to lament how this has gone down. Earlier this week, you were lamenting the partisan aspect of this process. And you said, ""Maybe this is what has to happen. The Democrats had their partisan bill, Republicans are doing ours, and then we'll sit down and start working in a bipartisan fashion and fix our healthcare system."" It seems to me you're admitting or you may be admitting that even if you guys passed this bill, it's going to be done in a partisan basis, and as soon as the Democrats get power, they'll do another bill, and we have more uncertainty in the healthcare market. Aren't we just banging our head against the wall here? You know, Chuck, my background really is manufacturing, I'm also an accountant. So I understand without a good process, you're not going to end up with a good product. And a process in terms of problem solving starts with information. But that's kind of foreign to Washington, D.C. I'm not of that world. You know, Washington, D.C. is an alternative universe, where people just talk about policies, void of facts, void of the types of information you really need to solve a problem. So that's my first point right now is we don't have enough information. I don't have the feedback from constituencies who will not have had enough time to review the Senate bill. We should not be voting on this next week. But we should have started the process, reaching out to the Democrats, pointing out the fact that Obamacare didn't work, it did drive premiums up more than double nationally, some places three times has been the increase in premiums. Let's acknowledge that, let's repair the damage done by Obamacare and transition to something that works. Look, you just described why this process hasn't worked. For instance, we have this debate about these insurance companies. Why are they leaving the market? Here's something that Congress doesn't know. They don't know the answer to that question because you didn't hold a single hearing with a single head of an insurance company in the last couple of months. So how do we know why? We do, but nobody wants to really talk about it. We know why these premiums have increased. I am reminded by, remember President Bill Clinton talking about Obamacare as a crazy system? He started talking about the people that are busting it, sometimes working 60 hours a week, and then they're left with premiums that have doubled and their coverage cut in half. Those are the forgotten men and women in this entire healthcare debate, but we know why those premiums doubled. We've done something with our healthcare system that you never even think about doing, for example, with auto insurance, where you'd require auto insurance companies to sell a policy to somebody after they crashed their car. States that have enacted guaranteed issue, which is the guarantee for preexisting conditions, it crashes their markets. It causes these markets to collapse, it causes premiums to skyrocket. Now the good news, Chuck, is you can actually address people with preexisting conditions without collapsing markets. It's by properly designing high-risk pools. Maine passed guaranteed issue, and what they had to do is they had to institute an invisible high-risk pool. But we don't have the courage in Washington. We don't have the honesty to talk about these things with real information, real facts, go through that problem-solving process, information, agree on achievable goals, then set the strategies, then pass the legislation. Look, isn't some of the problem here the rhetoric that gets used? And look, I'm going to use you as an example here. I want to play the rhetoric you used during your reelection campaign. Here it is. This is our shot. We're not going to be able to repeal Obamacare the next time. This is our shot. Then yes, you bet I'd repeal it in a heartbeat. And then this is what you said in January. No, but this is what you said in January about that rhetoric. It's way more complex than simply repeal and replace. That's a fun little buzzword, but it's just not accurate. The point is, during the campaign you used that fun little buzzword. And your constituents are hearing that buzzword, and then they're looking at this now and saying, ""You've been promising repeal and replace on the campaign trail for seven years as a party."" Now you're being realistic, I think, in the January statement when there isn't an election coming. But isn't this part of the problem in that you used one set of rhetoric during an election year, and then when you need a pragmatic process, the constituents don't buy it? Well, the problem Chuck is on shows like this, you get a couple minutes and you have to condense what you want to do. No, I would repeal all of Obamacare and I would replace it with something that'd actually work. Focus on repairing the damage done. That's those skyrocketing premiums, those are the collapsing markets, that's addressing the forgotten men and women. But, you know, here's some other inflamed rhetoric, you said it yourself. Slashing Medicaid. Now that's Washington speak. My definition of a cut is spending being reduced year over year. We don't have the final figures, but any projections that I've been working with, regardless of the bill, I don't see anything other than a reduction in the growth of spending. So let's be honest about what we're talking about here. We are $20 trillion in debt. Over the next 30 years, according to C.B.O., another $129 trillion of accumulated deficit. We are mortgaging our children's future. A compassionate society doesn't impoverish future generations for benefits in the here and now. All right, let's be realistic here. I think your concerns probably are never going to be fully addressed in this bill. What does it take for you? At some point, you've got to decide whether to do this or not. Is the political pressure of saying, ""Boy, if you don't do this...” and you're one of the Republicans, and you've heard from Pres. Trump, he hopes “his good friends don't tank this bill,"" how much of that political pressure weigh on you even though you look at this bill and you see a lot of flaws? Chuck, the reason I left a life I loved in Oshkosh, Wisconsin here is to fix this problem. And what I find so disappointing is these bills aren't going to fix the problem. They're not addressing the root cause. They're doing the same old Washington thing, throwing more money at the problem. And of course, we have all the inflamed rhetoric. So what I'd like to do is slow the process down, get the information, go through the problem-solving process, actually reduce these premiums that have been artificially driven up because of Obamacare mandates. So let's actually fix the problem. But in the end, I come from manufacturing base. I will look at whatever I'm forced to vote on, and I'll ask myself, ""Is this better tomorrow than where we are today? Is it continuous improvement?"" And that's what will guide my decision. So you don't like this process, but you're not willing to be the vote to delay things to force the process to get better? Well, I would like to delay the thing. There's no way we should be voting on this next week. No way. Are you going to work to stop it? Are you going to work to stop a vote next week? I have a hard time believing Wisconsin constituents or even myself will have enough time to properly evaluate this, for me to vote for a motion to proceed. So I've been encouraging leadership, the White House, anybody I can talk to for quite some time, let's not rush this process. And why haven't they listened to you? --so we can actually argue against the rhetoric. Well, maybe they will. Okay. Well, we're going to find out this week. Sen. Johnson, as you lamented, I'm out of time. I do wish we had more time. But until we meet again, thanks for coming on and sharing your views, sir. Appreciate it. Let's turn over to Senator Bernie Sanders over Vermont. He is not at all conflicted about the Republican healthcare bill. He is holding rallies this weekend in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio, in an attempt to generate opposition to the bill and plainly says, ""If it passes, thousands will die."" Senator Sanders joins me now from Columbus, Ohio. Senator, welcome back sir. Good to be with you, Chuck. I want to first address that rhetoric. You tweeted that issue of saying that yes, you thought people would die. And then Senator Orrin Hatch retweeted, he said here, ""Let us be clear. This is not trying to be overly dramatic. Thousands of people will die if the Republican healthcare bill becomes law."" Orrin Hatch retweeted you and said, ""This brief time when we were not accusing those we disagree with of murder was nice while it lasted."" Any regrets at using the rhetoric you used? Considering what Senator Hatch said? Chuck, what the Republican proposal does is throw 23 million Americans off of health insurance. What Harvard University, what a part of Harvard University, the scientists there determine is when you throw 23 million people off of health insurance, people with cancer, people with heart disease, people with diabetes, thousands of people will die. I wish I didn't have to say it. This is not me. This is study after study making this point. It is common sense. If you have cancer and your insurance is taken away from you, there is a likelihood you will die and certainly a likelihood that you will become much sicker than you are today. That's the fact. Unpleasant, but it's true. Second of all, while they throw 23 million people off of health insurance, while they defund Planned Parenthood, while they raise premiums for older workers, people who are in their 60s, they see premiums that'll be 50 percent, 75 percent higher, they are going to provide some $500 billion in tax breaks to the top 2 percent, to the insurance companies, and to the drug companies. Is what America supposed to be about, taking away health insurance from kids with disabilities, from people with cancer, in order to give tax breaks to billionaires? That is what this entire debate is about. And one of the things that bothers me very much, Chuck, 60 percent of the American people, according to a recent poll, don't even know what is in this healthcare, so-called healthcare legislation. Well, I want to talk about that process, because I think the process here, look, I think Senator Johnson brought up a good point earlier this week, that I asked him about, which you may have heard. Which is this idea that Obamacare passed with a partisan, just with the Democrats, this, if it passes, is only going to pass just with the Republicans. And we know no law ever is sustainable in this town when only one party has a piece of it, when only one party is invested in its success. So I guess my question is, this process has been a mess. Is there any way of fixing this process in next week, stopping it, starting from scratch. If the Republicans say, ""We'll get rid of reconciliation of Democrats come to the table, would you come to the table?"" Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait. Please, don't say ""come to the table."" What the Republicans have done, and that's what Senator Johnson just said, and he's right, we are talking about one-sixth of the American economy when we talk about health care. We're talking about an issue that impacts 320 million Americans. Every single person. There has not been one public hearing. The insurance company has not come forward. The American Medical Association has not come forward. There has been zero debate. All of this has been done behind closed doors. So please don't say, ""Oh, the Democrats would come to the table."" The Democrats were not invited. No, I wasn't implying it that way. Senator, I understand that. I hear you on that. I'm saying, if there is, if Senator Johnson gets his way, which is he wants to delay this process, delay the vote, and actually have a process, actually have some hearings, it sounds as if he wants that. If Mitch McConnell says, ""You know what, I'm giving up reconciliation because trying to do this on a partisan-only vote is damaging overall,"" at that point, are you open to some sort of bipartisan compromise? Of course. Well, we're open to it. Let's have the discussion. That's what should happen. Senator Johnson is right. There is no way on God's earth that this bill should be passed this week. People of Wisconsin don't know what's in it, people of Vermont don't know what's in it. We need a serious discussion and I'm quite confident that every member of the Democratic caucus would want to hold that discussion. But let me also say something else when we talk about where we are with health care. Please do not forget that the United States of America today remains the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all people as a right. And my view is, that the Affordable Care Act has problems, deductibles are too high, copayments are too high. We have to address that. But I also want to say that there's something wrong when we remain the only country not to guarantee health care to all people as a right. I am going to go forward with a Medicare for all, single-payer program. And I think that's the direction long term that we should be going. Let me ask you a little bit about where the Democratic Party is overall. Because you said you want to go there, and that is not necessarily a unified position inside the left umbrella in this country. I say left, because you're not technically a member of the Democratic party. But why do you think Democrats lost that special election in Georgia last week? Well, it's more than the special election. For the last nine years, Democrats have lost the White House, we've lost now the Senate, we've lost the U.S. House, two-thirds of governor's chairs are controlled by Republicans, a thousand seats have been lost to Republicans in state legislatures all over this country. I'll tell you what I think is going on. I think there is a massive amount of demoralization on the part of the American people with the Democratic party, with the Republican party. I think the American people, in many cases, are seeing themselves working longer hours for lower wages, they're worried about their kids not being able to go to college, they're worried about what's going to happen to them when they are retiring. They're seeing almost all new income and wealth going to the top 1 percent. There is an enormous amount of pain in this country, Chuck. And people are saying, ""Does anybody in Washington know what's going on in my life? That I'm 60 years of age and I have nothing in the bank and I'll be retiring in five years? Or that I have $50,000 in college debt and I can't find a decent job? Does anybody know that? Do Republicans know it? Do the Democrats know it?"" And I think what the Democrats have got to say is that we will be on the side of the working class of this country. We are prepared to stand up to Wall Street and the drug companies who rip us off every day, and the insurance companies. And that we're going to fight for an agenda that makes sense to working families. All right. I'm going to leave it there because we're going to continue that debate after the break. Senator Sanders, thanks for coming on and sharing your views. Appreciate it as always. When we come back, the brewing civil war inside the Democratic party, how that loss in Tuesday's special election in Georgia is leading to a debate over whether it's time for Nancy Pelosi to step aside. Welcome back. Panel is with us. Syndicated columnist George Will, Helene Cooper, Pentagon correspondent for The New York Times, NBC News chief White House correspondent Hallie Jackson, and Mark Leibovich, the chief national correspondent for The New York Times Magazine. Welcome all. George Will, let me start with you. I want to get to the process part of this. Ron Johnson I think correctly stated, ""Democrats did their partisan bill, Republicans did their partisan bill, maybe this is what it takes before the two parties come to solve this together."" So it's an admittance that whatever gets passed is temporary. Yes, but the process argument, while real, is an excuse it seems to me. I don't think the problem is that this violates the president's campaign promise not to cut Medicare. You can argue as Senator Johnson did that it's just a slowing of the expansion. The problem isn't that this violates the Mnuchin rule, which no one seems to remember. The Treasury secretary said there'd be no large tax cut for the wealthy. This is a large tax cut for the wealthy. The problem isn't whether you scale back Medicare expansion in seven years or three years. Those are splittable differences. There are two problems here. One is that we don't take things back from people once we've given them. Once we did. Aid to families with dependent children was repealed part of the sacrosanct 1935 Civil Rights act, under 1996 welfare reform. But that took something away from poor people who are not organized, articulate and well lawyered. This takes something away from people who've got it and they value it because they've got it now. Second, after eight years of debating this, we're up against the fact that expansion of Medicaid is exactly what this is about. Fifty-five million people are on Medicare, 68 million are on Medicaid, and we're still arguing about whether or not we should have government control of health care. It's there. Now it's about reforming it. No, Helene, it is sort of, the irony here is that there is rhetoric that indicates, ""Oh, we can't. We've got to get back into the private market."" It's not private. No, no. And it hasn't been for a while. I was very—It was really funny because this morning, I snapped awake at 2:45 in the morning and looked at Facebook because I was worried about my alarm not going off at 6:30 to wake me up to get here. And the first thing that popped up on my page was an ad for Senator Dean Heller telling people, it's on Facebook already, to hurry up and make calls to him to make sure that he votes for the Republican plan. This is Senator Dean Heller of Nevada who was the one who did look like he was in a hostage video earlier on Friday when he said he wasn't going to support the bill as it stands right now. And I'm just so fascinated by just how these lines are being drawn right now. And it’s not over—it doesn't seem at this point to be—a lot of this is about process. Let's put them back up. We've got the moderates there, she brought up Dean Heller, it's Heller, it's Collins, it's Murkowski, it's Cory Gardner, interestingly enough. Well, and that's one that Democrats-- it's the Democratic operatives who say Gardner is actually somebody to watch. They've learned the hard lesson that health care is not just something that becomes an issue in the most immediate next election, but it's one that could become an issue down the road, maybe in 2020. And I remember Senator Gardner as somebody who's running the campaigns here in 2018. So he's someone to watch. The president is reaching out a little bit. I know he had some phone calls Friday with at least one of the folks who's on that list, trying to get people on board. But the White House feels like they have some time now. I had somebody say to me, ""Well, the vote is not going to happen until Thursday, so we have a little time to do that outreach."" There are fewer people we need to do that outreach to. But at the same time, this thing is going to go by quick. Well, it's interesting, I do think if McConnell successfully makes the political—it's because he made the political argument, not a policy argument, right? He made the argument the base will reject you. I think they can—I think they’re right about Cory Gardner. They can bluff their way through 2018 on this. I don't know if they can bluff their way to 2020 on this. Possibly. I mean, I think the more this debate is about Medicaid, the more that potentially cuts into the Trump base. You could take—you can look at video all day of Trump saying over and over again during the campaign, ""We're not going to touch Medicaid, we're not going to touch Medicare."" Sean Spicer, as recently as a few days ago said, ""This bill does not really have any effect on Medicaid or Medicare."" By the way, Republicans won control of Congress largely on accusing Democrats of cutting Medicare, when they were cutting Medicare advantage. So by the way, both parties know how to exploit that issue. Correct. Oh, absolutely. But I mean Republicans are in a ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" situation in some way, one because as George said, this is already the law of the land. But also, if they mess, or if they repeal this bill, it is going to affect a lot of people. And a lot of these people are in the Trump base. If they don't do anything, the base could possibly rebel. And that's the thing. It feels like they're picking between their base and their constituent, Shelley Moore Capito to me, it's like Medicaid expansion on one hand, George, and on the other hand, she would lose a Republican primary over this. Oh, repeal and replace Obamacare is extremely popular, 80 to 15. Except a lot of people don't understand what that means. Of course. And it's a sort of wash in the rest of the country, which means I think at the end of the day, people are going to wake up and see that no matter what we pass, it's not repeal and replace, it's tweak and move onto something we'd like to do, which is infrastructure and tax reform. Well, the president going to get this? You know, he seems optimistic. He did an interview that's new out today talking about wanting to have everybody come together. And he doesn't understand why the Democrats and Republicans can't sort of hug and make up on this one. He wants it, but at the same time, he's a lot more hands-off than what we saw in the House portion. Remember when he was doing a lot of one-on-one outreach, he was having a ton of Congress members over to his house, he had that big celebration at the Rose Garden. We are not seeing that this time around. And part of that is intentional. But that didn't come right away. That came after he had lost the first time. Right, that's true. So maybe that's what it takes for him again. I do think though the operative word, especially on the Hill is move on. I mean, there is a sense, especially around leadership, that if they can lose, it would be good to lose quickly. Lose quick. Yeah. Lose, lose fast. All right, we'll pause it here. When we come back, in order for Democrats to win the House, do they need a new candidate for speaker of the House? I talked to two Democrats, one who says it's time for Nancy Pelosi to go, and another who's not ready to say that just yet. Welcome back. Democrat Jon Ossoff may not have been the only loser in Tuesday's special congressional election in Georgia. Groups aligned with President Trump, Speaker Paul Ryan, and former Speaker Newt Gingrich spent a combined $4.5 million in that race simply to tie Ossoff to House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. The ads made sure that Pelosi's supposed San Francisco liberalism and Jon Ossoff were indistinguishable, as you can see in these ads. And apparently, it worked. That's led some Democrats to call for Pelosi to step down, including Congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio who actually challenged Pelosi last November for the position of House Democratic leader. He joins me now along with Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, who along with her husband and his father have made sure that Michigan has been represented by a Dingell, by the way, since 1933. Welcome to both of you. Congressman Ryan, you have not been shy at all this week about what happened post-election there. Let me be blunt. If Nancy Pelosi wasn't leader, if you were leader, do you think John Ossoff would be a member of Congress today? Well, let me first say, Chuck, I don't want to be leader. This is not about me. I don't want to run against Nancy Pelosi. I did that in November, I spoke my peace, I got everything out I needed to say. But I think it would be hard for us to say that after $5 million being spent tying that candidate to her, that it didn't have some effect. The Republicans wouldn't still be using this if it didn't have some effect. And so it's still being used for a reason. And I think that's a discussion that we need to have. Now, with the health care coming down the pike now and everything that's going on, we do need to stay united as Democrats, especially this week, because of the travesty that would happen to a lot of our constituents. But we do need to have a family discussion. I don't necessarily need to lead it, because I've been pretty clear. But if others want to have that discussion, I'm happy to have it. Debbie Dingell, you've seen a lot of this over the years. You've seen these party fights from the outside, from the inside. I'm curious of your reaction to what your colleague Kathleen Rice said earlier this week. Let me play it. Nancy Pelosi was a great speaker, she is a great leader. But her time has come and gone. Yes, she's a great fundraiser, but if the money that we are raising through her leadership is not helping us win elections, then we have to have this difficult conversation now. No. I'm going to tell you point blank, and I'll respectfully disagree with her, because I love Kathleen. We were in the same class. I never thought we were going to win any of these four seats. I have been around. I am seasoned. These people were selected to go in the cabinet because they were in safe, Republican seats. Two or three months ago, I would never have bet we came as come as we did in those. The Cook Report's done a very independent analysis of this and it says we've outperformed in all four of these seats by 8 percent. And if we were to continue in those numbers, the Republicans should be worried we could win 80 seats next November. Now that's not going to happen, we all know that, because we're running against incumbents. But if you'd get pragmatic, we always attack the leader. I don't care who it is. As I say to people, I remember when we were attacking Tip O'Neill. I was very young, but I remember it. We love to attack our leaders, either party. Well, let me ask you this though, and first, Congresswoman Dingell, I want to start with you. Because I think I know what Tim Ryan's answer’s going to be. How do you make the case in 2018 to be the change party and create a change election atmosphere if when every Democrat that's running for a House seat gets asked, ""Well, who are you going to support for speaker? Are you going to support Nancy Pelosi?"" And if she's speaker in 2019, are you sending a message of change to the voter who thinks, ""Oh, I thought we voted that out?"" So I have a lot of things to say about, first of all, I think that if each of us doesn't start taking some responsibility for the leadership we have and start acting like a ""we,"" we're not going to win. And that's one of our biggest problems. As you know, I care deeply about the issues for the coast, I care deeply about urban issues, but I also care about issues in the Midwest. And Tim and I really share that passion of fighting for the working men and women. So we've got to stop this finger pointing, and each of us has got to learn how we're going to become part of the ""we"" and the community that's going to win. And when people start talking about age and everything, let's talk about that. We elected a 70-year-old as president, Bernie Sanders is 75, Joe Biden's 74. The representative government is people of all generations, all ages. And we've got to come together and each of us has got to take responsibility for what we are as part of that ""we."" Tim Ryan, has some of this criticism of Nancy Pelosi been too harsh and too unfair? Well, what's been unfair is that it's not necessarily her fault. They spent, I would say, hundreds of millions of dollars against her. And as I said during the campaign, I've got enormous respect for Nancy Pelosi, I love Nancy Pelosi, she's helped me throughout my career and she was a tremendous speaker. We're talking about health care for everybody today because of the work that she has done. So this is completely unfair. But the reality is the reality is that the fact that we have to go into 2018 with a leader who has been damaged. And the caucus, at the end of the day, has to make this decision. But let's make no mistake about it. This is not about us having a family fight publicly. We're going to have this discussion. But the reality of it is, and why I get so worked up about things like this, is because if we're not in power, Chuck, we can't help anybody. This isn't just a fight to have a fight. If Democrats aren't in, we talk about the Republicans taking 25 million people's health care away from them. But if the Democrats are in, we can talk about how we're going to help them with their wages, their jobs, their economic security, their pensions, reducing their healthcare bill and their energy bills, and putting money in their pocket. This is not just a fight that we just want to have. We've got to have these discussions because we owe it to our constituents. We owe it to the American people to put us in a position to be able to fight for them. Right now, we don't control any of the levers of government as Senator Sanders said earlier. So we've got to win these elections and put ourselves in a good position to do it. I want to close, and it's a question I'm going to give you both a shot at answering here. Because it stumped me. I do a Facebook Q&A every Friday afternoon. And a man by the name of Chuck Kitterman asked the following question: what is the Democratic Party's constituency at this time? What is their mission statement? Will Dems be able to parlay a multitude of special interest causes into a winning demographic for the 2018 midterms? I have to say, and Debbie Dingell, I'll start with you, the Democratic Party does feel as if it's a coalition of various special interest groups, not sort of one voice. Is that a fair critique? I know who I'm working for. I'm working for the working men and women of my district. And that's what we all have to remember. That we're elected to represent the districts that we come from. And that's why coming together as the ""we"" matters. I don't like this word special interests. Since when are working men and women special interest? We need to make sure that every American has all those issues that Tim just cared about. Every American's got a right to affordable, quality health care. To be able to get a good education. To live in a safe neighborhood. To make sure that they're going to have a safe retirement. That's what Bernie Sanders did a very good of articulating that earlier. That's who we are as Democrats and we've got to come together as ""we."" It's not one person's responsibility, it's all of our responsibilities. Tim Ryan, I've heard you on this. I think you believe the identity politics has been a bit of a detriment to the Democratic Party. Well, if you're a marginalized citizen in any way, shape, or form, the Democratic Party is the party for you. And that means economically marginalized as well. And I don't care about color, man, woman, black, white, brown, gay, straight, we should be working for all of those groups and their economic interests. The one thing that the Democrats have and we need to get back to and focus on is that economic message. And Sen. Sanders is very articulate and very clear about what we all need to stand for. Yes, we've got to go to the mat on these issues, there'll be quality and tolerance and we've got to fight for people who are marginalized in that regard. But what unites all of those groups, Chuck, is an economic message. Every one of those people in those groups want to make more in the paycheck they get every two weeks. They want to pay less for their energy bill and less for health care and still have coverage. Those are pocketbook issues that unite everybody. But when we get off on just the social issues, again, those are important, we need to fight for them, but if we just talk about those and we don't talk about the economic issues, we do get frayed, the Republicans come in and divide us, and then we get what we got in the last presidential election. We got lower African-American turnout in some communities, we had white voters go and vote for Trump, and we had a diminished electorate. So focus on economics, put money back in the pocket of people, grow this new economy, and Democrats will get back into the majority. Tim Ryan, Debbie Dingell, I thank you both for coming on and sharing your views. Appreciate it. Great to be with you. Up next, why Amazon's growing influence may cost millions of Americans their jobs and why it also may lead to the next jobs crisis that will face politicians on the ballot. Welcome back. Data download time. When Amazon bought Whole Foods and announced its new Prime Wardrobe service recently, it didn't just confirm the brick-and-mortar retail crisis in America, it signaled yet another gigantic disruption in our economy and where people are going to work. But, early warning, this is not just an economic issue. It's the next big political problem, the canary at the cash register, if you will, that could change the way we eventually vote. The number of people working in retail has dropped, even as the economy has been recovering. In the two years between 2014 and 2016, the unemployment rate fell from 6.2 percent to 4.9 percent. Despite this, the number of people working in retail sales declined during that same period of time. Let me emphasize, more people employed overall, fewer people working in retail jobs. Politicians spend a lot of time talking about disappearing manufacturing and coal jobs. But the great retail displacement has been largely ignored. And retail actually employs millions more than the coal industry, 4.5 million compared to 76,000. Anybody see a press conference about the loss of retail jobs recently? Plus, people from all races and backgrounds work in retail. In fact, retail employees look a lot like the country as a whole. And, they come from all over the country. Retail isn't regional like coal, industry's Appalachia or manufacturing's Rust Belt. All of this suggests the loss of retail jobs is on the verge of hitting a crisis point, which will make it a hot-button issue in our politics. The top ten states for retail are all in the biggest states in the country. They hold 2.4 million retail jobs and 256 electoral votes. If enough of those jobs disappear, expect a great retail displacement to become a growing major issue in 2018 and 2020. It's yet another massive economic transformation we're about to see. The biggest issue in the next 25 years will be work, the future of it. The population is growing and the jobs are disappearing. When we come back, why did a former Obama administration official say the following: ""I feel like we sort of choked""? Welcome back. Panel is back. Let's talk about the Democrats here. On one hand, you look at our generic ballot and from our NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. Democrats have an eight-point lead among those who say, ""Who do you want to have control Congress?"" 50 percent picked the Democrats, 42, so you would think, ""Oh, that's good for the Democrats."" But let me show you the 2016 popular vote House race total and how it translated into House seats. And as you can see, Republicans won the popular vote by a point, but that one point allowed them a ten-point spread among House seats. The point is, if you do your math, Mr. Leibovich, and I know math isn't your favorite subject, but if you do your math there, it means an eight-point Democratic lead still wouldn't be enough to win control of the House for the Democrats. They've got some work to do. Correct. And I think the math actually obviously doesn't work in presidential equations either, as the Democrats found out here. No, they do. And I think it might be a little bit misguided to talk about the message that Democrats might lack here, because as Debbie Dingell pointed out, these are very specific and pointed messages that every congressional district has to do. I do think that one, perhaps benefit of health care, if Republicans pass it is it actually would give Democrats a message. It would give Democrats something to run on in addition to Trump. And right now, there is absolutely no-- the economic populism that Congressman Ryan was talking about is as close as he was going these days to that. And I think that one of the most important words that Debbie Dingell said herself was, ""We don't want a leadership fight now."" And when you talk to people, that's what you hear. I talked to one high-level Democrat who said, ""Listen, this is not the time to get into Nancy Pelosi's leadership. We've got to fight for health care, we've got 2018 coming up."" That said, what happens after that, I think that there is an acknowledgement that this is something that needs to be discussed. You look at, for example, who will replace Nancy Pelosi. Not even Tim Ryan. As somebody phrased it to me last night, it's an airing of the grievances. There is no succession plan. This is just getting out, venting, blowing off some steam. Even Republicans will acknowledge, and I spoke with one operative who said, ""She's a great fundraiser, she brings in good money for the party."" But they love having her in place. And that's what Democrats have to figure out now over the next, if not six months, then at least year and six month. Can I just interject here though? Because it feels as if the commentary after this Georgia election acts as if this was a blue district that flipped to red. It's not. This was a red district that the Democrats came very close to winning. And so I do think that there's a little bit of hysteria here when we start thinking about yet another loss on the Democratic side and Nancy Pelosi must go. God, I love that line about, ""I think I'm more fit."" I'm going to start using that all the time. Worth the trouble. Oh God, yeah. Right? Yeah, the ""trouble"" part is the part. It's even better, right? Well, this ethical election to pick 1/435th of one-half of one of our three branches of government matters only if they misconstrue what happened down there. Progressives are saying, ""He ran in the primary and won,"" as often by saying, ""Vote for me and make Trump furious,"" then he won and he became militantly vanilla, campaigning against government waste and then going to have a high-tech north Georgia and all that. If they say that if we only go hard left we will bring people out, if they say, ""We're really more interested and realigning the party for the long term than winning elections in the short term,"" then what happened in Georgia will really matter. No, I think if there is one sure thing coming out of these special elections is that people will overinflate their significance. It's true. I guess if you look at it though, who's got more to worry about? Republicans or Democrats, after what they've watched there? Is it the Democrats and their message problem, or is it the Republicans that they're not going to get $30 million every time they can save a House seat. Correct. And they acknowledge that. I think it depends who you talk to. To Helene's point, these are all seats in the special elections. Democrats point out, yes, we did overperform the numbers, as you heard Debbie Dingell said, the expectation. And these are seats that Republicans chose to vacate, that they pulled people out of, opening up those seats. And so that is sort of the line you hear from Democrats. From Republicans, there is an acknowledgement that neither side is going to raise the kind of money that they raised in the special. And if I have to tell you how many times I've heard the phrase, ""Special elections are special for a reason this week,"" I'd have a lot of nickels. Waste happens when one side is demoralized and the other side is enthused. We don't have that just yet. We'll be back in 45 seconds with endgame. And the face that booked himself in Iowa this week that has the social media world buzzing. Meet the Press Endgame is brought to you by Boeing: Always working to build something better. Back now with Endgame. Whiplash this week from President Trump on the Russia story. Now is admitting the meddling, and he tweeted this yesterday, ""Since the Obama administration was told way before the 2016 election that the Russians were meddling, why no action? Focus on them, not T!"" Helene Cooper, setting that aside, that expose in The Washington Post, and that quote, ""I think we choked."" That's huge, I mean that's huge. But I think you look at it, on one hand, you can sort of understand the position that the Obama administration, President Obama would have been in, it would have been seen as so cravenly political if he had come out at that point and said, ""Look, it looks as if the Russians are interfering to help then Republican candidate Trump."" But at the same time, that's why we have leaders, you know? At some point, the American people deserve to have somebody in office who's only in office for, what, three more months, come out and say without political consideration. And I just think the fact that they're saying now that they choked is kind of sad. George Will, that August 6th briefing before 9/11 was always known as the red flag that was missed. Are we going to look back, that quote of choked, is this a version of that for President Obama? No. And I think it's supremely unfair. I think Obama faced an agonizing choice. A Democratic president comes out on the eve of the election and says, ""A foreign power is trying to elect a Republican."" Mr. Trump says, ""Where was the action?"" If the action had been taken, he wouldn't be president. It is true. It is the ultimate ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" situation again. I think it would have been, the political environment, for as charged as it is right now, think of what it was in October and November. The other thing is, people expected, and I think Obama expected the president to be Hillary Clinton. And I think that he sort of figured, ""Okay, we can just let this pass and it will come out afterwards."" This gives President Trump a branch or something solid to hold onto. And you have seen that over the last 48, 72 hours. But I do think the broader underlying question here, why no action, what action is happening now to stop it from happening again, right? That is something that matters. We just did an investigation contacting every state, dozens of state officials responded and said they just haven't heard enough from the Trump administration. The White House says, ""We've got this election fraud commission,"" which was started because of the president's unfounded claim that millions of people voted illegally, and they point to some things that D.H.S. is doing, but the alarm bell is ringing. We had somebody show in Iowa this week. You know, hey, when somebody shows up in Iowa, you think, ""Maybe they're running for president."" Mark Zuckerberg showed up in Iowa and he posts this, ""In Iowa, I stop by one of the major truck stops. It's like a small city where truckers on long trips can take a break, get something to eat, get a haircut, do laundry, get their truck washed -- or their dog washed! -- and even go to the dentist. ...I asked a number of truckers what they think about self-driving cars and trucks, what they think about the future. Everyone I met was skeptical self-driving cars would replace jobs for different reasons..."" Mark Leibovich, you enjoy your share of snark. How does he run for president doing the, ""Wow, look at this, a truck stop."" Yeah, I would say that that was kind of like a parody of how a bubble person writes about that stuff when he ventures off from the West Coast to the East Coast and sort of discovers truck stops. Um, yeah, I think the messaging might need a little work, if he's in fact running for president. But it's certainly interesting. And I do think that Trump has created a generation of, I would say, maybe some pale imitators who think that anyone with name recognition and a lot of money can run. But we'll see. David Plouffe, I'm going to say it, David Plouffe, is working, the president's former campaign manager, is working for the Zuckerberg foundation. That's all for today. Thank you for watching.

Like RhodeMap RI, why do we continue to allow unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats to arbitrarily make such important public policy decisions,” asked Mike Stenhouse, CEO for the Center. “Where are the voices of the Governor and our General Assembly, whose authority is being infringed upon by out-of-control bureaucratic ideologues? We call on the Governor to immediately halt this mandate in order to give lawmakers time to consider overturning this unprecedented edict.”“Not only are the FDA approved vaccines for HPV relatively new and not vetted to the satisfaction of many in the medical community, they have been cited as the cause of many injuries, health complications and even death in some cases. Parents and the public have every right to be concerned about their children’s health,” said Gary D. Alexander, former Secretary of Health and Human Services for Rhode Island and adjunct scholar for health issues to the Center. “The state has not provided a proper public forum to discuss these concerns with parents. The implementation of this mandate must be delayed until a full public process has been conducted and all fears allayed.”Also, a group of Rhode Island physicians that have been in contact with the Center do not believe an epidemic exists, especial one that should warrant such a drastic mandate; they further question whether the Gardasil vaccine is even effective. The doctors further claim that the potential side-effects of the vaccination include paralysis and death. The group cites that traditional pap smear tests are highly effective in diagnosing the human papillomavirus. The physicians also argue that the disease is not a public health issue in America, but rather a personal health issue, where parents – not the state government – should be making such important decisions about whether or not to have the vaccines administered to their children.In 2011, then Texas governor and presidential candidate, Rick Perry, came under intense national criticism for issuing a similar executive order. Perry would later call his executive order a mistake, after the Texas legislature decided to overturn it.The Center strongly recommends that any parent uncomfortable with this vaccine for their children should claim a ‘religious medical exemption’, which can be executed via a simple form that can be downloaded from the health.ri.gov website .Media Contact:401.429.6115 | info@rifreedom.orgAbout the CenterThe nonpartisan RI Center for Freedom & Prosperity is Rhode Island’s premiere free-enterprise think tank.

Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn is expected to end his tenure as DIA director this summer, about a year before he was scheduled to depart, according to officials who said Flynn faced pressure from Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. and others in recent months. His deputy, David Shedd, had been in his job since 2010. The moves come at a time when the DIA is in the midst of major changes, including an effort by senior Pentagon officials to expand the agency’s network of spies overseas, improve collection on unfolding crises such as the one in Ukraine, and work more closely with the CIA. Kirby did not indicate when Flynn and Shedd would step down. Lt. Gen. Mary A. Legere, the Army’s top intelligence officer, is considered a leading candidate to replace Flynn, and she would be the first female DIA director if nominated and confirmed. Flynn, who served as a top intelligence adviser to Gen. Stanley McChrystal in Iraq and Afghanistan, arrived at the DIA in July 2012 vowing to accelerate the agency’s overhaul. He drafted a blueprint that called for sending more employees overseas, being more responsive to regional U.S. military commanders, and turning analysts’ attention from the war zones of Iraq and Afghanistan to a broader array of emerging national security threats. “I think that Flynn’s efforts to move the organization into a role supporting combatant commanders was spot on and it is where DIA should be heading,” said Fred Kagan, a military historian and unpaid adviser to the DIA. Critics said that his management style could be chaotic and that the scope of his plans met resistance from both superiors and subordinates. At the same time, his tenure was marked by significant turbulence, including the fallout from the classified intelligence files leaked by former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, as well as other emerging crises. “His vision in DIA was seen as disruptive,” said a former Pentagon official who worked closely with Flynn. At the DIA, Flynn sought to push DIA analysts and operators “up and out of their cubicles into the field to support war fighters or high-intensity operations,” the former official said. Flynn clashed with other high-ranking officials, including Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Michael G. Vickers. Officials said Flynn had opposed Vickers’ efforts to make significant cuts to large intelligence centers established to support the U.S. military’s regional overseas commands. A former CIA operative, Vickers has sought to model the DIA’s training and overseas presence more closely on its civilian counterpart, according to current and former U.S. officials. The plan has encountered significant opposition on Capitol Hill, particularly from members of the Senate Armed Services Committee who have voiced concern over the cost of creating the Defense Clandestine Service, and questioned whether Pentagon spies would end up being used to fill intelligence gaps that are supposed to be handled by the CIA. Flynn’s departure, which has been rumored for weeks, was set in motion earlier this year when Clapper informed him that the administration had concluded that a leadership change was necessary, officials said. Others described it as a mutual agreement that Flynn would step down. Flynn was a key player in U.S. military efforts to dismantle insurgent networks in Iraq and Afghanistan, an approach that relied heavily on combining U.S. Special Operations forces with intelligence operatives and analysts. With McChrystal, Flynn helped to compress a cycle of carrying out raids and then exploiting the intelligence from those operations to find other targets. In 2010, Flynn rankled many of his counterparts in the intelligence community when he published an article that was sharply critical of the information that spy agencies were assembling in Afghanistan. The effort was so focused on tracking insurgents that U.S. military and diplomatic leaders got little to help them understand the political, economic and cultural issues driving the insurgency.		0

['Energy']	http://americansforprosperity.org/	http://americansforprosperity.org/florida/article/americans-for-prosperity-proposed-solar-policies-are-not-free-market/	2015/03/24	Americans for Prosperity: Proposed Solar Policies are Not Free MarketMar 11, 2015 by AFPGroup begins education effort to inform Floridians about rate hikesTALLAHASSEE – Americans for Prosperity (AFP) today held a press conference in Tallahassee with a coalition of free market organizations to refute claims that proposed solar policies are free market policy. AFP explains that the proposed policies result in government favoring solar energy industries over other energy providers, and will result in electricity rate hikes. AFP – Florida state director Chris Hudson explained:“Some people think that certain proposed policies floating around Tallahassee are free market policies, when they are anything but. Requiring traditional utility companies to give their grid space to solar energy will impose a massive cost on these providers, which will be passed onto Florida consumers in the form of higher rates. Changing our constitution such that “it shall be the policy of the state to encourage and promote” equals subsidies and mandates by another name – not a free market policy. Installing solar panels and using solar power in one’s home or business is already legal. If promoters of solar really want to encourage a free market, they should focus on deregulating the utility market as a whole, not demanding that existing companies share limited grid space with an inconsistent power source.”AFP pointed out that in Louisiana, similar net metering policies have resulted in rate hikes and did not result in solar becoming any more economically viable. While AFP does not oppose solar technology, it points out that solar power is not dependable and grids that try to incorporate solar power end up requiring additional traditional energy facilities in order to meet demand when solar panels do not produce sufficient wattage.		1

Mark Pocan, D-Wis., talked about President Donald Trump first month and a half in office. Trump gave his first address to Congress this week. Pocan brought college student Lupe Salmeron, a DACA recipient, to the address in which Trump vowed once again to ramp up border security and deportation for undocumented immigrants.Episode TranscriptDonald Trump:We want all Americans to succeed but that can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos. We must restore integrity and the rule of law at our borders.[applause]Frederica Freyberg:President Trump talking lawless chaos. We check in now with the opposite side of the aisle with Democratic U.S. Representative Mark Pocan. He brought a college student to the address. Lupe Salmeron immigrated to Wisconsin from Mexico 12 years ago and is undocumented but received deportation exception under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Congressman Pocan joins us now. Thanks very much for being here.Mark Pocan:Absolutely. Glad to be here.Frederica Freyberg:Why did you bring Lupe to the address?Mark Pocan:There's a lot of different angles you could go to try to raise awareness but this is one issue where literally we're tearing families apart who've been here for decades. In Lupe's case, she's been here for a dozen years. When we go and do what is starting the happen with the ICE raids and deportations and building the wall, we're starting to put a fake narrative out there about people who are hard working in this country, want to be citizens and we had a bipartisan bill a couple of sessions ago to do just that and now we're going in a completely different direction based on fear in order to kind of prove why he got elected. I think that's not clear enough. You can't destroy families just because it somehow addresses your political narrative.Frederica Freyberg:Switching directions. What is your reaction to Attorney General Sessions' recusal?Mark Pocan:I’m glad that at minimum we're getting the recusal. But honestly if you lie to the American people under oath you can be prosecuted if you're an individual. At minimum he should be resigning. This is something where you can't act like I didn't remember this conversation. Oh yeah, I did have this conversation. He lied directly in testimony under sworn testimony to Al Franken as he asked questions, a senator from Minnesota. And more importantly I think is just this issue. This is an issue that's not going away. There's so much more coming out how the Russians interfered with our elections. I've read the classified report. I've asked on the floor of Congress -- if they are so sure there's nothing here, then declassify that report because I know what I read. And supposedly that's what the president's read. There is more information there and it's not the hacking at the DNC. I could care less. People wrote dumb things in email and that got out, that's not what changes elections. There's more things that have happened and I think it's very disingenuous to the point of questionable why they would say things like they're talking about lifting sanctions and other things and now we're finding all these people had all these meetings from the Trump Administration and the campaign with Russian officials. There's more than smoke. There is a big forest fire here and we need to let the American people know about it.Frederica Freyberg:President Trump calls this a political witch hunt.Mark Pocan:I would call it a political witch hunt if I was in the middle of something like this as well. He's trying to find subterfuge wherever he can to try to confuse the issue. The bottom line is 17 different intelligence agencies came out with a unified report that said the Russians interfered with our elections. I've read that report. There's far more even than has come out so far. Then all this other information now is coming out that's not in some of the various intelligence reports about his campaign officials and his administrative officials having all these connections with Russia and whether it be about the interference in the election or the issue of sanctions or the issue of the fact we haven't seen his tax returns we don't know how much business involvement he has in Russia. The American people just need to know the very basics about this before we can even move on to things like the Affordable Care Act and tax reform and other issues. This is something that goes way deeper than Democrat, Republican politics. This is something that's --inside the beltway is one way. I'm from Wisconsin. I'm not from inside the beltway. Here if you lie, you lie. It's not how -- what version of lying is what they always debate about in D.C. And when a country like Russia comes in, interferes with our elections, that should bother everybody. I give people like John McCain and others credit because they're saying that. But the fact that Donald Trump acts like nothing happened makes me even more suspicious of how much he knows and when he knew about it.Frederica Freyberg:What about other people across the aisle, your peers, are they taking this as seriously as you are?Mark Pocan:More and more are as more information comes out. So I think at first they also were told there is nothing here to look at. Nothing here to look at. But now you find out the son-in-law of the president met with Russian officials at the Trump Tower after having them come in the back door. You're finding out that Attorney General Sessions now suddenly after explicitly saying he didn't meet with Russian officials, oh yeah, he did. We're starting to find this avalanche of information like this. Something's extremely suspicious by Wisconsin Midwestern standards and I think that we have to get the truth for the people.Frederica Freyberg:On the Affordable Care Act, I wonder if the time has come for Democrats to kind of face the reality that this is being repealed and they are working to replace it with President Trump saying quote I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.Mark Pocan:First of all I don't know if it's an imploding disaster. They're trying to help create that narrative around it. If you listened to the speech, yes he had a different tone but he still said there is an immigrant around every corner trying to attack you with the Affordable Care Act. He watches too much Mad Max I think when he gave that clip you played at the beginning of the interview. We all know there has to be changes to the Affordable Care Act. The problem is they want to repeal it without really a replacement. And supposedly this week we're going to see some language. But they won't have a hearing on it before the mark-up. They're not going to do any kind of public exposure of the bill. Again that is the wrong way to do it. We had a lot of debate around the Affordable Care Act when it came together. And I would argue -- I wasn't there when it happened and it wasn't a perfect process but there was plenty of public review and debate which we're not seeing on whatever they're going to come up with next.Frederica Freyberg:Let me ask you about some of the prongs we're hearing about and have heard about for a while. Those include tax credits based on age versus these kind of subsidies that Obamacare had, based on income. What is your opinion of those kinds of tax credit?Mark Pocan:You have to have the money to be able to afford health insurance so the subsidies at least helps you buy it on a monthly basis. Tax credits don't necessarily work in the same way and it's not going to be as clear. They're also talking about health savings account which are great if you have lots of money. But again it's not for the average middle class family or someone trying to aspire to be in the middle class. They talk about things like buying across state lines. We know that's not proven to provide any savings. My measurement is, is this going to provide -- protect the healthcare that everyone has right now, provide increased levels of healthcare and make it more affordable? I don't think any of those levels right now are being addressed by the plan they're roughly talking about.Frederica Freyberg:What happens to those in Wisconsin just over the poverty line that were encouraged to sign up in the marketplace when we didn't take expanded Medicaid in any of these kinds of replacement plans?Mark Pocan:They’re the ones that are going to fall through the holes in this plan because there's not going to be a safety net for them. Even though they keep telling us people will have coverage, it's going to be that they're offered a plan for coverage but not that they're going to be covered. We really need to have a thorough review of what they're going to put out there. And that's why when they're fast tracking this without any kind of hearings or anything, again it just makes me suspicious. My Wisconsin Midwest common sense is like ringing all sorts of bells when they are trying to move it this fast when for six years they've had no plan and now in one week they're going to come up with a plan. It just doesn't pass the smell test.Frederica Freyberg:All right. Representative Mark Pocan. Thanks very much.Mark Pocan:		1

Follow her on Twitter: @sallykohn . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.(CNN)Police in Pennsylvania are investigating the Delta Kappa Rho fraternity at Penn State University regarding two private group Facebook pages where members of the fraternity allegedly posted pictures of naked or partially dressed women, some of whom appeared to be passed out or asleep, "" or in other sexual or embarrassing positions."" Many of these pictures, it appears — though hopefully it goes without saying — were posted without these women's consent, or even awareness the photos were being taken. The Facebook pages also included pictures of frat members engaged in drug deals and hazing rituals.This comes on the heels of members of a University of Oklahoma fraternity being caught on video singing an explicitly racist chant. In 2013, the Sigma Phi Epsilon chapter at the University of Texas at Arlington was shut down after three separate incidents of rape were reported to have taken place in the frat house. In 2010, members of a fraternity at Yale marched past a female dormitory chanting , ""No means yes, yes means anal!""Sally KohnMost, though certainly not all, of these fraternity members are young white men. To be clear, the identity of the students involved in the Delta Kappa Rho Facebook posts has not been made public, but 73% of students at Penn State University are white and since Delta Kappa Rho is not a historically black fraternity, it's safe to assume that the Penn State frat is at least as white as the student body, which is to say predominantly so.These incidents and more remind us of the rampant but often-ignored danger posed by young white men in America today. Although the news media and popular culture constantly cast suspicion on young Muslim and African-American men and the supposedly disproportionate and ever-present threats these communities pose, the fact is young white men are just as dangerous. But because our biases have us so busy looking the other way, we're ignoring the magnitude of this reality.Certainly not all those perpetrating or advocating sexual and racial assault, within fraternities and outside of them, are young white men. Several of the instances of rape and sexual assault made public recently have certainly also included black and Latino young men. But while studies show that men who join fraternities are 300% more likely to rape, it's simply too easy to blame fraternities alone.Read MoreMaybe fraternities are boiling points of rape culture, but that culture is simmering everywhere else. And it makes sense we should examine every factor. This must include race and gender -- including whiteness and maleness. (Of course, the vast majority of young white men are law-abiding and present no risk; but that is also true of the vast majority of young black men and of Islamic men.)Studies show that most school shooters, for instance, are white men — 97% are male, 79% are white. According to analysis, when there's a mass shooting, there's a 98% likelihood the shooter is male.Whites account for 69% of those arrested for crimes. And yet although blacks and Latinos comprise a total of 30% of the population, they account for 58% of the prison population. Black men are six times more likely than white men to be incarcerated. And according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, since 9/11 more Americans have been killed on U.S. soil by white right-wing radicals than by Islamic jihadists.At a moment in our society when we magnify the threats posed by Islamic radical terrorists and attempt to rationalize the killing by police of unarmed black men across the country by over-hyping fears about black male violence, the simple fact remains that white men are an ever-present if not greater threat to our safety. Our racial and Islamophobic biases blind us to the dangers posed by young white men, allowing them to continue unexamined and unaddressed.A white friend in law school once pointed out in a discussion that one of the less-talked-about ramifications of racial profiling was that guilty young white kids were getting a pass. She said that if her white son were doing drugs in a park somewhere, she'd want the cops to find out and do something about it. But her white son would likely be overlooked, in a system irrationally and irresponsibly focused on the over-dramatized fear of black criminality. I'm not endorsing increasing rates of incarceration; we already have too many imprisoned for a free society in which rates of crime are dropping overall. I'm saying we should culturally, politically and, where appropriate, legally, scrutinize the criminal behavior of white men in equal proportion to the serial bad behavior in which they're engaged.Is it time to think about banning fraternities as apparently rampant cesspools of misogynistic and racist culture?

There are principled reasons for declining to grow a program that currently covers 3.7 million Floridians at a cost of $23.5 billion per year, or about one-third of Florida's budget.We oppose expanding Medicaid because it is a broken system with poor health outcomes, high inflation, unseverable federal strings, and no incentive for personal responsibility for those who are able to provide for themselves. Under current law, Florida provides for our most vulnerable: low-income children, pregnant women, the elderly and disabled people.Under federal law, other low-income Floridians have access to health care subsidies to buy private insurance for less than the average cost of a wireless phone bill. In fact, if we choose Obamacare expansion, 600,000 will lose eligibility for their subsidies, of which 257,000 would be forced into Medicaid.Those who claim we should expand Medicaid to get Florida's money back should note that we already receive over $15 billion more each year than we send to Washington. It's deficit spending. The national debt burden today is $145,000 per household. Medicaid expansion would not be financed with the hard-earned dollars we have already sent to Washington — it would be financed by mortgaging our children's and grandchildren's future.The Florida Senate disagrees and has unfortunately partnered with the Obama administration to demand Medicaid expansion. They suggest existing safety net funding (the Low Income Pool, or LIP) and our state budget are tied to federal health care policy goals.What is LIP? It's a federal program that provides $1.3 billion to hospitals and other providers, using additional local matching dollars. It was approved in 2006 to replace a prior program, in place for decades. Last year, the federal government told us that LIP needs to end in its current form, yet gave no guidance about what a new program should look like. Florida entered into talks with the federal government. Months later, the state was suddenly told that continued LIP funding is linked to Medicaid expansion.The implication is that if we don't expand, we won't get LIP funds.Eliminating LIP has serious consequences for some Florida hospitals and primary care programs. The federal government should approve a new program. If that does not happen, we need to take a serious look at what hospitals really need from taxpayers and whether hospitals can be more prudent and efficient.If we lose the federal LIP funds, we can create a more limited, state-funded program or we can live without LIP by pursuing other policy options aimed at reducing costs and increasing access to quality health care.Such options include ideas that the Florida House has championed for years. We support expanding the use of telemedicine and expanding the scope of practice for advance practice nurses to treat patients. We support encouraging direct primary care, which restores the doctor/patient relationship so health care is available at dramatically lower costs. We support expanding medical malpractice reform to reduce frivolous lawsuits that increase health care costs, and expanding choices for where patients get their health care by eliminating unnecessary government regulations. We support breaking geographic monopolies for hospitals. We support allowing consumers to buy health insurance across state lines.The LIP experience points to the difficulty of working with an unreliable, unpredictable federal partner more committed to a political goal than good government. I am hopeful the LIP negotiations will move past the Medicaid expansion debate to bring a swift resolution that creates a reasonable hospital funding program.In the meantime, the best course for Florida is to separate Medicaid expansion discussions and finish our state budget. Manufacturing a budget crisis in order to leverage a federal policy preference is not in the best interest of 19 million Floridians who are counting on us to do our job. Florida's safety net population and budget should not suffer because we disagree with the federal government on health care policy.We must have a budget by July 1, and the Florida House of Representatives stands ready to meet our constitutional obligation. The House made multiple offers to the Senate to restart the stalled budget process that would set aside state monies as a contingency fund for our safety net pending the outcome of the talks with the federal government. Our offer still stands. I believe we can responsibly craft a budget and together move toward common-ground policy ideas that are in the best interest of all Floridians.House Speaker Steve Crisafulli is a Merritt Island Republican.Trending Now		1
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/30/jeff-sessions/jeff-sessions-misleads-saying-inspector-general-fo/	"""Just last May, the Department of Justice inspector general found that these (‘sanctuary city’) policies also violate federal law."" "	mostly false	['Crime', 'Criminal Justice', 'Homeland Security', 'Immigration']	https://www.justice.gov/	https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-jeff-sessions-delivers-remarks-sanctuary-jurisdictions	2017/03/30	Attorney General Jeff Sessions Delivers Remarks on Sanctuary JurisdictionsWashington, DC~Monday, March 27, 2017Good afternoon. The Department of Justice has a duty to enforce our nation’s laws, including our immigration laws. Those laws require us to promptly remove aliens when they are convicted of certain crimes. The vast majority of the American people support this common-sense requirement. According to one recent poll, 80 percent of Americans believe that cities that arrest illegal immigrants for crimes should be required to turn them over to immigration authorities.Unfortunately, some states and cities have adopted policies designed to frustrate the enforcement of our immigration laws. This includes refusing to detain known felons under federal detainer requests, or otherwise failing to comply with these laws. For example, the Department of Homeland Security recently issued a report showing that in a single week, there were more than 200 instances of jurisdictions refusing to honor Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer requests with respect to individuals charged or convicted of a serious crime. The charges and convictions against these aliens include drug trafficking, hit and run, rape, sex offenses against a child and even murder. Such policies cannot continue. They make our nation less safe by putting dangerous criminals back on our streets. We all remember the tragic case of Kate Steinle, the 32-year-old woman who was shot and killed two years ago in San Francisco as she walked along a pier with her father. The shooter, Francisco Sanchez, was an illegal immigrant who had already been deported five times and had seven felony convictions. Just eleven weeks before the shooting, San Francisco had released Sanchez from its custody, even though ICE had filed a detainer requesting that he be kept in custody until immigration authorities could pick him up for removal. Even worse, Sanchez admitted that the only reason he came to San Francisco was because of its sanctuary policies. A similar story unfolded just last week, when Ever Valles, an illegal immigrant and Mexican national, was charged with murder and robbery of a man at a light rail station. Valles was released from a Denver jail in late December, despite the fact that ICE had lodged a detainer for his removal. The American people are justifiably angry. They know that when cities and states refuse to help enforce immigration laws, our nation is less safe. Failure to deport aliens who are convicted for criminal offenses puts whole communities at risk – especially immigrant communities in the very sanctuary jurisdictions that seek to protect the perpetrators. DUIs, assaults, burglaries, drug crimes, gang crimes, rapes, crimes against children and murders. Countless Americans would be alive today – and countless loved ones would not be grieving today – if the policies of these sanctuary jurisdictions were ended. Not only do these policies endanger the lives of every American; just last May, the Department of Justice Inspector General found that these policies also violate federal law. The President has rightly said that this disregard for the law must end. In his executive order, he stated that it is the policy of the executive branch to ensure that states and cities comply with all federal laws, including our immigration laws.The order also states that “the Attorney General and the Secretary [of Homeland Security] . . . shall ensure that jurisdictions that willfully refuse to comply” with the law “are not eligible to receive Federal grants, except as deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes by the Attorney General or the Secretary.”Today I am urging all states and local jurisdictions to comply with all federal laws, including 8 U.S.C. Section 1373. Moreover, the Department of Justice will require jurisdictions seeking or applying for Department grants to certify compliance with Section 1373 as a condition for receiving these awards. This policy is entirely consistent with the Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs (OJP) guidance issued last July under the previous administration. This guidance requires state and local jurisdictions to comply and certify compliance with Section 1373 in order to be eligible for OJP grants. It also made clear that failure to remedy violations could result in withholding of grants, termination of grants, and disbarment or ineligibility for future grants.The Department of Justice will also take all lawful steps to claw-back any funds awarded to a jurisdiction that willfully violates Section 1373. In the current fiscal year, department’s OJP and Community Oriented Policing Services anticipate awarding more than $4.1 billion dollars in grants. I urge our nation’s states and cities to consider carefully the harm they are doing to their citizens by refusing to enforce our immigration laws, and to re-think these policies. Such policies make their cities and states less safe, and put them at risk of losing valuable federal dollars.The American people want and deserve a lawful immigration system that keeps us safe and serves our national interest. This expectation is reasonable, and our government has a duty to meet it. And we will meet it.Speaker: 		1

The ad claims Dan Patrick has not repaid his bankruptcy debts, did not pay his taxes, pocketed payroll taxes and changed his name to hide from his debts. Woman: It’s a struggle, but I pay my bills, so why can’t millionaire Dan Patrick. KERA Debate Clip: You walked away from more than $800,000 in debts when you declared personal bankruptcy. You’ve been able to loan your campaign hundreds of thousands of dollars but you haven’t repaid the bankruptcy debts. Narrator: Dan Patrick also got caught not paying his taxes, pocketing his employees payroll taxes, and changed his name from Dannie Goeb to hide from the debts. Woman: If he can’t run his own business honestly, how can we trust him to run the state honestly. Dewhurst claim: Dan Patrick has not repaid his bankruptcy debts According to bankruptcy court documents, Patrick filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in October 1986 for over $800,000 in debts and those debts were discharged in May 1987. David Dewhurst has also used the bankruptcy process to “walk away” from debts. According to the Dallas Morning News and Texas Monthly, Dewhurst never repaid the unsecured creditors to whom he owed money. (Terrence Stutz, “Lieutenant governor candidate Dan Patrick knows struggles of going broke,” Dallas Morning News, 09/19/2013; S.C. Gwynne, “Lonesome Cowboy,” Texas Monthly, 06/01/2002). In 1983, Dewhurst, as well as Trans-Gulf Supply and Trans-Gulf Resources, were sued by River Oaks Bank and Trust over an unpaid debt. River Oaks Bank and Trust loaned Trans-Gulf Supply $1.5 million that was guaranteed by David Dewhurst and Trans-Gulf Resources. The court found in favor of River Oaks Bank and Trust, and Dewhurst was ordered to pay $832,805.29. Trans-Gulf Resources_Abstract of Judgment.pdf In addition to these debts, David Dewhurst currently owes more than $1 million to vendors for services provided to his 2012 U.S. Senate campaign. Consultant Jeff Roe told the Texas Tribune: “It’s clear he’s able to raise resources and pay these debts. The steps we took were on David’s word that we would be paid.” According to a Dallas Morning Report, vendors have been waiting over 18 months to receive payment for their work (Jay Root, “Dewhurst Campaign Owes Vendors Nearly $1 Million,” Texas Tribune, 08/13/2013; Christy Hoppe, “David Dewhurst’s 2012 campaign still owes vendors more than $1 million,” Dallas Morning News, 02/07/2014). Dewhurst claim: Dan Patrick got caught not paying his taxes Tax liens were filed against Dan Patrick and his businesses for failure to pay taxes; however, these liens were released in 2006 when Dan Patrick paid the taxes that were owed. During his 1998 campaign for Land Commissioner, it was revealed that Dewhurst owed $1,542 in back taxes and fines to the Comptroller for unpaid franchise taxes relating to his company Trans-Gulf Supply. The company did not file a franchise tax return in 1984 and did not pay the state-required minimum tax (Staff, “Land agency candidate criticizes foe over tax payment,” Dallas Morning News, 02/14/1998). The company was subject to tax forfeiture in 1990. Trans-Gulf Supply_State Tax Lien.pdf In 2000, the Comptroller’s Office informed Dewhurst that he owed use taxes on art and furniture he purchased in foreign countries. After discovering he owed the taxes, Dewhurst asked the Legislature to review the use taxes, calling the tax “a twisted tool that has loitered in the dark corners of state government for too long.” Dewhurst’s complaint against the tax was not based in helping Texas consumers, but preserving his own selfish interests (Staff, “Dewhurst should pay, and support, use tax,” San Antonio Express-News, 01/18/2000). Dewhurst claim: Dan Patrick pocketed his employees’ payroll taxes Bankruptcy and lien documents show Dan Patrick owed the federal government for unpaid payroll taxes. These documents do not prove that Patrick collected and pocketed the taxes. This is not a defense; however, it is a technical distinction. According to Patrick, these taxes were ultimately paid and the debt to the federal government was settled. Dewhurst claim: Dan Patrick changed his name to hide from his debts Although Patrick legally changed his name in 2004, he had been using the name “Dan Patrick” for 36 years as a broadcaster on television and radio (http://www.danpatrick.org/truth/). The debts and the name change are matters of public record and are not hidden from the public. Patrick even wrote about his bankruptcy, which occurred almost 20 years prior to his name change, in his book The Second Most Important Book You Will Ever Read: A Personal Challenge to Read the Bible (Terrence Stutz, “Lieutenant governor candidate Dan Patrick knows struggles of going broke,” Dallas Morning News, 09/19/2013).		1

Brady Press Briefing Room3:39 P.M. EDTMR. CARNEY: Good Friday afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for being here. I appreciate your patience. Before I take your questions, I just wanted to note, because it’s been reported, we did, as many of you know, have a background briefing here at the White House earlier. I think 14 news organizations were represented, ranging from online to broadcast TV, print and the like. And we do those periodically. We hope that participants find them helpful. I will say that no one here believes that briefings like that are substitute for this briefing, which is why I’m here today to take questions on whatever issues you want to ask me about.And with that, I will go to the Associated Press.Q Thanks, Jay. Two subjects, starting out with the IRS issue. The IRS says it's flagged conservative groups with names like “patriots” or “tea parties” for review, and says that in some instances that its workers inappropriately asked for the identities of donors, and it has apologized. When did the White House become aware that the IRS engaged in this? And in a tax collection system that relies on trust, isn’t the IRS’s credibility at stake here? And will the White House, as called on by Senator McConnell, call for an investigation?MR. CARNEY: Well, two things, Jim. I appreciate the question, and we’ve certainly see in those reports. My understanding is this matter is under investigation by the IG at the IRS. The IRS, as you know, is an independent enforcement agency with only two political appointees. The fact of the matter is what we know about this is of concern, and we certainly find the actions taken, as reported, to be inappropriate. And we would fully expect the investigation to be thorough and for corrections to be made in a case like this. And I believe the IRS has addressed that and has taken some action, and there is an investigation ongoing. But it certainly does seem to be, based on what we’ve seen, to be inappropriate action that we would want to see thoroughly investigated.Q Given that the President was so critical of some of these groups, both in 2010 and in 2012, isn’t it natural for the public to think that these things are politically motivated? What assurances can you --MR. CARNEY: Well, I think that, first of all, two things need to be noted, which is IRS is an independent enforcement agency, which I believe, as I understand it, contains only two political appointees within it. The individual who was running the IRS at the time was actually an appointee from the previous administration. But separate from that, there is no question that if this activity took place, it’s inappropriate and there needs to be action taken and the President would expect that it be thoroughly investigated and action would be taken. Q On Benghazi, and with all due credit to my colleague on the right, we have had emails showing that the State Department pushed back against talking-point language from the CIA and expressed concern about how some of the information would be used politically in Congress. You have said the White House only made a stylistic change here, but these were not stylistic changes. These were content changes. So again, what role did the White House play, not just in making but in directing changes that took place to these?MR. CARNEY: Well, thank you for that question. The way to look at this, I think, is to start from that week and understand that in the wake of the attacks in Benghazi, an effort was underway to find out what happened, who was responsible. In response to a request from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to the CIA, the CIA began a process of developing points that could be used in public by members of Congress, by members of that committee. And that process, as is always the case -- again, led by the CIA -- involved input from a variety of agencies with an interest in or a stake in the process, and that would include, obviously, the State Department since it was a State Department facility that was attacked and an Ambassador who was killed, as well as three others; the NSS, the FBI, which is the lead investigating authority, and other entities.The CIA -- in this case, deputy director of the CIA -- took that process and issued a set of talking points on that Saturday morning, and those talking points were disseminated. Again, this was all in response to a request from Congress. And the only edit made by the White House or the State Department to those talking points generated by the CIA was a change from -- referring to the facility that was attacked in Benghazi, from “consulate,” because it was not a consulate, to “diplomatic post.” I think I had referred to it as “diplomatic facility."" I think it may have been “diplomatic post.”But the point being, it was a matter of non-substantive/factual correction. But there was a process leading up to that that involved inputs from a lot of agencies, as is always the case in a situation like this, and is always appropriate. And the effort is always to, in that circumstance, with an ongoing investigation and a lot of information -- some of it accurate, some of it not, about what had happened and who was responsible -- to provide information for members of Congress and others in the administration, for example, who might speak publicly about it that was based on only what the intelligence community could say for sure it thought it knew. And that is what was generated by the intelligence community, by the CIA.Q But this information that -- was information that the CIA obviously knows about prior attacks and warnings about those. Does the President think that it was appropriate to keep that information away simply because of how Congress might use it?MR. CARNEY: Well, first of all, the CIA was the agency that made changes to the edits -- I mean, to the talking points and then produced the talking points, first of all. Second of all, I think the overriding concern of everyone involved in that circumstance is always to make sure that we’re not giving, to those who speak in public about these issues, information that cannot be confirmed, speculation about who was responsible, other things like warnings that may or may not be relevant to what we ultimately learn about what happened and why. All of that information, by the way, was and remains part of the investigation. It’s information that was provided to Congress and to others looking into this matter last fall and throughout the winter and into this year. And that investigation continues. But on the substantive issues of what happened in Benghazi, and at that time, what the intelligence community thought it knew, that was reflected in the talking points that were used, again, that weekend by Ambassador Rice and by others, including members of Congress. And I think if you look at the information that’s been reported, you can see that evolution and that it was -- the talking points were focused on what we knew and not speculation about what may or may not have been responsible or related.I would also say that all of this information was provided months ago to members of Congress, a fact that we made clear to all of you at the time. During the confirmation process for John Brennan as Director of the CIA, there was a request for more information, including emails around the deliberating process involved in producing these talking points, and this administration took the rather extraordinary measure of providing those emails to members of the relevant committees, as well as the leadership members and staff in Congress. And that information was available, again, in late February to members of Congress, and through March. And once that information was reviewed, in the case of the Senate, Senate Republicans, a number of whom went on record saying, well, now I feel like I know what I need to know, then allowed the process for the confirmation of John Brennan to go forward and he was confirmed in early March.Q Since you bring it up, why were those emails provided in a read-only fashion?MR. CARNEY: It is, I think, a standard procedure for administrations of both parties, going back decades, that internal deliberations are generally protected -- is generally protected information that is not something that is regularly shared with Congress, and then that’s -- to allow for a deliberative process in the executive branch. In this case, to answer just these concerns that members of Congress had, particularly Republican members of Congress, that step was taken and provided. And they were able to review all of these emails, which they have, of course, now leaked to reporters, but they were able to review all of these emails for as long as they wanted, take extensive notes if they chose to.And again, once that process was completed, the confirmation of John Brennan went forward. A number of Republicans came forward and said that they felt like they had the information they needed about that aspect of the Benghazi incident. And it's only now for what I think is, again, reflective of ongoing attempts to politicize a tragedy that took four American lives, we're now seeing it resurface together with sort of political assertions by Republicans that ignore the basic facts here: There was an attack on our facility in Benghazi. The intelligence community provided the information that it felt comfortable providing for public dissemination to members of government, Congress and the administration. As we learned more about what happened, we provided it. That's why everybody has received the information that it has throughout this process, from the -- I mean, one of the things that I think is interesting about the points is that from the very beginning there was included in the points the statement about demonstrations taking place outside of the building, of the facility in Benghazi. That is what the assessment -- the consensus or collective assessment of the intelligence community was that, from that, there were spontaneous attacks launched against the facility. And when we found out that that was not true, when the assessment changed, we made that clear. And that was -- going back, if you remember, when we had this discussion back in the fall, that was the point that Republicans were focusing on.And yet, it's clear from what you see in these documents that that was the assessment made by the intelligence community. And it's also clear from the evolution of what public officials said about what we knew that as we got more concrete information and information that we felt confident about, we provided it to the press, to Congress and to the public. Q Jay, the substance of these emails, though, suggests -- or have very specific exchanges between State Department officials and officials here at the White House, which Jonathan uncovered, in which a State Department official raises concerns about providing talking points that would include a mention of al Qaeda because of a concern that Congress would use that against the State Department and the White House.MR. CARNEY: Well, I think that’s actually not -- I think you need to -- the State Department has said that the spokesman's office raised two primary concerns about the talking points. The points went further in assigning responsibility than preliminary assessments suggested, and there was concern about preserving the integrity of the investigation. That concern was expressed in other quarters, not just at the State Department.Q The email said specifically concern about giving members of Congress something to use against the State Department.MR. CARNEY: Well, again, this was a process where there was an effort underway, an interagency process, to develop information that could be delivered by government officials -- both congressional and administration officials -- about what we knew and not going beyond what we knew.Q The language of that email is pretty clear, and the response is pretty clear in terms of saying we want to address Victoria Nuland's concerns. No matter who ended up providing the talking points in the end, it certainly seems clear that there was an influence by the White House and the State Department on the CIA talking points for that reason.MR. CARNEY: But again, I think you're conflating a couple of things here. The White House, as I said, made one minor change to the talking points drafted by and produced by the CIA, and even prior to that made very few --Q But is that just parsing words, Jay? I mean, does that --MR. CARNEY: -- had very few inputs on it. The other discussions that went on prior to this in an interagency process reflected the concerns of a variety of agencies who had a stake in this issue, both the FBI because it was investigating; the CIA, obviously, and other intelligence agencies; and the State Department, because an ambassador had been killed and a diplomatic facility had been attacked. And what I think the concern was is that these points not provide information that was speculative in terms of whether it was relevant to what happened.And what could not be known at that time was the relevance of issues about warnings. There's the discussion about -- the Republicans -- again, in this ongoing effort that began hours after the attacks when Mitt Romney put out a press release to try to take political advantage out of these deaths, or out of the attack in Benghazi, in a move that was maligned even by members of his own party. And from that day forward, there has been this effort to politicize it. And if you look at the issue here -- the efforts to politicize it were always about were we trying to play down the fact that there was an act of terror and an attack on the embassy. And the problem has always been with that assertion is that it's completely hollow, because the President himself in the Rose Garden said this was an act of terror. And he talked about it within the context of September 11th, 2001. And then we had other officials of the administration refer to this as a terrorist act.Susan Rice, when she went out on the Sunday shows using the very talking points that we're discussing now, talked about the possibility that we knew that -- or believed based on the intelligence assessment that extremists were involved, and there were suspicions about what affiliations those extremists might have, but there were not -- there was not hard, concrete evidence. And so Ambassador Rice, in those shows, talked about the possibility that al Qaeda might be involved, or other al Qaeda affiliates might be involved, or non-al Qaeda Libyan extremists -- which I think demonstrates that there was no effort to play that down, it was simply a reflection of we did not, and the intelligence community did not, and others within the administration did not jump to conclusions about who was responsible before we had an investigation to find out the facts.Q But was concern about how Congress would react a factor in what went into those talking points, as that email suggests?MR. CARNEY: Again, I think if you look at the development of the talking points, the answer to that is no, because the talking points reflect the intelligence community's assessment of what happened. And all the other issues about who was responsible, what specific organizations may have participated, what information was available or threats were known about the situation in Libya or in Benghazi specifically -- I mean, all of that was part of an investigation, and was provided to Congress, and, as we learned more, to the public by the administration.April.Q Jay, since you say this is a minor change -- a minor change in venue, with the wording changed in venue -- why such a big deal today with this deep background, deep, deep background, off-the-record briefing? It makes it seem like --MR. CARNEY: Well, let's be clear, it wasn't off the record. And that was an erroneous report. But the -- I mean, it's a big deal because Republicans have chosen, in the latest iteration of their efforts, to politicize this, to provide -- leak this information to reporters -- information that we provided months ago to Republican lawmakers from the relevant committees and Republican leadership, as well as Democratic. And there's an ongoing effort to make something political out of this.But the problem with that effort is that it's never been clear what it is they think they're accusing the administration of doing, because when it comes to who is responsible, we were very open about what we knew, what we thought we knew, what we did for a fact know, and the fact that this was an ongoing investigation, and we would certainly learn more that would change our view of what had had happened in Benghazi.Q I’m understanding that, but it seems like there has been fuel added to the fire. If this was such a minor issue, why not just tell the press like you did from the podium just a few minutes ago, instead of having this background briefing with a select few, and not the whole group right now if it's such a minor issue?MR. CARNEY: Well, again, I think I talked -- I'm here right now to take your questions about this issue. And we have background briefings periodically, and 14 news organizations were represented, and that’s something that administrations do regularly of both parties. And as I said at the top, it's not a replacement for this briefing, and that’s why I'm here taking your questions.Yes.Q Jay, how do you go from a conversation that was apparently happening between various administration officials, various officials of this government on September 14th, and in those emails -- in that email exchange there is a discussion about a group, Ansar al-Sharia, and then, after Victoria Nuland raises concerns on the part of the State Department, that references to that group are then removed from the conversation and don’t make their way into the talking points? That is a not a stylistic edit. That is not a single adjustment, as you said, back in November. That is a major, dramatic change in the information. MR. CARNEY: No, I appreciate the question and the opportunity, again, to make clear that the CIA produced talking points that was a result of an interagency process on the morning of -- that Saturday morning. And to that --Q But when you say the CIA produced talking points --MR. CARNEY: Jim, let me just finish this and then you can follow up.Q But they were produced with the involvement and from pressure from other parties that were involved -- the White House, the State Department. MR. CARNEY: I would point you to the numerous statements by the top officials at the CIA making clear that they wrote the talking points, that they believed that those talking points represented what they knew to the best of their knowledge at that time and did not include things that they could not be concretely sure of. Ansar al-Sharia is a good example.If you remember, in the wake of these attacks, there was an initial claim of responsibility by that group, and a lot of people rushed out and said, well, this is the group that’s responsible. Then that group withdrew the claim of responsibility. Now neither is dispositive -- that’s why it needs to be investigated.So what we knew was not concretely for sure that that group was responsible at that time, but we knew that extremists were participants. And that’s what the talking points said. And again, there’s the idea -- Jim, if I could -- the idea that saying ""extremists"" is somehow hiding the ball, I mean, does anybody in this room not understand that extremists in Libya means the kind of people who would attack a U.S. diplomatic facility?Q But if you go back to what Susan Rice was talking about during those talk shows, she may have left open the possibility of extremists, but this is an altogether different thing. When you --MR. CARNEY: Well actually, Jim, as I just said, she went on the Sunday shows and she talked Ansar al-Sharia. She talked about the fact that they may be responsible. She talked about the fact that al Qaeda could be responsible or other al Qaeda-linked affiliates. So what she did not say is that we know for a fact that they're responsible. And that’s why in the basic talking points -- again, this is all about talking points. This is not about the facts of the investigation or all of the information that has been provided to Congress in countless hearings, countless pieces of information in documents that have been provided -- I think 20,000 or 25,000 pages of documents. This was just the talking points that were the baseline for what public officials, beginning with members of Congress -- that's what they were developed for, but also provided to Ambassador Rice. And then she spoke beyond that based on what could be true, as opposed to what we knew to be true. Q But just to follow up on this, once and for all -- you are comfortable, you are still comfortable --MR. CARNEY: You promise -- once and for all? (Laughter.)Q Well, maybe not. (Laughter.) But you are comfortable with the way you characterized this back in November, that this was a single adjustment? Yes, it may have been the White House that made a single adjustment, and perhaps it was the CIA that drafted these talking points. But that's sort of glossing over the fact that you had all of these other parties involved. These were not stylistic edits, Jay. This is very much a content-driven change in the talking points.MR. CARNEY: Well, let me just make clear, I do stand by that when we were talking about the talking points that were produced by the CIA and provided to members of Congress on the Intelligence Committee in the House who would ask for it and others, as well as folks in the administration, that that document was -- there was a suggested edit that was accepted by the White House, and that was a change from, to make it factual, the calling of the building in Benghazi a “consulate,” because it was not a consulate, to “diplomatic post” or “facility.” I can't remember which.Prior to that, there had been a lot of discussion and iteration, iterative process where the various issues were discussed about what could be or should be said publicly -- what we know, what we're just speculating about. And that process involved a whole bunch of agencies. And it's also the case that in that process, the White House involvement in the talking points was very limited and non-substantive. But the issues that you mentioned had to do with limiting the talking points to what we knew, as opposed to speculation about what may or may not have been in the end relevant to what happened in Benghazi.Jon.Q Jay, you told us that the only changes that were made were stylistic. Is it a stylistic change to take out all references to previous terror threats in Benghazi?MR. CARNEY: Well, I appreciate the question again. And I think that what I was referring to was the talking points that the CIA drafted and sent around, to which one change was made. And I accept that “stylistic” may not precisely describe a change of one word to another. Q Jay, this was not a change of one word to another. Jay, these underwent extensive changes after they were written by the CIA; that these were concerns that were raised by the State Department that the White House directed the interagency process to use in making these talking points. The CIA original version included references to al Qaeda, references to Ansar al-Islam. The original CIA version included extensive discussion of the previous threats of terrorist attacks in Benghazi. Those were taken out after the CIA wrote its initial draft. MR. CARNEY: And then the CIA wrote another draft.Q Based on input from the State Department. Do you deny that?MR. CARNEY: No, Jon. What I'm saying is -- and I've answered this question several times now, but I'm happy to answer again if you let me answer it, and that is that there was an interagency process, which is always the case, because a lot of agencies have a stake in the matter like this -- the investigative agency, the intelligence agencies, the State Department in this case, the national security staff. And everybody provided information and comment. And then on Saturday morning the CIA said, we're going to take a crack at drafting these points based on what we know. And the things that you're talking about don't go to the fundamental issue here, which was what would -- could be said concretely about what the intelligence community knew to be true, not that some people thought it was Ansar al-Sharia, some people thought it was other al Qaeda affiliates or Libyan extremists, so we knew it was extremists or we believed we knew that extremists had participated.There was also the belief from the beginning by the intelligence community in these points that there had been protests out of which the attack occurred, protests in response to the demonstrations that were in Cairo at our embassy that were in response to that video. That turned out not to be the case, but it demonstrates the fluidity of the information, the fact that it was hard and continues to be hard -- in an investigation -- to know concretely, especially in the first days afterwards, what happened. And that's why we were so careful to say here's what we know or we believe we know. And every time we've said that, we fully expect this information to change as we learn more. And it did, and we've provided it.And the whole effort here by Republicans to find some hidden mystery comes to nothing because the President called it an act of terror. The Ambassador to the United Nations that very Sunday that has caused Republicans so much concern talked about the possible involvement of al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia. All of this is a distraction from the key issues: A diplomatic post was attacked by individuals in Libya, in Benghazi. Four Americans lost their lives. From the beginning, the President has committed all the resources of this administration, of this government, to finding out who was responsible and to bringing them to justice. He also, very clearly, together with the Secretary of State, said we need to make sure that we find out what went wrong, what problems there were with security that allowed this to happen, to hold people accountable and to make the necessary changes so that it doesn't happen again. And that process happened -- was stood up by the Secretary of State. It was a process led by two of the most experienced and widely regarded figures in national security in Washington, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Admiral Mullen, and Ambassador Tom Pickering -- nonpartisan, serving both parties for different administrations. They conducted an extensive review of this. They’ve said they had access to all the information they needed. They had access to all the people they needed to talk to. And they produced an unsparing report with a series of very critical observations and very serious recommendations, every single one of which the State Department has adopted.So that’s the way the system should work, and it worked that way because the President and the Secretary of State insisted that it work that way.Q But, Jay, can we come back on what you said? You said that the only changes that were made by either the White House or the State Department were stylistic and a single word. What we see here is that the State Department raised objections about the references to Ansar al-Sharia. They raised objections to the fact that the CIA had warned about terror threats in Benghazi prior to the attack. Those subjects were taken out of the CIA talking points at the direction of the White House based on the objections from the State Department.MR. CARNEY: No, they weren’t. First of all, they weren’t at the direction of the White House. The only -- this process, as everybody is an equal player in this process says, everybody’s concerns have to be listened to and taken into account. But ultimately these were intelligence community talking points that the intelligence community, led by the CIA, had --Q Changed because of objections from the State Department.MR. CARNEY: Jon, could I finish? You’ve had a long time there -- that the intelligence community has to sign off on and believe represents the intelligence community’s view of what they knew at that time about what happened. And again, this would be more significant if we didn’t acknowledge from the beginning that extremists were likely involved, that we didn’t acknowledge from the beginning that it could very well have been Ansar al-Sharia that was involved or al Qaeda itself or other al Qaeda affiliates.This is an effort to accuse the administration of hiding something that we did not hide. In fact, we spoke publicly about it. The Secretary -- I mean, the Ambassador to the United Nations, who was the lead administration official talking about this that weekend, spoke openly about that possibility. And every bit of information that’s come out about what we know happened in Benghazi has been a result of information provided by various agencies of the administration.This investigation, in fact, continues to this day. Just last week, the FBI released photographs of individuals that they believe might be connected to the attack on Benghazi in their effort to bring those people accountable. That’s the important business that remains to be done when it comes to Benghazi.Q Just a clarification --MR. CARNEY: Let me let some others. Last one.Q When you said what you said, did you know that this had gone through 12 versions and that there had been extensive changes made? Were you aware of that at the time?MR. CARNEY: Jon, there is always a deliberative process. There is always input by agencies, and I knew that. And what I also knew was that the CIA, on Saturday morning, said, we’re going to draft these points. They drafted those points and those points were delivered virtually unchanged, with the exception of the one change I mentioned, to members of Congress and to the administration for use.Kristen.Q Jay, to ask it in a slightly different way, do you acknowledge that your initial characterization of the White House’s involvement was to some extent a mischaracterization of the extent to which the White House was involved in the evolution of those talking points?MR. CARNEY: I think it’s really important to examine now the information that we provided Congress months ago, which they have chosen for political reasons to leak today, which is their prerogative, I suppose. But the fact is the White House’s involvement to the talking points that were generated by the CIA that Saturday was to make the single change, suggest the single change. By the way, we suggest -- the White House suggests a change; everybody signs off, or doesn’t -- because, as a matter of fact, I think people were fine with it. And even prior, in the deliberative process that I was referring to that Jon was talking about, the White House involvement in the actual -- in any changes that were made to the so-called talking points was extremely minimal and non-substantive.Q But why not come forward initially and say, Friday night, White House officials were involved in the interagency process that you’ve been describing? Why not offer that information at the start?MR. CARNEY: Again, look, there was no intent here to do anything but answer the question. The questions were related to -- this was the Republican accusation that everybody was very excited about at the time -- that did the White House change the intelligence community’s assessment of what happened? Did the White House tell the intelligence community to say that there were demonstrations? And the underreported fact of all the revelations today is that these documents bear out what we said all along, and the answer is no. The answer is no.Q So Speaker Boehner -- I have a few more questions, Jay. Speaker Boehner has asked that you release the emails, and according to our sources, House officials are also asking that they get more documentation about the Saturday, September 5th meeting at the White House. Will you release those additional emails and documents?MR. CARNEY: Well, I think they’re asking for emails that they’ve already seen, that they were able to review and take extensive notes on, apparently provide verbatim information to folks. So I think -- including the Speaker’s House, and maybe he’s unaware of that. Q Just one more, on the IRS. Is the President --MR. CARNEY: The Speaker’s office, sorry.Q -- concerned about the allegations? And will he make sure that those who are involved are held accountable? MR. CARNEY: Allegations of what, sorry? On the --Q The IRS story, targeting --MR. CARNEY: Well, I think I made clear I haven’t spoken to the President about that, but you can be sure that if there was inappropriate conduct here, that he would want it thoroughly investigated and we would not tolerate that.Bill.Q When did the White House become aware that the IRS was looking into the tax-exempt applications of conservative --MR. CARNEY: I don’t have an answer to that specifically. I know that when the IG began investigating it, that it’s been investigating it for however long the IRS has said, but I don’t have a specific answer to that. It was -- but what I can tell you is, based on what we've learned today, two things: One, the IRS has clearly taken action to correct this, clearly stated from the leadership of the IRS that this is inappropriate and unacceptable behavior. And we concur with that, and we would expect a thorough investigation and for all the necessary corrections to be made.Q Conservative groups were complaining about this all through the period between 2010 and 2012. Was the White House aware of that then?MR. CARNEY: Of what, the complaints?Q Yes, the complaints that they were being targeted by the IRS.MR. CARNEY: I don’t have any information on that. I think there were public reports, but I don’t -- I would refer you to the IRS. I don’t have information about that.Q And there's no call on -- by some reporters on the Hill for a congressional investigation. MR. CARNEY: Again, I think -- the IRS is an independent agency. The inspector general is an independent investigator, and that office is investigating this, and that’s entirely appropriate. Jared.Q To follow up on Kristen's question -- I think Speaker Boehner's office, they know -- they have seen the emails, but they wanted them to be released to the public, at least the unclassified ones. Is that something the White House will do?MR. CARNEY: Again, as I mentioned at the top, there is a long precedent here for protecting internal deliberations. This is across administrations of both parties. And we took the extraordinary step, which is unusual -- and in fact, I think especially unusual with regard to our predecessor -- of providing these emails in-camera so that the relevant committee members and their staffers, as well as leadership members and their staffers could review them, take notes, spend as much time with them as they like. And that was an extraordinary step because it was demanded by Republicans as part of what they were asking for during the confirmation process for John Brennan.And I would remind you that in response to that, a number of Republicans said they felt they had gotten the information they needed. The Brennan nomination moved forward and he was confirmed.Q But wouldn’t it just help clear up, I guess for people who still have a lot of questions about what exactly --MR. CARNEY: But here's the thing -- we've provided this information to the committees. The fact that the very people who have reviewed this and probably leaked it -- generally speaking, not specifically -- are asking for something they've already had access to I think demonstrates that this is what it was from the beginning in terms of the Republican handling of it, which was a highly political matter.From the hours after the attack -- beginning with the Republican nominee’s unfortunate press release, and then his statements the day after -- there has been an effort to politicize a tragedy here, the deaths of four Americans, to try to suggest that even though the President called it an act of terror, even though the Ambassador to the United Nations referred to possible responsibility not just by extremists but possibly by al Qaeda or al Qaeda affiliates, that we were somehow not talking about that when the publicly available evidence proves the opposite.Q Jay, on a different subject.MR. CARNEY: Yes, Wendell.Q The House will vote again next week to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Speaker Boehner says it's for the benefit of 70 new members who haven't had a chance to vote on the Affordable Care Act. What's your response?MR. CARNEY: Well, I appreciate that, Wendell. I think that what I've said in the past holds true today, which is the now 40th attempt, I think, or 40th vote by the House of Representatives -- that’s a rough estimate -- to repeal the Affordable Care Act will achieve nothing beyond what it has achieved in the past, which is nothing but, I suppose, a waste of time.The Congress passed the Affordable Care Act. The Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act. And we are implementing the Affordable Care Act. And it just seems to me if -- whether it's the vote this week by the House of Representatives to pass on a measure that would prioritize debt payments -- in other words, default by any other name; to basically accept a situation where they would tank the world economy if they didn’t get the tax cuts for the wealthy that they wanted, to make that -- to pass that law -- that doesn’t seem like a great use of time, a representation of what the American people want their members of Congress to be doing.And then, next week, to go through the charade again of voting to repeal a law that has been upheld by the Supreme Court and that was passed into law and signed into law just seems misguided. And what would be great I think for members of Congress to do would be to focus on the things that the American people want them to focus on -- like measures to help the economy grow; to focus on some of the things the President was focused on yesterday in Austin, Texas, where he highlighted remarkable advancements being made in high-tech manufacturing, advancements that are helping build the economy of the future, where he announced an initiative to fund another innovation institute so that we can develop these jobs for the middle class that are the jobs of the future, and then to assist middle-class Americans in obtaining the skills they need to fill those jobs, and to ensure that those jobs pay the kind of wages that can sustain a middle-class life. That’s what the American people are focused on and what they want.I think efforts to refight the political battles of the past are not looked upon kindly by a majority of Americans. Jon-Christopher, then Julianna, and then Peter.Q As the British invasion continues, Monday, Prime Minister David Cameron will be here meeting with the President. David Cameron met with Mr. Putin today in Russia. Aside from the discussions about the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in June, how much of this discussion will be on the crisis in Syria? And can you give us any more detail about the meeting and the topics that might be discussed?MR. CARNEY: Well, as is always the case when the President meets with Prime Minister Cameron, they will speak about a range of subjects. The relationship between our two nations is extraordinarily close, and we work and cooperate on matters across the international spectrum. The upcoming G8 will of course be a topic of conversation. The United Kingdom is hosting that important meeting on the international economy. They will also clearly discuss Syria. They will probably discuss Iran. They will probably discuss the Middle East peace process and a whole host of other issues. That is always the case when these two leaders get together.Julianna.Q I just want to follow up on some of the questions about the IRS and conservative political groups. Did anybody at the White House know that this was going on during the campaign? MR. CARNEY: I have to take that question. I just learned about it today. I think that the IRS has addressed when it learned about -- at the headquarters level -- when it learned about it, and what actions that were taken in the IG investigation. And so I would just refer you to the IRS.Q But any sort of White House involvement or knowledge that you can't say at this time?MR. CARNEY: Again, I learned about it today, and I'll have to take the question. Peter.Q Jay, you said that the Republicans were being political about it. Is it not also political to say we want to keep something out of the talking points because we might be criticized by members of Congress? Is that not a political motivation there? MR. CARNEY: Again, I think the State Department has addressed what the concerns of the spokesperson's office were when that office engaged with a number of other agencies in discussions about what they knew and what the various agencies knew and what was appropriate to include in public talking points. And I think one of the concerns, as I said, was that we don’t put information in that would suggest by its inclusion was relevant to or determinative about who was responsible when, in fact, we didn’t know that.As we learn more information, we provided it. And officials of the administration, including Ambassador Rice, openly engaged in conversations that allowed that it was possible that groups like Ansar al-Sharia might have been responsible, or other extremist groups. And remember that the issue at the time was were we somehow by including in the talking points the assessment by the intelligence community that there had been protests that led to this attack outside of the facility in Benghazi, were we trying to play down the fact that it was an act of terror -- again, a hollow claim when the President himself called it an act of terror when the talking points referred to the participation of extremists. And I think everybody understands what “extremist” means.So I think the effort underway was simply to provide in those talking points the information that the intelligence community felt confident it knew for sure, as opposed to information it could not be confident of. And I think that was what the CIA has said produced the points that they drafted.Q But the phrase doesn’t say let's not put this out because we're not sure it's true; the phrase is, let's not put this out because we don’t want to be criticize by our political opponents. Is that not political in itself?MR. CARNEY: Well, again, I think the State Department has addressed the spokesperson's office's concerns about this. But they focused on not assigning responsibility prematurely before -- based on preliminary assessments by experience and definition were likely to change, and that we not use language that was inconsistent with what -- that members of Congress not be deploying information about this that, again, wasn’t based on what we knew or believed to be true, or that other administration officials had been using.There was an effort to focus everyone who was talking about this publicly on what the lead agencies here were, the information they had as opposed to speculating about who was responsible or what -- what relevance there might be to the fact that there had been threats and warnings in Libya in general and in Benghazi specifically.Q I hear what you’re saying. Sorry, on the backgrounder you had earlier you said, well, everybody does it basically; Republicans and Democrats, everybody has backgrounders. You all came to town, though, saying you were going to be different, change the rules, be more transparent. Don't you think it encourages the idea that you had something or your colleagues or whoever did the backgrounder -- I wasn’t there -- had something to say they didn't want to say it out here?MR. CARNEY: Not at all. There’s nothing that -- that was an effort to, as we do periodically, to walk people through what we knew with granularity, which I’m happy to do for as long as you want here.Q You might have done that on the record then. Why did it have to be on background?MR. CARNEY: Well, I think we -- look, again, Peter, we provide information on background, but it is not a substitute for on-the-record, on-camera briefings where I will take any question you have and attempt to answer it. And that's what I’m doing.Q But what purpose is there for doing it on background?MR. CARNEY: Again, to provide reporters with information that we then follow up with the public briefing.Q Did you provide that information from the background in this briefing do you believe today?MR. CARNEY: I can go into -- this is mostly -- people ask questions, I can answer the questions. I was able to listen to the briefing as well, and I think it helps me answer the questions that everybody here has.Q But do you think that you gave much of that information from the briefing, that background briefing today, in your briefing today on the record?MR. CARNEY: The answer is yes, but my familiarity with the subject predates today significantly.Q Jay?MR. CARNEY: Alexis.Q Jay, just overarching -- looking back at -- because a lot of were in the Briefing Room with you that day that day after the attacks. Is the President satisfied with the way the administration handled this? Would you do anything differently? Would he want the administration to do something differently looking backward?MR. CARNEY: No, I think that the administration has focused on what’s important here: Investigating what happened, working to bring those who killed four Americans to justice on the one hand, investigating what went wrong with security, and taking steps to ensure that it never happens again. And those two tracks have been pursued from the beginning at the President’s direction.And our effort has been to be -- to provide as much information as we have when it’s available and when we feel confident that it’s accurate. And even then -- and I think is reflective of major incidents like this all the time -- that the initial information may not turn out to be wholly accurate. And we made clear from the very beginning that the investigation was just beginning; that as more information became available we would make you aware of that. And that's exactly what we did.Q So to follow up on that -- because some of us were here that day talking to you -- you talked right away about the video. And I’m wondering, when you are saying now that you didn't want to be speculative, some of us then were wondering why you didn't just wait and say there was an investigation. So why are you saying the video discussion was not speculative to reassert --MR. CARNEY: Well, I was -- well, I was using -- what I was saying was based on the points that the CIA had provided, just as Susan Rice had. Q Right, but now --MR. CARNEY: And that's what the -- that's the CIA had -- and I think it’s instructive because at that time -- and obviously there different people thought different things -- but the leading intelligence agency in this process decided that that's what it believed it knew at the time, and that is what it provided to us, as well as to members of Congress. And as that changed we made clear that it -- Q But don't the --MR. CARNEY: What's that?Q Don't this series of emails now suggest that your discussion of the video was speculative, you were cherry-picking?MR. CARNEY: Well, I think again, you’re -- no, because -- I mean I would ask the CIA. The CIA -- one thing that's consistent throughout the material that was provided to Jon and others is that from the beginning that was in the talking points, that the CIA was prepared to disseminate. And it was based on what they thought they knew at the time.And I think the fact that parts of that -- and really the only part of that that turned out not to be the case, which was that there were protests over the video that preceded the attack on the embassy reflects how fluid information is and how risky it is to make declarations about what we know to be true in the immediate aftermath of an incident like this.But it is very important actually to stand back and look at that. The talking points that have gotten so much attention -- and let’s remember that these are talking points -- it’s not policy, it’s talking points -- to this day have been shown to be wrong in only one instance, and that was the existence of demonstrations preceding the attack. Everything else about them was true, including the assertion that extremists might have been involved, and the assertion that as we got more information we would -- that this account would likely evolve and change, and we would provide that information as we got it.And so all of this from the beginning, the Republican attempts to politicize this, has been based on that single thing, which we corrected once we knew that it was no longer a correct description of what happened.Q But today the President had a health care event that gets wiped off because this has continued because that information was not put out.MR. CARNEY: I don't understand. What do you mean ""that information?"" Are you saying we should have overruled the intelligence community? I mean that -- we relied on what they thought they knew. So did the members of the House Select Intelligence Committee, so did other members of Congress. But we also made clear that it was preliminary information that was subject to change as more information became available.Q Jay, on the point you just made, it seems like you're saying contradictory things. You’re saying that the first iteration of the talking points that the CIA drafted was what they thought happened, and the last version was what they knew happened.MR. CARNEY: No, in both cases I think I said what they thought they knew happened.Q Okay.MR. CARNEY: And based on their assessment that's what they thought they knew. But even then it was couched. In all iterations it was couched, and there was a caveat that as more information became available, the picture would likely change.Q But by nature of the CIA signing off on each iteration of the talking points, they were perfectly fine with members of Congress or officials discussing anything they included in any of those versions that they signed off on. So why was it necessary -- why was it deemed necessary to then refer them back to not including certain information in the final draft version if they were perfectly fine with that being --MR. CARNEY: Well, when you say they were -- the process began because the CIA got the request from the House Select -- the House Permanent Select Intelligence Committee. And they began the process of drawing up points. And again, as I’ve said, as that process evolved, there was clearly inputs from other agencies who had a direct stake in this, including the FBI, the State Department, the national security staff and others, the ODNI. And when the CIA then redrafted the points on Saturday morning, it kept those points to what they believed they knew at the time --Q But why --MR. CARNEY: -- based on the information. I think I’ve addressed that. Again, there was no concrete determination. There were some people who believed it, some people who didn't -- concrete determination that Ansar al-Sharia was responsible. There was no concrete determination that warnings about the threats that existed in Libya were or were not directly related to what happened in Benghazi. All of those matters have been openly discussed and matters of investigation, but they weren’t what we knew or what the intelligence community knew to be true at the time. And again, Ambassador Rice, who is -- has been the focus of this and the use of these talking points, and the very partisan focus of Republican complaints on this, openly discussed the possibility that and even the likelihood that the extremists that we felt were involved might have some al Qaeda affiliation or some other affiliation to an extremist group, as opposed to just unaffiliated violent actors.Q But if it was a problem for the CIA to speculate about those things, why would they sign off on the first version for others to review?MR. CARNEY: Again, you're talking about a draft process that involves a bunch of agencies offering their views.Q But the CIA is not going to spill secrets they're not comfortable putting out there. I mean -- or is that an assumption?MR. CARNEY: I would simply say that the -- here’s a good point. I think there was in one of the stories I read -- and again, these are documents that somebody, I don't know who on the Hill, provided to reporters -- but one of the things that has been noted that was removed was an assertion about a warning from social media about potential demonstrations in Cairo.Well, you don't hear a lot of Republicans citing that because that would have, if it had been included, reinforced the assertion that demonstrations preceded an attack in Benghazi, that those demonstrations were the result of reaction to the violent demonstrations in Cairo. And I think the focus of these things was to write just what we knew or what we thought we knew based on the intelligence community’s best assessments. And that's what was produced.Steve.Q It’s coming up on eight months to the day since the Benghazi attack. The FBI just got around two and a half weeks ago to releasing three images of people they were looking for information for about perpetrators of the attack. Is the President confident that the FBI is capable of solving and finding the perpetrators, something that you just said a few minutes ago is a priority of the President? And is the President doing everything in his power to do that as well?MR. CARNEY: Absolutely. And I think that “just getting around to” is probably not a characterization that reflects the very hard work that the FBI is engaged in, in investigating this, working with other agencies of government as well as obviously authorities in Libya. And that process continues.And you can believe -- and I think this President has a record to prove it -- that he will keep focused on this until those who are responsible are brought to justice. And again, I think this President has a record that backs that up.Q Thanks, Jay.MR. CARNEY: Steve and then George. I already gave them more time. Sorry, Steve and George.Q Yes, you talked about the talking points being about what we knew or what the CIA believed it knew. The first few drafts, it says, “we do know that Islamic extremists with ties to al Qaeda participated in the attack.” This is not couched. It says “we do know.” MR. CARNEY: I believe the CIA -- the CIA --Q That this appears --MR. CARNEY: The CIA -- again, these are --Q -- from the drafts and four and five --MR. CARNEY: Right, and that's -- and you should direct those questions to the intelligence community where obviously there were different inputs within the IC about what they thought they knew and what different people who provided information within the intelligence community thought they knew. And it was the assessment of the leadership at the CIA and those who were --Q In their first -- when they said they knew in their first draft that they were wrong?MR. CARNEY: I think it’s reflected that we -- that there was not concrete enough information. And the head -- the then director of the CIA, or after he left the directorship, has testified on this, as has -- as did the acting director -- and made clear that the points as they emerged and were disseminated on that Saturday reflected what they felt they knew, what they could say concretely based on their assessments. And that's what -- the intelligence community doesn't deal in facts just picked off a shelf. They have to assess a wide variety of information. In a situation like what happened in Benghazi that was so chaotic, they had to base it on a variety of streams of information, and they made the assessment they did. And even then when being very cautious not to go beyond what they knew, they -- one of the points they made turned out not to be true. And when that became clear, they corrected it and we corrected it. And that's -- in real time, and that's how the public and the press became aware of it.George.Q Back on the IRS, I want to get your reaction to two things Speaker Boehner just -- he said that this “echoes some of the most shameful abuses of government power in 20th century American history. And then he asked if other federal agencies use government powers to attack Americans for partisan reasons. He seems to be likening this White House to the Nixon White House.MR. CARNEY: Well, there’s so much I could say about that.Q Please.MR. CARNEY: But all I will say is that this is a matter of concern and needs to be thoroughly investigated. As I understand it, it is being investigated by the Inspector General that is responsible for the IRS, which is an independent enforcement agency. And the activity, as described, is inappropriate. And that’s the view of this White House, and it should be thoroughly investigated and acted on. Q Jay?MR. CARNEY: I’ll do one more. Voice of America, because -- yes. Q Back to Syria. In this interview with NBC, with Ann Curry, Prime Minister Erdogan said -- just came right out and said chemical weapons were used, mentioned the number of shells used -- I think it was 200 shells -- that it was based on intelligence and interviews with people who have come across the border. I mean, do they have different intelligence than --MR. CARNEY: Well, we work cooperatively with a number of allies and partners in assessing the situation in Syria on the ground, and specifically with -- in relation to this very important matter, the use of chemical weapons in Syria. What the President has said and what we have said is that we have information that chemical weapons were used, but we do not have a complete picture about how that was used, who was responsible, what the chain of custody was. And we need to build a case, if you will, about that use before we make policy decisions based on it. And I think that’s something that the American people would expect us to do -- to be very deliberate about this, and to rely not just on an intelligence assessment -- interestingly we’ve been talking about intelligence assessments and the fact that they evolve and sometimes in the first instance aren’t accurate -- and we need to build on that. In this case, we believe very strongly that the intelligence work done here has been very solid, but it is not the end of the process; it’s closer to the beginning. And we’re continuing to work with our partners. We’re continuing to press for a United Nations investigation. But we’re not leaving it only to the United Nations. As I’ve said on several occasions, we’re working with our allies and partners, and, importantly, with the Syrian opposition to gather more information and evidence about chemical weapons use in Syria.Q Thanks.MR. CARNEY: Thank you. Q Week ahead?MR. CARNEY: I think we’ll have to provide it. Do I have it here? Oh, yes I do. Okay. Thank you all very much for reminding me -- Jim, as ever. The schedule for the week of May 13th, 2013: On Monday, the President will hold a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Cameron of the United Kingdom at the White House. The Prime Minister’s visit will highlight the fundamental importance of the U.S.-U.K relationship through which, together, we address a broad range of shared global and regional security concerns. Later on Monday, the President will travel to New York City for DNC events and a joint DCCC/DSCC event before returning to the White House in the evening.On Tuesday, the President --Q Are any of those open?MR. CARNEY: I’ll have to get that information. Yes, I believe one of them -- my trusted deputy says one is open. On Tuesday, the President will attend meetings at the White House. On Wednesday, the President will deliver remarks at the National Peace Officers Memorial Service, an annual ceremony honoring law enforcement who were killed in the line of duty in the previous year.On Thursday, the President will welcome Prime Minister Erdogan of Turkey to the White House for meetings and a working dinner. The Prime Minister’s visit underscores the close friendship between the United States and Turkey and the strategic importance we place on broadening and deepening our relationship moving forward.On Friday, the President will travel to Baltimore, Maryland in his second Middle-Class Jobs and Opportunity tour event. More details regarding the President’s travel to Baltimore will be forthcoming.Q Do you expect two-by-twos or one-by-ones either with Cameron or with --MR. CARNEY: I don’t have the answer to that. We’ll get back to you when we have more details. Thank you all very much. Q Have a nice weekend.MR. CARNEY: You, too."		1

(Applause.) Si se puede.AUDIENCE: Si se puede! Si se puede! Si se puede!PRESIDENT OBAMA: Thank you. Thank you so much. Please, everybody have a seat. Thank you for the wonderful introduction, David. And thank you for the great work that you are doing each and every day. And I appreciate such a warm welcome. Some of you I've gotten a chance to know; many of you I'm meeting for the first time. But the spirit of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the desire to create jobs and provide opportunity to people who sometimes have been left out -- that's exactly what this administration is about. That's the essence of the American Dream. And so I'm very proud to have a chance to speak with all of you.You know, every so often, throughout our history, a generation of Americans bears the responsibility of seeing this country through difficult times and protecting the dream of its founding for posterity. This is a responsibility that's fallen to our generation. Meeting it will require steering our nation's economy through a crisis unlike anything that we have seen in our time.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIn the short term, that means jump-starting job creation and restarting lending, and restoring confidence in our markets and our financial system. But it also means taking steps that not only advance our recovery, but lay the foundation for lasting, shared prosperity.Continue reading the main storyI know there's some who believe we can only handle one challenge at a time. And they forget that Lincoln helped lay down the transcontinental railroad and passed the Homestead Act and created the National Academy of Sciences in the midst of civil war. Likewise, President Roosevelt didn't have the luxury of choosing between ending a depression and fighting a war; he had to do both. President Kennedy didn't have the luxury of choosing between civil rights and sending us to the moon. And we don't have the luxury of choosing between getting our economy moving now and rebuilding it over the long term.America will not remain true to its highest ideals -- and America's place as a global economic leader will be put at risk -- unless we not only bring down the crushing cost of health care and transform the way we use energy, but also if we do -- if we don't do a far better job than we've been doing of educating our sons and daughters; unless we give them the knowledge and skills they need in this new and changing world.For we know that economic progress and educational achievement have always gone hand in hand in America. The land-grant colleges and public high schools transformed the economy of an industrializing nation. The GI Bill generated a middle class that made America's economy unrivaled in the 20th century. Investments in math and science under President Eisenhower gave new opportunities to young scientists and engineers all across the country. It made possible somebody like a Sergei Brin to attend graduate school and found an upstart company called Google that would forever change our world.The source of America's prosperity has never been merely how ably we accumulate wealth, but how well we educate our people. This has never been more true than it is today. In a 21st-century world where jobs can be shipped wherever there's an Internet connection, where a child born in Dallas is now competing with a child in New Delhi, where your best job qualification is not what you do, but what you know -- education is no longer just a pathway to opportunity and success, it's a prerequisite for success.That's why workers without a four-year degree have borne the brunt of recent layoffs, Latinos most of all. That's why, of the 30 fastest growing occupations in America, half require a Bachelor's degree or more. By 2016, four out of every 10 new jobs will require at least some advanced education or training.So let there be no doubt: The future belongs to the nation that best educates its citizens -- and my fellow Americans, we have everything we need to be that nation. We have the best universities, the most renowned scholars. We have innovative principals and passionate teachers and gifted students, and we have parents whose only priority is their child's education. We have a legacy of excellence, and an unwavering belief that our children should climb higher than we did.And yet, despite resources that are unmatched anywhere in the world, we've let our grades slip, our schools crumble, our teacher quality fall short, and other nations outpace us. Let me give you a few statistics. In 8th grade math, we've fallen to 9th place. Singapore's middle-schoolers outperform ours three to one. Just a third of our 13- and 14-year-olds can read as well as they should. And year after year, a stubborn gap persists between how well white students are doing compared to their African American and Latino classmates. The relative decline of American education is untenable for our economy, it's unsustainable for our democracy, it's unacceptable for our children -- and we can't afford to let it continue.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyWhat's at stake is nothing less than the American Dream. It's what drew my father and so many of your fathers and mothers to our shores in pursuit of an education. It's what led Linda Brown and Gonzalo and Felicitas Mendez to bear the standard of all who were attending separate and unequal schools. It's what has led generations of Americans to take on that extra job, to sacrifice the small pleasures, to scrimp and save wherever they can, in hopes of putting away enough, just enough, to give their child the education that they never had. It's that most American of ideas, that with the right education, a child of any race, any faith, any station, can overcome whatever barriers stand in their way and fulfill their God-given potential. (Applause.)Of course, we've heard all this year after year after year after year -- and far too little has changed. Certainly it hasn't changed in too many overcrowded Latino schools; it hasn't changed in too many inner-city schools that are seeing dropout rates of over 50 percent. It's not changing not because we're lacking sound ideas or sensible plans -- in pockets of excellence across this country, we're seeing what children from all walks of life can and will achieve when we set high standards, have high expectations, when we do a good job of preparing them. Instead, it's because politics and ideology have too often trumped our progress that we're in the situation that we're in.For decades, Washington has been trapped in the same stale debates that have paralyzed progress and perpetuated our educational decline. Too many supporters of my party have resisted the idea of rewarding excellence in teaching with extra pay, even though we know it can make a difference in the classroom. Too many in the Republican Party have opposed new investments in early education, despite compelling evidence of its importance. So what we get here in Washington is the same old debate about it's more money versus more reform, vouchers versus the status quo. There's been partisanship and petty bickering, but little recognition that we need to move beyond the worn fights of the 20th century if we're going to succeed in the 21st century. (Applause.)I think you'd all agree that the time for finger-pointing is over. The time for holding us -- holding ourselves accountable is here. What's required is not simply new investments, but new reforms. It's time to expect more from our students. It's time to start rewarding good teachers, stop making excuses for bad ones. It's time to demand results from government at every level. It's time to prepare every child, everywhere in America, to out-compete any worker, anywhere in the world. (Applause.) It's time to give all Americans a complete and competitive education from the cradle up through a career. We've accepted failure for far too long. Enough is enough. America's entire education system must once more be the envy of the world -- and that's exactly what we intend to do.That's exactly what the budget I'm submitting to Congress has begun to achieve. Now, at a time when we've inherited a trillion-dollar deficit, we will start by doing a little housekeeping, going through our books, cutting wasteful education programs. My outstanding Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, who's here today -- stand up, Arne, so everybody can see you. (Applause.) I'm assuming you also saw my Secretary of Labor, Hilda Solis. (Applause.) But Secretary Duncan will use only one test when deciding what ideas to support with your precious tax dollars: It's not whether an idea is liberal or conservative, but whether it works. And this will help free up resources for the first pillar of reforming our schools -- investing in early childhood initiatives.This isn't just about keeping an eye on our children, it's about educating them. Studies show that children in early childhood education programs are more likely to score higher in reading and math, more likely to graduate from high school and attend college, more likely to hold a job, and more likely to earn more in that job. For every dollar we invest in these programs, we get nearly $10 back in reduced welfare rolls, fewer health care costs, and less crime. That's why the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that I signed into law invests $5 billion in growing Early Head Start and Head Start, expanding access to quality child care for 150,000 more children from working families, and doing more for children with special needs. And that's why we are going to offer 55,000 first-time parents regular visits from trained nurses to help make sure their children are healthy and prepare them for school and for life. (Applause.)Even as we invest in early childhood education, let's raise the bar for early learning programs that are falling short. Now, today, some children are enrolled in excellent programs. Some children are enrolled in mediocre programs. And some are wasting away their most formative years in bad programs. That includes the one-fourth of all children who are Hispanic, and who will drive America's workforce of tomorrow, but who are less likely to have been enrolled in an early childhood education program than anyone else.That's why I'm issuing a challenge to our states: Develop a cutting-edge plan to raise the quality of your early learning programs; show us how you'll work to ensure that children are better prepared for success by the time they enter kindergarten. If you do, we will support you with an Early Learning Challenge Grant that I call on Congress to enact. That's how we will reward quality and incentivize excellence, and make a down payment on the success of the next generation.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySo that's the first pillar of our education reform agenda. The second, we will end what has become a race to the bottom in our schools and instead spur a race to the top by encouraging better standards and assessments. Now, this is an area where we are being outpaced by other nations. It's not that their kids are any smarter than ours -- it's that they are being smarter about how to educate their children. They're spending less time teaching things that don't matter, and more time teaching things that do. They're preparing their students not only for high school or college, but for a career. We are not. Our curriculum for 8th graders is two full years behind top performing countries. That's a prescription for economic decline. And I refuse to accept that America's children cannot rise to this challenge. They can, and they must, and they will meet higher standards in our time. (Applause.)So let's challenge our states -- let's challenge our states to adopt world-class standards that will bring our curriculums to the 21st century. Today's system of 50 different sets of benchmarks for academic success means 4th grade readers in Mississippi are scoring nearly 70 points lower than students in Wyoming -- and they're getting the same grade. Eight of our states are setting their standards so low that their students may end up on par with roughly the bottom 40 percent of the world.That's inexcusable. That's why I'm calling on states that are setting their standards far below where they ought to be to stop low-balling expectations for our kids. The solution to low test scores is not lowering standards -- it's tougher, clearer standards. (Applause.) Standards like those in Massachusetts, where 8th graders are -- (applause) -- we have a Massachusetts contingent here. (Laughter.) In Massachusetts, 8th graders are now tying for first -- first in the whole world in science. Other forward-thinking states are moving in the same direction by coming together as part of a consortium. And more states need to do the same. And I'm calling on our nation's governors and state education chiefs to develop standards and assessments that don't simply measure whether students can fill in a bubble on a test, but whether they possess 21st century skills like problem-solving and critical thinking and entrepreneurship and creativity.That is what we'll help them do later this year -- that what we're going to help them do later this year when we finally make No Child Left Behind live up to its name by ensuring not only that teachers and principals get the funding that they need, but that the money is tied to results. (Applause.) And Arne Duncan will also back up this commitment to higher standards with a fund to invest in innovation in our school districts.Of course, raising standards alone will not make much of a difference unless we provide teachers and principals with the information they need to make sure students are prepared to meet those standards. And far too few states have data systems like the one in Florida that keep track of a student's education from childhood through college. And far too few districts are emulating the example of Houston and Long Beach, and using data to track how much progress a student is making and where that student is struggling. That's a resource that can help us improve student achievement, and tell us which students had which teachers so we can assess what's working and what's not. That's why we're making a major investment in this area that we will cultivate a new culture of accountability in America's schools.Now, to complete our race to the top requires the third pillar of reform -- recruiting, preparing, and rewarding outstanding teachers. From the moment students enter a school, the most important factor in their success is not the color of their skin or the income of their parents, it's the person standing at the front of the classroom. That's why our Recovery Act will ensure that hundreds of thousands of teachers and school personnel are not laid off -- because those Americans are not only doing jobs they can't afford to lose, they're rendering a service our nation cannot afford to lose, either. (Applause.)America's future depends on its teachers. And so today, I'm calling on a new generation of Americans to step forward and serve our country in our classrooms. If you want to make a difference in the life of our nation, if you want to make the most of your talents and dedication, if you want to make your mark with a legacy that will endure -- then join the teaching profession. America needs you. We need you in our suburbs. We need you in our small towns. We especially need you in our inner cities. We need you in classrooms all across our country.Newsletter Sign UpPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

That's why we're taking steps to prepare teachers for their difficult responsibilities, and encourage them to stay in the profession. That's why we're creating new pathways to teaching and new incentives to bring teachers to schools where they're needed most. That's why we support offering extra pay to Americans who teach math and science to end a teacher shortage in those subjects. It's why we're building on the promising work being done in places like South Carolina's Teachers Advancement Program, and making an unprecedented commitment to ensure that anyone entrusted with educating our children is doing the job as well as it can be done.Now, here's what that commitment means: It means treating teachers like the professionals they are while also holding them more accountable -– in up to 150 more school districts. New teachers will be mentored by experienced ones. Good teachers will be rewarded with more money for improved student achievement, and asked to accept more responsibilities for lifting up their schools. Teachers throughout a school will benefit from guidance and support to help them improve.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAnd just as we've given our teachers all the support they need to be successful, we need to make sure our students have the teacher they need to be successful. And that means states and school districts taking steps to move bad teachers out of the classroom. But let me be clear -- (applause.) Let me be clear -- the overwhelming number of teachers are doing an outstanding job under difficult circumstances. My sister is a teacher, so I know how tough teaching can be. But let me be clear: If a teacher is given a chance or two chances or three chances but still does not improve, there's no excuse for that person to continue teaching. I reject a system that rewards failure and protects a person from its consequences. The stakes are too high. We can afford nothing but the best when it comes to our children's teachers and the schools where they teach. (Applause.)Now, that leads me to the fourth part of America's education strategy –- promoting innovation and excellence in America's schools. One of the places where much of that innovation occurs is in our most effective charter schools. And these are public schools founded by parents, teachers, and civic or community organizations with broad leeway to innovate -– schools I supported as a state legislator and a United States senator.But right now, there are many caps on how many charter schools are allowed in some states, no matter how well they're preparing our students. That isn't good for our children, our economy, or our country. Of course, any expansion of charter schools must not result in the spread of mediocrity, but in the advancement of excellence. And that will require states adopting both a rigorous selection and review process to ensure that a charter school's autonomy is coupled with greater accountability –- as well as a strategy, like the one in Chicago, to close charter schools that are not working. Provided this greater accountability, I call on states to reform their charter rules, and lift caps on the number of allowable charter schools, wherever such caps are in place.Now, even as we foster innovation in where our children are learning, let's also foster innovation in when our children are learning. We can no longer afford an academic calendar designed for when America was a nation of farmers who needed their children at home plowing the land at the end of each day. That calendar may have once made sense, but today it puts us at a competitive disadvantage. Our children -- listen to this -- our children spend over a month less in school than children in South Korea -- every year. That's no way to prepare them for a 21st century economy. That's why I'm calling for us not only to expand effective after-school programs, but to rethink the school day to incorporate more time -– whether during the summer or through expanded-day programs for children who need it. (Applause.)Now, I know longer school days and school years are not wildly popular ideas. (Laughter.) Not with Malia and Sasha -- (laughter) -- not in my family, and probably not in yours. But the challenges of a new century demand more time in the classroom. If they can do that in South Korea, we can do it right here in the United States of America.Of course, no matter how innovative our schools or how effective our teachers, America cannot succeed unless our students take responsibility for their own education. That means showing up for school on time, paying attention in class, seeking out extra tutoring if it's needed, staying out of trouble. To any student who's watching, I say this: Don't even think about dropping out of school. Don't even think about it. (Applause.)As I said a couple of weeks ago, dropping out is quitting on yourself, it's quitting on your country, and it's not an option -- not anymore. Not when our high school dropout rate has tripled in the past 30 years. Not when high school dropouts earn about half as much as college graduates. Not when Latino students are dropping out faster than just about anyone else. It's time for all of us, no matter what our backgrounds, to come together and solve this epidemic.Stemming the tide of dropouts will require turning around our low-performing schools. Just 2,000 high schools in cities like Detroit and Los Angeles and Philadelphia produce over 50 percent of America's dropouts. And yet there are too few proven strategies to transform these schools. And there are too few partners to get the job done.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySo today, I'm issuing a challenge to educators and lawmakers, parents and teachers alike: Let us all make turning around our schools our collective responsibility as Americans. And that will require new investments in innovative ideas -- that's why my budget invests in developing new strategies to make sure at-risk students don't give up on their education; new efforts to give dropouts who want to return to school the help they need to graduate; and new ways to put those young men and women who have left school back on a pathway to graduation.Now, the fifth part of America's education strategy is providing every American with a quality higher education -– whether it's college or technical training. Never has a college degree been more important. Never has it been more expensive. And at a time when so many of our families are bearing enormous economic burdens, the rising cost of tuition threatens to shatter dreams. And that's why we will simplify federal college assistance forms so it doesn't take a Ph.D to apply for financial aid. (Applause.)That's why we're already taking steps to make college or technical training affordable. For the first time ever, Pell Grants will not be subject to the politics of the moment or the whim of the market –- they will be a commitment that Congress is required to uphold each and every year. (Applause.) Not only that; because rising costs mean Pell Grants cover less than half as much tuition as they did 30 years ago, we're raising the maximum Pell Grant to $5,550 a year and indexing it above inflation. We're also providing a $2,500-a-year tuition tax credit for students from working families. And we're modernizing and expanding the Perkins Loan Program to make sure schools like UNLV don't get a tenth as many Perkins loans as schools like Harvard.To help pay for all of this, we're putting students ahead of lenders by eliminating wasteful student loan subsidies that cost taxpayers billions each year. All in all, we are making college affordable for 7 million more students with a sweeping investment in our children's futures and America's success. And I call on Congress to join me and the American people by making these investments possible. (Applause.)This is how we will help meet our responsibility as a nation to open the doors of college to every American. But it will also be the responsibility of colleges and universities to control spiraling costs. We can't just keep on putting more money in and universities and colleges not doing their part to hold down tuitions. And it's the responsibility of our students to walk through the doors of opportunity.In just a single generation, America has fallen from 2nd place to 11th place in the portion of students completing college. That is unfortunate, but it's by no means irreversible. With resolve and the right investments, we can retake the lead once more. And that's why, in my address to the nation the other week, I called on Americans to commit to at least one year or more of higher education or career training, with the goal of having the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by the year 2020. And to meet that goal, we are investing $2.5 billion to identify and support innovative initiatives across the country that achieve results in helping students persist and graduate.So let's not stop at education with college. Let's recognize a 21st century reality: Learning doesn't end in our early 20s. Adults of all ages need opportunities to earn new degrees and new skills -- especially in the current economic environment. That means working with all our universities and schools, including community colleges -- a great and undervalued asset -- to prepare workers for good jobs in high-growth industries; and to improve access to job training not only for young people who are just starting their careers, but for older workers who need new skills to change careers. And that's going to be one of the key tasks that Secretary Solis is involved with, is making sure that lifelong learning is a reality and a possibility for more Americans.It's through initiatives like these that we'll see more Americans earn a college degree, or receive advanced training, and pursue a successful career. And that's why I'm calling on Congress to work with me to enact these essential reforms, and to reauthorize the Workforce Reinvestment Act. That's how we will round out a complete and competitive education in the United States of America.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySo here's the bottom line: Yes, we need more money; yes, we need more reform; yes, we need to hold ourselves more accountable for every dollar we spend. But there's one more ingredient I want to talk about. No government policy will make any difference unless we also hold ourselves more accountable as parents -- because government, no matter how wise or efficient, cannot turn off the TV or put away the video games. Teachers, no matter how dedicated or effective, cannot make sure your child leaves for school on time and does their homework when they get back at night. These are things only a parent can do. These are things that our parents must do.I say this not only as a father, but also as a son. When I was a child my mother and I lived overseas, and she didn't have the money to send me to the fancy international school where all the American kids went to school. So what she did was she supplemented my schooling with lessons from a correspondence course. And I can still picture her waking me up at 4:30 a.m., five days a week, to go over some lessons before I went to school. And whenever I'd complain and grumble and find some excuse and say, ""Awww, I'm sleepy,"" she'd patiently repeat to me her most powerful defense. She'd say, ""This is no picnic for me either, buster."" (Laughter and applause.)And when you're a kid you don't think about the sacrifices they're making. She had to work; I just had to go to school. But she'd still wake up every day to make sure I was getting what I needed for my education. And it's because she did this day after day, week after week, because of all the other opportunities and breaks that I got along the way, all the sacrifices that my grandmother and my grandfather made along the way, that I can stand here today as President of the United States. It's because of the sacrifices -- (applause.) See, I want every child in this country to have the same chance that my mother gave me, that my teachers gave me, that my college professors gave me, that America gave me.You know these stories; you've lived them, as well. All of you have a similar story to tell. You know, it's -- I want children like Yvonne Bojorquez to have that chance. Yvonne is a student at Village Academy High School in California. Now, Village Academy is a 21st century school where cutting edge technologies are used in the classroom, where college prep and career training are offered to all who seek it, and where the motto is ""respect, responsibility, and results.""Now, a couple of months ago, Yvonne and her class made a video talking about the impact that our struggling economy was having on their lives. And some of them spoke about their parents being laid off, or their homes facing foreclosure, or their inability to focus on school with everything that was happening at home. And when it was her turn to speak, Yvonne said: ""We've all been affected by this economic crisis. [We] are all college bound students; we're all businessmen, and doctors and lawyers and all this great stuff. And we have all this potential -- but the way things are going, we're not going to be able to [fulfill it].""It was heartbreaking that a girl so full of promise was so full of worry that she and her class titled their video, ""Is anybody listening?"" So, today, there's something I want to say to Yvonne and her class at Village Academy: I am listening. We are listening. America is listening. (Applause.) And we will not rest until your parents can keep your jobs -- we will not rest until your parents can keep their jobs and your families can keep their homes, and you can focus on what you should be focusing on -- your own education; until you can become the businessmen, doctors, and lawyers of tomorrow, until you can reach out and grasp your dreams for the future.For in the end, Yvonne's dream is a dream shared by all Americans. It's the founding promise of our nation: That we can make of our lives what we will; that all things are possible for all people; and that here in America, our best days lie ahead. I believe that. I truly believe if I do my part, and you, the American people, do yours, then we will emerge from this crisis a stronger nation, and pass the dream of our founding on to posterity, ever safer than before. (Applause.)Thank you very much. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you. (Applause.)"		1

James Richard 'Rick' Perry told the New Hampshire Sunday News.'But am I going to say that if you don't believe this particular way, you're wrong?'Far be it from me,' he said. 'The idea that I have an idea about who's going to go to heaven and who's not, I don't. That is way above my capability.'Perry, who has been governor since George W. Bush resigned to become President in 2000 and was elected three times to full terms - unprecedented in Texas history - has been the hot 'non-candidate' for about the past month.While not polled in New Hampshire yet, he polled within a few percentage points of front-runner Mitt Romney nationally last week.In a telephone interview, Perry, who chairs the Republican Governors Association, described himself as 'a full-throated unapologetic fiscal conservative' and 'an unapologetic social conservative' who is 'pro-life' and 'pro-traditional marriage.'But while Texas has written into its constitution that marriage is defined as being between one man and one woman, he said New York's recent decision to implement same-sex marriage 'is New York's prerogative.'Perry said that if he runs, he would 'absolutely' engage in the person-to-person type of campaign Granite Staters are accustomed to and that he gained experience as a candidate for the Texas Legislature and state agriculture commissioner.'I love the give and take and the personal engagement,' he said.Perry in mid-June signed a $172 billion two-year budget that spends $15 billion less than was spent in the prior budget cycle. It was reportedly the first two-year state budget in 40 years that cut spending.The Fort Worth Star-Telegram recently reported that while Perry has said predecessor Bush was 'never a fiscal conservative,' prior to the new budget, Texas budgets had grown faster during the Perry years than during the Bush years.Perry said that with growth in population and jobs, 'you bet you're going to spend more money. The more important way to look at this is whether we spent our money efficiently.'He said Texas 'has, I believe, the fourth-lowest debt per capita of any state in the nation, and we are the lowest of any of the big states.Since the recession officially ended in June 2009, Texas reportedly added nearly 300,000 jobs, while losing 45,500.Perry said the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas has estimated that Texas accounted for between 37 percent and 48 percent of all the jobs created in the country between April 2009 and April 2011.On the key issue of immigration, Perry said the federal government has been 'an abject failure' at securing the nation's borders, forcing Texas to budget $152 million to do Washington's job.'It is very dangerous for American citizens to have a President who turns a blind eye to what's going on on the border,' he said.In 2001, Perry signed into law the first state 'DREAM Act,' which allows children of illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition at state universities as long as they graduated from a Texas high school and are working toward attaining citizenship.Although criticized for it by some conservatives and some elements of the Tea Party, Perry stands by it, while opposing such a law on the federal level.'To punish these young Texans for their parents' actions is not what America has always been about,' he said.		1

I want to thank George and Dany specifically, and I’d also like to welcome members of the diplomatic corps and our representatives from embassies. I told you this at the State Department just last month: We really value your partnership. I want to thank Senator Perdue and Senator Shaheen. I am truly honored by your words but also by your partnership, which I think sends the important signal to all of us about what we can do.Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and David Perdue (R-GA) and USAID Administrator Gayle Smith deliver remarks on USAID's…www.c-span.orgI also see in this room a lot of faces who’ve worked for USAID for many, many years. Many legends, many people who built the foundation of the Agency I’m proud to serve today. I just want to say “thank you” to you, and I hope I can live up to your hard work and everything you’ve done.I think the senators here today represent something that is critical to our success, and that’s the incredible bipartisan — in fact, I think it’s almost nonpartisan — support that development now enjoys. I’ve had a lot of meetings with members of Congress since I was nominated, and I will tell you, in no single meeting did I need to make the case that development was important or that USAID is important. That’s a big change, and that’s a big deal.And turns out, with bipartisanship in the mix, we can get a lot done. I remember when I first started in this administration, and there on day one were PEPFAR , the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the President’s Malaria Initiative , all good ideas realized by President Bush. It never crossed President Obama’s mind to do anything but build on the progress that PEPFAR, MCC and PMI had achieved.And today, PEPFAR is supporting life-saving treatment for 9.5 million people, and has provided 68 million people with testing and counseling. An AIDS-free generation is a real possibility for the first time.And that’s because a Republican president had the vision and courage to invest billions to fight HIV/AIDS, and a Democratic president was smart enough to scale success when he saw it. That’s because two parties and two branches united around the simple idea that the United States could — and should — be the country to lead the fight against an epidemic threatening every country on earth.Next year, a new administration will pick up and run with the PEPFAR ball, and future leaders will keep going until we live in an AIDS-free world. And that’s the way it should be.And PEPFAR is just one of many great examples. The senator mentioned Power Africa . Last week, I was able to co-host a reception to celebrate the Electrify Africa Act , which was passed by Congress and signed into law by the president last month. There, senators and representatives from both parties and members of President Obama’s administration were united in a simple message: We can change people’s lives when we work together.Because of their efforts — and the efforts of partners from African governments, NGOs and the private sector — the work of Power Africa can continue from administration to administration until the lights are on at every home, business and school in sub-Saharan Africa. As the senators suggested, that’s the way Washington should work.We have the opportunity now to go for a triple (that’s a big thing for me, I’m not good with sports metaphors) with the Global Food Security Act. If passed, when passed, the Act will solidify the incredible progress made by Feed the Future and position the U.S. for continued leadership in the global fight to end hunger and malnutrition. And it will mean that we and our partners can build on the hard-won development gains, ranging from a 33 percent drop in child stunting in Ghana to a poverty reduction of 16 percent in targeted areas of Bangladesh.So the fact is that when we work together, we’re a powerful force for change. That’s why I’m very glad to have all of you by my side as we work to lock in what we’ve accomplished and to meet the challenges that are ahead of us. And I am enormously proud to lead USAID, and very confident about what we can achieve together. So let me thank you again for all of you being here.Now USAID, as it should be, is an ever-evolving institution. I think for too long it’s been viewed as the U.S. Agency for Foreign Assistance. USAID has long since abandoned the notion that the solution to development is assistance alone.Trust me, assistance is important — I am cramming for my first ever budget hearings and I will make a very strong case — but we’ve also learned that how many dollars we spend is neither the exclusive measure of our commitment nor the means by which we measure success.Part of that is because we’ve adjusted to a new landscape. When USAID was founded more than 50 years ago, donor governments were responsible for nearly three quarters of all finance flowing to the developing world. Now we account for less than 10 percent.So USAID is acting on the fact that it takes multiple streams of capital to finance and sustain development, and that we can make much more of our assistance dollars, as the senator has said. We’re making smarter investments with our assistance; leveraging private capital to scale our impact; and supporting governments, small businesses and entrepreneurs to mobilize domestic resources.And the results are nothing to scoff at — thank you, Senator, for your comments. USAID and the other agencies driving Power Africa have mobilized $43 billion, the bulk of which is private capital. In Latin America, we’ve leveraged five dollars for every one dollar invested.We’ve helped entrepreneurs in Asia secure financing for clean energy projects, and partnered with major corporations like Coca-Cola to improve access to safe drinking water and distribute critical medical supplies.Our challenges going forward, I think, are scale and sustainability. We need to help economies become less dependent on aid by driving steady flows of domestic and private capital. And we need to craft what I would call “systemic” public-private partnerships that achieve impact across supply chains, delivering results for development and changing business models for the better.The USAID that I lead is also acting on the fact that development is not just an aspiration, but it’s also a discipline. I’m very proud to see that since adopting a new evaluation policy in 2011, USAID has averaged 200 external evaluations a year, and staff and partners are using these to adjust projects and inform future design.We’re doing more to measure impact, even in areas like democracy, rights and governance where impact is harder to measure than, for example, in maternal-child health. The Agency is now creating the feedback loop needed to ensure that what we learn is built into everything we do.Our challenge going forward is to institutionalize this practice, including by strengthening our Bureau for Policy, Planning and Learning , to ensure that we can drive with evidence, make mid-course corrections, scale what works and, importantly, be fully transparent and accountable.USAID is also acting on the fact that local ownership matters. Since 2010, USAID has doubled the percentage of our funding obligated through local governments, civil society partners and local businesses.Our gains in ending preventable child and maternal deaths, improving reading skills, and building stronger democratic institutions have derived in no small part from the leadership of communities and countries.The success of Feed the Future has much to do with the fact that African leaders acted on their own to call for an increase in spending on agriculture and that every country should have its own food security plan.USAID is acting on the fact that we can achieve more when we join forces with others, including many of you in this room. That’s why we partner across the U.S government with agencies from the Department of Agriculture to the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to NASA. That’s why we’ve revitalized relationships with great institutions of higher learning, here in the U.S. and abroad.We’ve strengthened relationships with communities of faith, and engagement with the private sector is now fully embedded in the way we do business. Our challenge going forward is to marshal these partnerships not just for good but also for the scale needed to keep pace with demand.We’re acting on the fact that development solutions are manifold. I think many of you know that for decades this field has been characterized by the flavor of the month phenomenon — and depending on who you ask, and I’ve been at this for a long time, so I’ve been through all of these — the one really critical key to development has at different times been rural agriculture, good governance, infrastructure, human capital, the enabling environment, democratic systems, gender equity or innovation.The fact of the matter is that development requires all of these and more. So our challenge is not only to integrate these but we also have the opportunity to integrate our newest force multiplier, the Global Development Lab , so that it can spur and integrate innovation across and beyond the Agency.Finally, and this is a new and I think extraordinarily positive development, USAID is acting on the fact that our role as a development agency is also to bring analysis, solutions and expertise to the mix when it comes to seizing the opportunities and tackling the challenges that confront our government every day and in every corner of the world.That means using our early warning systems to enable the U.S. to respond early to crises, sharing our analyses of state fragility and long experience with transitions to help shape effective policies, and garnering decades of experience in individual countries to help inform our next steps. Our challenge now is to build the systems to ensure USAID’s extraordinary foundation of knowledge is brought to the policy table with rigor and with regularity.Even as I work with the men and women of USAID, and I want to say it’s an absolute privilege to do so, I’ve also got an eye to the challenges we face as a broader community. I’ve been in this field for over 35 years now, which means that Senator Perdue actually can’t be my father because he’s really not that old, but I honestly can’t remember a moment as pivotal as the one that we face now.I think everyone in the room knows that this is a moment of extraordinary progress. Over the last 30 years, extreme poverty has been cut in half. Boys and girls are enrolling in primary school at nearly equal rates, and there are half as many children out of school today as there were 15 years ago.The number of children who die from preventable deaths has been cut in half since 1990. Every continent has seen substantial gains, with individual incomes growing by more than a third in every region of the developing world.And it’s also a moment of global consensus. In the last 12 months, the world has agreed to the new Sustainable Development Goals ; a policy framework for financing development with assistance, private capital and domestic resources; and a plan to curb climate change.But flowing against all of this positive momentum are what President Obama has called the “dangerous currents [that] risk pulling us back into a darker, more disordered world.” You can see these currents at work around the world.In the volatility of world commodity prices and shifts that knock economies off balance and plunge families back into poverty. In the sharp-edged conflicts that tear regions apart and are spawning record waves of refugees and displacement. In the willful abuse of human rights, denial of humanitarian access, and closing of space for civil society. In the rise and expansion of predatory terrorist networks across vast regions. In the ravages of the weather or the tiny mosquito bite that becomes a global health emergency almost overnight.That’s what we’re up against. As a global community, we have to answer volatility with stability, injustice with rights, despair with opportunity and conflict with peace. Even with all the gains we’ve seen, that’s no easy task. And when you step back to see the full picture, it’s almost as if the good and the bad, the signs of progress and the dangerous trends, are in a dead heat, with one balanced against the other.Now our work at this moment is made easier because there’s a global and national consensus that development matters. You just heard it from our Senate leaders. Six years ago when he signed the first-ever Presidential Policy Directive on Global Development , President Obama committed us to “making sure that the United States will be a global leader in international development in the 21st Century.”The steps we’re taking at USAID are helping our nation live up to the president’s pledge. And going forward, as the latest National Security Strategy affirms, the United States will continue to lead with all the instruments of American power: defense, diplomacy and development.But even with a commitment to strong U.S. leadership, there are some challenges we can’t tackle alone. To conquer the dangerous currents, there are questions we have to answer with one voice, the global community committing together to a better world. And I’d like to pose three.The first is: Whether we respond to the urgency of now, are we bold enough to invest now to manage a future of rapid and often tumultuous change?This is a time when the humanitarian need across the globe is as great as I can remember. And every time a disaster hits, the world is there to respond — with food, with medicine, even with the tools to rebuild. We’re good at it, and nobody is better at it than the United States.But over the last seven years, USAID has deployed 23 disaster assistance response, or DART, teams and responded to an average of 60 emergencies per year. No matter the crisis — Syria or the Sahel, earthquakes or Ebola — USAID is there to save lives and meet people’s needs on the ground.But many of these crises are chronic, complex and severe. They require more time, more money and more people to respond. This year’s El Niño, for example, is unfolding on a global scale and threatening the livelihoods of people from Latin America to Africa.And in too many cases, like in South Sudan, governments make an effective response even harder because those charged to lead have turned their backs on the people who need them most.We are today feeding more than 1 million people in South Sudan each month and responding to El Niño on four continents, just as we will continue to respond wherever there is need. The American people expect it, and respond themselves with generosity.But even as we respond, we need to make sure that the urgent does not crowd out the important. We need to make long-term, steady investments to prevent the crises that shatter the lives of millions and cost the taxpayers billions.Investing now means staying the course for years to come on the Global Health Security Agenda — thankfully propelled in this initial phase by Congressional approval of our emergency Ebola request last year — so that every country in the world has the capacity to prevent, detect and respond to diseases like MERS, Ebola and now Zika.It means scaling dramatically some of the most effective but perhaps least visible work USAID is doing to foster resilience — or the capacity of people, communities and countries to withstand external shocks.It means building the institutions needed to sustain democracy and governance by taking a page from what the world has done to strengthen global public health, and marshaling the resources and political buy-in that can generate scale, build the body of evidence, and model success.We must also maintain a steady drumbeat to uphold the basic norms without which we cannot succeed — against the corruption that undermines progress and saps citizens’ faith in their governments; for the rights of all citizens and civil society; and for the obligations of governments to prevent discrimination — against women, against people of faith, against minorities, against the LGBT community, and against the disabled or any other person.The second question we have to answer is whether we have the strategic patience to support the transitions before us until they succeed?USAID and our partners work in some of the toughest environments you can imagine, as do many of you. Brand new countries working to build institutions of governance from nothing. Countries reeling from decades of civil war. Countries consumed by insecurity and instability.Our men and women risk everything — sometimes paying the ultimate sacrifice — as they and our partners strive to plant the seeds of dignity and opportunity. That would be incredibly difficult under any circumstance. But try it with limited funding, too few donors, security constraints and ever-growing expectations, and most people would simply give up.But our people don’t, and we owe them our thanks and a commitment to pursue change that lasts at least as long as these transitions take. Progress cannot be measured in four- or eight-year increments. That’s not how development works.It’s not how transitions work, either. The World Bank found in a recent study that even the fastest transformers took 20 years to achieve functioning government systems, and another seven to bring corruption under control. And these are countries with a solid head start — they began with conditions that helped expedite the process, like a history of working government or a relatively literate populace.Given all of the enormous difficulties, there are some who would say the hard work isn’t worth it. But tell that to President Santos of Colombia, which 15 years ago was on the brink of being declared a failed state.But today, he says the Colombian people “see the future with hope.” And that’s because Colombia, with our robust and steady support, did the hard work to tackle the structural conditions allowing drug cartels to run rampant, climb out of a recession, and to end a decades-long war. We were with them every step of the way. And we’ll be with them when the next phase of the transition can begin.Because we know that sustained effort pays off. Ask the Kosovar woman who worked as a USAID Foreign Service National for more than 15 years, serving her country and ours by helping Kosovo write a constitution and build institutions where there were none less than a decade ago. Today, she sits as a judge on her country’s highest constitutional court.Now consider what it will take, when the time comes, in Syria.Change takes time and hard work. It also takes strategic patience and managing expectations, of administrations, of the Congress and of the media. But it’s worth it — and if we know anything, it’s that the costs of impatience are far too great.The last question I think we all have to answer is this: Are we willing to adapt our systems and our institutions to the world we face?If there’s one thing we know we need, it’s agility. Even as we persist through long transitions and pursue a patient path to lasting progress, we must move swiftly to seize opportunities when they arise, whether to support elections in Sri Lanka and Burma or to set up non-formal education centers for Nigerian families displaced by Boko Haram. That means we need to adapt our systems and institutions for a rapidly changing world.This year, we have at least two opportunities to do just that. First, in May, the United States will participate in the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul. As we work together to meet the needs of millions, we also have the opportunity to strike a new grand bargain that leverages more efficient donor action to spur parallel changes in UN agencies so that collectively we are more strategic, more effective, more efficient, and more nimble.We will also have the opportunity and the obligation to grapple head on with the sharp decline in adherence to basic humanitarian doctrine, and the fact that the greatest impediment to reaching people in need in chronic conflicts today is the willful denial of humanitarian access by all parties.Second, in September, President Obama will host a summit on refugees on the margins of the UN General Assembly. There’s no question that the global refugee crisis is putting our systems and host countries to the test. It is also putting people to the test.Most refugees face futures without education, or jobs, or the hope of normalcy — often for a generation. Unfortunately, the debate the global refugee crisis has sparked has been more about rhetoric, some of it hateful, than about solutions.The president’s summit provides an opportunity to change that by challenging the world to commit to solutions — to sustained humanitarian funding, to resettlement and other legal channels, and to enabling refugees to secure the protection, education and livelihoods they need for their families.Finally, let me come back to USAID. I am proud of where the Agency is today, and I know that what the United States needs, regardless of administration or party, is an effective, agile, and impactful USAID, one that’s ready to handle whatever the future brings.So I end where I began and leave you with the hope — perhaps more easily offered by an administrator near the beginning but also the end of her term — that we can strike our own grand bargain.We have shown that development is an endeavor backed by bipartisan commitment; we have shown that USAID can deliver. I have told members of Congress with whom I have met that I will be transparent and accountable — a pledge made easier by the hard work and rigor that the men and women of USAID bring to work every day. I have also said that I will not be shy about coming to Congress to ask for what we need.Last month, I met with the former USAID administrators, who span four administrations and both political parties, and each of whom maintains the same fierce love for and commitment to the Agency they held while in office.I’m looking at one of them as I say I know they would agree when I say that all of us — across party lines and from one administration to the next — must pledge to keep building a stronger USAID, one that delivers accountability and impact and earns flexibility in exchange. An Agency with the agility and support it needs. The Agency we need and the world deserves.If we meet these three challenges, if we make the choice to invest in the future and not just the right now, we can usher in a new era of progress.If we persist through the inevitable setbacks and shocks of a country’s transformation, in years to come we will have capable and responsible partners. If we come together as a global community to say we can do this better and do it, we’ll have systems worthy of our complex and changing world.The men and women of USAID, with whom I’m proud to serve, are ready to lead. And we need all of you by our side. Thank you very much.		1

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Thanks.Happening now, we're standing by for Barack Obama live. He's about to face reporters, and likely questions about helping Hillary Clinton pay off her enormous campaign debt.Plus, a top gun in the McCain campaign. Senator Lindsey Graham. He'll give us immediate reaction. He is standing by live.Also this hour, McCain's new declaration of independence. He's setting a formal deadline for America to kick its addiction to foreign oil.And Democrat Donna Brazile and Republican Bill Bennett, they are trading lists. They will share their top worries about the presidential candidate from the other party. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.In Chicago right now, Senator Barack Obama's getting ready to answer reporters' questions. We're set to go there live once he starts doing that. He's also gearing up for his big unity tour with Hillary Clinton. That's on Friday. And there are a lot of questions about their political and financial relationship.Let's get some answers from our senior political correspondent, Candy Crowley. She is here. I take it you were just listening in on a conference call with some top strategists for the Obama campaign.What are they saying about the Clintons?CANDY CROWLEY, CNN SR. POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: The campaign chairman here in Washington saying, don't look for bill Clinton to show up in Unity, New Hampshire. It would be inappropriate. That they fully expect that both Clintons will help out in the campaign. Also noting that the Clintons, of course, will be helping Democratic candidates in general. That's the thing about this Obama campaign at this point, Wolf, is that they are not only expanding the playing field in terms of states and where they're going to play and where they are going to put up ads.They are also expanding the playing field in that they may go to states simply to bulk up the Senate and the House. And it's something that both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama mentioned yesterday when they were talking about each other. They both mentioned the need to go out and help Senate candidates. Because, of course, what they would like to do is get well beyond the 51-vote marker that they have now, or almost half.BLITZER: And there is Joe Lieberman, independent Democrat, as he likes to call himself from Connecticut. We're standing by here to hear from Senator Barack Obama, he's about to start answering reporters' questions out in Chicago. Based on what you're hearing from your sources, and we know you have terrific sources. How committed are Hillary Clinton's fund-raisers to helping Senator Obama?CROWLEY: The bulk of Clinton fund-raisers that I talked to say, yes, we're on board, with varying degrees of enthusiasm. But there is what one fund-raiser who is onboard with the Obama campaign now says, the hard core group. Mostly women fund-raisers. Some of them big names in fund-raising who say, never, not going to do it.These are women, they point out, sort of grew up in the '60s and '70s, the feminist movement where they're sort of -- it was a formative time in their life. They just say there is a group there that is just not onboard, and they think maybe won't come onboard. The bulk of them are having, of course, the big kumbaya fund-raiser meeting on Thursday.BLITZER: Senator McCain is badgering Senator Obama, why doesn't he go visit Iraq, the troops, the commanders. Is there new information we're getting today?CROWLEY: We are, first of all, campaign manager says they will shortly put out the itinerary, part of a codel, which his to say that he will ...BLITZER: Professional delegation.CROWLEY: Right. He will go with other lawmakers to Iraq. We also know in the past couple of months, Obama did in fact get a briefing, intelligence briefing from the Pentagon. They are now trying to arrange another one in advance of his trip to Iraq. And we believe Afghanistan and maybe even other places.BLITZER: All right. We'll watch and Candy stand by, because we're waiting to hear from Senator Obama right now and as soon as he starts answering questions we'll go to Chicago to hear what he has to say.John McCain is declaring a new independence day. The Republican today set a deadline for America to kick its addiction to foreign oil. The year, 2025. Let's go to Dana Bash, she's covering the McCain campaign for us.Is this the sort of a gamble for Senator McCain, Dana?DANA BASH, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, Wolf, it is in a way. But you know what, McCain aides tell me they're convinced voters are desperate for leadership. A call to action, but one with specific proposals to combat high gas prices. Today he vowed to break the power of OPEC and Saudis. The gamble that you're referring to is some of his prescriptions on how to do that.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BASH (voice-over): A campaign pledge on a make-or-break issue for brokers -- energy.SEN. JOHN MCCAIN, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: In a world of hostile and unstable suppliers of oil, this nation will achieve strategic independence by 2025.BASH: A lofty goal aimed at invoking John F. Kennedy ...JOHN F. KENNEDY, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Of landing a man on the moon.BASH: And some Harry Truman for good measure.MCCAIN: Three decades on partisan paralysis on energy security is enough. Since I'm not president, I cannot say the buck stops here. But I will say that it must stop now.BASH: But beyond this snappy sound bite, many of the ways John McCain wants to wane America from oil are controversial. Take nuclear energy.MCCAIN: If I'm elected president, I will set this nation on a course to building 45 new reactors by the year 2030.BASH: That's a promise voters he was speaking to in Nevada are weary of because of congress's plan to store nuclear waste in their state, Yucca Mountain. It's something that McCain acknowledged.MCCAIN: We will need to solve complex problems of storing materials that will always need safeguarding. We will need to do all these things, and do them right.BASH: McCain's speech was a wrap-up of a week-plus of proposals. A $5,000 tax credit for customers who buy alternative fuel cars, a $300 million prize for anyone who invents an alternative car battery. But McCain's goal was as much about tone as it was substance. An attempt to show voters looking for action on high gas prices that he's their candidate, not Barack Obama. Who his campaign is labeling Dr. No.MCCAIN: Opponents of domestic production cling to their position, even as the price of foreign oil has doubled and doubled again.(END VIDEOTAPE)BASH: McCain talks in sharp tones about the kinds of things he knows voters want to hear, that special interests and decades of deadlock in Washington has led to the energy crisis. McCain's problem is that he has been in Congress nearly three decades and voted against some of the projects aimed at promoting alternative sources of energy that he says is crucial now to break America's dependence on foreign oil -- Wolf? BASH: Major differences not only on this issue but a lot of other issues. We're going to be going in-depth over the course of this campaign. Dana Bash reporting.There are 65 active nuclear power sites across the United States right now. Housing 104 reactors. They produce almost 20 percent of the nation's energy. There hasn't been any new construction of reactors launched since the 1970s, in large part because of safety concerns, and high costs.Let's go back to Jack Cafferty for ""The Cafferty File."" Hi, Jack.JACK CAFFERTY, CNN ANCHOR: Wolf, Barack Obama's beginning to widen his lead over John McCain in some of the early polling. A new ""Los Angeles Times"" Bloomberg poll shows Obama ahead by 12 points, 49 to 37 percent in the two-man race. If you add in the third-party candidates Ralph Nader and Bob Barr, Obama's lead actually increases to 15 points. The recent ""Newsweek"" poll shows Obama leading McCain by 15 points. CNN's poll of polls reflects the growing gap as well. Obama is now leading McCain by eight points, which is double the lead Obama had in the average of polls less than two weeks ago.Obama's lead may be due in part to his position on domestic issues. A lot of voters are saying in these polls that he would do a better job than McCain handling health care, taxes and the economy. The nation's number one issue. McCain once said he's not an expert on the economy, he continues to insist the fundamentals of our economy are very strong. McCain is also lagging when it comes to the passion that voters have for their choices.Among those who say they'll vote for McCain, 51 percent say they're not enthusiastic about him. But those who say they'll vote for Obama, 81 percent are enthusiastic. McCain remains the most trusted when it comes to protecting the country from terrorism. But that may not hold up if his advisers, people like Charlie Black, keep saying things like, another terror attack on U.S. soil would help McCain's election chances.Here's the question: What does it mean to you if Barack Obama's opening up a double-digit lead over John McCain in some of the early polls? Go to cnn.com/cafferty file, you can post a comment on my blog -- Wolf?BLITZER: Those two polls, that last ""Newsweek"" poll and now the ""Los Angeles Times"" Bloomberg poll, showed a dramatic advantage for him.CAFFERTY: It does and our poll of polls, the average of CNN's polls, he's doubled his lead. It's not double digits, but he's gone from four to eight. To the degree those three polls are more or less on the same page. There's a minitrend there, but it's very, very early.BLITZER: You're right. Almost five months to go. Jack, stand by. We'll get back to you. These are some of the stories we're working on right now. We're waiting for Barack Obama's news conference in Chicago. As soon as he prepares to hit the road with Hillary Clinton, we're going to go there live to the news conference. There you see him. There you see some introductions. Once he starts talking, we'll hear what he has to say. See what's on the minds of the reporters.Also, we're going to get reaction, immediate reaction from Senator Lindsey Graham. He's a co-chairman of the McCain campaign.And online right now, some people are finding a creative way to make a buck off the vice presidential speculation.And Bill Bennett and Donna Brazile are drawing up provocative lists on their top three worries about Obama and McCain.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Joining us now, Senator Lindsey Graham, he is a major supporter of his good friend John McCain, national co-chairman of the McCain campaign.Senator, thanks very much for coming.SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, (R) SC: Thank you. I think John can win anyway, but I hope so.BLITZER: We were waiting to hear from Senator Obama. I know you've got to get out there and vote. We're going to be hearing from him momentarily. Let's talk a little bit about what's going on in this campaign right now. Jack Cafferty was just pointing out the latest ""Los Angeles Times"" Bloomberg poll, the latest ""Newsweek"" poll shows a double-digit advantage that Barack Obama is building up right now. We know it's a snapshot. Still a long time to go. I assume that's a source of some concern to you.GRAHAM: Well, I'm not so sure those polls are accurate. I like the CNN and the Gallup poll. I think we're behind in single digits. He's gotten a bump from closing out his primary. I can understand that. But I think it's a very competitive race, single digits, not double digits.BLITZER: How worried are you that Bob Barr, the congressman from Georgia, now running as a libertarian, will take a sizeable number of republican votes in his home state of Georgia where he's relatively well known and could hurt Senator McCain there?GRAHAM: I think that's something we have to watch. You know, Bob is well known in Georgia. But, you know, those that vote for Bob Barr have to understand that you're also voting for the Senator Obama agenda, and we have to make that clear to people, and minimize that, and I think we can.BLITZER: The Obama people think he can be competitive in Georgia, especially if the Democrats get a lot of new voters to register, young people, African Americans, that he could make a run for it in a state like Georgia.GRAHAM: Well, that's my neighbor. Good luck. Go over there, see what happens. Georgia and South Carolina are pretty similar. My money is on Senator McCain in Georgia.BLITZER: Let's talk a little bit about tax cuts. Because there's a huge difference between these two candidates on the issue of tax cuts. Here's what Senator Obama says about Republicans in general, and Senator McCain, that they simply will go forward with all these new tax cuts. And they don't have a way to pay for it. It's only going to increase the national debt and our children and grandchildren will wind up paying for it. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BARACK OBAMA, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Republicans love to say ease tax and spend tax. The truth is, that my tax plan is going to give almost all the benefits to people who are making $150,000 or less. In contrast, John McCain's got a plan where -- that will cost $300 billion.(END VIDEO CLIP)BLITZER: All right. So how is Senator McCain going to, as they say here in Washington, pay for $300 billion in new tax cuts?GRAHAM: Washington will spend less under McCain's administration, so we can give you some of your money back. Controlling spending.BLITZER: But there's -- with all due respect, you aren't going to find $300 billion in waste, are you?GRAHAM: No, no, $35 billion from earmarks, but there are other programs up here that can be reined in including the Department of Defense. We believe the tax cuts, the capital gains cuts and tax cuts and dividend cuts increase revenue to the government. And over time will help us. The key to this is controlling spending and cutting taxes. If you just cut taxes, you don't control spending. You haven't solved the problem. If you increase spending and increase taxes, you'll drive people offshore to other countries. The Obama solution is to increase spending and increase taxes. That will not lead to a vibrant economy.BLITZER: And as you can see, we're standing by to hear from Senator Obama. He's got a news conference coming up. We'll go there shortly. Another major source of -- another major difference is on energy policy, which has been foremost with $4 plus a gallon a gas, $130, $140 a barrel, whatever it is right now. Listen once again to Senator Obama.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: My entire energy plan will produce three times the oil savings that John McCain's ever could. What's more, it will actually decrease our dependence on oil while his will only grow our addiction further.(END VIDEO CLIP)BLITZER: All right. I'll give you a chance to respond to the senator.GRAHAM: I'd love to know how you're going to do that. John will put domestic supply on the table. We can under the McCain administration extract oil in America that's off-limits today. Nuclear power has to replace coal-fired plants if you're serious about climate change. Senator Obama has said no to nuclear power, exploration off the coast, in Colorado, oil shale at the end of the day, his policies make no sense. You won't replace coal powered plants with wind and solar. You have to have nuclear. So at the end of the day it just doesn't add up.BLITZER: You've got beautiful beaches in South Carolina.GRAHAM: We do.BLITZER: Including Myrtle Beach. We were there not that long ago for one of the Democratic debates. Are you comfortable with oil platforms going up off the coast of South Carolina?GRAHAM: If the State of South Carolina agrees it would be OK with me. At $4 a gallon gas, we've got to do something different. Ninety one percent of the oil reserves on federal territory are not subject to being extracted. I think we can off the coast of South Carolina, with the permission of South Carolina, extract oil and gas in a way that will be environmentally sensitive.And the more supply we can generate at home, the less dependent we are on overseeing supplies. You also have to conserve. I want to produce more and i want to use less. I want to do two things, not just one.BLITZER: We heard from Candy Crowley just a little while ago that Senator Obama's getting ready to go over to Iraq, probably Afghanistan.GRAHAM: Good.BLITZER: With a congressional delegation.GRAHAM: Good.BLITZER: I know you and Senator McCain have been there several times.GRAHAM: Yes.BLITZER: You've been urging him to go. So I guess that sort of ends that little issue between these two campaigns.GRAHAM: Good for him. Just go with an open mind, sit down with General Petraeus, talk to the generals, the corporals, meet with the Iraqi government, appreciate how far they've come, how far they have to go. Appreciate the fact that the surge has worked. Political and economic progress has been allowed to go forward because of better security. Just go with an open mind and come back and tell us what you saw. I'm glad he's going.BLITZER: Senator Graham, thanks for coming.GRAHAM: Thank you, Wolf.BLITZER: And ahead a top Senate Democrat joins us in THE SITUATION ROOM. I'll be speaking to Russ Feingold and will ask if Senator Obama is slapping him and John McCain in the face of their signature issue, campaign finance reform.And we're also standing by for a live news conference with Barack Obama. How many homes are selling where you live? You're going to find out if your area is seeing the worst sales and why the nation's largest mortgage lender is partly being blamed for so many foreclosures.And if you made a list of why you like and don't like Barack Obama and John McCain, what would be on it. Donna Brazile and Bill Bennett standing by reveal their lists. That's coming up in our ""Strategy Session.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: We'll go right back to Carol Costello. She's monitoring some other stories incoming into THE SITUATION ROOM right now.And we're also waiting as you know for Barack Obama. We have live feed coming in already. He's in Chicago, he's getting ready to make a statement and to answer reporters' questions. As soon as we start hearing from him, we'll go there. What else is going on?CAROL COSTELLO, CNN ANCHOR: What else is going on, Wolf? Well, California and Illinois say the nation's largest mortgage lender is partly to blame for record home foreclosures. So they're suing. Attorneys general for Countrywide of risking homes they did not fully understand. No response from Countrywide. This comes on the same day that Countrywide stockholders approved its takeover by Bank of America.People trying to sell their homes are, boy, they're doing it in a tough environment. Last month home sales dropped for six times. The government reports that in May sales of new single-family homes were down 2.5 percent. The medium price for a home sold, $231,000. That's down six percent from April. How bad is it? Seems to depend on where you live. The West being the worst. Prices fell 11 percent there in May. The Northeast down eight percent. Home sales actually posted small increases in the Midwest and were flat in the South.An adult who rapes a child may not be executed. That ruling today by a divided U.S. Supreme Court. In a 5-4 decision, the justices said the death penalty should only be given to murders. A Louisiana man who raped his eight-year-old stepdaughter was at the center of the case. He would have been the first rapist in 44 years to be executed for a crime in which the victim was not killed.And Neil Entwistle is found guilty of murdering his wife and baby daughter in Massachusetts. The British national could be sentenced to life in prison without chance of parole. Entwistle claims he's innocent of the 2006 murders. His parents say they will continue to fight to prove his innocence. He will be sentenced tomorrow. The motive for the killing was deeply in debt and dissatisfied with his sex life.BLITZER: Not a good enough reason by far to do what he's now convicted of having done, obviously. We'll watch that story, too. Carol, thanks very much. Horrible, horrible story it is.We're standing by to hear from Senator Barack Obama. He's getting ready to start answering reporters' questions in Chicago. Once he does, we'll go there.Also, do you know who will get your vote for president? Don't be so sure. History shows a lot could happen between now and November. Some people think they can make some easy money by predicting who Barack Obama and John McCain will pick as running mates.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: To our viewers, you're in THE SITUATION ROOM.Happening now, we're waiting for Senator Barack Obama to speak to reporters on his presidential campaign. He's expected to come to the podium at any moment. We'll go there live.Also one environmentalist calls it a mockery of justice. A Supreme Court decision regarding one of the worst environmental disasters in U.S. history, the Exxon Valdez spill. We have the ruling and the reaction.Also North Korea set to blow up part of its main nuclear reactor and give away key information about its nuclear activities. Experts say it means no more or better bombs will be made.And why is Ralph Nader wondering if Barack Obama is trying to quote ""talk white."" And even accusing Senator Obama of not taking strong stands on issues of African Americans.I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.If the presidential election were held today, many of you -- many of you sure know who you would vote for. But the political calendar can drastically change the political calculus, and many of you can certainly change your minds. There are 132 days to go before America votes for a new president. But that offers 132 days for current opinion to turn for or against Barack Obama and John McCain. Let's go to our senior political analyst Bill Schneider. He's joining us now to look at this story. You've covered a lot of campaigns, Bill, together with all of us. How reliable are these polls in June for forecasting what might take place in November?WILLIAM SCHNEIDER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, Wolf, here's the rule. They work, except when they don't work.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)SCHNEIDER (voice-over): Five national polls all taken within the last 10 days show Barack Obama leading John McCain. The average? Obama 48 McCain 40, an eight-point lead. Two of the polls give Obama a double-digit lead.How much can we rely on polls taken four months before the election? We looked at the June Gallup polls in the last 14 presidential elections, going back to 1952. In 10 of those elections, the June polls actually forecast the election results. In 2004, for example, the June Gallup poll had George W. Bush leading John Kerry by one. Bush ended up beating Kerry by three. That's pretty close.What about the four elections the June polls got wrong? We detected a pattern there. Take 1960. In June 1960, John F. Kennedy was 10 points ahead of Richard Nixon. Kennedy ended up winning by less than half-a-percent. Why was 1960 so close? Because President Eisenhower, was very popular, 59 percent job approval. That helped his vice president nearly overtake the Democrat.The most famous exception, when the June polls were way off, was 1988. In June, Michael Dukakis was leading George Bush by 14 points. Bush ended up winning by seven. The conventional wisdom is that Dukakis lost because the Republicans run a tough negative campaign that discredited him.But here's something else to consider. President Reagan had a 51 percent job approval rating. That had a lot to do with carrying his vice president to victory.(END VIDEOTAPE)SCHNEIDER: So, the lesson here is, don't just watch the polls. Also watch the president's job ratings.Now, that is more bad news for McCain, because the latest Gallup/""USA Today"" poll gives President Bush a 28 percent approval rating. That's worse than bad. It's just about the lowest rating ever recorded.So, is there any hope for McCain? Well, maybe. McCain is not the incumbent president, nor is he the incumbent vice president. And 2008 is the first election in 56 years when neither is running. McCain's message has to be, I'm not Bush. Obama's message is, you are too -- Wolf.BLITZER: Those numbers for Bush's approval ratings, they're approaching, what, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter? Who has had the lowest?SCHNEIDER: Harry Truman actually had the lowest back in 1952.BLITZER: Really?SCHNEIDER: But Richard Nixon was down there in the 20s. When the president's job rating is in the 20s, his party usually suffers at the polls. We will see what happens with McCain.BLITZER: Well, you certainly will -- Bill Schneider reporting for us.Online, people are trying to make a profit by predicting who Senator John McCain and Senator Barack Obama will pick as their running mates.Our Internet reporter, Abbi Tatton, is watching this story for us.How are they doing it? What's going on?ABBI TATTON, CNN INTERNET REPORTER: Wolf, there's a little bit of speculating going on online, some of these Web addresses registered two, three years ago. ObamaBayh.com is one example, McCainPawlenty. And cyber-speculators are hoping that they're going to hit the jackpot in the next few weeks, once an announcement is made.I spoke to John Bowman (ph), who is in Ohio. He's got about six of these Web sites. Here's one of them, ObamaHillary.com. He actually put this one on eBay, wanted $5,000 for it. No bidders so far. And now he's using the site to push a unity ticket.And on the other side, here's one of the Web sites owned by TerryGraham.com (ph). This is -- this is McCainRomney.com. He's got a few of these. And he says that he's already got a few advertisers lined up in the event that this is the ticket -- Wolf.BLITZER: So, is it just a given, once the running mate has been selected, they would need a new Web site? Is that just a given?TATTON: No, not necessarily at all. In fact, in July of 2004, a spokesman for the Kerry/Edwards campaign said they were quite happy with their Web site, which was JohnKerry.com.However, they had made inquiries about this domain right here, KerryEdwards.com. But Mr. Kerry Edwards of Indianapolis, who actually owned this Web address, says that he wanted a little bit more than money than they were offering.BLITZER: Interesting. There's always some problem out there.All right. You are going to continue to watch this story for us.A new round of alleged members of an al-Qaeda terrorist cell, it's one six the stories we're following right now in the United States and around the globe. Donna Brazile and Bill Bennett, they're standing by to share their top three worries about John McCain and Barack Obama.And he's a top Senate Democrat, and he isn't happy with Barack Obama's stand on domestic spying and campaign fund-raising. We're going to talk about it with Senator Russ Feingold.Also, we're standing by to hear from Senator Obama. He's getting ready to answer reporters' questions at a news conference in Chicago. We're about to go there live as soon as he arrives.Stay with us. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Standing by to go to Chicago, Barack Obama getting ready to meet with reporters. Once he's there, we will be there as well.In the meantime, let's check back with Carol. She's monitoring some other important stories incoming to THE SITUATION ROOM right now.What's going on, Carol?COSTELLO: Well, Wolf, global warming could make things worse in countries already struggling with poverty and other social ills. A U.S. report says climate change could destabilize struggling and poor countries around the world, but that wealthier countries would fare better.The chairman of the National Intelligence Council even tells Congress global warming could cause people in those poor countries to flee and even to turn to terrorism.More than 500 people who allegedly were plotting attacks inside Saudi Arabia are in custody. More than 700 were initially arrested. Today, Saudi officials announced details of their largest anti-terror sweep. The suspects are members of a group believed to have ties to al-Qaeda. Officials say Saudi security forces seized weapons, ammunition, money, and documents during the arrests.A powerful Iranian official warns the world, don't mess with us. The powerful speaker of Iran's parliament says the world should not provoke his nation. The speaker says countries that do could pay heavily. The speaker also echoed comments from the United Nations' nuclear watchdog Mohamed ElBaradei. He recently said a strike on Iran would turn the Middle East into a -- quote -- ""ball of fire.""And Queen Elizabeth II has stripped Zimbabwe's leader, Robert Mugabe, of his knighthood -- the highly unusual move meant to show Britain's revulsion of human rights abused by Mugabe's regime. There's been widespread violence in Zimbabwe, but, Wolf, I hear that Obama is speaking. And maybe he will mention Zimbabwe as well, so I will throw it back to you.BLITZER: All right. Let's go to Chicago right now. He's opening with a statement. Then he will take reporters' questions.(JOINED IN PROGRESS)SEN. BARACK OBAMA (D-IL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: But no matter who I have met with, whether it was the business leaders today, or the labor leaders I met with last week, my message has been the same. It's that the American economy is at its strongest when we have a common set of values that it reflects, when we reward not just wealth, but also work and the workers who create it, because what we have relearned in painful fashion over the last few months is that Wall Street can't thrive so long as Main Street is struggling.So, to strengthen our long-term economic competitiveness, a topic that I will be addressing in-depth tomorrow in Pittsburgh, we need to build an economy that lifts up all Americans. If we're serious about making America more competitive in the 21st century, we also have to finally solve our energy crisis.I know that this is something that John McCain talked about in a speech earlier today. And I want to once again repeat that I commend Senator McCain for having done more than some of his party when it comes to climate change.Unfortunately, there remains a real difference between us on energy reform. And I think it's important for the American people to understand that difference.Uh-oh. Time and...OBAMA: I haven't gotten to the funny parts yet, actually.Yes, exactly.Time and time again, when he's had the chance, Senator McCain has opposed real solutions to the energy crisis. When I was reaching across the aisle to build support for a plan to double our fuel efficiency standards, Senator McCain was voting against biofuels, against solar power, against wind power, and against an energy bill that his own campaign co-chairman called the biggest legislative breakthrough we have had since he has been in the Senate.Now, that bill certainly wasn't perfect. It contained irresponsible tax breaks for oil companies that I consistently opposed and that I will repeal as president. But it also represented the largest ever investment in renewable sources of energy. And that's why I supported it.But it's not just that there's a difference between what we have done in the past. It's that there's a big difference between what we're proposing for the future.While I'm glad Senator McCain is talking about energy on the campaign trail, and I do believe that the only way we're going to solve this problem is by bringing the parties together, what Senator McCain has proposed so far is not a serious plan to solve the problem. He wants a gas tax holiday that will save you, the American consumer, at most 30 cents a day for three months. And that's only if the oil companies don't just increase their prices and pocket the savings themselves, which is what they did here in Illinois when we tried the same thing.Senator McCain wants to open up our coastlines to drilling, a proposal that his own top economic adviser admitted won't provide any short-term relief at the pump. It's a proposal that George Bush's administration says will not provide a drop of oil for at least a decade. And by the time the drilling is fully under way, in 20 years, our own Department of Energy says that the effect on gas prices will be -- quote -- ""insignificant.""Just today, we heard from the head of the government office whose mission is to provide an unbiased analysis of energy policy, and he said that the idea won't affect gas prices much.Now, Senator McCain noted the other day that the idea on coastal drilling that he and President Bush have offered polls well. And I acknowledge that. Perhaps that's why Senator McCain changed his position. But what we need right now are not appealing, but meaningless gimmicks, designed to get politicians through the next election, gimmicks that offer no real relief to struggling motorists.What we need now is a serious national commitment to meet our responsibility to our country and the next generation, a serious and sustained commitment to transition our economy from our dependence on oil to clean affordable sources of energy. What we need now is to make America the world leader in the development of these fuels and environmental technology.And that's what I'm offering. I wish I could just make gas prices come down on their own. No president can. What I can do, and what I will do, is push for a second stimulus package that will send out another round of rebate checks to the American people.What I will do as president is tax the record profits of oil companies and use the money to help struggling families pay their energy bills. I will provide a $1,000 tax cut that will go to 95 percent of all workers and their families in this country.I will fully close the loophole that allows corporations to engage in unregulated speculation that artificially drives up the price of oil. That's what we will do in the short term to provide some relief to the American people.Most importantly, though, is what I will do in the long term to solve this crisis. When America wanted to send a man to the moon, we put the full resources of our federal government behind it and spent over $100 billion in today's dollars. Well, I want to make an even bigger commitment to free this nation from its addiction to oil.And that's why I will invest $150 billion over the next 10 years in alternative sources of energy, like wind power, solar power, and advanced biofuels, to invest in the next generation of plug-in hybrids, investments that will create up to five million new green jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced and that will create billions of dollars in new business.That's the kind of leadership we need to realize the promise of clean energy for our economy, our safety and our security. And that's the kind of leadership I will offer as president of the United States.With that, let me open it up to questions.QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) And I'm just wondering, are you worried about the precedent that your decision is going to set?OBAMA: Well, we talked about this, I think, in Florida. I answered almost exactly the same question. So, I will say it again.We haven't just sort of done better with small donors. We have, I think, revolutionized how campaigns are financed at the presidential level. Ninety percent of our donors provide donations of $200 or less, 90 percent. So, the overwhelming bulk of the 1.7, I think, million donors that we get money from are ordinary Americans, not fat cats.We don't take special interest money in the form of PAC donations. We don't take money from federal lobbyists. We have implemented a program where the Democratic National Committee is also not taking money from those sources.And, so, if you look at how we fund our campaign, we are more reliant on small donors and ordinary Americans than any campaign in history. We have also been more transparent than other campaigns in terms of where we get our money from.Do we have some big donors? Absolutely. But that's not what drives our campaign. And, as a consequence, we're actually in a position where, if a large donor wants to contribute to us, but wants something in return, I can afford to simply say, no, I'm not interested.There's no single donor in our campaign or group of donors on which we depend, because our donor base is the American people. And that is exactly what has always been the end of campaign reform.Now, public financing was one means of achieving that end, of freeing ourselves from special interest domination. And I feel confident that we have achieved it. And, you know, if you contrast how I'm funding my campaign with John McCain, for example, he's more reliant on lobbyists, more reliant on PACs, more reliant on special interests. There are no constraints to what the Republican National Committee can do.So, we could have made a choice to go through the public financing system, and then, with a wink and a nod, have all this big money go into the RNC, or to, in our case, the DNC, in which case -- and that's what we have been doing in the past. But I don't think that that lives up to the spirit of what we're trying to achieve in terms of campaign reform.QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) Is there a way to fix the system?OBAMA: Well, I think, as I said even earlier in the year, I felt that the system was broken. And I still want to see if we can fix it. And I think that part of what we're going to have to do is to create a system in which all spending is transparent, and you don't have an artificial public financing sector that's strictly limited, and then huge amounts of money, hundreds of millions of dollars that are being spent outside that system.And that's been my goal from the start.OK.QUESTION: Senator, last -- last January, you pledged to support a filibuster of a warrantless surveillance bill that included retroactive immunity for telecommunications. Last week, the House passed a bill that effectively gives the telecoms that immunity. You said would support it.In explaining the change, you said it was -- you were talking -- it was in light of the security threats facing the country.Can you explain how the security threats facing the country are any different today than they were in January, when you said you would support a filibuster?OBAMA: Well, the bill has changed. So, I don't think the security threats have changed. I think the security threats are similar.My view on FISA has always been that the issue of the phone companies per se is not one that overrides the security interests of the American people. I do want accountability and making sure that, as I have said before, somebody's watching the watchers, that you don't have an administration that feels that it can make its own determinations about when warrantless wiretaps are applicable without going through a FISA court.And -- and that's what we had. That's the system that we had previously. And I think that, if you look at why people were concerned about the original bill, it wasn't simply that we wouldn't be able to sue the phone companies. I would be happy with a system that discloses what's happened and make sure that we prevent violations of the American people's privacy, even if the phone companies are held harmless.The issue was, can we get to the bottom of what's been taking place, and, most importantly, do we have safeguards going -- in place going into the future so that American civil liberties are not being violated?It is a close call for me, but I think that the current legislation, with the exclusivity provision that says that a president, whether it's George Bush or myself or John McCain, can't make up rationales for getting around the FISA court, can't suggest that somehow there is some law that stands above the laws passed by Congress in engaging in warrantless wiretaps.Make -- the fact that that provision is in there, I think, is very important and provides us protection going forward. The fact that there's an inspector general in place to investigate what happened previously gives us insight into what has happened going -- or retrospectively.And, so, that, in my mind, met my basic concerns. And given that all the information I have received is that the underlying program itself actually is important and useful to American security, as long as it has these constraints on them, I felt it was most -- more important for me to go ahead and support this compromise.QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) Ask you, what were your thoughts about Ralph Nader's comments that you were trying to talk white and appeal to white guilt, so that you don't seem like a Jesse Jackson, and you're not confronting real problems in the African-American community? He was pretty brutal.OBAMA: You know, look, first of all, what's clear is, Ralph Nader hadn't been paying attention to my speeches, because all the issues that he talked about, whether it's predatory lending, or the housing foreclosure crisis, or what have you, are issues that the traveling press can tell you I have devoted multiple speeches, town hall meetings to throughout this campaign.Ralph Nader's trying to get attention. He's become a perennial political candidate. I think it's a shame, because, if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections, it's an extraordinary one. But, at this point, he's somebody who's trying to get attention and whose campaign hasn't gotten any traction.There's a better way to get some traction than to make an inflammatory statement like the one that he made. It is what it is.(CROSSTALK)QUESTION: I assume that you consider the economy issue number one in this campaign. And you link the pain at the pump to the general economic malaise.What can you tell Chicagoans here about $4- and $5-a-gallon gasoline, how that would be improved, would be reduced by those several short-term measures that you would like to implement if you were president?OBAMA: Well, there are two elements, short-term, that could make a difference.The first is having some serious investigation in closing loopholes in the oil futures market. Experts estimate that up to 30 percent of the current price of oil, or at least the current increase, is accounted for by energy speculation. And it is very important, I think, for us to be able to crack down on that speculation by closing the loopholes that lead this out of the regulatory framework that exists for most futures -- futures markets.The second thing is to give people some tax relief, so that they can absorb these higher costs, both in the form of a tax stimulus rebate and a permanent $1,000 tax cut per family. Now, that will help people's bottom line day to day. What I...QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)OBAMA: Well, no, the first one will. The tax break will not.I mean, the truth is, is -- and I have -- look, obviously, we're spending a lot of time talking to energy experts across the country and around the world. And the fact of the matter is, is that, once you take out some of that speculation that's been taken in the oil markets, the rest of it is driven by a big spike in demand, and a flatlining, or a supply that's not increasing as quickly.Now, I would love, as I said in my opening remarks, to wave a magic wand and say, you elect me president, and gasoline's going to go back to three bucks or two. But that's not going to happen. That's not going to happen regardless of who's president.What can bring gas prices down is a long-term serious energy policy. That's what we should have had in place 20 years ago. It's what we should have had in place 10 years ago. And that's what we should have in place now.And, so, my goal is to get it right now. And the way to get it right is to make sure that we have got fuel-efficient cars that are significantly reducing oil consumption in the transportation sector, making our buildings more energy-efficient, setting up a cap-and-trade system that gives people incentives to move away from carbon-producing fossil fuels, using the money that's generated to reinvest in solar, wind, biodiesel, and setting a very clear goal that we are going to reduce our consumption by a large magnitude, 30 percent, 35 percent of our current oil consumption.That is something that is achievable, but it's not going to be done tomorrow. It's not going to be next year. It's going to be done 10 years from now.QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)OBAMA: OK. Hold on a second, everybody. Go ahead.QUESTION: Senator, what's your reaction to the Supreme Court's decision today striking down the death penalty for a child rapist?OBAMA: I disagree with the decision. I have said repeatedly that I think that the death penalty should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes. I think that the rape of a small child, 6 or 8 years old, is a heinous crime. And if a state makes a decision that, under narrow, limited, well-defined circumstances, the death penalty is at least potentially applicable, that that does not violate our Constitution.Now, I think it's -- you know, had the Supreme Court said, we want to constrain the ability of the states to do this to make sure that it's done in a careful and appropriate way, that would have been one thing. But it basically had a blanket prohibition. And I disagreed with that decision.Yes?QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) The Supreme Court is expected to rule tomorrow on the D.C. gun ban.Can you review for us where you stand on that?(CROSSTALK)OBAMA: Why don't I wait until the decision comes out, and then I will comment on it, as opposed to trying to prognosticate what the Supreme Court is going to decide tomorrow?QUESTION: You commented on it before you -- you support the D.C. gun ban (OFF-MIKE)OBAMA: What I have said is that I do not -- what I have said is, is that I'm a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, but I do not think that that precludes local governments being able to provide some commonsense gun laws that keep guns out of the hands of gangbangers or children, that local jurisdictions are going to have different sets of problems, and that this is a very fact-intensive decision that has to be made.But I do think that the Second Amendment is an individual right. So, what I would like to do is wait and see how the Supreme Court comes down, and evaluate the actual reasoning in the case to see how broad or narrow the decision's going to be.(CROSSTALK)QUESTION: Al Gore -- who are you pointing to?OBAMA: I was pointing to Lee (ph).But go ahead.QUESTION: OK. All right.OBAMA: I will call on you next.QUESTION: Al Gore and John Edwards endorsed you in big arenas with big crowds. Former President Clinton issues a somewhat tepid statement through an aide. Are you worried about -- do you need to hear more from the former president? Are you worried about the party truly uniting, if you don't get a more full-throated endorsement from the former president?OBAMA: No, because I'm going to be appearing with Senator Hillary Clinton, the former president's wife, who was involved in an epic, historic primary with me. And then I'm going to be campaigning with her on Friday. So it's understandable that the former president wouldn't want to upstage what is going to be, I think, a terrific unity event over the next day-and-a-half.Now if the question is do I want Bill Clinton campaigning for us for the ticket leading into November, the answer is absolutely yes. I want him involved. He is a brilliant politician. He was an outstanding president. And so I want his help not only in campaigning, but also in governing. And I'm confident that I'll get that help.Lee?QUESTION: Depending on your -- the statement that you made yesterday about the violence in Zimbabwe and the elections there coming up, is it your sense that the U.N. and some of the regional groups in the area haven't done enough?And if that's the case, what do you think the next step should be taken by the U.N. and by the U.S.?OBAMA: Well, I think they haven't done enough. I actually had a conversation with the -- who we anticipate will be the next head of the South African government Minister Zuma, and encouraged and urged him to speak out more forcefully on what was happening. This is before Mr. Tsvangirai decided to withdraw from the election.What's happening in Zimbabwe is tragic. This is a country that used to be the bread basket of Africa. And Mugabe has run the economy into the ground. He has perpetrated extraordinary violence against his own people.What is remaining of this election is a complete and total sham. I don't think that whatever the results of this election on Friday that Mugabe will be able to claim any sort of legitimacy as a Democratically elected leader in Zimbabwe. And not only do I think that the United Nations needs to continue to apply as much pressure as possible on the Mugabe government, but in particular, other African nations, including South Africa, I think have to be much more forceful in condemning the extraordinary violence that has been taking place there. And, frankly, they have been quiet for far too long and allowed Mugabe to engage in this sort of anti-colonial rhetoric that is used to distract from his own profound failures as a leader.Yes?QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE) talk with Senator Clinton and you've begun to address the issue of her debt.What sort of role to you envision for her in the campaign (INAUDIBLE)?OBAMA: Look, the -- I want her campaigning as much as she can. She was a terrific campaigner. She, I think, inspired millions of people. And so she can be an extraordinarily effective surrogate for me and the values and ideals that we share as Democrats. You know, I want her out there talking to people about how we're going to provide universal health care. I want her to talk about what's going to be required for us to get on a serious energy footing in this country. I want her to talk about her passion for children and early childhood education, making sure that college is affordable. And I think we can send Senator Clinton anywhere and she will be effective.So, obviously, it will be constrained by her schedule, but I'm looking forward to campaigning vigorously with her. I think we'll have a -- I think we'll have a terrific time together in New Hampshire. And I think that she will be very effective all the way through November.(CROSSTALK)QUESTION: What have you -- yesterday you told your big donors you had given the green light to help retire Senator Clinton's debt.Are you planning to reach out to those small donors you were talking about earlier, sort of the grassroots?And if not, why not?And what's her plan if you have to help her with her debt?OBAMA: Well, you know, we don't have some 10 point strategy to do this. What I said was, to my large donors, who are in a position to write large checks to help Senator Clinton retire her debt, or at least a portion of it. And I think there are going to be those who are willing to do so. You know, small donors, you know, who are writing $5 or $10 or $15, $25 checks, first of all, their budgets are tighter. And, you know, they know that I am going to be working with Senator Clinton. If they want to make contributions, then I think there's nothing wrong with them doing so. And I want to encourage that.But we're not I'm not going to be individually contacting $15 donors because, frankly, it probably wouldn't be that effective in terms of making a big dent in Senator Clinton's debt.(CROSSTALK)OBAMA: Yes, go ahead.QUESTION: Senator, the national media has had some fun lately with the discovery that you're a politician and you come from Chicago. There's a lot of pedigree there, good and bad.From your perspective, what's good about being a Chicago politician? What does it mean?OBAMA: Well, look, for the local reporters here -- here in Chicago, you guys have a sense of where I come from and who I am. You will recall that for my entire political career here, basically, I was not the endorsed candidate of any political organization here; that I didn't go around wielding a bunch of clout; that my reputation in Springfield was as an independent. And my reputation here was also somebody who will try to work with everybody.And so there's no doubt that I had friends and continue to have friends who come out of the more traditional school of Chicago politics. But that's not what launched my political career and that's not what I've ever depended on in order to get elected. And I would challenge any Chicago reporter to dispute that of -- that basic fact.I think one thing about Chicago is that people try to get stuff done for their constituents. And one of the things I'm going to try to do as president is to get stuff done for the American people, who are struggling with high gas prices and lack of health care and an inability to afford college.And I do think that there's a non-ideological approach to politics. It's not unique to Chicago. I think it's Midwestern in some way, which is important and will represent a significant change from the very ideological, very sharp partisanship that we've seen in Washington for a long time now.QUESTION: How important is it to you that your vice president have national security credentials and can you elaborate on the kind of resume that person will have to have?OBAMA: I want somebody who can be a good president if anything happened to me. And I want somebody who can be a good adviser and counsel to me and tell me where he or she thinks I'm wrong, not just on national security policy, but on domestic policy, as well.Beyond that, I will give you more details when I announce my V.P. candidate.Jay?OBAMA: Wait, actually, Jay, you already got one, didn't you?Sorry. Go on.QUESTION: Senator, following up on the question that Greg Heinz just asked regarding Chicago, isn't it the case by now, concentrating more of the function of the DNC here in Chicago, that you're going to be causing more attention to be focused on this city. And in the minds of those who have a less nuanced understanding of the city, they may focus more on the traditional corruption aspects and on ongoing investigations, some of which may come to fruit during the course of the campaign?OBAMA: Yes, but those have nothing to do with my presidential campaign. And I don't think anything -- anybody would indicate that the mere fact that I am from Chicago is going to somehow have any impact on the kind of president that I'm going to be. So, no. The answer is I don't think that's going to be relevant at all.QUESTION: Senator, back to public -- your decision on public financing. It was widely criticized as being a flip-flop and/or a broken promise.Do you accept those characterizations as fair?And are you concerned that the decision might jeopardize your credibility on other pledges you've made during the campaign on issues like trade, health care and withdrawing troops from Iraq?OBAMA: Well, I think that the characterization of flip-flop was wrong because if you looked at my statement, what I said was is that we would try to work with the Republican nominee to preserve the option of public financing. In fact, you know, if you recall my original statement, it was prompted by the fact that everybody had said, including John McCain, that they were looking to opt out of the system. And it was on our own initiative, without any prompting, that we wrote to the FEC in order to give us that option.That was -- that was the purpose of that letter and that statement, to make sure that we preserved that possibility.And so the answer is no. I don't think that it is going to damage my credibility at all on those issues that you just mentioned. Those issues have to do with the reason that I'm fighting to be president of the United States -- making sure that the American people get a fair shake. Those are issues that I've been working on for 20 years. If people are interested in my credibility, they can take a look at what I said when I was a first year state senator, what I said when I was a first year U.S. senator or what I'm saying now as a presidential candidate. And they'll find consistency in my approaches on all these issues.And even my critics, including conservative critics, would acknowledge that, in fact, there's been surprising consistency in how I approach every issue, whether it's trade or economic policy. On a whole host of issues, my orientation has been how can we, in a practical, pragmatic way, give more rung -- put -- you know, place more rungs on that ladder of opportunity for the American people and how can we make sure that we've got a competitive economy that continues to grow and that continues to prosper, how are we going to make sure that we keep the American people safe.So there just hasn't been a lot of contradiction there. And, you know, frankly, when I hear those arguments made by supporters of John McCain or from the Republican National Committee, when just in the last two weeks we've seen John McCain reversed himself on a whole host of issues like drilling on the Continental shelf, and when there were a whole host of shifts in position on public financing by John McCain himself, then my sense is these arguments are just part of the political environment, that they are part and parcel of a presidential campaign, so.(CROSSTALK)OBAMA: All right, guys.QUESTION: Senator, just one quick question.OBAMA: You know, I'm going to -- I'm going to -- the last question here, because -- just because you had your hand up.QUESTION: Was that me?OBAMA: Yes, you -- for quite some time.QUESTION: OK.Your hometown is in the grips of a wave of violence that has frustrated political leaders. The police are responding. An extraordinary statement yesterday (INAUDIBLE) police chief saying some of these parents are to blame, their own lifestyles are putting their children in harm's way. But in a lot of cases, this is 15 years too late for the police to deal with.OBAMA: Right.QUESTION: What can you do as president to give Chicago and other cities a leg up on this violence?OBAMA: I've talked about this repeatedly. But let me try to be succinct. We have to put more cops on the streets and that's why I want to restore the COPS program. We have to make sure that we are able to trace guns that have been used in violence to the unscrupulous gun dealers that all too often are dumping illegal handguns onto the streets of Chicago. I don't think there's anything contradictory between that and being a supporter of the Second Amendment.We have to have -- improve schools, after school programs and summer school programs that give young people a place to be that's constructive and that gives them a sense of self-worth and a belief that they can achieve beyond just participating in the drug trade. Those are things government can do.But as I said two Sundays ago at a speech here in Chicago, parents have to do their jobs. And fathers have to be at home and be a part of their child's lives and provide them guidance and provide them values. And we, as a community, have to speak out against the violence and instill a sense -- a greater sense of self-control and responsibility in our children.And it's true, those are not things that we're going to be able to do overnight. It's going to take some time because there are kids who have been -- have not received that nurturing for a very long time. And many of them are hardened to the point where reversing how they've been brought up is going to be a daunting task.And just while I'm on this topic, one last point I guess I would make. There were some who criticized my speech by saying well, you haven't acknowledged, for example, the joblessness and poverty that exists in the black community. I talk about that all the time. And there's no doubt that -- in fact, I wrote about this in my book ""The Audacity of Hope,"" that if you've got men in inner city communities that can find jobs that support families, they are more likely to participate in those families and participate in their children's upbringing and to provide a role model for those children.And so there's -- everything else that we've been talking about in terms of the economic development and job growth is going to have some impact on this issue. But that can't -- that can't be an excuse for a failure to provide the kind of guidance that children need in the household.So, all right?QUESTION: Senator (INAUDIBLE) -- on Charlie Black and his comments about -- that a terror attack might be good for Senator John McCain's campaign.Any reaction to that?OBAMA: Well, I thought I commented on that yesterday. But I'll do so again. I'd make two points. One is I'm not sure he is -- his analysis is correct, because I am looking forward to having a debate with the authors of the disastrous policy in Iraq about what's required in order to keep the American people safe. I don't think that the Bush administration or John McCain have shaped policies that are optimal in order to deal with the terrorist threat.We're seeing backsliding in Afghanistan. We've got bin Laden sending out audio tapes. We've got interactive Internet sites that Al Qaeda has put up because they've got a place where they feel relatively secure. We are weakened financially and our military is strained to the breaking point as a consequence of our incursions into Iraq. We've neglected some of the homeland security investments that we could have made here.Our National Guard, as we saw in the Midwest flooding, can't function as effectively as it could. I was talking to National Guard representatives. Fifteen of their 17 helicopters in this region were overseas during the flooding.So I want to have that debate. And, you know, I think that if the Republicans think that they can run the same playbook that they ran in 2004 or 2000, I think they're badly mistaken, because I think the American people recognize their policies have not made us more safe.Now, having said that, I also think that using the specter of a terrorist attack as a political angle to be exploited is not what the American people are looking for. Everybody -- all of us have an interest in preventing a terrorist attack on our homeland. I think that's true of John McCain. I think that's true of Democrats and Republicans. And I think it's true of George Bush.And so my sense is that we should try to avoid trying to exploit the issue politically and focus on what are the concrete policy differences that we have in order to achieve that goal. All right?Thanks, guys."		1

This bill, which is supported and endorsed by FAIR, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, would impose a 2% fee on all remittances headed south of the US border. Remittances, or wire transfers, are commonly used by illegal immigrants to move money from the US to their home countries. In 2014, Mexico alone received over $24 billion in remittances sent from the US, while other South and Central American countries received over 15% of their GDPs in the form of remittances. “President Trump has made it very clear that he intends to complete a wall along our Southern border. As a senior member of the Homeland Security committee, I have long supported the border wall, which will protect Americans.” Rogers said. “In order to jumpstart the funding of the wall, I have introduced a bill to impose a 2% fee on remittances sent south of the border. This bill is simple – anyone who sends their money to countries that benefit from our porous borders and illegal immigration should be responsible for providing some of the funds needed to complete the wall. This bill keeps money in the American economy, and most importantly, it creates a funding stream to build the wall,” Rogers said. 		1

http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2010/aug/15/lamar-smith/us-rep-lamar-smith-says-united-states-could-cut-un/	"	""We could cut unemployment in half simply by reclaiming the jobs taken by illegal workers."""	false	['Immigration']	http://www.nytimes.com/	http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/us/politics/02obama.html	2010/08/15	“We could cut unemployment in half simply by reclaiming the jobs taken by illegal workers,” said Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, co-chairman of the Reclaim American Jobs Caucus. “President Obama is on the wrong side of the American people on immigration. The immigration debate has flared in recent weeks with the passage of a new law in Arizona requiring police to question the immigration status of anyone they stop for other reasons if they suspect they are in the country illegally. About 20 other states are considering similar laws while the Justice Department is preparing a lawsuit to challenge the Arizona measure. The White House has been under pressure to tackle an overhaul of immigration policy this year on the assumption that it could face a more hostile Congress after the November election. The president met separately this week with immigration advocates and with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. His attention to the issue was also a favor to Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, who promised to pursue legislation as he battles for re-election in a state with a rising Hispanic population. Mr. Obama invited Mr. Reid to meet at the White House after Thursday’s speech. The president drew praise from Mr. Reid and groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, questioned Mr. Obama’s commitment. “I haven’t seen anything to demonstrate that he’s used any political capital or made this a priority,” he told reporters. In his address, Mr. Obama repeated his support for an approach like that proposed by Senators Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. Under their plan, illegal immigrants who wish to remain in the country would be required to admit they broke the law and pay fines and back taxes, pass background checks and prove that they can speak English before going to the back of the line of those seeking permanent legal residency. It would also strengthen border security and interior enforcement, create a process for temporary workers and require Social Security cards with biometric data like fingerprints or retinal patterns to help ensure that illegal workers cannot get jobs. The president rejected the most dramatic solutions to illegal migration. Mass deportations would be “logistically impossible and wildly expensive,” he said, but blanket amnesty was “unwise and unfair” to those who played by the rules. “In sum, the system is broken and everybody knows it,” Mr. Obama said. He also used the opportunity to repeat his opposition to Arizona’s new law. Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the Republican minority whip, said the state’s law was a response to Washington’s failure to deal with the problem. Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.

Guests include: House Speaker John Boehner; Senators Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Tom Coburn, R-Okla.; Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker; Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley; and a roundtable with Major Garrett, Jonathan Martin and CBS News' Jan Crawford and John Dickerson.NORAH O'DONNELL: Today on FACE THE NATION, the Supreme Court upholds the President's signature health care law. The White House says the reforms are working but critics say the fight's just begun.PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: It's time for us to move forward to implement and, where necessary, improve on this law.MITT ROMNEY: If we want to get rid of Obamacare, we're going to have to replace President Obama.NORAH O'DONNELL: We'll get reaction from the top Republican in the land, House Speaker John Boehner.REPRESENTATIVE JOHN BOEHNER (House Speaker): This has to be ripped out by its roots. This is government taking over the entire health insurance industry. The American people do not want to go down this path.NORAH O'DONNELL: And he says the House will push for repeal yet again.REPRESENTATIVE JOHN BOEHNER: We will not flinch from our resolve to get-- to make sure this law is repealed in its entirety.NORAH O'DONNELL: For reaction from both sides we'll hear from two top Senators Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republican budget hawk Tom Coburn. What does it mean for the states? We'll get the governors' perspective from Democrat Martin O'Malley of Maryland and Republican Scott Walker of Wisconsin. And how will the decision play out on the campaign trail? We'll ask our political round-table--John Harris of Politico, Major Garrett of National Journal and our own Jan Crawford and John Dickerson--the Supreme Court's ruling and what it means for you--(Crowd Cheering)NORAH O'DONNELL: --because this is FACE THE NATION.ANNOUNCER: And now from CBS News in Washington, FACE THE NATION with Bob Schieffer, substituting for Bob Schieffer, CBS News chief White House correspondent Norah O'Donnell.NORAH O'DONNELL: Good morning again.The big news came this week when the Supreme Court decided to uphold the President's signature achievement, his Affordable Care Act, including its most controversial element, the individual mandate, which requires people to buy health insurance or pay a penalty. We're joined now by the speaker of the House, John Boehner. Mister Speaker, thank you for joining us.REPRESENTATIVE JOHN BOEHNER (Speaker of The House): Good morning.NORAH O'DONNELL: Were you surprised by the Supreme Court's decision?REPRESENTATIVE JOHN BOEHNER: I was. The idea that the federal government can mandate that the American people purchase a product is shocking to me. But they made their-- their decision. I respect their ability to make that decision. But all it really does is strengthen my resolve and resolve of Republicans here in Washington to repeal this awful law, which is increasing the cost of health insurance for the American people and making it harder for small businesses to hire new workers.NORAH O'DONNELL: The House has already voted some thirty times to repeal or defund this law. What's one more time going to do?REPRESENTATIVE JOHN BOEHNER: And we're going to do it one more time.NORAH O'DONNELL: What's the point?REPRESENTATIVE JOHN BOEHNER: It's-- we want to show people we are resolved to get rid of this.NORAH O'DONNELL: You don't think after thirty times they think you're resolved?REPRESENTATIVE JOHN BOEHNER This law-- this law will bankrupt our nation and put the government in charge of everyone's health care. This is the wrong direction. And while the court upheld it as constitutional, they certainly didn't say that it was a good law. This-- this law is-- is making it much more difficult for workers to get jobs. It's raising the cost of health insurance for the American people. Republicans believe in a common-sense step-by-step approach that will lower health care cost and allow the American people to choose the health insurance they want, not the health insurance the government wants them to have.NORAH O'DONNELL: Is there anything good in this law?REPRESENTATIVE JOHN BOEHNER: Well, there's always going to be parts of it that are good. But when you look at the twenty-seven hundred pages that no one read and, uh, you know, remember Nancy Pelosi said, well, we have to pass this before we know what's in it. Republicans are not going to go down that path.NORAH O'DONNELL: I asked ask you if there's anything good in it because I want to ask you about some of the specific provisions in the bill. Since you are going to be repealing it, are you willing to roll back the provisions that would provide free mammograms under Medicare?REPRESENTATIVE JOHN BOEHNER: Listen, there are a lot of provisions that can be replaced. Remember, I said, we want to take a common-sense, step-by-step approach to replacing Obamacare.NORAH O'DONNELL: Let's talk about what's specifically in this bill because there are a lot of protections for individuals.REPRESENTATIVE JOHN BOEHNER: Of course, there are.NORAH O'DONNELL: If you are under twenty-six years old, you are out of a job, you can stay on your parent's insurance. Do you support that?REPRESENTATIVE JOHN BOEHNER: I do. And the health insurance industry has made that a practice within their industry.NORAH O'DONNELL: What about it--REPRESENTATIVE JOHN BOEHNER: They came out and made that statement a couple of weeks ago.NORAH O'DONNELL: What about additional preventative care like for children, for instance, you don't have to pay a copay on immunizations?REPRESENTATIVE JOHN BOEHNER: As I-- as I said Republicans believe in a common-sense, step-by-step approach to replacing this law. And all of those provisions, popular provisions, many of them very sound provisions can, in fact, be done in a common-sense way, but not in twenty-seven hundred pages that no one read.NORAH O'DONNELL: What about preexisting conditions? What about the millions of Americans that have preexisting conditions and are discriminated against?REPRESENTATIVE JOHN BOEHNER: We believe that the way it is done within Obamacare is-- is pushing the cost of health insurance for all Americans much too high. We believe that the state high-risk pools are a much more effective way to making sure that those with preexisting conditions have access to affordable health insurance.NORAH O'DONNELL: But access to affordable health insurance, but you're not saying you would be for a law that would prevent discrimination of those individuals?REPRESENTATIVE JOHN BOEHNER: No, we just believe there is a better way to make sure that they have affordable access to quality health insurance.NORAH O'DONNELL: So when you repeal this, what are you going to replace it with?REPRESENTATIVE JOHN BOEHNER: I just started pointing out. We're going take a common-sense, step-by-step approach that puts in place the kind of policies that will make our-- our health insurance system more what I call patient-centered and lower cost. The only proposal out there last year that would lower the cost of health insurance came from Republicans. Why? Because we've got policies that really will help bring down the cost of health insurance. It's clear that Obamacare is increasing the cost of health insurance for all Americans and making it virtually impossible for small employers to hire new workers.NORAH O'DONNELL: How does it make it hard for small employers to hire more workers?REPRESENTATIVE JOHN BOEHNER: Because they're being required to either provide health insurance or pay a fine. Well, I'm sorry, a tax. It's now a tax since the court said it was a tax.NORAH O'DONNELL: Chief Justice John Roberts said it was a tax.prev"		1

We’ve made clear that Democrats’ $33 billion proposal is not enough, and much of it is based on gimmicks. To make a positive impact on our economy, the cuts need to be significant, and they need to be real. Failing to make real cuts will send a signal to job creators that Washington is still not serious about getting government spending under control. We’ve also made clear that policy provisions must be part of any final agreement, because the American people are concerned not just about how much we’re spending, but also how we’re spending it. “We’re not going to allow the Senate and White House to force us to choose between two options that are bad for America, whether it’s a bad deal that fails to make real spending cuts, or accepting a government shutdown due to Senate inaction. We’ve introduced a bill that includes $12 billion in cuts over the next week and funds our troops through the year. We may pass this to keep the government running if Democrats don’t listen to the American people and get serious about cutting spending.“As I’ve said many times, our goal is to pass real spending cuts to create a better environment for job growth and to keep the government open. We’ve done our job. If the government shuts down, the American people will know it was because Senate Democrats failed to do their job. We can still avoid a shutdown, but Democrats are going to need to get serious about cutting spending – and soon.”Share This Post		1

Mitt Romney initially ranked last among states in job growth, but by the end of his governorship, ""we were in the middle of the pack."""	half-true	['Economy', 'History', 'Jobs', 'States']	http://abcnews.go.com/	http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-stephanie-cutter-eric-fehrnstrom/story?id=16476391&page=7#.T85XaLBrPSg	2012/06/05	"STEPHANOPOULOS (voice-over): Good morning, and welcome to ""This Week."" As Romney clinches the nomination... ROMNEY: Let's keep America strong. Let's have a president that knows what it takes to get America to work. STEPHANOPOULOS: ... and each team invades rival turf... ROMNEY: Heads and his cronies win, tails and the taxpayers lose. (UNKNOWN): The Massachusetts record was alarmingly weak. STEPHANOPOULOS: Grim news on jobs rocks the presidential race. OBAMA: Our economy is still facing some serious headwinds. ROMNEY: The president's policies and his handling of the economy has been dealt a harsh indictment this morning. OBAMA: Is Obama to blame? Can Romney do better? The campaign strategists come to ""This Week"" for their first debate, Stephanie Cutter for Obama and Eric Fehrnstrom for Romney join our powerhouse roundtable, with George Will, Paul Krugman, and Donna Brazile. Plus, John Edwards gets off. EDWARDS: Finally, my precious Quinn, who I love more than any of you could ever imagine... OBAMA: George W. Bush gets some laughs. BUSH: What would George do? OBAMA: And Mike Bloomberg starts a soda war. All that right now on ""This Week."" ANNOUNCER: From ABC News, ""This Week"" with George Stephanopoulos. It's your voice, your vote. Reporting from ABC News election headquarters, George Stephanopoulos. STEPHANOPOULOS: Hello again. Just about five months before Election Day, that jobs report on Friday was a gut-check for President Obama. It reminded all of us what this campaign is really about and just about guaranteed the race will be a nail-biter all the way. The latest polls show a dead-even contest, a country on edge, anxious and divided as ever, not thrilled with President Obama's leadership, not sure Governor Romney has any better answers. Here to make the case for their candidates this morning in their first debate from the Romney campaign, senior adviser Eric Fehrnstrom, Obama deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter. They join our regulars George Will and Paul Krugman, Nobel Prize-winning author of new book ""End This Depression Now,"" just told me it's a best-seller in Spain. KRUGMAN: Indeed, it is. STEPHANOPOULOS: Congratulations. And, Stephanie, let's get to the economy, and let me begin with you. Right after that jobs report came out on Friday, Governor Romney did respond. He said, ""This president is responsible for the fact that this recession has gone on so long and is hurting so many people."" Your response? CUTTER: Well, George, I think the president said it best on Friday that, you know, we are still in a recovery period. Over the past 27 months, we have created 4.3 million private-sector jobs. The issue is that we're not adding jobs fast enough. If you looked at the report on Friday, the areas where we are doing well are areas that we've been able to affect policy. Manufacturing jobs continue to rise. And that's precisely because the president stepped in and did what nobody else was willing to do to save the auto industry. And that has had a great impact on manufacturing jobs up and down the supply chain. Now, that report also showed areas that are still hurting, particularly teachers and construction workers. And that just shows the wisdom of the president's policies, because we have two very -- two policies sitting on the desk of Congress right now that they could act on to put teachers back to work and put construction workers back to work rebuilding our roads, bridges and highways. STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's get Eric to respond to that. What do you make of that? Governor Romney's been quite critical of what the president did with the auto industry. FEHRNSTROM: Well, I agree with Stephanie, first, that this president is not adding jobs fast enough. And I think for anybody who is urgently waiting for improvement in the economy, last week was not a good week. And it's not just the devastatingly weak jobs report we got on Friday. It was also the revision in GDP downward for the first quarter. It's a drop in consumer confidence. It was an increase in unemployment claims. And it's not that we don't think that this president is trying. I think he is. It's just that his policies are not working. And, by the way, George, not just the policies... STEPHANOPOULOS: On all of those? FEHRNSTROM: Just let me stay on jobs for a moment. Not just that the policies -- we gave the keys to the largest economy in the world to a person who did not have any prior executive leadership experiences. Governor Romney has led in the private sector. He organized and ran the Winter Olympic Games in 2002. He's run a state successfully. I think that's a big difference between these two... STEPHANOPOULOS: I want to get in more on the records in a moment, but let me turn it over to George Will now, because this comes at a point, this May jobs report, where perceptions usually get baked in, in a presidential race. WILL: Exactly. And no matter what Congress does, nothing the government can do is going to change the trajectory of the economy right now. Since the Second World War, no president has been re-elected with the unemployment rate over 7.4 percent. What we learned this week is for sure it's going to be over 7.4 percent. We now have 40 consecutive months of 8 percent unemployment or more. The average workweek went down. As you're right, they revised downward the first quarter GDP. They also revised downward the jobs creation in April. So there was simply nothing in this report to give people confidence. And what it does begin to answer is a question. Is this going to be 1984 or 1980? 1984, when Reagan could run after a deep recession, on the morning in America and the revival has begun, or would it be 1980, with a sense of stagnation and permanence in stagnation, and it looks increasingly like 1980. STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's get to the economist, then. Where is the economy right now? KRUGMAN: Well, the economy is weak. It's not terrible, but it's weak. The bitter irony here has to be for Obama, certainly for people like me, is that if the Republican answer is ""let's slash spending, let's have low taxes,"" that's actually the policy we've been following. It's amazing, actually. Especially if you look at the last couple of years, what we've actually seen is sharply... STEPHANOPOULOS: Let me show you -- we have a chart in your blog this morning. KRUGMAN: Yeah, this is... STEPHANOPOULOS: We created it. It shows the point you're making. KRUGMAN: Yeah, this is real government spending, so it's federal, state and local combined, deflated, you know, adjusted for population growth and inflation, and it is plunging. It's plunging mostly because of cutbacks at the state and local level, because the aid that they were receiving in the stimulus has run out, but also because unemployment benefits have been expiring because Congress won't -- you know, Republicans in Congress won't extend them. So in effect -- and, by the way, if you extend that chart backwards, there's been nothing like this since the demobilization after the Korean War. We're actually practicing government austerity on a scale that we haven't seen in 60 years. It's not the president's policy. In effect, we've already got the policies that Republicans say they will impose if they take the election, and yet, of course, it may lead to the defeat of this president. STEPHANOPOULOS: And that's the point Stephanie was making, so bringing it back to you, what would Governor Romney do right now -- not in the future -- right now, to get the economy moving again? FEHRNSTROM: Well, it's not just, as Paul says, tax policy. That's part of it, of course, but it's also spending policy, it's regulatory policy. It's confronting China on their unfair trade practices. It's -- it's a whole -- it's labor policy, George. The governor has laid out very detailed plans. People can go to mittromney.com and learn about them for themselves. But I think what we really have here... KRUGMAN: ... detailed plans, and there is nothing there. There is not... FEHRNSTROM: What we -- what we -- what we really have here is a deficit in leadership. And this president came into office without any prior experience running anything. He never even ran a corner store. And I think it shows in the way that he's handling the economy. STEPHANOPOULOS: Can the president do anything now? CUTTER: He could get Congress to act. You know, the proposals that we've put forward that have been sitting there for nine months, you know, independent estimates have put those proposals at a million jobs. So there are a million jobs sitting on that table in Congress right now that they could -- they could move on. They need to get off their hands and stop rooting for failure. That's really what's going on right now. And we can impact the economy. Just as Paul was saying, this policy of austerity, because of the refusal of Republicans to act, can change. We can give states the aid that they need to protect those teachers' jobs. We can put construction workers back to work by rebuilding our roads, bridges, and highways. We can cut taxes... WILL: How about the -- how about the Keystone pipeline? You don't need Congress to do that. CUTTER: That's a fraction of the jobs that could be created by these proposals. WILL: But pretty important to those that get those jobs. CUTTER: And we -- and we have, you know, extended the Keystone pipeline at different points in the country. It's currently under review. But that's a fraction of the jobs that we're talking about here. We're talking about a million jobs. KRUGMAN: Can I just say, on the Reagan thing, if public-sector employment had continued to expand the way it did during Reagan's first term, instead of falling by about 600,000 as it has, right there we'd have something like 1.4 million people working in this country. So if you actually look at the actual track record of government spending, government employment, Reagan is the Keynesian and Obama -- mostly because of political constraints, although a little bit of lack of conviction on the part of his own people, has been the anti-Keynesian. He's been the one who's been doing what Republicans say is the right answer. If I have a political critique, it's that this administration has been very reluctant to make that case. They've been very hesitant about saying, look, we're trying to do the right thing, but those guys won't let us, I think for fear of... STEPHANOPOULOS: But doesn't -- but -- you got to the point at the end. I think the danger of that argument -- you were making part of it right now -- is that the more you blame Congress and nothing gets done, the weaker you look. KRUGMAN: Well, you know, I think they have no alternative (inaudible) what do I know about political strategy, right? But -- but -- but I think this is what they have to do now. They have to say, look, we -- we could have made this better. And, you know, Harry Truman, the do-nothing Republicans... FEHRNSTROM: Could I say, George, just on -- on that point? I do think it's important for Republicans in Congress to come together with the president on some bipartisan jobs legislation. The problem is, this president has made it nearly impossible to do that because of the way he demonizes his opposition, his personal attacks against Paul Ryan. I can tell you that when Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts, he had to confront a Democratic legislature. Every week, he would invite the Democratic leaders to come into his office. They would discuss agenda items. If they didn't have an agenda to discuss, they would talk about the last movie they saw. But the important thing was to keep those lines of communication open. This president hasn't done that, and I think it's -- we're for the worse. CUTTER: Well, in terms of the governor's Massachusetts record, I think that the Democratic leadership in Massachusetts would probably tell you a different story about Mitt Romney's ability to reach across the aisle. The number of vetoes of the Democratic legislature says it all. On the president working with Republicans, it's been clear since day one that the president was willing to reach out to Republicans, work with them on critical pieces of legislation to get our economy moving. Time and time again, they've rebuffed him. Now, whether you're talking about the secret meeting that they had on the day of the president's inaugural to figure out how they were going to defeat him or Mitch McConnell saying that his number-one goal to make the president a one-term president or bringing the economy to the brink of disaster last summer and resulting in a reduction in the nation's credit rating because Speaker Boehner couldn't get his Republicans together to do -- ensure that everybody paid their fair share and ensured this economy could keep moving. STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's talk about the plan going forward, because you mentioned the Ryan plan, the demonization of the Ryan plan, in your -- your words. Is Governor Romney saying that is going to be his blueprint for the budget going forward? FEHRNSTROM: Well, at least he has a blueprint. The president hasn't produced a budget or at least a budget he did produce -- or the outline of the budget he produced was rejected unanimously in both branches. Look, we need to restraint growth in government spending. If we -- if we're concerned about what's happening in Europe, if -- if we're concerned about Greece, if we're concerned about Spain, then we ought to rein in our spending now and get our debt and deficit down, or else we'll head down the same -- the same path as Europe. CUTTER: George, can I just say something here? There's -- you know, that -- that all sounds great, but the governor has not put out any details on how he is going to achieve that. The details that he has put out, a $5 trillion tax cut for millionaires and billionaires that he's not just telling us how he's going to pay for it, so he's either blowing up the deficit or he's raising taxes on the middle class... CUTTER: ... he's going to deregulate Wall Street, which we know how that turns out. We're going to go back to risky financial deals that crashed our economy. And on China, you know, we've been hearing this blustering on China for quite a while now. What exactly is the governor going to do? There's... STEPHANOPOULOS: ... I want to bring in George Will. FEHRNSTROM: He'll do what this president has failed to do in China, which is to declare that China is a currency manipulator. Look, we're all in favor of free trade. In fact, we don't think this president has done enough to reinvigorate trade talks -- trade talks with our friends, but China is -- is robbing us blind. They're stealing... KRUGMAN: I was very much for that. I've been demanding that we declare -- but the window for that has passed. Right now, the Chinese economy is tanking. So if you were thinking you were going to get a big boost out of beating up on the Chinese now, two years ago I thought was really a good time to do that. But my god, now that is totally out of date. CUTTER: And how do you explain the governor's comments that -- when the president did take action, enforcement action against the Chinese when they were dumping tires in this economy, that the governor called that protectionism? FEHRNSTROM: Well, the governor has -- has -- has promised that he would confront China in ways that this administration has not. He can -- the president has the power right now through his Treasury Department -- he doesn't need Congress to act -- to declare China a currency manipulator. They are playing fast and loose, giving themselves an unfair advantage, and that's hurting American jobs. STEPHANOPOULOS: George Will? WILL: The president has had a lot of discretion and used it vigorously with -- not just with Solyndra that Mr. Romney went out to dramatize this week, but this week the Wall Street Journal had a long article on $1,260,000,000 invested in car batteries for electric cars. Now, there's a big supply of the batteries; there's a small supply of the cars. Complete mismatch and lots of money lost. On another matter, I didn't hear a robust answer to George's question. Where does the governor stand, Governor Romney, on the Ryan plan? Does he endorse it? FEHRNSTROM: Oh, he's for -- he's for -- he's for the Ryan plan. He believes it goes in the right direction. The governor has also put forward a plan to reduce spending by $500 billion by the year 2016. In fact, he's put details on the table about how exactly he would achieve that. So to say he doesn't have a plan to -- a plan to restrain government spending is just not true. KRUGMAN: Can I say, the Ryan plan -- and I guess this is what counts as a personal attack -- but it isn't. It's not an attack on the person; it's an attack on the plan. The plan's a fraud. The plan is a big bunch of tax cuts, some specified spending cuts, basically for poor people, and then a huge magic asterisk which is supposed to turn into a deficit reduction plan, but, in fact, if you look what's actually in it, it's a deficit-increasing plan. And so to say that -- just tell the truth that there is really no plan there, neither from Ryan, nor from Governor Romney, is just the truth. That's not -- if that's -- if that's being harsh and partisan, gosh, then I guess the truth is anti-bipartisanship. FEHRNSTROM: So may I ask you, Paul, do you prefer the president's plan? KRUGMAN: Oh, yeah. I mean, the president -- at least it's -- you know, I don't approve of everything, but there are no gigantic mystery numbers in his stuff. We do know what he's talking about. His numbers are -- you know, all economic forecasts are wrong, but his are not -- are not insane. These are -- these are just imaginary. FEHRNSTROM: Well, this president has given us four years of trillion-dollar deficits. Never before -- not until Barack Obama came into office -- have we ever achieved a $1 trillion annual operating deficit. That's what we have under this president. At least the Paul Ryan plan puts us on a path toward a balanced budget. It gets those annual deficits down. FEHRNSTROM: ... in a way -- in a way -- in a way that this president has been unable to do. STEPHANOPOULOS: George? WILL: With his predictions about what his stimulus would accomplish, what his green jobs programs would accomplish, the president gave a lot of hostages to fortune, and fortune has shot the hostages. Now, when -- when Trotsky, one of the leaders of the Russian revolution, made lots of predictions, and his -- his biographer, Isaac Deutscher, who loved Trotsky, said, proof of Trotsky's farsighted is that none of his predictions have come true yet. I think Mr. Obama is farsighted in the same way. KRUGMAN: Oh, no question, that -- that one chart about the stimulus was -- was really wrong, but what's interesting about that very early thing was... STEPHANOPOULOS: When he said that unemployment would go below 8 percent. KRUGMAN: Right, but they actually said that... WILL: Stay below 8 percent. KRUGMAN: But they -- they were -- they were wildly over-optimistic about the ability of the private economy to recover on its own, but the mistake they made was that they said that even without the stimulus unemployment would fall sharply. And that was -- I don't know why they believed that, but this is not a problem with the president's policies, and it is something that a couple of economists put together in January 2009. Is that still what we're going to run on? STEPHANOPOULOS: I want to dig into a little more of what happened this week when both campaigns went in to rival territories. I said at the open, we had David Axelrod go to Massachusetts, talk about the Massachusetts record, Mitt Romney go to Solyndra, talk about the president. Take a look. AXELROD: The state was 47th in job creation, fourth from the bottom. Under Romney's tenure as governor, Massachusetts's economic performance was one of the worst in the country. ROMNEY: This building, this half-a-billion-dollar taxpayer investment, represents how the president thinks about free enterprise. Free enterprise to the president means taking money from the taxpayers and giving it freely to his friends. STEPHANOPOULOS: I want to talk about each of these issues in turn. Stephanie, let me begin with you. You saw David Axelrod make the point about the Massachusetts' jobs record, but in Massachusetts, unemployment did go down... STEPHANOPOULOS: ... under Mitt Romney, and it was below 5 percent when he left. CUTTER: Right. So let me tell you the story about Massachusetts under Governor Romney. It did fall to 47th out of 50 in jobs creation. Wages went down when they were going up in the rest of the country. He left his successor with debt and a deficit, and manufacturing jobs left that state at twice the rate as the rest of the country. And there was a reason for this, because the governor didn't have policies to get the economy moving again. Remember, that recession that he blames ended almost a year before he was even elected, and the country was growing jobs. Six months before Massachusetts -- he created one job in Massachusetts. Now, at this point in his term, 40 months into his term, he had created about 4,000 jobs. At this point in the president's term, Massachusetts has created five times that amount in Massachusetts. The reason the unemployment rate went down, in part, according to independent analysis in Massachusetts, is because 250,000 people left that state. KRUGMAN: Can I just break in? That actually... FEHRNSTROM: Well, I'd like an opportunity to respond to the political attack, and -- and that is, the magic number, here, George, is 4.7 percent. That was the level of unemployment achieved by Governor Romney in Massachusetts during his term in office. That's close to full unemployment. What does that mean? It meant anybody who wanted a job had a pretty good chance of finding one. I have no doubt that President Obama would happily trade his 8.2 percent unemployment rate for Mitt Romney's 4.7 percent. KRUGMAN: Massachusetts is a classic example, having nothing to do with current politics. It shows why America works as a currency union, while Europe doesn't, because Massachusetts had a terrible bust at the end of the '80s, and the unemployment rate eventually came way down, although there was no recovery in jobs. And the reason is people left, which is an interesting story, and it's good that people could find jobs elsewhere, but I don't think a president of the United States can solve our job problems by encouraging Americans to move to some other country to find work. FEHRNSTROM: Can I just say, on the jobs question, because this comes up repeatedly that Massachusetts was 47 out of 50 in terms of jobs growth. Actually, when Mitt Romney arrived, Massachusetts was an economic basket house. If you throw D.C. into the mix, we were 51 out of 51. By the time Mitt Romney left four years later, we were in the middle of the pack. We were 30th in the nation in terms of job growth. That's the trend line that you want to see. That's called a turnaround. And it's what this president has been unable to execute with the national economy. CUTTER: Well, I guess I'd just -- I have been looking at different numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics... CUTTER: ... which I think we all follow. FEHRNSTROM: Well, that's where -- that's where these numbers come from. CUTTER: ... 36 out of 50 states when Governor Romney took office, and he was 47th when he left. WILL: I don't think this election is going to have this retrospective cast of mind. The question is, what is the mood of the country going to be five months from now? And you would like to Congress to do something. If there's anything we know, it is that anything Congress does now will have an effect, if at all, in 2013... STEPHANOPOULOS: I think you can also say that it's pretty safe that the Congress isn't going to do all that much between now and November. I wanted to bring another question about Mitt Romney's Solyndra tact, to you, Eric Fehrnstrom, because the governor was very strong on that, but just the day after he gave that speech, the Boston Herald, I think, reported that a solar energy company that Mitt Romney supported as governor of Massachusetts with his own green jobs investments went bankrupt. It was one of several that have come up in the last couple of days, so isn't this exactly the same story? FEHRNSTROM: Well, that was a loan that was approved by the prior administration. The governor made it clear that his philosophy was that government should not be in the business of venture investing. Actions he took as governor were to limit the state's ability to do that. He vetoed funds that were set aside for that purpose. What the president did with Solyndra simply exposes the hypocrisy of his attacks against Bain Capital and free enterprise, because the president's idea or his concept of free enterprise is government bureaucrats and politicians making investment decisions to reward their political contributors, which is exactly what happened at Solyndra, and it was a $500 million bust to the American taxpayer. CUTTER: Well, just as Mitt Romney was implementing a program started under a previous administration, the president was doing the same thing. This program was started under the Bush administration. The process for the Solyndra loan was started under the Bush administration, and the loan was given to Solyndra to -- to improve the clean-energy sector. Now, that loan didn't work out. And it's tragic that it didn't. But that's 1.5 percent of a larger loan portfolio that is actually working. We now have the largest wind farm in the world in this country, first nuclear power plant in 20 years is being created of this country. Because of the investments that we've made in the clean-energy sector, we've created almost 250,000 jobs. Now, the president -- you know, we're listening to... WILL: It was supposed to be 5 million. CUTTER: The president is not willing to cede the clean-energy industry to countries like India and China. If Mitt Romney wants to cede those -- that industry to India and China, then I think the American people deserve to know the real impact that's going to have not only on our competitiveness, but on our stability. KRUGMAN: Can I just -- these are -- these are -- we're talking as if $1 billion was a lot of money, and in $15 trillion economy is not. Solyndra was a mistake as part of a large program, which has been -- by and large had a pretty good track record. Of course you're going to find a mistake. I think, to be fair, that's probably true in Massachusetts, as well. But this is -- this is ridiculous, that we are taking these tiny, tiny missteps which happen in any large organizations, including corporations, including Bain -- Bain Capital had losers, too, right, even from the point of view of its investors? So this is ridiculous. And the fact of the matter is, this president has not managed to get very much of what he wanted done. He -- it's terribly unfair that he's being judged on the failure of the economy to respond to policies that had been largely dictated by a hostile Congress. STEPHANOPOULOS: We have a couple minutes left before we have to take a break, and I just quickly want to go to you, George Will, because you're calling this recall election in Wisconsin, coming up on Tuesday, Governor Scott Walker, the Republican, facing a recall, the second most important election this year. WILL: Yes, because it's a microcosm of what the country faces, an attempt to change the trajectory of the public sector. You have this extraordinary conflict there where unions are defending their privileged position. And it does look as though Wisconsin people are going to try and take that back. The man running against Scott Walker, Mayor Barrett of Milwaukee, has used the Walker reforms to save $19 million in the Milwaukee budget itself, so he's running against a man whose reforms he's emulating and using. KRUGMAN: And yet, of course, Walker is proposing tax cuts that will do much more to hurt the budget than any of these alleged savings. So this is -- it is a microcosm. It is -- it's not -- it's not fiscal responsibility versus irresponsibility. It is a vision of what kind of country you want to have and whether we're going to redistribute income upwards. WILL: A more than $3 billion budget that he inherited -- deficit has now become a surplus. STEPHANOPOULOS: Time to take a quick break right there. I want to thank Paul Krugman for joining us this morning. Everyone else is staying put, and Donna Brazile is standing by for much more on our powerhouse table. A. ROMNEY: It sounds like you all are fired up. STEPHANOPOULOS: The candidates' wives hit the trail this week. Is the women's vote starting to shift? Foreign policy fight. Conservatives question Romney, but he fires back at Obama. (UNKNOWN): What grade would you give President Obama? ROMNEY: Oh, an F. There's no question about that. (UNKNOWN): Across the board? ROMNEY: Across the board. STEPHANOPOULOS: And can't wait for George Will's take on the plan to ban Big Gulps. COLBERT: No more giant sodas? Come on. This is America, the land of plenty. We haven't even achieved Type III diabetes yet. STEWART: Wow, Mayor Bloomberg, wow. I love this idea. It combines the draconian government overreach people love with the probable lack of results they expect. What are you doing? M. OBAMA: I'm going to be out there a lot. I'm going to be traveling around the country. I love campaigning. And I say this all the time. If every American had the opportunity to travel around the country and go into people's living rooms and talk, we'd understand that we have so much more in common. A. ROMNEY: If Mitt wins, the country wins. If Mitt loses, the country loses. I really believe that. There is a sense in the country that we are in danger and that we have got to turn this country around. STEPHANOPOULOS: Michelle Obama, Ann Romney out there this week. We're back with our roundtable. Want to welcome Donna Brazile to join George Will, Stephanie Cutter from the Obama campaign, Eric Fehrnstrom from the Romney campaign. And, Stephanie, let me begin with you. On the women's vote itself, you see both campaigns going out hard at it. We had a new poll come out at ABC this week on Governor Romney's favorability. It showed a huge shift in the women's vote. He had gone about a 20-point shift in the last month now, only trailing President Obama by about 11 points. It was about 30 back in April. What happened? CUTTER: Well, you know, George, I think that the Republican Party is consolidating around Mitt Romney now that he is the nominee, and that includes Republican women, but different polls show different things. On the same day that poll came out, there was another poll by one of your competitors that showed the gender gap at -- by a bigger margin than we even won it in 2008. And there were two, I think, interesting things about the ABC poll this week that is really telling about where the election is. One, women believe that Barack Obama understands their economic problems more than Mitt Romney does and, number two, that he will take care of the middle class and help grow the middle class compared to Mitt Romney, where they would singled out that he would help the wealthy and financial institutions. And I think that really just symbolizes the debate we're having. How do you grow the economy? Do you grow it from the top down? Or do you grow it from the middle out? FEHRNSTROM: I think women view this election through the prism of their own family. Women, like all Americans, are feeling squeezed by this Obama economy. In many cases, women manage households. They're responsible for paying the bills. And they're scrimping and saving to buy groceries and maybe put a little bit of money aside to send a kid to summer camp. I think it's about not so much themselves, but about their children and whether or not their children will have it better than they did, and they don't believe that's the case today. BRAZILE: Well, George, as you well know, the gender gap is alive, it's real, but there's an larger gender gap between unmarried women and married women. And what's driving the conversation, clearly, is kitchen-table issues, the economy... STEPHANOPOULOS: And Romney coming back among married women. BRAZILE: Well, look, he's coming back, a little consolidation there, but it's not enough, I believe, to break out in a sweat right now. But here's what's important. The economy, very important for women voters, very important for single women out there. And if President Obama can continue to make the case that he has the policies, the right policies, the right ideas to move this economy along, to keep it healing, to keep it to growing, that he'll -- that gender gap will only grow larger. WILL: Isn't there something patronizing and condescending about talking about the -- definite article -- the women's vote, as though it's a simple and big block? You've pointed right there to one division between the married and the unmarried. I think Romney's carrying married women at this point. But there's been a gender gap for election after election after election. But you know how far back into the mists of American history you need to go to find an election cycle when the Republicans carried the women's vote? Twenty months. In 2010 congressional elections, they carried the women's vote. BRAZILE: Well, the gender gap has been alive since 1980. That's when we first saw a difference between how women voted versus men, but the economy is an issue, but also women are showing some hesitation of supporting Republicans based on their own reproductive lives. STEPHANOPOULOS: I want to pick up on that, because there's a pretty remarkable article in New York magazine this week by John Heilemann, went inside the Obama campaign, and included this quote from David Plouffe, the president's chief political strategist inside the White House right now, talking about how they were going to use social issues. I want to bring this to you, Eric Fehrnstrom. Here's what he said. He said, ""We're going to say, let's be clear about what he, Mitt Romney, would do as president. Potentially abortion will be criminalized. Women will be denied contraceptive services. He's far right on immigration. He supports efforts to amend the Constitution to ban gay marriage."" They go on in the article to say, you know, they're going to Mitt Romney as a man of the '50s, retro, backwards, that's not where America wants to go. FEHRNSTROM: Well, good luck with that. Mitt Romney is pro-life. He'll govern as a pro-life president. But you're going to see the Democrats use all sorts of shiny objects to distract people's attention from -- from the Obama performance on the economy. This is not a social issue election, George. This is going to be about the president's handling of the economy. It's a referendum on his performance, and, frankly, right now, he's getting a failing grade. STEPHANOPOULOS: Good luck with that? CUTTER: Well, good luck with that. If it's not a social issue election, then why did Mitt Romney just spend the last year campaigning on social issues? These are his positions that he's taken, whether it's, you know, giving bosses control over whether female employees can get contraception, being for the so-called personhood amendment that would ban all forms of abortion, or, you know, telling the American people that he'll get back to them on whether he supports Lilly Ledbetter, which is an economic issue and it should be a no-brainer, but the governor couldn't even bring himself to be for that. So we agree, the economy is the number-one issue. Women want to see two candidates compete on their visions for the economy, which is what I was getting at before, whether you want to build an economy from the middle out or the top down. STEPHANOPOULOS: So how much do these issues matter? I still can't figure it out listening to you two. CUTTER: Well, I think that for the -- you know, getting rid of Planned Parenthood or the number of other social issues that the governor injected to this campaign, I think women don't like that intrusion. What -- what Mitt Romney is really saying that he's going to do is use government to intrude into their lives, and I think that they resent that. And that's one of the reasons that the gender gap blew up so much during the primaries. FEHRNSTROM: George, it was a year ago yesterday that Mitt Romney went to a small farm in Stratham, New Hampshire, and he announced his candidacy for president. At that time, he laid out the issues that were compelling him to get into the race. Primarily, it was because he didn't believe that this economy was headed in the right direction. He also talked about the massive debt burdens that we were accumulating and would be passing on to our children and our grandchildren. That's why he's running for president, and that's why he's going to win in November. BRAZILE: And, Eric, and that's why he's put forward the same proposals that have gotten us in this fiscal mess that we're in. I mean, a recipe of more tax cuts, more, you know, tax subsidies, that's not going to bring this economy back. It's healing slowly, 27 consecutive months of job growth. Of course, it's not enough jobs, but the fact is, is that Mitt Romney's proposals will add trillions to the deficit, and you haven't addressed that. FEHRNSTROM: Well, Mitt Romney's proposals are in specific reaction to this president's proposals. So, for instance, Governor Romney would construct the Keystone pipeline. That will put thousands of people to work immediately. He will repeal Obamacare. Obamacare is like a wet blanket on the economy. It's inhibiting employers from adding new jobs. These are actions that Governor Romney would take, not that that harkened back to the policies of old, but are in specific reaction to what... STEPHANOPOULOS: George, I think we're seeing something play out, a microcosm here, and I wonder if it's going to tell us something about the campaign. Even when other issues come up, everything does drive back to the economy and the economic issues. WILL: Exactly. Now, Stephanie said a moment ago, the question is whether women can get contraception. The question that we've been litigating in public this spring is whether women can get someone else to pay for their contraception (inaudible) no one is talking about blocking access to contraception. You said people are worried about whether the government will intrude in their private lives. No, they're worried about whether the government will intrude into the life of churches, such as the Catholic Church. So these issues tend to explode and damage almost everyone, which is why at the end of the day we're all going to swerve back to the question of who's going to put us to work. BRAZILE: Well, there's been so many attacks on women, George, and it's -- and it's not just out of Washington and the Republicans. It's in states all over the country. I mean, it's -- there's been so many attacks on women, one would think that the Republicans would at some point just cease. I mean, the attacks on Planned Parenthood, the Republicans have always said that they are parents. So what is it you're against, planning? WILL: When did -- since when did Planned Parenthood become a synonym for American women? BRAZILE: Because Planned Parenthood proves a broad range of reproductive health services for women, life-saving medicine, mammograms. This is about, of course, testing for diabetes and so many other important programs. That's why the attacks on Planned Parenthood has alarmed so many women in this country. STEPHANOPOULOS: Each man is also running to be commander-in-chief. President Obama, of course, already is commander-in-chief. And, Stephanie, you saw that -- a clip we played right before we went to commercial, Governor Romney the other day giving President Obama an F on everything, including foreign policy. Your response? CUTTER: Well, I think that it's what Colin Powell said of Mitt Romney's foreign policy. You know, Mitt, think. Get real. And I think, you know, Mitt Romney saying that Barack Obama gets an F is one of the most ridiculous things that he has said in this race. Let's just go over the president's record, ended the war in Iraq in a responsible way. We're on track to end the war in Afghanistan. We crippled Al Qaida and brought bin Laden to justice. You know, he led to topple Gadhafi and protect the people of Libya. You know, that's just a sample of what he's done. Now, Mitt Romney calls Russia our greatest geopolitical foe. You know, that's what you were saying before, about going backwards instead of forwards, that he would go back to the '50s to talk about Russia as our worst geopolitical foe. And on -- you know, of the bluster that we hear from Governor Romney, whether it's criticizing our Iraq policy and promising that he would leave troops on the ground in Iraq, with no promise of ending the war, or the number of different proposals he put out on Afghanistan, again, with no promise to end the war, or, you know, stating that he wouldn't move having the nerve (ph) to get bin Laden. I think that the governor is picking the wrong fight in this election if he's going to take on Barack Obama on foreign policy. FEHRNSTROM: Look, the killing of bin Laden was a great achievement for America. Governor Romney credited the president for that. He also gave credit to the intelligence agencies that were involved in searching him out and, of course, to the members of the military, he carried out that mission. But the measure of America's foreign policy is, how strong is our influence in the world? And our influence is dependent on two things: our economic strength and on our military strength. Now, we know how weak this economy is. We've added unprecedented levels of new debt. And in terms of the military, we are on a path under this president to cut $1 trillion over the next 10 years. It is a combination of this weak economy and a hollowed-out military... FEHRNSTROM: ... that is emboldening our adversaries and weakening our influence around the world. STEPHANOPOULOS: Don't you -- don't you need -- doesn't defense have to be a part of reducing the debt? FEHRNSTROM: One trillion dollars over the next 10 years, that's level of reduction that the secretary of defense called devastating. That needs to be changed. But this president hasn't taken any action at all to stop this sequestration process from happening. STEPHANOPOULOS: Where does this debate go? WILL: Well, it goes to Syria, first of all, which is the fact, do we want to become involved, as we're withdrawing from two wars in the Middle East, do we -- and that region, do we want to get involved in a third, that is, do we want to get involved in a civil war, in a sectarian tribal society? Governor Romney says we should be taking more assertive action to change the Assad regime. I don't know what that means. The question is, what does it mean? FEHRNSTROM: I'll tell you what it means, because he -- he spelled it out. There are -- there are two things that we can say about the opposition in Syria. They're very brave, and they're not going away. What they need is the capacity to wage a fair fight. So what Governor Romney would do is encourage the United States to work with our partners, to identify, organize, and arm the opposition. I mean, these are very brave people, and they're going up against vastly superior forces in Assad's army and have suffered 10,000 losses, just slaughtered by the government. WILL: But a few decades ago, we armed the opposition to the Russians. We armed the Taliban in Afghanistan, and that didn't turn out so well. FEHRNSTROM: Well, of course you -- well, of course you have to be careful in -- in selecting your partners within the opposition. But let's step back for a moment, because for the last year-and-a-half, this president has not engaged in organizing moderate forces within that opposition. So to the extent that there's a vacuum that's being filled by bad actors, that is the president's fault. WILL: But once we start, it's hard to stop. We entered the war -- the civil war in Libya to prevent in Benghazi, one city, a humanitarian disaster. A no-fly zone soon became searching for targets on the ground. We didn't have mission creep; we had mission gallop. And eight months later, we were implicated in changing the regime. How do you stop once you engage? FEHRNSTROM: Well, the governor's not talking about intervention. FEHRNSTROM: What he's talking about is arming the opposition so that there's a level playing field. WILL: That's an intervention. BRAZILE: The chair -- the chair of the House Intelligence Committee and the ranking member believe that that is the wrong strategy, because we simply don't know who they are and exactly what they will do with those weapons. Look, Mr. Assad has turned out to be just like his daddy, a brutal dictator. Kofi Annan has it absolutely right. The Arab League and others in that region have to play a much larger role in trying to end the violence and getting Assad to leave, so the question is not, you know, if he should leave. It's when he should leave. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, and the other question is -- I think George Will pointed up a lot of the questions about the governor's plan -- but what more can President Obama do right now to help push Assad out? CUTTER: Well, we're doing everything possible to isolate that regime, whether it's leading the world to expel Syrian diplomats from our allied countries, you know, tough sanctions on Syria, everything we can to isolate and move the U.N. towards taking action. And, you know, the president is committing to toppling the regime in Syria, but we have to do it in a responsible way that protects our own interests. And, you know, as Donna said, the House Intelligence Committee, which actually knows what it's talking about here, disagrees with Governor Romney about arming the opposition. If you arm the opposition, then you are responsible for wherever those arms end up. And I don't think we know that yet. STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's take a quick break. Right now, we'll be back with the roundtable in just 60 seconds. Michael Bloomberg and John Edwards, he avoids jail, what's next? EDWARDS: I don't think God's through with me. I really believe he thinks there's still some good things I can do. BUSH: Thank you so much for inviting our rowdy fans to my hanging. When the British burned the White House, Dolly Madison famously saved this portrait of the first George W. Now, Michelle, if anything happens, there's your man. And I'm also pleased, Mr. President, that when you are wandering these halls as you wrestle with tough decisions, you will now be able to gaze at this portrait and ask, ""What would George do?"" STEPHANOPOULOS: A relaxed and funny George W. Bush at the White House this week, as his portrait was unveiled. We're back with a roundtable, and I guess quite different scene from Greensboro, North Carolina, where John Edwards left the courtroom, not guilty on one charge, hung jury on five others of campaign fraud. And when he came out for the first time, he mentioned his daughter, Quinn, who he had with Rielle Hunter. EDWARDS: Finally, my precious Quinn, who I love more than any of you could ever imagine. And I am so close to and so, so grateful for, so grateful for Quinn. STEPHANOPOULOS: Donna Brazile, the first time he had mentioned her in public. He does avoid any jail time, almost certain that the Justice Department is not going to bring this again. I talked to several of the jurors on Friday. They didn't even think it was a particularly close case. But can he really come back? You know, he had that phrase saying God is not finished with me yet, a little Jesse Jackson there. BRAZILE: Well, if he's listening to God, I hope it humbles him and that he spends as much time as possible being a good dad to all of his kids and a good man. John Edwards was caught up in a series of lies, lies that he could never unravel and lies that perhaps destroyed his family, but clearly destroyed his public reputation. I don't know if there's a road to redemption. I hope so, because I believe in redemption. But I think for now, John Edwards would be wise just to mellow, chill, and just be with his family. STEPHANOPOULOS: And, George Will, maybe -- maybe the same advice for the Justice Department's public integrity (inaudible) some of the jurors I spoke to thought the case shouldn't have even been brought. And they've had a pretty bad run. WILL: They have. But I'm glad they did bring this to trial, because I think it served two public functions. The first is the jury, by acquitting him and by hanging on other issues, said essentially that the rule of law presupposes that the law will give the citizen due notice of what behavior is mandatory and what is proscribed. And they said in this case, who knows? And that's the second point. This case dramatized how baroque and murky the laws encrusting our political activities have now become. It's not unusual, as you know, for a campaign to spend 15 percent of its money on lawyers, just to try and decipher this. STEPHANOPOULOS: How careful are you two now on anything dealing with, you know, the crossover between campaign -- well, you're both in the campaigns right now. Do you think about that, the idea that at some point lawyers or somebody might be looking? CUTTER: Well, I mean, I agree with George that our campaign finance laws are arcane and complicated, and you need to be careful. We obviously have lawyers working on the campaign to ensure that we're doing everything by the book. So I can't speak for Eric, if he's talking to lawyers at all. FEHRNSTROM: Well, in terms of campaign finance, of course, there are -- there are lawyers associated with the campaign that make sure that the raising of funds is all done according to law and regulation. And I know that, you know, there's an effort, constant effort to make sure that the campaigns -- both campaigns -- are in compliance with the law. STEPHANOPOULOS: And it's not easy. I want to get to one more issue before we go. Michael Bloomberg this week banning the sale of 16 -- anything over 16 ounces of soda in movie theaters, restaurants (inaudible) got that ad right there in the New York Times. It says he's the nanny. And, George, I got to -- I got to confess, the minute I heard about this plan from -- from Michael Bloomberg, the first person I thought about was you... WILL: Let me read you what Michael Bloomberg said, because in one sentence, he's got the essence of contemporary liberalism, that is something preposterous and something sinister. Listen to this. We're not taking away anyone's right to do things. Could have fooled me. We're simply forcing you to understand. Now, that's modern liberalism, the delight in bossing people around, the kind of irritable gesture that'll have no public... STEPHANOPOULOS: But it is a massive problem, George. Obesity is a problem across the country. WILL: Of course it is. And regulating the size of these drinks at some outlets will do nothing about it. By the way, the sale of sugary, carbonated sodas has fallen 24 percent since 1990. The American people are getting the word on this. But what this really says is -- what Bloomberg is saying, the government helps with your health care, the government's implicated in your health, therefore, we own you, therefore, the government can fine-tune all the decisions you make pertinent to your health. STEPHANOPOULOS: You're free to buy two, I guess. BRAZILE: We have a public health crisis. Obesity is a national problem. I don't think you can solve it by banning one of many sugary things out there. And besides, people will just cross over the Hudson and get a big gulp over there. I don't drink sodas, George. We had Kool-Aid growing up, so I never developed a habit. But... STEPHANOPOULOS: That's got about twice as much sugar as soda, right? BRAZILE: Well, not the way we made it in Louisiana. WILL: But this is one of the reasons liberals are so enamored of the issue of climate change. They say all our behavior in some way affects the climate. Therefore, the government -- meaning, we, liberals, the party of government -- can fine-tune all your behavior right down to the light bulbs you use. STEPHANOPOULOS: Wow, the leap from soda to climate change. Donna, you get the last word, 10 seconds. BRAZILE: George, all I could tell you is that this is a very serious concern and I commend the mayor for raising it and also giving you something to drink about. STEPHANOPOULOS: George Will, Donna Brazile, Stephanie Cutter, Eric Fehrnstrom, thank you all very much. Terrific roundtables today. And we will be right back. STEPHANOPOULOS: I'll be back to answer the questions you had for us this week, but first, we honor our fellow Americans who serve and sacrifice. This week, the Pentagon released the names of 13 servicemembers killed in Afghanistan. STEPHANOPOULOS: Finally today, ""Your Voice This Week,"" where you ask the questions. And today's comes from Edison Palmer. How do you choose the folks on the panel? George Will is great. Well, I couldn't agree more. That's why George has been kicking off the roundtable for more than 30 years. And each week, we look for a mix of guests with different points of view who also have George brings to the table, a strong voice backed by solid reporting, research and experience. We want a lively and informed debate that makes you want to join in and continue the conversation at home. That's what we aim for. Let us know when we hit and when we miss. And we'll be right back with a look at the Queen's Jubilee. STEPHANOPOULOS: That's all for us today. Check out ""World News"" with David Muir tonight. And look at this. Just moments ago, the queen arrived at Chelsea Pier in London for her Jubilee pageant. As we leave you this morning, enjoy this look at the pageant as it winds its way down the River Thames, 1,000 boats there celebrating for the queen. And don't forget that tomorrow on ""GMA,"" Robin Roberts and Lara Spencer anchor live coverage of the Jubilee from London. Thanks for sharing part of your Sunday with us. I'll see you tomorrow on ""GMA."""		1

MWC photo by Mike Leischner.Tony Evers with WSAU's Mike LeischnerWAUSAU, WI (WSAU) -- State Superintendent of Schools and Democratic candidate for Governor Tony Evers held a campaign fundraiser in Wausau Friday, during which he questioned the proposed program restructuring at the University of Wisconsin Stevens Point.“Education continues to be a real flash-point,” said Evers. “People that I talk to are very concerned about the future of not only public schools but also our University system.” He says while he agrees that it may be time for officials at the Stevens Point campus to reconsider some of their course offerings to meet the need of today’s employers, he does think the cuts are coming in some of the wrong areas. “There has to be some sort of compromise here. Whether its political science, social studies, English, all those courses help young people become good adults. [They teach] creative thinking, collaboration, and creativity.”What concerns Evers most is the way it seems that the University is devaluing the humanities courses. “I know that’s not their intent, but that is what people believe.” He would like to see more dialog before the final cuts are made. “When we’re up against it because of lack of funds, people can make bad decisions. We have to make sure this isn’t a bad decision.”He added that the state hasn’t kept up with their share of funding for the entire UW system, which he feels has helped put the schools in this crunch. He says the same has happened to K-12 education as well, which he’s seen firsthand as part of his position as the state Superintendent. “We are nowhere near where we were before and we need to make sure that we have [education] as a top priority.”He called Governor Walker’s recent increase in sparsity aid payments a “one year flash,” adding that the increase in funding seemed to be “a little bit of an anomaly” in an election year.Evers added that funding for roads would also be one of his top priorities if elected, citing cases in Northern Wisconsin where some roads are having the pavement stripped out because there’s no funding to main them. He would also like to see the state access federal Medicaid funds to help bring down the cost of health insurance for everyone.Hear the full conversation with WSAU’s Mike Leischner at the link above.More From Local		1
http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/29/michael-doherty/sen-mike-doherty-says-minority-new-jersey-income-e/	"	""The top 1 percent of income earners pay 40 percent of all state income taxes, and those at the bottom pay little or nothing."""	true	['Taxes']	http://blog.nj.com/	http://blog.nj.com/njv_guest_blog/2011/05/divide_money_equally_among_all.html	2011/06/29	State Sen. Michael J. Doherty (R-Warren) says if funding was divided equally among all New Jersey students, it would increase school funding for 85 percent of the state's towns.By Michael J. DohertyNew Jersey has the most expensive public school system in the country. Unfortunately, the members of the state Supreme Court do not believe that spending more per child than the rest of America is enough, and the court may order that even more money be spent for schools.The New Jersey Constitution states that the Legislature — and the Legislature alone — shall provide for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of free public schools. By what authority does the court issue a mandate concerning education funding levels?If the members of the Supreme Court want to legislate, then they have the right, like every other citizen, to run for the Legislature. In doing so, they can place their agenda before the voters and the voters will decide. That’s democracy. What we have now is judicial tyranny.The Supreme Court seems to pick and choose what sections of the constitution are relevant. Why does the court ignore the portion of the constitution that states the fund for the support of free public schools “shall be annually appropriated to the support of free public schools, and for the equal benefit of all the people of the state?” This section of the constitution does not say that any town or group should get special consideration. The word “equal” means just that — equal. Why does the Supreme Court order the Legislature to violate the clear language of the constitution?In 1976, New Jersey instituted a state income tax to provide sufficient funding for our public schools. After the income tax is collected, it is distributed to towns as school aid. New Jersey’s income tax rate is very progressive. The top 1 percent of income earners pay 40 percent of all state income taxes, and those at the bottom pay little or nothing.Our progressive income tax accounts for economic differences among our residents. Those individuals who make more, pay more; those individuals who make less, pay less. When the income tax fund (i.e. the school fund) is collected progressively, shouldn’t the money be distributed equally to each student regardless of where that student lives or the economic status of that student’s family? Didn’t the progressive income tax already account for wealth differences?A comparison of one suburban town, Clinton Township, and a former Abbott district, Asbury Park, shows how unequal the system has become. According to the latest state figures, the 13,299 residents of Clinton Township paid $29.8 million in state income tax, or about $2,240 per person, and the 11,758 residents of Asbury Park paid $3.8 million in state income taxes, or about $326 per person. Thus, the residents of Clinton Township paid seven times more per person into the income tax fund.And how did New Jersey distribute the income tax as school aid for our children? Asbury Park received $55 million for its 2,316 students, or about $23,753 per student. Clinton Township received $583,547 for its 1,591 students, or about $367 per student. Each student in Asbury Park received 65 times more school aid than a student in Clinton Township.For every dollar in income tax Clinton Township sends to Trenton, it gets back 2 cents in school funding, and for every dollar Asbury Park sends to Trenton, it gets back $14.34 in school funding.Unfortunately, the residents of Clinton Township are not alone. There are more than 185 towns in New Jersey that receive 10 cents or less in school funding for every dollar in income tax sent to Trenton.In spite of this massive transfer of wealth, organizations such as the Education Law Center claim that it is not enough and they have instituted yet another lawsuit before the Supreme Court demanding even more money. Why should the residents of Clinton Township be asked to pay more? Can anyone make this argument with a straight face?New Jersey must adopt a simple, transparent system for funding our schools. I propose dividing the income tax fund equally for each student, as required by the constitution. That would mean $7,481 for each student, regardless of where the student lives. This proposal would increase school funding for 85 percent of New Jersey’s towns.Michael J. Doherty is a Republican state senator representing Warren County.Most Read		1

This is Nixon/Watergate. President Trump’s explosive allegation that former president Barack Obama wiretapped him is based on — what? That has been the question ever since Trump sent provocative early-morning tweets over the weekend, because he and his staff have provided no evidence. At The Fact Checker, we require the accuser to provide the evidence for a dramatic claim. We asked Saturday and received no answer. However, in calling for a congressional investigation of apparent Russian meddling in the election to also look into Trump’s allegation, White House press secretary Sean Spicer on March 5 referred to “reports concerning potentially politically motivated investigations.” That suggests the tweets were based on media reports, not information the president might have received from inside the government. Our colleague Robert Costa has reported that White House aides have internally circulated an article on Breitbart titled “Mark Levin to Congress: Investigate Obama’s ‘Silent Coup’ vs. Trump.” Breitbart is a right-leaning news organization that is a rather unreliable source of information. Often the material that is published is derivative and twisted in misleading ways. However, a White House spokesman told The Fact Checker that the White House instead is relying on reports “from BBC, Heat Street, New York Times, Fox News, among others.” He provided a list of five articles. Let’s explore the sources of the president’s claim. June 2016: FISA [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act] request. The Obama administration files a request with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to monitor communications involving Donald Trump and several advisers. The request, uncharacteristically, is denied. October: FISA request. The Obama administration submits a new, narrow request to the FISA court, now focused on a computer server in Trump Tower suspected of links to Russian banks. No evidence is found — but the wiretaps continue, ostensibly for national security reasons, Andrew McCarthy at National Review later notes. The Obama administration is now monitoring an opposing presidential campaign using the high-tech surveillance powers of the federal intelligence services. But these data points are not based on reporting by Breitbart. Instead, Breitbart links to a report that appeared in Heat Street, another right-leaning news organization: “EXCLUSIVE: FBI ‘Granted FISA Warrant’ Covering Trump Camp’s Ties To Russia.” It was written by Louise Mensch, a former Tory member of the British Parliament and an independent journalist. This is one of the news reports identified by the White House, and it’s the most important one. This article claimed: “Two separate sources with links to the counter-intelligence community have confirmed to Heat Street that the FBI sought, and was granted, a FISA court warrant in October, giving counter-intelligence permission to examine the activities of ‘U.S. Mensch claimed that the warrant was related to an FBI investigation of a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to two Russian banks — an investigation that apparently went nowhere. Her article makes no mention of a wiretap. “The FISA warrant was granted in connection with the investigation of suspected activity between the server [in Trump Tower] and two banks, SVB Bank and Alfa Bank. However, it is thought in the intelligence community that the warrant covers any ‘US person’ connected to this investigation, and thus covers Donald Trump and at least three further men who have either formed part of his campaign or acted as his media surrogates,” Mensch wrote. (Note: While Heat Street says the server in question is in Trump Tower, other reports have suggested the server actually was located in Philadelphia. The Washington Post for months has sought to confirm this report of a FISA warrant related to the Trump campaign but has been unable to do so. Presumably, other major news organizations have tried to do so as well. So one has to take this claim with a huge dose of skepticism. Indeed, the New York Times reported before the election that the FBI “ultimately concluded that there could be an innocuous explanation, like a marketing email or spam, for the computer contacts” with the Russian banks. Interestingly, as far as we can tell, only two other reports have touched on this FISA claim, and they also have British connections. One is a report in the BBC from January, which the White House cited as a source. Lawyers from the National Security Division in the Department of Justice then drew up an application. They took it to the secret US court that deals with intelligence, the FISA court, named after the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. They wanted permission to intercept the electronic records from two Russian banks. Their first application, in June, was rejected outright by the judge. They returned with a more narrowly drawn order in July and were rejected again. Finally, before a new judge, the order was granted, on 15 October, three weeks before election day. Neither Mr Trump nor his associates are named in the FISA order, which would only cover foreign citizens or foreign entities — in this case the Russian banks. But ultimately, the investigation is looking for transfers of money from Russia to the United States, each one, if proved, a felony offense. A lawyer — outside the Department of Justice but familiar with the case — told me that three of Mr Trump’s associates were the subject of the inquiry. “But it’s clear this is about Trump,” he said. Finally, there was a report in the Guardian, which reported on the supposed June FISA request but could not confirm the October one. The Guardian has learned that the FBI applied for a warrant from the foreign intelligence surveillance (FISA) court over the summer in order to monitor four members of the Trump team suspected of irregular contacts with Russian officials. The FISA court turned down the application asking FBI counter-intelligence investigators to narrow its focus. According to one report, the FBI was finally granted a warrant in October, but that has not been confirmed, and it is not clear whether any warrant led to a full investigation. Separately, McClatchy, in a January article mostly focused on whether money from the Kremlin covertly aided Trump’s campaign, reported one source had confirmed “the FBI had obtained a warrant on Oct. 15 from the highly secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court allowing investigators access to bank records and other documents about potential payments and money transfers related to Russia.” This echoed the BBC report, but is much different than the Heat Street account. The White House provided three other sources. Two, a National Review article and a Fox News interview, are simply derivative of the Heat Street article, with no independent confirmation. (The National Review article first speculated about wiretaps, and was cited by Breitbart.) The third is a New York Times report that intelligence agencies “are examining intercepted communications and financial transactions” as part of a probe of possible links between Russian officials and Trump campaign aides. So what do we have here? Only one article, with British roots, reported that a FISA court order was granted in October to examine possible activity between two Russian banks and a computer server in the Trump Tower. This claim has not been confirmed by U.S. news organizations. Moreover, no article says that Obama requested the order or that it resulted in the tapping of Trump’s phone lines. The server, in fact, may not have even been in Trump Tower. (Our colleague Ellen Nakashima reported how difficult it is to obtain a wiretap of a U.S. Moreover, the articles do not support the White House’s claim that these were “potentially politically motivated investigations” led by Obama. The articles all suggest that the FISA requests — if they happened — were done by the intelligence agencies and the FBI. Last April, the CIA director was shown intelligence that worried him. It was — allegedly — a tape recording of a conversation about money from the Kremlin going into the US presidential campaign. It was passed to the US by an intelligence agency of one of the Baltic States. The CIA cannot act domestically against American citizens so a joint counter-intelligence task force was created. We should also note that a spokesman for Obama has denied the allegation that the former president ordered a wiretap on Trump. Moreover, James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence under Obama, told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday that in the national intelligence activity he oversaw, “there was no such wiretap activity mounted against the president, the president-elect at the time, as a candidate or against his campaign.” Clapper said as intelligence director he would have known about a “FISA court order on something like this. Update: FBI Director James B. Comey asked the Justice Department to issue a statement refuting President Trump’s claim that Obama ordered a wiretap of Trump’s phones before the election, U.S. officials told news organizations. Update, March 6: Mensch, the author of the Heat Street article cited by the White House, tweeted she never reported there was wiretap and instead pointed the finger at Breitbart (which as we noted above, appears not to have done independent reporting). BBC, @McClatchyDC, @JulianBorger and I, none of us report wire at Trump Tower, just warrant. If there IS one, who leaked to @BreitbartNews? While the Trump White House cited five news reports to justify its request for a congressional investigation, only two actually are relevant. It’s certainly ironic that the Trump White House — which has heavily criticized articles relying on anonymous sources — now relies on articles based on anonymous sources that cite information that has not been confirmed by any U.S. news organization. It would be amusing if it were not so sad. After all, Clapper, who presumably would be aware of a FISA court order, has issued an on-the-record denial. Even if these media reports are accepted as accurate, neither back up Trump’s claims that Obama ordered the tapping of his phone calls. Moreover, they also do not back up the administration’s revised claim of politically motivated investigations. We’re still waiting for the evidence. In the meantime, Trump earns Four Pinocchios. Update, Sept. 22: After CNN reported that the U.S. government wiretapped former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, some readers asked us to reconsider this ruling, saying he was vindicated. We still found no evidence to support Trump’s claim and reaffirmed the Four-Pinocchio ruling. The beginning of the president’s term has featured controversial executive orders and frequent conflicts with the media. Wait 1 second to continue. “How low has President Obama gone to tapp [sic] my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate.		0

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/23/chris-dodd/Dodd-flip-flop-AIG-bonuses/	On whether he wrote a provision that allowed AIG to dole out bonuses.	full flop	['Economy']	http://www.nytimes.com/	http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/nyregion/20dodd.html?scp=1&sq=chris%20dodd%20a.i.g.&st=cse	2009/03/23	Mr. Dodd said that his staff revised the bill at the urging of Treasury officials, who he said were concerned that the compensation limits, which he had written in the original legislation, went too far and might invite lawsuits. While he knew the language was being rewritten, the senator said he had no idea the revision would allow for the bonuses at A.I.G. “Had I known at the time that there were any A.I.G. bonuses involved — that this was somehow going to assist in that matter — I would have rejected it completely,” he said. On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. The fierce reaction back in his home state, however, underscores the peril the usually politically invulnerable senator faces. In dozens of interviews, residents said they were appalled by Mr. Dodd’s ties to financial firms and believed that he had damaged himself as he prepares to run for re-election next year. Even some who have been steadfast supporters worry that after 28 years in the Senate, Mr. Dodd, 64, has been seduced by the power of Washington and grown distant from his constituents in this heavily Democratic state, which has been hit hard by the economic downturn. “What he needs to do is try to get some jobs out here for people,” said Henry Ford, 44, a painter from New Haven. This week’s uproar was triggered largely by Mr. Dodd himself, when he provided conflicting answers about the provision that allowed the bonuses at A.I.G. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the company’s employees, political action committees and subsidiaries have made campaign contributions of nearly $300,000 to Mr. Dodd since 1989. Initially, Mr. Dodd said he did not know how the loophole got into the legislation that sought to crack down on executive compensation. But then in an interview Wednesday with CNN, he acknowledged that his staff helped write the revisions after receiving a request from the Treasury Department. Newspaper headlines that greeted morning commuters throughout Connecticut on Thursday underscored Mr. Dodd’s problems. “Dodd’s Flip-Flop,” declared The Hartford Courant. “Dodd Takes Bonus Blame,” announced The Advocate of Stamford. “Dodd Admits Bonuses Role,” trumpeted The Norwich Bulletin.

You are already subscribed to this email. The firestorm has encouraged Republicans, who see an opportunity to pick up a Senate seat in next year’s election. Last week, Quinnipiac University released a poll showing Mr. Dodd trailing former Representative Rob Simmons, who has jumped into the race, railing against the senator’s ties to the financial industry. “He is certainly out of touch with Connecticut,” Mr. Simmons said in an interview. The problem for Mr. Dodd is that the A.I.G. affair is just the latest episode in which he has been accused of being too chummy with powerful corporate executives. Last year, he was criticized for receiving preferential treatment from Countrywide Financial Corporation after it was disclosed that the mortgage lender assigned him to a V.I.P. program in 2003 when he refinanced mortgages on his homes in Connecticut and Washington. Mr. Dodd insisted he had done nothing wrong, saying that he did not get favorable pricing from the lender. But the issue was politically explosive, given that Countrywide and its executives had been criticized for contributing to the national housing crisis with aggressive subprime lending. A short-lived presidential run, during which he moved his family to Iowa, did not help either, leaving some in Connecticut feeling that he abandoned the state for a quixotic adventure. “To be very honest with you, I thought he was nuts,” said Mary Spaulding, 79, a retired nurse from Waterford, who said she had always supported the senator, but would not do so again. “I think in Connecticut, a lot of people are very frustrated with him,” she said. The backlash is a remarkable development for a senator once known for championing populist initiatives like the 1993 Family Leave Act. Elected to the Senate in 1980, Mr. Dodd is the longest-serving senator in the state’s history and has won all his re-elections by sizable margins. Troy Beers of New London remembered how he felt in 1985, when the senator spoke at his graduation from Ella T. Grasso Southeastern Technical High School in Groton and took a moment to shake his hand. “He was inspiring back then,” said Mr. Beers, 41, a lifelong Democrat who is unemployed. “Now, he’s a dinosaur. That sentiment was echoed by Jasmine Coleman, 21, of New Britain, whose mother’s house went through foreclosure last year. Ms. Coleman, a Democrat, expressed dismay over Mr. Dodd’s connection with A.I.G. “I can’t believe he actually approved of that,” she said, as she shopped in Meriden with her two small sons. “For them to get bailed out, it’s just not fair. I’m from New Britain, and every street has at least three houses going through foreclosures. People are poor. Unemployment is a problem.

Ron Johnson for supporting Donald Trump for president.Speaking to reporters on Milwaukee's north side, Feingold reacted to a new TV spot by Johson that's critical of Feingold and his Progressives United PAC.Titled ""In It for Himself,"" the ad says that in 2011 Feingold, a former three-term senator, set up Progressives United and that ""it was supposed to support candidates.""""But that's not what he did,"" the ad continues, focusing on how Progressives United gave only 5% of its income to federal candidates. The ad refers to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article and the headline, ""Russ Feingold's PAC funded fees, salaries for former staffers, himself,"" and other news accounts.The ad is part of a seven-figure TV buy that will take the Johnson campaign to election day. The Johnson campaign has sought to portray Feingold as a career politician who says one thing and does another.Feingold told reporters:“Very clear. It's simply false. It's intentionally misleading and they know that because they don’t want to talk about the fact that Senator Johnson not only loves the current finance system, but he is the one who is benefiting from several super PACs. And I am not.""During their second debate, Johnson claimed Progressives United was ""basically a money-making machine,"" that spent a sizable chunk of money on salaries.Responding to a question about Johnson's support for Trump, Feingold said politicians at this stage in the election should be putting politics aside for the country.""Look, this is a time when people have to put their country first over their political party or their political future and a number of other Republican senators who are in tough elections for re-election have had the decency to say, ‘Look, of course, I am not going to support Trump. He shouldn’t be president.’ ”Johnson has distanced himself from Trump but says that he and Trump are both ""change agents."" Johnson campaigned in Eau Claire and Wausau Thursday with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina.)Feingold also said he had not been critical of Johnson's involvement with the Joseph Project, an inner-city jobs program in Sheboygan County. Johnson helped launch the project. The year-old program is run out of Greater Praise Church of God in Christ in Milwaukee and helps people with skills like interviewing and resumes.""These programs are very valuable,"" Feingold told reporters on Thursday, adding that help for the disadvantaged requires a multifaceted approach. ""There needs to be much more done to make a community a community,"" Feingold said.In an interview on Wisconsin Public Radio this week, Feingold, said: ""It's not enough to pick people up in a van and send them away a couple hours and have them come back exhausted at the end of the day.""Johnson reacted sharply and said it was ""literally sad"" when someone like Feingold would ""denigrate"" a program that has helped people find employment.On Thursday, Feingold was joined at a rally to get out the vote in Milwaukee's central city by U.S. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) and Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Milwaukee.)Booker, the former mayor of Newark, said that voting and participating in the political process is the antidote to Republican policies aimed at limiting the vote, especially among people of color.Also on Thursday, Johnson released a radio commercial that criticizes a federal judge in December 2014 for suspending state management of the gray wolf population in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan. That has led to a growing number of wolves in northern Wisconsin and the other states and has led to increased conflicts with humans.Johnson says he advanced federal legislation allowing Wisconsin and the other states to manage wolf populations.Published 3:24 p.m. UTC Oct 28, 2016"		1

Today, an exclusive interview with CIA director, John Brennan.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: Fact is, they fooled us, repeatedly, the Iranians.In a wide-ranging interview, we discuss Iran's nuclear program, the growing threat from ISIS and Russian President Putin's global ambitions.As director of the CIA, do you see any indications that Vladimir Putin wants out of Ukraine?Spy master John Brennan from the CIA, only on 'Fox News Sunday.'Then, new tensions between the White House and Israel. After Prime Minister Netanyahu is re-elected.Will the Obama administration let the U.N. recognize a Palestinian state?JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The commitment to that two-state solution has been in a lot of ways sort of a guiding principle. It's pretty clear that Israel is no longer committed to that outcome.WALLACE: Our Sunday group discusses that and our interview with John Brennan.And our power player of the week, Mitt Romney's former campaign manager now leaving the oppo research effort against Democrats.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All these people here are focused on Secretary Clinton. And so, they are tasked day in and day out.WALLACE: All, right now, on FOX NEWS SUNDAY.(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: And hello again from FOX News. Today, at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, this is the agency's iconic entrance here with the CIA seal.In this complex, thousands of officers work around the clock collecting intelligence and directing covert operations to protect the U.S. from foreign threats. But while the CIA is the stuff of spy movies and Tom Clancy novels, in real life, the agency has a unique insight into what's happening in hot spots around the world.Today, we take you inside for a rare and exclusive interview with the man who heads the spy agency, Director John Brennan.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: Director, we're here in the CIA's private museum. Tell us about this model next to us.JOHN BRENNAN, CIA DIRECTOR: Well, first of all, welcome, Chris, to our museum that we're quite proud of. This is the model of the compound in Abbottabad that Osama bin Laden was hiding for years in a number of years. And that was the site of the takedown of bin Laden.But despite the detail that you see in the outside, there's still a lot we didn't know at the time as far as the inside of the building and what bin Laden and his cohorts might have planned in terms of blowing up the building and confronting any type of force that would come in.WALLACE: Let's talk about a current threat, Iran. What if the talks fall apart and there is no deal? What's your best intelligence? Will Iran race to develop a nuclear weapon? Or are they more likely to go back to where we were before the talks, just a couple of months short of breakout?BRENNAN: The nuclear program is one issue that we're hoping to be able to halt, but also we see that Iran is still a state-sponsored terrorism. So what we have to do -- whether there's a deal or not -- is to continue to keep pressure on Iran and to make sure that it is not able to continue to destabilize a number of countries in the region.WALLACE: I want to get into that in a moment. On the deal, what's your guess what happens if there is no deal? Do they breakout or do they stay just short of that?BRENNAN: I think they realize there will be tremendous costs and consequences and implications if they were to decide to go for a breakout. There are a number of things that the United States has available to it to prevent Iran from getting a bomb. President Obama has made it very clear that we are going to prevent Iran from having that type of nuclear weapon that they may were going on the track to obtain.So, if they decide to go down that route, they know that they will do so at their peril.WALLACE: On the other hand, if there is a deal, the big question is, can we verify that Iran is living up to that deal?Here is what Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu told Congress.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: Iran not only defies inspectors, it also plays a pretty good game of hide and cheats with them.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Question, how confident are you that between the new inspections regime under the agreement and your intelligence in the area that you would be able to ensure that Iran was not secretly building a nuclear weapon?BRENNAN: It's not a question of trusting the Iranians on this. I know that Secretary Kerry and President Obama are comfortable with what it is that we are insisting on as far as a verification regime.WALLACE: But, frankly, our track record when it comes to Iran and its nuclear program is not good. Iranian opposition groups in 2002 were the ones that revealed that the regime had secret facilities at Natanz in Iraq. One of your predecessors, Michael Hayden, says that they had done a lot of work at Fordo before we knew about it.Fact is, they fooled us, repeatedly, the Iranians.BRENNAN: And I think we've gone to school on some of those developments over the last decade or so, so that we can now have a better plan and opportunity to verify some of the things that they are saying they are going to do and not do.WALLACE: Are you aware of an underground site near Tehran called Lavizan-3?BRENNAN: I know that there are a lot of reports. I'm not going to get into what it is we know about the Iran nuclear program. But I am confident that our intelligence capabilities are sufficiently robust that we have a good understanding of what the Iranian nuclear program entails.WALLACE: Well, the reason I ask is Iranian opposition groups say that there is a secret nuclear facility there that we haven't known about.BRENNAN: I think we have confidence that we're aware of the facilities that Iran has right now, and there's going to be a lot of speculation and rumors about other facilities. But, again, I'm confident that right now, we have a good appreciation of what the Iranian nuclear program consists of.WALLACE: What is the danger of nuclear arms race across the Middle East? Top Saudi officials, including former intel chief, Prince Turki al Faisal, say if there's a deal, that the Sunni nations are going to match whatever it is we allow the Iranians to do. Doesn't that just lead to an arms race?BRENNAN: We talked to the Gulf partners. We're trying to stay close in touch with them. I believe that they do have confidence that the United States is going to be sort of the security guarantor in that region to prevent this type of escalation that's going to include nuclear weapons.WALLACE: But when you have top Saudi officials say they're going to top what we have Iran have, doesn't that create an arms race?BRENNAN: We continue to have this close dialogue with them, about what it is that we are insisting upon, from the Iranians and the verification system there. So, I'm confident that the Saudis will be a responsible partner and player in the region.WALLACE: Which is a greater threat to the U.S., Iran or ISIS?BRENNAN: I think they're both threats.WALLACE: The reason I ask is Iran's reach -- I don't have to tell you -- is spreading into Iraq, into Syria, into Lebanon, now into Yemen. General Qassam Suleimani, the head of the Quds force, from Iran, is leading the offensive in Tikrit.Here is what you said recently.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRENNAN: There's an alignment of some interest between ourselves and Iran, clearly in terms of what ISIL has done there.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Do you really think that the U.S. and Iran share interests?BRENNAN: I think what's Daesh, ISIL has been doing in the region is something that is counter to U.S. interests as well as counter to Iranian interests. And the Iranians are now engaged with their Iraqi partners to try to push back these forces of terrorism inside of Iraq.So, Iran does have an interest in preventing further Daesh, ISIL terrorist attacks. At the same time, I think they need to be responsible as far as what they're doing inside Iraq and not further inflaming that situation.WALLACE: But your immediate predecessor in this job, General David Petraeus, said this week Iran is not an ally. It's part of the problem, not part of the solution. And Benjamin Netanyahu, when he spoke to Congress, said the enemy of your enemy is not your friend, he is your enemy.BRENNAN: Well, I wouldn't say that Iran is an ally right now. All I'm saying is that the Iranians are pursuing their interests inside of Iraq, some of which include efforts against Daesh and preventing that phenomenon from growing.WALLACE: But the concern is that we're somehow letting Iran back into Iraq and other areas and I understand that we don't have a veto power, but, you know, the concern is that we are letting them play a bigger role --BRENNAN: We're not letting them play that role. I think they're working with the Iraqis to play that role. We're working with the Iraqis as well. And the Iranians are involved as a neighboring state. They clearly have interests there. They're pursuing them.Qassem Suleimani, head of the Quds Force, is somebody who has been very aggressive, very active. There are many things that Qassem Suleimani is further that future destabilizing the situation there. So, I wouldn't concern Iran an ally inside of Iraq right now.What I'm saying is that the forces that Daesh has brought to bare in Iraq generated an Iranian reaction, that they need to make sure they're not pursuing a very parochial and separate agenda from what the Iraqi nation and people need.WALLACE: General Lloyd Austin, the head of the U.S. Central Command, told Congress recently that ISIS is losing. But ISIS is still dug into Iraq and Syria. They now have affiliates across North Africa. They were possibly responsible for these terrible attacks this week in Tunisia and Yemen.Director, can we really say ISIS is losing?BRENNAN: Clearly, ISIS momentum inside of Iraq and Syria has been blunted and it has been stopped. So, they are not on the march as they were several months ago. And so, our working with the Iraqis and the Iraqis now trying to push back against it, it is having some great, I think, progress.At the same time, this phenomenon of Daesh throughout the entire region is something that we need to work with our partners. We see what's happening in other countries, in these franchises that are blowing up in Libya and other areas. They -- they've claimed responsibility for attacks in Tunisia and Yemen.This is something that clearly is not just restricted to Iraq and Syria. So, we cannot relent. We have to continue working with our partners in the region.WALLACE: Here is what you said in 2012.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRENNAN: If the decade before 9/11 was the time of al Qaeda's rise and the decade after 9/11 was the time of its decline, then I believe this decade will be the one that sees its demise.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Director Brennan, weren't you just flat wrong about that?BRENNAN: No. And when we look at al Qaeda and we look at what has happened to al Qaeda and particularly the core of al Qaeda that was in the area of Afghanistan and Pakistan, they have taken some really big hits.WALLACE: But -- but, respectfully, sir, when you were saying this is the decade of al Qaeda's demise, I don't think most people thought you meant, well, yes, but there will be an offshoot called ISIS which spreads across the Middle East.BRENNAN: This phenomenon that Daesh represents right now is a new one. It is one that has grown up in the past two years.WALLACE: But it's an offshoot of al Qaeda.BRENNAN: We've done a lot against al Qaeda. We've been able to push them back. We've been able to prevent their attacks.But there are these offshoots, as you say. This is a phenomenon that we're going to have to deal with. And I do think over the next decade, this is going to be a long, hard fight.WALLACE: I guess what I'm asking is didn't you give the American people -- and the president give the American people a false sense of confidence back in 2012 about our fight against Islamic terrorists at a time, perhaps not so coincidentally, when the president was running for reelection?BRENNAN: What we said was al Qaeda was on the run. We said that al Qaeda was really bloodied and it was not the same organization that it was in 9/11, as well as in the years after that.There was no sense that I think either I or the president or others gave to the American people that terrorism was going away. But we've made great progress against a lot of these groups that had plans in place to carry out attacks.WALLACE: You talked recently of the ideology -- your word -- that fuels ISIS.What is that ideology?BRENNAN: It is a very twisted, perverted interpretation of a religion that they purport to represent, but in no way do they represent. It's an ideology of violence. That's what it is. It is not a religious ideology.WALLACE: Well, Islam is certainly a part of it, isn't it?BRENNAN: They purport to be Muslims. But as I said, the overwhelming majority of Muslims throughout the world roundly denounce and condemn what they're doing. And that's why we should not give them any type of religious legitimacy.WALLACE: This gets to your refusal and the president's refusal to talk about Islamic extremism.Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, former head of The Defense Intelligence Agency, says you can't defeat an enemy unless you define it.And Egyptian President el-Sisi called for a religious revolution recently.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI, EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT: The Muslims have to stand up correct, this misinterpretation and deformed picture of what Islam is.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: If ISIS is selling its ideology, its brand -- twisted brand of Islam to followers and pulling in recruits, don't you have to confront that?BRENNAN: And we are confronting it.WALLACE: So why not say this is a perverted form of Islam and here's what we're doing to stop it, and this is why they're wrong about Islam, instead of ignoring that?BRENNAN: No, I think that's exactly what we have said. It is a corruption of the Islamic faith. It is a distortion of it. It does not represent the Muslim community or Islam.WALLACE: Are you prepared to say they're Islamic extremists?BRENNAN: I'm prepared to say that they are extremists. They're violent terrorists who misrepresent what the Islamic religion is about -- yes, absolutely.WALLACE: What is your read on Russian President Putin? What are his strategic ambitions?BRENNAN: I think President Putin has a view of what sort of Russian nationalism is, that, unfortunately, I think he has put some of the personal interests of himself and some of the senior members of the Russian government ahead of the best interests of the Russian people.And what he needs to understand is that if Russia is going to play the appropriate place in the world, it needs to respect the territorial integrity, as well as the sovereignty and the independence of the countries that are in the region of Russia.WALLACE: Haven't we misread Putin throughout the Ukraine crisis?President Obama kept talking about giving Putin off ramps. But in a -- a movie on the first anniversary of the invasion, Putin said that he always saw Crimea as part of Russia and that he was even willing to put nuclear forces on alert.He never had any intention of backing down.BRENNAN: I think Mr. Putin has demonstrated that he's going to continue to push as far as what his objectives are inside of Ukraine. And I think it is --WALLACE: So, wasn't it naive to even talk about off ramps?BRENNAN: No. I think what Mr. Putin himself needs to do is to understand how he can extract himself from this situation, because it is coming at the cost of the Russian economy and the Russian people being hurt.WALLACE: But he's happy with this situation.BRENNAN: I don't believe he's happy with the situation.WALLACE: As director of the CIA, do you see any indications that Vladimir Putin wants out of Ukraine?BRENNAN: I see that what we need to do is to continue to put pressure on Mr. Putin so that the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian government can have a future that is going to be peaceful and safe and secure.WALLACE: But you see any sign he's looking for an off ramp?BRENNAN: I think that there are signs that discomfort that is associated with this is becoming more uncomfortable.(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: When we come back, more of our exclusive interview with CIA director, John Brennan. Why was his agency surprised by the spread of ISIS and Putin's move on Ukraine? And did the enhanced interrogation of terror suspects after 9/11 produce key information or not?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRENNAN: I cannot determine cause and effect that it was only for the use of those EITs that those individuals provided information.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: More of our conversation as FOX NEWS SUNDAY continues from inside the CIA.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: And we're back inside CIA headquarters, just across the river from Washington, with more of our exclusive interview with Director John Brennan.The spy agency has gotten a lot of things right over its 68-year history, most notably tracking down Osama bin Laden. In recent years, critics say they've been surprised repeatedly by global events.And that's where we picked up our conversation with Director Brennan.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: Director Brennan, President Obama says the intelligence community underestimated ISIS' spread during the early part of 2014. Other officials say that you made the same mistake when it came to the spread of the Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen and the general belief was before he invaded that Putin wasn't going to go into Ukraine.Why did -- do those misjudgments happen?BRENNAN: Our ability to evaluate some of things is limited if we don't have the presence, if we don't have the insights and capabilities.But I think we've done a very good job over the course of time, identifying some of these new waves that have come through. But intelligence is not a perfect science. It is one that is based on the intelligence information we get, the insights, the assessments.And what we try to do is to give policymakers a sense of these developments as they unfold.WALLACE: But critics would say are we getting enough? Are we getting our money's worth for the billions we spend on intelligence? Aren't those serious mistakes?BRENNAN: No, the world is a complicated place. There are a number of developments that are going on right now in countries that unfold with, I think, great speed as well as a result of some of the actions that individual leaders take. And unfortunately, the challenges that government faced in a number of these countries are significant.WALLACE: Speaking of misjudgments, a special national intelligence estimate concluded that the pullout by President Obama of all of our troops from Iraq in December of 2011 helped set the stage for the spread of ISIS.Wasn't the pullout a mistake?BRENNAN: I think the fault really lies with a number of the Iraqis who wasted and squandered the opportunity they had after the government was reconstituted, not to put at rest some of these sectarian tensions and not to be more inclusive as far as bringing the Sunni community in.WALLACE: But what about the special national intelligence estimate that the pullout of U.S. troops contributed?BRENNAN: Clearly, U.S. military forces provide a tremendous capability to our partners, whether it be in Iraq or other countries.But it really is up to these countries' military security and intelligence forces to step up.WALLACE: Last year, U.S. drone attacks killed at least 138 Al Qaeda operatives.Isn't part of the problem that we now have a policy where we basically kill these terrorists instead of capturing them and so we lose the intelligence that they could provide?BRENNAN: I think we have said over and over that if we have the opportunity to capture terrorists, simply working with a lot of our partners overseas, we will do that.And there have been countless terrorists who have been captured, who have been arrested and detained, who have been debriefed and are providing intelligence and insights into those terrorist organizations.WALLACE: Experts tell me that -- that when opposite -- when other countries catch these guys, they slit their throats. We don't get any intelligence.BRENNAN: Well, I think those experts are wrong, because we are working with our partners and we're making sure that they do not do things like that and if we find that there are indications that they're doing this, we take action against them.WALLACE: You were one of the key players in the take-down of Osama bin Laden. And from this compound here, Navy SEALS were able to recover one and a half -- an estimated one and a half million documents.Why have only 25 been released to the public?BRENNAN: There is a process underway for the release of those documents. There's also been quite --WALLACE: It's been almost three years.BRENNAN: Yes. And there's also quite a bit of exploitation of information that was obtained in that raid that has assisted greatly our efforts against the terrorists that are out there.We'll continue to do that and exploit that.WALLACE: But I guess the question is, if you have scrubbed them so thoroughly and if it's -- it's now four years later, can't more than 25 be released to the American people?BRENNAN: Sometimes these things take time, and we need to make sure that the resources are dedicated to that effort as well as dedicated to keeping the American people safe.WALLACE: There are reports that one of the reasons these documents aren't being released is because a number of them show that al Qaeda was not in decline, was on the on the run, as it was being portrayed in 2012 -- but, in fact, was a very active operation.BRENNAN: That's hogwash. If anybody believes that we're withholding documents because we believe that would be embarrassing, that is just absolutely wrong.WALLACE: You recently created a new division here in the CIA, the directorate of digital innovation.Has cyber become the new frontline in the contest between nations and terrorist groups?BRENNAN: The CIA has an obligation to make sure we're able to work in all the various domains, the physical domain, maritime, aviation. But the digital domain has continued to grow and evolve. That digital domain is going to be used by terrorist groups and others, proliferators, to be able to communicate, to be able to incite, encourage, use propaganda and communicate.And so, CIA, as well as our other intelligence agencies, really need to master that domain as a way to protect the American people.WALLACE: Speaking of mastering that domain, was the U.S. behind the massive Internet outage in North Korea last December after the hacking of Sony?BRENNAN: The North Korean system is fraught with a number of sort of challenges, because it is a country that, unfortunately, has put its pursuit of military capabilities in front of what the best interests are of the people.And so, there is an infrastructure there that is rickety, there are challenges that they face on a technical front. So there are a lot of reasons why the North Korean people and the Internet system out there has problems.WALLACE: Did the U.S. give a little shake to the rickety North Korean system?BRENNAN: I'm not going to address anything that we may have done in that instance, and I'm not acknowledging anything at all here. What I'm saying is --WALLACE: But you're not denying it either?BRENNAN: You can raise any question about what might happen worldwide, or I'm not either going to confirm nor deny it.WALLACE: We began, you and I, talking about this interview last summer, at a time when the Senate intelligence agency was investigating the enhanced interrogations that were carried out after 9/11.And one of the key issues was whether or not the agency exaggerated the effectiveness of the EITs.Did enhanced interrogation play a role in our being able to track down Osama bin Laden?BRENNAN: I cannot determine cause and effect, that it was only for the use of those EITs that those individuals provided information. But the take-down of bin Laden at that compound was the result of tedious work that was done by counterterrorism experts that were able to tap into the information that was provided by individuals who were in detention and that the CIA debriefed.WALLACE: How badly did the criticism coming 12 years after 9/11 of what this agency did, a very different time, a very different place -- how badly did that damage the morale of this agency?BRENNAN: It was demoralizing to a number of people, particularly those who were involved in the program, who really felt as though there was an effort on the part of some individuals involved in that investigation, that report, that were intentionally trying to just emphasize and over-emphasize the mistakes that were made and did not put it into a broader context.Yes, mistakes were made. But the overwhelming activities that were a part of that program, the ones that I think the American people would feel proud that the agency was able to fulfill its responsibilities.WALLACE: Finally, from your 27 years at this agency, the last two as director of the CIA, what do you think the public needs to know about the Central Intelligence Agency?BRENNAN: The successes and accomplishments that we have, the overwhelming majority of them will not ever find expression in newspaper and media. They do it silently. They do it not for accolades or parades. They do it because they are true American patriots.So, the American people should feel good about what CIA is doing. And, yes, we've made mistakes. And sometimes, they're the ones that get the spotlight and the headlines. But they are a very, very small portion of what this agency does. And I couldn't be prouder to be here.WALLACE: Director Brennan, first of all, thank you for inviting us here to headquarters.Thank you for talking with us. And thank you for your years of service to the country, sir.BRENNAN: Thank you, Chris.(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: To see more of our interview with Director Brennan, go to our Web site FOXNewsSunday.com.And that's it from CIA headquarters here in Langley, Virginia.When we return, we'll be back in our Washington studio to get our Sunday group's reaction to the interview.Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about chances for a nuclear deal with Iran? Just go to Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN BRENNAN: President Obama has made it very clear that we are going to prevent Iran from having that type of nuclear weapon that they maybe were going on the track to obtain. So if they decide to go down that route, they know that they will do so at their peril.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: CIA Director John Brennan warning what will happen if there's no deal and Iran pursues a nuclear weapon. And it's time now for our Sunday group. Radio talk show host, Laura Ingraham. Judy Woodruff, co-anchor of the PBS NewsHour. Fox News contributor, Liz Cheney and Bob Woodward from ‘The Washington Post.’Well, Laura, Director Brennan seemed confident that if there is a deal that we'll be able to verify it and if there isn't that we'll be able to stop it? Do you share his confidence?LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I'm skeptical. And the interview was fascinating, because you got into not only this issue, but then you went back and we examined why we missed ISIS, what was going to happen with ISIS, how lethal ISIS would become. So the trust, I think, is based on recent experience, how credible are their reassurances that if they go off the tracks we'll be able to stop it. We weren't able to see what was about to happen in the Middle East with the rise of ISIS.WALLACE: We also missed a lot of what Iran has done over the last decade and now that Brennan wasn't on the watch then, but ...INGRAHAM: Well, and the - and all of the nuclear sites that you also alluded to. So, there's a track record of spotty results, I think, for American intelligence. I am glad you got to the point about moral at the CIA, which I think took a huge hit. He acknowledged that. So, while I understand that the administration is trying to reassure all these skeptics in Congress, on Capitol Hill, that they are worried about, I think even recent history, that is a difficult sell to make and especially now with this conflicting deal with Iran fighting ISIS, but Petraeus says Iran is a bit - his predecessor is saying that's the big threat here. I think it's difficult for this administration to make this case at this point with this recent history.WALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel and we got this on Facebook from Annette Demoss. She writes, what has changed in our government where we are now considering allowing Iran even limited nuclear development?Judy, how do you answer Annette because from what we understand and obviously we only know the reports, Iran under this deal would be able to have 6,000 centrifuges. They would be able to continue to enrich uranium, although at lower levels. Whatever happened, I guess, and that is asking to the old policy of no nuclear program period.JUDY WOODRUFF, CO-ANCHOR, PBS NEWSHOUR: Well, I thought - I also thought the interview was fascinating. And I was struck when he said, you were asking him about how do we know? Some of these very questions you're asking us. How do we know what Iran is up to? And he said we went to school in effect on the mistakes that were made. So they are saying that they know more about what Iran is up to than we know, than they can talk about. So, one has to assume that that's the reason that they are prepared to say Iran can do more. But I just want to say what we know about the negotiations, Chris, at this point is that serious issues or yes, the centrifuges, the quality of the uranium and so forth, but the sanctions are - I'm told by people watching this closely, what is really holding this up at this point. The U.S. wants them phased out. The Iranians are saying, no, we want them gone immediately.The Iranians have come a little bit in the direction of what the U.S. wants. They talked about something called snap back where-in, if there's any material breach of an agreement, the sanctions would come back in full force, but it is still believed by the people watching these negotiations very closely that that's not enough that the Iranians still need to do more to move forward.WALLACE: Interestingly enough, and supposedly, according to reports, the French are taking a harder line than the U.S. is in terms of holding Iran's feet to the fire. Director Brennan and I also discussed at some length the question of the claims by the administration during the re-election that al Qaeda was on the run. Here is a look at that exchange.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Didn't you give the American people and the president give the American people a false sense of confidence back in 2012 about our fight against Islamic terrorists at a time perhaps not so coincidentally when the president was running for re-election?BRENNAN: There was no sense that I think either I or the president or others gave to the American people that terrorism was going away.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Liz, Brennan said that, in fact, core al Qaeda in Pakistan has been decimated, his argument is ISIS is a completely different proposition.LIZ CHENEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, decimated only if you think decimated means rapidly spreading throughout the region. I mean, you have a situation where obviously during the election the president's position was I'm keeping America safe. I've gotten bin Laden, therefore the problem is over. He said it repeatedly. And what we know now from the bin Laden documents, for example, that have come out through some court cases, although they need to release more, is that that absolutely wasn't the case. You've got Iran (ph) study that talks about 50 percent increase in al Qaeda affiliate groups since 2009. The president knew it wasn't the case and he said it anyway for political purposes.WALLACE: But Brennan seems to draw this line between al Qaeda and groups like ISIS and Boko Haram and other groups. Do you think that's a fair distinction?CHENEY: No. I think that clearly, what we've seen is that, you know, ISIS is an offshoot of al Qaeda in Iraq. And al Qaeda affiliated organizations themselves are rapidly spreading. And bin laden who I think even Director Brennan would say was at the center of core al Qaeda. We know that the documents that they released from the Abbottabad raid are the documents that show he was sort of this lion in winter, but that is not what the rest of the documents apparently say. The rest of the documents demonstrate that he has been - was very clearly directing al Qaeda throughout his time even when he was in hiding.WALLACE: Bob, when I talked with the intelligence community this week, particularly about this question of misjudgments, they used a phrase I hadn't heard before, they said political successes and intelligence failures. And what they were saying was, look, some of those times when the administration throws us under the bus and says, well, they didn't - and particularly they mentioned this about ISIS, and they underestimated the spread of ISIS, they say we were telling the political leaders in 2014 a lot of this stuff, they didn't react to it and now they blame it on us.BOB WOODWARD, THE WASHINGTON POST: Well, I think if you looked at the overall in the interview, there's lot of from Director Brennan, no wrong hogwash. And you look at this and is he giving an accurate fundamentally accurate picture of the world? I think it's kind of whitewashed. And there's a lot of happy talk here. And ...WALLACE: Such as?WOODWARD: Well, such as this idea that they have blunted and stopped ISIS in Syria and Iraq. I mean, there's some pluses. You get into the details here. There are indeed some negatives. And I take a step back, where you really have to here. The world is a much more dangerous place than he is outlining here. That the ingredients of instability in Syria and Iraq, in the whole region of the Middle East, in Pakistan, North Korea, you know, this is a time of deep anxiety and the real question is this of an intelligence picture. He is presenting to the president or is he being more realistic when they talk.WALLACE: Judy?WOODRUFF: I was just going to say, and I'm listening to Bob, but I also looked at, as I'm sure you did, he gave a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations at the end of last week, and he talked about this being the most unstable period since the breakup of the Soviet Union. I mean he didn't, in at least what I was hearing, he didn't understate I think the threats out there. So ...WOODWARD: You know, but he didn't say this in that interview. And he kept saying - when you posed some skepticism, he would say, oh, no, that's not true or that's wrong or hogwash on these documents.INGRAHAM: I want to get this sense at some point that there is some post hawk attempt to justify the Noble Peace Prize here, right? That even the French are saying, the French ambassador of the United States says, this is a bad tactic to say we really must have a deal, at least the beginnings of a deal by March 31ST? Why. We want a deal that's good for America, that's good for this country and obviously regional security, global security, but this has to be good for the United States.And I think, Bob, I think you hit on it. The sense that the world is more chaotic, you bet it is. We're not better off than we were in 2009 when it comes to security in the world under Obama's leadership. Our influence is on decline. And the world is more dangerous.WALLACE: Iran was continuing its nuclear program, too. And I know your dad, it was one of the things he was most upset about, was that they didn't intervene in Iran.CHENEY: Well, I think, you know, one of the other points here that it's important to raise in the Brennan interview is the verification point. Judy touched on this. But the IAEA last month said the Iranians are not currently living up to their obligations. So, for director Brennan to say, and I noted twice, he said we have a good understanding. He didn't say complete understanding. But I think frankly it is false to give the American people the idea that we know what is going on inside Iran or that we will be able to verify after this agreement. The French, I believe, sadly I never thought this sentence would come out of my mouth, but the French actually have a much more realistic and harder line approach to this.WALLACE: All right. We have to take a break here.When we come back, the rift between President Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu only grows after the prime minister is re-elected. What do growing tensions between the U.S. and Israel mean for security in the region?And what do you think about the testy relationship?

Be part of the discussion and weigh in on the action every ""FOX NEWS SUNDAY.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: I didn't retract any of the things that I said in my speech six years ago calling for a solution in which a demilitarized Palestinian state recognizes a Jewish state. I said that the conditions for that today are not achievable.BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: I indicated to him back given his statements prior to the election, it is going to be hard to find a path where people are seriously believing that negotiations are possible.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu denying he ruled out creation of a Palestinian state the day before elections and President Obama refusing to let him off the hook. And we're back now with the panel. Bob, it seems to me the most interesting development this week was not Netanyahu's on again, off again, on again relationship for support for a two-state solution. It was President Obama's decision, clear decision to ratchet up the tension between his administration and Netanyahu. How do you explain that?WOODWARD: Yeah. Well, I mean that's a move, but I suspect if we had a transcript of the Obama/Netanyahu phone call a couple of days ago, it would contain the elements they say. But they need each other. And Obama remembers, a politician, and he realized Netanyahu did some things to stay in office. And I think ...WALLACE: But wait a minute. I mean you had that, but then the day after and even after he seemed to walk things back on Thursday, you had the State Department, you had the White House spokesman, now you have President Obama all in effect saying, no. You know, he said and Obama said I take him at his word, he doesn't support a Palestinian --WOODWARD: Yes, but his word is he is riding both horses, as we know is documented. And I don't think this is the really central thing going on if I may disagree with you.WALLACE: It's a lie ....WOODWARD: I thought the most important thing going on is the Iran negotiation. And very interestingly, just yesterday, I guess, it was ""The Huffington Post"" put out an interview with Obama. And he said, yeah, we expect maybe we'll get a deal in weeks, and then he said two things. He said, we need Iran to make more concessions. Have you ever been involved in a negotiation? In a negotiation you don't go public and say, oh, yeah, we want concessions from the other side. As we know, there is politics in Iran. And in Iran, there are hard liners and soft liners.WALLACE: Forgive me.WOODWARD: Yeah.WALLACE: But I want to talk about Israel. And I think you're glossing over what I think is a fairly remarkable statement. You even had the administration, Liz, talking about the possibility of abandoning Israel at the U.N. and letting a resolution pass that would recognize a Palestine state?CHENEY: Look, the administration has now I would say since 2009 been looking for any excuse possible to distance the United States from Israel. You now have this unbelievable situation where we are aligning ourselves more with the Iranians than with the Israelis in the Middle East. And I just noticed something else in that interview that you showed, which is stunning to me that demonstrates this total lack of familiarity on the part of the president of what's happening around the world. He said we have got to evaluate what other options are available in terms of a two-state solution. To make sure we don't see a chaotic situation in the region. What in the world does he think is going on in the region? And from the Israeli perspective, I think you've got to say it makes complete sense that they at this point would not trust their security to an American president who doesn't have their interests in mind, who has done everything he can to distance himself from them and seems to be totally unaware at best of the complete and total mess his policies have created in their neighborhood. It's really breathtaking.WALLACE: You know, Judy, White House chief of staff Denis McDonough is going to speak to J Street tomorrow. This is a pro-Israeli, but liberal democratic group that has been very critical of Netanyahu and it just seems to be one more indication, you know, we don't know what McDonough is going to say, but the fact that he would talk to this group would seem to indicate they're going to continue to ratchet this up.WOODRUFF: Well, it looks that way. But I think, you know, I think as Bob said and I think as Liz is suggesting, there's so much at stake in the relationship between the United States and Israel. It's hard to believe that people like Denis McDonough and people who were making decisions in this administration aren't taking the long view.Yes, there clearly is a short-term peak over what happened. And I think people are looking both at the politics of it because it's clear -- I mean, it's clear to me that Republicans are going to do better with the Jewish vote in the future, given what's happened in the last few weeks with Netanyahu. You know, one can assume there are going to be more votes, more money from Jewish voters who maybe thought they would never be voting Republican are seriously considering doing that now.At the same time, I think what Netanyahu has helped to do is to create questions about this historic bipartisan support for Israel in the United States. And I think the younger generation of Jewish voters from talking to people who know the American Jewish community well, younger Jewish voters, Jewish voters who just are not comfortable with Netanyahu's, some of his domestic positions are questioning whether they're going to continue to support Israel like they have.WALLACE: I have got to say, I'm a little bit stunned here. Because it seems to me there's been a fairly dramatic development here. Am I crazy?INGRAHAM: No, you're absolutely right. This is what Obama treats Netanyahu similarly the way he treats the Tea Party. But in this case, it's dangerous, it's irresponsible, and it's incredibly immature. His petulance after Netanyahu clearly steps back a little bit from his statements about the Palestinian, you know, the two-state solution, unclenching his fist and reaching out back to the United States. Now, the president made that big speech early on in this administration to the Muslim world, if you unclench your fist I'll take your hand. Here it is a slap across the face to a man who won a solid victory in a democratic election in the Middle East.WALLACE: But wait, wait, wait. Now, you're going, to me you're going a little bit too far the other way. Don't you think Netanyahu bears some responsibility for going to Congress and speaking there? I mean it isn't as if he's been the innocent victim in this ratcheting up of relations.INGRAHAM: The president brought David Cameron here to the United States to do phone a friend in Congress to try to move congressional opinion.WALLACE: That's a little different than ...INGRAHAM: Well, we're bringing outside people into the United States a lot, the Congress, OK. Have a disagreement with him about that. That's fine. You know what would have been the mature thing for him to have done? He said, you know something, you're in town to give this speech, I'm not thrilled by it. Let's come - let's talk. I want you to come over to the White House and let's talk. That would have been a mature thing. That would have been good for America. It's supposed to be what's good for our security and regional security. This approach has been counter-productive.WOODWARD: The dynamics at all. I mean serious disagreement, but as everyone has said, including President Obama, in the phone conversation with Netanyahu, they agreed that the military intelligence and diplomatic alignment remains. That's what's important. This is not going to change the overall.CHENEY: I think it clearly -- sorry, Bob, but I think it clearly does change the overall relationship. You know, I was in Israel last year and they are stunned. They cannot comprehend why the president of the United States is obviously doing more to align American policy with Iran than with Israel. And you've got a situation now where it's not just the Israelis that are just completely baffled, it's the Gulf Arabs. You know, in the Brennan interview, he said oh, the Gulf Arabs know that we will be there to defend them. They don't believe that anymore and the Israelis don't believe it anymore.WOODWARD: It just is not true that the president has aligned himself with the Iranians on this. Come on, he said, look, we're going to have intrusive inspections, is that alignment?(LAUGHTER)WALLACE: It's the Middle East, we're never going to agree. But thank you for disagreeing so agreeably. Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.Up next, our Power Player of the Week, a look inside an oppo research factory.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Every election there's a game changer, whether it's an issue or the candidate's own words. Now one campaign veteran is taking lessons he learned the hard way to change the game in 2016. Here is our Power Player of the Week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MATT RHOADES, CHAIRMAN, AMERICA RISING: It's not dumpster diving. It's very issue-focused. Especially in the era of social media, Twitter, Tumbler, there's just a constant appetite now for content.WALLACE: Matt Rhoades is the head of ""America Rising"" what's been called an opposition research factory that goes after Democratic candidates. Last election day, they had 73 full-time staffers in more than two dozen states putting out damaging information in Senate, House and state races.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, yes, I did miss that one.WALLACE (on camera): How do you feel when you're a researcher, your tracker comes to you and says, look at this, boss.RHOADES: It's a rush, no doubt about it, Chris.WALLACE (voice over): Such as when they got a hold of this clip of Iowa Democrat Bruce Braley taking a shot at Republican Senator Chuck Grassley.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRUCE BRALEY: You might have a farmer from Iowa, who never went to law school, never practiced law, serving as the next chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee.(END VIDEO CLIP)RHOADES: He bagged on Iowa farmers, he bagged on Senator Chuck Grassley. We released it to the Iowa media and it just transformed the race.WALLACE: While at headquarters, staffers search a candidate's record and old clips. ""America Rising"" also has trackers in the field recording everything that Democrat says and sometimes trying to create an issue.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Miss Nunn, did you vote for President Obama in 2008 and 2012?WALLACE: Which brings us to 2016.RHOADES: So, this is the presidential research team. All of these people here are focused on Secretary Clinton and so their task day in and day out --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Look for any Hillary videos you can find.WALLACE: The team has been going through Clinton's record for almost two years now. And you never know when it's going to pay off.RHOADES: This is our war room, Chris.WALLACE (on camera): When Hillary Clinton holds her news conference, so that's on all four TVs there. Does this place shut down or do they speed up?RHOADES: That's go time for this crew.HILLARY CLINTON: I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal e-mails instead of two.WALLACE (voice over): Clinton was still talking when the war room pumped out this clip from a few weeks earlier.HILLARY CLINTON: iPhone.(CHEERS)HILLARY CLINTON: OK. In full disclosure, Blackberry. And a Blackberry.RHOADES: Basically blowing a whole in her convenience argument about why wanting to - one e-mail and one device.WALLACE: Rhoades felt the sting of oppo research as Mitt Romney's campaign manager in 2012. He says a Democratic group ""American Bridge"" was better than anything the GOP had then.RHOADES: Our Democrat opponents in the Republican primary were the first ones that asked Mitt to release his tax returns.MITT ROMNEY: There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for this president no matter what.WALLACE (on camera): Is there some connection between the fact that you're doing this and that Romney was kind of sunk by a video about the 47 percent?RHOADES: Is there some poetic justice in the Bruce Braley clip? I hope. We can't change what happened, but we certainly can balance the playing field.(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: Matt Rhoades says he's still getting over the Romney loss in 2012, but he says he's determined not to go out on the losing end. And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next ""Fox News Sunday.""Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Through a combination of tax reforms, efficiencies, and aggressive prosecution of fraud and abuse, this Governor has fixed the mess he inherited as a result of years of diversions and fiscal irresponsibility by an unchecked Democratic Majority in Trenton.Senator Kevin O’Toole (R-Essex):The bankrupt unemployment insurance fund inherited by Governor Christie is emblematic of the problems created by years of budget gimmicks, revenue grabs, and borrowing. The fact that this fund will be stabilized by the end of 2013 is a testament to this Administration’s leadership in restoring fiscal sanity to our state and sending a signal to job creators that they will not be gouged to pay for irresponsibility in Trenton.Senator Steven Oroho (R-Sussex):Private sector job creation is a key indicator of our state’s economic health. In the past two years, we have cut taxes, taken actions to help lower the cost of government and created 60,000 private sector jobs. This is compared to many years of tax and spending increases that helped contribute to the loss of nearly 250,000 private sector jobs. That is a contrast that speaks for itself. We have much more work to do, but a New Jersey with a competitive tax structure and fiscally disciplined government is a great recipe for private sector job creation.Senator Joe Pennacchio (R-Morris):Simply put, the difficult decisions we’ve made over the last two years are getting results for our economy: restoring solvency to the UI fund, putting more private sector jobs into our economy, and improving the outlook for job seekers across the state. This was accomplished this not through sound-bites or gimmicky legislation, rather, it was achieved by restoring honesty, integrity, and affordability to the state budget.Senator Jennifer Beck (R-Monmouth):While we will not be content until every New Jersey worker who needs a job can find a job, we are clearly moving in the right direction with regard to our economy. New Jersey is slowly coming back from a decade of economic stagnation and decline precipitated by poor decision making in Trenton. For the first time in recent memory, a majority of New Jersey residents believe our state is on the right track. It isn’t hard to see why: we’re doing something different and it is working for our economy.		1

It's anywhere from $69 billion to a $100 billion a year."""	half-true	['Corrections and Updates', 'Economy', 'Foreign Policy', 'Trade']	https://www.whitehouse.gov/	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-prime-minister-abe-japan-joint-press-conference/	2018/04/19	Palm Beach, Florida6:16 P.M. EDTPRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much. I want to begin today by expressing my deep condolences to the entire Bush family on the passing of former First Lady Barbara Bush, a wonderful, wonderful person. For decades, Barbara was a titan in American life. Her presence and character were engraved into America’s identity.Her strength and toughness really embodied the spirit of our country. And her warmth and devotion earned the admiration of an entire nation and, indeed, the entire world. She was a tireless champion for literacy. She was a fierce advocate for the American family. And she was a woman of proud patriotism and profound faith.Our hearts are saddened by her passing, but our spirits are lifted by the memories of her goodness and her grace. She was a good person.Melania and I send our prayers to Barbara’s husband of 73 years — I’ll never beat that record — President George H.W. Bush; to the surviving children — Jeb, and Neil, and Marvin, Dorothy, and former President George W. Bush; and to their many wonderful grandchildren and great-grandchildren.This evening, I also want to send a message to all of the brave service members from the United States, France, and the United Kingdom who were involved in the very successful strikes on targets associated with the Syrian chemical weapons program last week. Once again, the unmatched skill of the United States military, and our great partners and allies, was demonstrated to the entire world. Missiles were shot. They tried to knock them down; they weren’t in the least successful. They hit none.The purpose of our strike was to establish a strong deterrent against the use of banned chemical weapons. Civilized nations must join together to prevent the horrors of chemical warfare and, in fact, warfare. And I think our allies really were absolutely world-class, wonderful. We thank them for their support.Today, I’m thrilled to be joined by my good friend, Prime Minister Abe of Japan. Highly respected gentleman. Prime Minister, Melania and I are honored to host you and Mrs. Abe once again at Mar-a-Lago. We’re grateful for the tremendous hospitality you showed us during our visit to your country last fall. It was a true privilege to be welcomed to the magnificent land of Japan, or as I’ve heard all my life, the Land of the Rising Sun. It’s true. So great.During our visit to Asia in November, we had tremendous success enlisting support for our campaign of maximum pressure on the North Korean regime. As you know, I will be meeting with Kim Jong-un in the coming weeks to discuss the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Hopefully, that meeting will be a great success. And we’re looking forward to it. It would be a tremendous thing for North Korea and a tremendous thing for the world. So we will be doing everything possible to make it a worldwide success, not just for the United States or South Korea or North Korea or Japan, but for the entire world.We hope to see the day when the whole Korean Peninsula can live together in safety, prosperity, and peace. This is the destiny of the Korean people who deserve and have gone through so much over the years. We hope it all works out, and we’ll be trying very hard.I want to thank the Prime Minister for his insight and support over the past year as we have pursued the dream of a peaceful, nuclear-free Korea. Shinzo, you have worked very hard, along with us and all of our people, and we thank you very much. And we’re with you. And you’re a lot closer than we are, but we’re working on this together. Thank you very much. Your support has been critical to getting us to this important moment in time. It’s a historic moment, and possibly beyond that, if it works out properly.Our discussions today reaffirmed the close cooperation between the United States and Japan on the issue of North Korea and our common defense.We will not repeat the mistakes of previous administrations. Our campaign of maximum pressure will continue until North Korea denuclearizes. We have great respect for many aspects of what they’re doing, but we have to get it together. We have to end nuclear weapons, ideally in all parts of the world. That would be a goal for all of us, to hope for and to cherish.As I’ve said before, there is a bright path available to North Korea when it achieves denuclearization in a complete and verifiable, and irreversible way. It will be a great day for them. It will be great day for the world.During my visit to Japan last fall, I met with Japanese families who endured the terrible heartbreak of having their loved ones abducted by the North Korean regime. We want to see these families reunited as soon as possible. And I know for a fact that it’s one of the truly most important things on Shinzo’s mind. We talk about it often. So important to you. And we’re going to do everything possible to have them brought back, and bring them back to Japan. I gave you that promise.The United States also supports Japan’s efforts to improve its defense capabilities, and we’re exploring ways to expedite the sale of American military equipment to Japan through the Foreign Military Sales program.We’ve stepped up our effort not only with respect to Japan, but other allies, that when they order military equipment from us, we will get it taken care of and they will get their equipment rapidly. It would be, in some cases, years before orders would take place because of bureaucracy with Department of Defense, State Department. We are short-circuiting that. It’s now going to be a matter of days. If they’re our allies, we are going to help them get this very important, great military equipment. And nobody — nobody — makes it like the United States. It’s the best in the world by far.We’re also working to improve our economic partnership by reducing our trade imbalance and removing barriers to U.S. exports. The United States is committed to free, fair, and reciprocal — very important word — trade. And we’re committed to pursuing a bilateral trading relationship that benefits both of our great countries.Prime Minister Abe and I have agreed to intensify our trade and investment consultations. Ambassador Lighthizer, who’s with us today, will take the lead for the United States.These past two days have been extremely productive. The friendship between Japan and the United States has never been closer. I truly believe it has never been closer than it is today. And the bonds between our people have never been stronger.In the months ahead, we will rely on this great friendship as we face an array of old challenges and new opportunities, and we will face them together. We will work closely on trade. We will do something having to do with the imbalance that, frankly, should have been done for years and years and years.Mr. Prime Minister, I want to thank you again for traveling to Mar-a-Lago for these important discussions and meetings. It’s been a true honor to welcome you here and to work with you toward greater security, prosperity, and peace for our two truly great and wonderful nations. And thank you for being here, Shinzo. Thank you. Thank you very much.PRIME MINISTER ABE: (As interpreted.) Mrs. Barbara Bush, the former First Lady, she has passed away. On representing the Japanese people, I would like to express my condolences to former President Bush and to all the family members. We express our heartfelt condolences.For the infinitely blue sky, refreshing and a soothing sea breeze, it was a great pleasure to be invited once again to this beautiful Mar-a-Lago and in a relaxed atmosphere to spend significant length of time with President Trump to engage in fruitful discussion in a frank and straightforward manner.About a year ago at this place, at the very moment I was at dinner with President Trump, North Korea dared to launch ballistic missiles. It is absolutely intolerable. Immediately after I said so, President Trump stepped forward in front of the camera, though it was not planned, and made one following comment: The U.S. is with our ally, Japan, 100 percent. The President sent out a message of powerful commitment to the world.Donald, your words on that occasion is still deeply etched in my mind, together with my wonderful memory of my stay here in Mar-a-Lago. With one single comment, you demonstrated a rather superbly strong Japan-U.S. alliance, which has a history of longer than half a century.And once again express my deepest respect for your remarkable leadership. A year also has passed since then. The situation surrounding North Korea, due to the decisive decision by President Trump on the first-ever U.S.-North Korea summit, is at a historical turning point. The past mistakes should never be repeated. On this point, President Trump and I were in full agreement.On the occasion of the 1994 framework agreement or the 2005 Six-Party Talks agreement, North Korea committed to abandon nuclear weapons development. But those promises were broken, and the effort of the international community to engage in dialogue were all entirely exploited to buy time to develop nuclear weapons and missiles.Based on such lessons learned, both the U.S. and Japan, together with the international community, we will demand that for all weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles complete a verifiable and irreversible dismantlement of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles to North Korea.By envisioning multiple scenarios, we carefully thought out our policies and directions at a concrete and detailed level. Just because North Korea is responding to dialogue, there should be no reward. Maximum pressure should be maintained, and actual implementation of concrete actions towards denuclearization will be demanded. This firm policy has once again been completely shared between us.On this occasion, we also agree to continue our effort towards the earlier resolution of the top priority matter of abduction. Just now, President Trump, on this spot here, has mentioned that with the return of the abductees, maximum effort will be made. With a clear promise just made here, we are deeply encouraged, Donald.Half a year ago, when you visited our country, you listened intently to each and every family members of the abductees. You listened carefully and kindly said you would like to help. Your image on that occasion is indelibly etched in the eyes and minds of many of the Japanese people. Going forward, we wish to work closely with the United States and towards the immediate return of all abductees. We are determined to strengthen our approach vis-à-vis North Korea.North Korea has diligent workforce and is blessed with resources. If North Korea advances in the right direction, they can make their populations richer. If North Korea takes the right path under the Japan-North Korea Pyongyang Declaration, there could be a possible path to settle the unfortunate past and to normalize diplomatic relationship.For that to happen, a comprehensive resolution of multiple concerns — including abduction, nuclear, and missile — will be the fundamental precondition. Through the upcoming historic U.S.-North Korea summit, we certainly hope for a breakthrough in this situation.The Japan-U.S. alliance is not just limited to the sphere of security, but it also contributes to the peace and prosperity of the world, as well as the region. On the economic front, Japan and the U.S. will take a lead and develop a free and fair market in the Indo-Pacific region.I spent some time with President Trump to discuss ways to make that happen in a candid manner. First of all, we must further strengthen the economic ties between the two countries. Under President Trump, exports from the U.S. — including energy, aircraft, amongst others — have already been increasing significantly. Further, following the bold tax reform by President Trump, Japanese companies’ investments in the U.S. have been gaining momentum, which is creating a large number of jobs in the U.S. and contributing to the expansion of the exports from the U.S.In order to benefit both Japan and the U.S., we’ll further expand trade and investment between the two countries. Building upon that foundation, we’ll aim to realize economic development in the free and open Indo-Pacific region based on fair rules. To make that happen, at this time, President Trump and I agreed to start talks for free, fair, and reciprocal trade deals.And Minister Motegi will be responsible for these talks on the side of Japan. Minister Motegi and the U.S. Trade Representative Lighthizer, I hope, will have very fruitful discussions.Over the last two days, President Trump and I have spent more than seven hours together over meals and playing golf, while at the same time, we were able to hold extremely fulfilling talks in a relaxing atmosphere. The last few days were the time when I was able to further deepen my friendship and relationship of trust with President Trump.Lastly, I’d like to express my sincere appreciation to Donald and First Lady Melania for their wonderful hospitality, as well as the continued warmhearted welcome of the people of the United States. Thank you.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much, Shinzo. Appreciate it.Questions. Mark Landler? Mark.Q Thank you very much, Mr. President. Mr. Prime Minister, nice to see you again.Mr. President, you sent your CIA Director to Pyongyang a couple of weeks ago, and he returned without three Americans who are being detained there, and also without any other visible signs of concessions the North Koreans had made to the United States in advance of your meeting with Mr. Kim.My question is: Do you intend or are you willing to sit down with Kim Jong-un if Americans are still being held in North Korea? And will you insist on other tangible concessions from the North Koreans in return for gestures like sending a potential future Secretary of State to North Korea?And for the Prime Minister, if I may — you, a moment ago, alluded to new trade talks between your minister and Mr. Lighthizer. Should we interpret that to mean that you are now open to negotiating a bilateral trade deal between the United States and Japan?And then, a second question. Japan is the only major American ally that was not exempted from the steel tariffs. Did you ask the President to exempt Japan? And if so, how did he reply?PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you, Mark, very much. The fact is that they do have three prisoners. We have been talking about them. We are negotiating now. We are doing our very best. As you know, they’ve been there a long time and it’s harsh treatment. We fought very hard to get Otto Warmbier back. And when we came back, he was in very, very bad condition. It was a very sad event.We are likewise fighting very diligently to get the three American citizens back. I think there’s a good chance of doing it. We’re having very good dialogue. We will keep you informed. But we are in there and we are working very hard on that.We have come a long way with North Korea. We were, as you know — and when I say “we”, for many years, they’ve been talking to North Korea and nothing has happened. This should have been taken care of by past administrations when they were not nearly so far along. But we put unbelievably powerful sanctions on, and many other things.I want to thank publicly President Xi of China, who has done more for us than he’s done for any other administration, or than any leader of China has done for any President or administration. He has clogged up the border, as you know, and he’s done it very, very powerfully. He would tell you himself that he never thought he would go to this extent, and I appreciate that very much. But it’s put a lot of pressure on.As you know, 93 percent of the goods coming into North Korea come in from China. And President Xi understands that this is a very important set of months that are lying ahead. He doesn’t want to see a Korea — North Korea, or any Korea — that has nuclear weapons either. So he’s also fighting for China when it comes to this. But he has been terrific.Can he be better? I always say yes, he can be better. I said, “President, you’ve been great. Can you be better? Yes.” But he’s been very good, and it’s had a big impact. And what we’ve done has had a big impact.So we’ve never been in a position like this with that regime, whether it’s father, grandfather, or son. And I hope to have a very successful meeting. If we don’t think it’s going to be successful, Mark, we won’t have it. We won’t have it. If I think that it’s a meeting that is not going to be fruitful, we’re not going to go. If the meeting, when I’m there, is not fruitful, I will respectfully leave the meeting, and we’ll continue what we’re doing or whatever it is that we’ll continue. But something will happen.So I like always remaining flexible, and we’ll remain flexible here. I’ve gotten it to this point. President Moon of South Korea was very generous when he said, if it weren’t for Donald Trump, the Olympics would have been a total failure. It was my involvement and the involvement of our great country that made the Olympics a very successful Olympics. If you look at ticket sales prior to what took place with respect to North Korea, it was going to be a big problem, and it turned out to be a very successful Olympics.So we’ve gotten us here, and I think we’re going to be successful. But if for any reason I feel we’re not, we end. Okay? Thank you, Mark.PRIME MINISTER ABE: (As interpreted.) Between President Trump and myself, for benefitting both Japan and the U.S., we have expanded the investment and trade based on the foundation — open and fair economic development in the Indo-Pacific region. We have agreed to start talks for free, fair, and reciprocal trade deals at this time.As for Section 232, Japanese steel and aluminum would not exert any negative influence on the U.S. security. Rather, it’s a position that the quality of Japanese product is high. Many of those products are difficult to be replaced with, and they are greatly contributing to the U.S. industries and employment. So recognizing that, we’d like to continue to respond to this matter going forward.PRESIDENT TRUMP: I will add that the 232, having to do with aluminum and steel tariffs — 30 percent, in one case; 25 percent and 10 percent — that it’s got us to the bargaining table with many nations, and, in other cases, they’re paying. And it’s billions of dollars coming into the coffers of the United States. So they’ve been, actually, very important.If you look at what we did with solar panels, where we put 30 percent tariffs on, we had 32 companies opened with pretty new plants, because it’s a relatively new industry. Of the 32 plants, 30 were closed and 2 were not doing well. Since putting the tariffs on, the two are doing very well, seven or eight are going to be opening, and a lot more will open.Same thing with washing machines. We were, believe it not, having washing machines dumped all over the country. We put tariffs on, and we’re now opening up and expanding companies that create and make — which is actually a very big business — washing machines and dryers.So the workers of our country know what’s happening. We have companies moving up from Mexico — automobile companies — and they’re building new plants in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Kentucky, and expanding their plants. A lot of things are happening. Our country is doing very, very well. And it’s going to continue. It’s going to continue. A lot of great momentum.If you look at any chart, the enthusiasm for business in our country is at an all-time high. And unemployment — for African American workers, for Hispanic workers, unemployment is at an all-time low. In history — in the history of our country, it’s at the lowest point. If you look at unemployment for women, it’s at an 18-year low. So we’re very proud of our achievements.And starting know, as you see, over the last few weeks, the tax cuts are kicking in. And it’s a beautiful thing to see. And people are spending money where they didn’t have the money to spend previously. So we’re very happy with that.Shinzo, please.Q (As interpreted.) I’m (inaudible). I’d like to ask a question about how to handle North Korean issues. Prime Minister Abe, the coordination for holding summits between the South Korea and North Korea, as well between the U.S. and North Korea, is underway. There is a concern in Japan that Japan may be left behind. So how are you going to proceed with dialogue with North Korea?President Trump, you talked about the abduction issue. Are you going to consider the nuclear weapons disarmament the same level as abduction issue?PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, maybe I’ll go first. Abduction is a very important issue for me because it’s very important to your Prime Minister. I will tell you that we were having dinner last night, and he started talking about abduction and how horrible it was. And his level of enthusiasm was unbelievable. And I said to him right then and there last night at the table, I said we will work very hard on that issue, and we will try and bring those folks back home. Very, very hard.PRIME MINISTER ABE: (As interpreted.) Whether Japan will be left behind, that is not at all the case. In the last two days, together with President Trump, we have spoken about North Korea. There will be the inter-Korean talks, and a U.S.-North Korea summit is planned. We have gone into really in-depth discussion. About our policy and direction, we have reached agreement.Regarding the upcoming U.S.-North Korea summit, we hope that it will lead to the resolution of weapons of mass destruction, nuclear missile, and of course, more than anything else, we hope it will be a historic summit that will lead to the resolution of abduction. And for that purpose, I have seriously and thoroughly discussed it with President Trump, and we have fully agreed about our direction going forward, in particular regarding abduction. As Donald has explained in our tête-à-tête, we have thoroughly discussed about this matter.Last year, the President met with the victims of the abduction, as well as the family members. And the families’ feelings have been strongly felt and understood by the President, and he has given a very encouraging comment that he would appeal towards the resolution. I highly appreciate this encouraging comment. This gives us huge courage — a very encouraging comment. And for the families of the abductees, again, this is a massively, powerfully encouraging comment.And, therefore, going forward between Japan and the U.S., or between the trilateral of Japan, U.S., and South Korea, we will cooperate closely and do our utmost to resolve the issues of North Korea, including abduction, nuclear, and missile.PRESIDENT TRUMP: And we will be very loyal to Japan. Thank you.Jennifer Jacobs.Q Thank you, Mr. President. On the Mueller probe, have you concluded that it’s not worth the political fallout to remove either Special Counsel Mueller or Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein?And, Prime Minister Abe, did the President ask you to provide more funding for U.S. troops in Japan? And what agreement did you reach here in Florida on buying more military equipment from the U.S.?PRESIDENT TRUMP: Jennifer, I can say this — that there was no collusion, and that’s been so found, as you know, by the House Intelligence Committee. There’s no collusion. There was no collusion with Russia, other than by the Democrats — or, as I call them, the “obstuctionists,” because they truly are obstructionists.So we are giving tremendous amounts of paper. This was a — really a hoax created largely by the Democrats as a way of softening the blow of a loss, which is a loss that, frankly, they shouldn’t have had from the standpoint that it’s very easy for them. They have a tremendous advantage in the Electoral College. And this is what it is, and this is where it came from.You look at the kind of money that was paid. Probably some went to Russia. You look at Podesta having a company in Russia where nothing happened and people don’t talk about it. You look at the fact that their server — the DNC server — was never gotten by the FBI. Why didn’t the FBI take it? The FBI takes what they want. They go in; they wouldn’t get the server.This is a hoax. As far as the investigation, nobody has ever been more transparent than I have instructed our lawyers — “Be totally transparent.” I believe we’ve given them 1.4 million pages of documents, if you can believe this. And haven’t used — that I know of, or for the most part — presidential powers or privilege.So we are hopefully coming to the end. It is a bad thing for our country — very, very bad thing for our country. But there has been no collusion. They won’t find any collusion. It doesn’t exist.As far as the two gentlemen you told me about, they’ve been saying I’m going to get rid of them for the last three months, four months, five months. And they’re still here. So we want to get the investigation over with, done with, put it behind us. And we have to get back to business with negotiating with this gentleman and plenty of others. But this gentleman is a very tough negotiator, and we have to focus on that.Thank you very much.PRIME MINISTER ABE: (As interpreted.) Regarding the U.S. forces expenses, of the U.S. forces in Japan, the safety and security of Japan, and the peace and stability of the Far East is being maintained.And for the forward deployment strategy of the United States in the Asia Pacific — in terms of the presence, their presence in Japan is very meaningful and significant. In the case of Japan, across the world, in terms of paying for the expenses, Japan accounts for the largest percentage of stationing compared to other countries. And the President understands very well.Q I’m Taketa (ph) with Sankei News. I have a question for President Trump. This is the follow-up question for 232. So you don’t have any intention to exempt Japan at this point in time? And President Trump and Prime Minister Abe, with regard to trade, you are going to establish new talks for trade. Is it going to be in the direction of FTA or TPP? So I’d like to hear the views from both of you.PRIME MINISTER ABE: (As interpreted.) So at this time, between President Trump, talks for free, fair, and reciprocal trade deals to initiate that has been agreed. As for this talk, Minister Motegi and Ambassador Lighthizer, USTR, will be the representative. And Mr. Asō and Vice President Pence, the U.S.-Japan Economic Dialogue where they will be receiving the report of these talks.As for these talks, I thought that it would be the interest of both of the countries that the investment and trade between the two countries will be expanded. And we are going to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific economic growth.So on the U.S. side, that they are interested in a bilateral deal, we are aware of that. But at any rate, our country’s position is that TPP is the best for both of the countries. And based on that position, we shall be dealing with the talks.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much. The United States has a massive trade deficit with Japan. It’s anywhere from $69 billion to $100 billion a year. That’s massive by any standpoint. We are doing 232 on steel and aluminum. And if we can come to an arrangement on a new deal between the United States and Japan, that would certainly be something we would discuss — aluminum tariffs and steel tariffs. And I would look forward to being able to, at some point in the future, take them off.But right now we have a deficit that’s a minimum of $69 billion a year. Japan sends us millions and millions of cars, and we tax them virtually not at all. And we don’t send so much product because we have trade barriers and lots of other things. So these are the things that the Prime Minister and I are going to be discussing over the next short period of time.The media has not covered the TPP correctly. I don’t want to go back into TPP, but if they offered us a deal that I can’t refuse, on behalf of the United States, I would do it. But I like bilateral. I think it’s better for our country. I think it’s better for our workers. And I much would prefer a bilateral deal, a deal directly with Japan. We already have a deal with 6 of the 11 nations in the TPP. So we already have trade deals, and the others we can make very easily. They’re all calling wanting to make a deal. But we think that’s much better for us.So unless they offer us a deal that we cannot refuse, I would not go back into TPP. We’ll see what happens. But in the meantime, we’re negotiating. And what I really prefer is negotiating a one-on-one deal with Japan. And that’s where we are right now, and I will say that the representatives who are sitting right here are extraordinarily competent and very tough — those representing Japan. And we will hopefully, in the not-too-distant future, have a very good deal — good for Japan and good for the United States. Okay?Thank you all very much. We appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you very much.PRIME MINISTER ABE: Thank you.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much, Shinzo.Q Anything sanctions on Russia, sir?Q Why no sanctions on Russia, sir?Q Mr. President, why did you delay the sanctions on Russia?PRESIDENT TRUMP: Yeah, we’ll do sanctions. As soon as they very much deserve it, we will have — that is a question. There has been nobody tougher on Russia than President Donald Trump. Between building up the military, between creating tremendous vast amounts of oil. We raised billions and billions of dollars extra in NATO. We had a very, very severe — we were talking about it a little while — fight in Syria recently, a month ago, between our troops and Russian troops, and that’s very sad. But many people died in that fight. There has been nobody tougher than me.With the media, no matter what I did, it’s never tough enough because that’s their narrative. But Russia will tell you, there has been nobody tougher than Donald Trump. And then, the other night, we had a strike in Syria, which was absolute precision.I leave it with this, with all of that said: If we can get along with China, and if we can get along with Russia, and if we can get along with Japan and other nations, that’s a good thing, not a bad thing. Just remember that. If we got along with other nations, that’s good, not bad.Thank you very much everybody.END		1

Navy Yard. A news conference is set to begin any minute now. We will bring it to you as soon ass underway. But here, 13 hours after those people were shot and killed, police say they are still working on identifying those victims and notifying their families. Three victims of the shooting, including one police officer, remain hospitalized tonight. But doctors expect those three to recover fully from their wounds. Navy Commander Tim Jirus was actually speaking to one of the victims when he was shot. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)	CMDR. TIM JIRUS, U.S. NAVY: There`s an individual who came from the building behind us, I mean, this building. He came up and was talking to me, basically saying, hey, there`s a shooter in your building. Then I heard two more shots. One of them hit him. He went down in front of me and I took off from there. REPORTER: The guy you were with? JIRUS: The guy I was talking to. REPORTER: Got shot? JIRUS: Correct. REPORTER: And what was his situation afterwards? Did you move or did you try to assess? JIRUS: He was shot in the head. He did not look like he made it. So, I run from there. I don`t know if he was aiming for him or aiming for me. But I got out of there as soon as I could afterwards. I realized I couldn`t do anything else for him. (END VIDEO CLIP)	O`DONNELL: The alleged murderer Aaron Alexis was shot and killed in a gun battle with police. Aaron Alexis was a U.S. Navy civilian contractor who worked in information technologies. Aaron Alexis previously served in the Navy Reserves between May 2007 and January 2011. Here is how Washington, D.C. police Chief Cathy Lanier described the scene. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)	CHIEF CATHY LANIER, DC POLICE: It certainly was one of the worst things we have seen in Washington, D.C. As officers entered the building and moved to the building, they were making transmissions and keeping commanders informed of what they were coming across as they went through, multiple victims. There was gunfire still going on. This is what we trained for. We were able to pull active shooter teams together and compliments to the partners here in the national capital region. We were able to pull officers from different agencies, put them in a single team and get them into the building within seven minutes. (CROSSTALK)	LANIER: There`s no question he would have kept shooting. (END VIDEO CLIP)	O`DONNELL: Joining me now: NBC`s Kasie Hunt and ""Politico`s"" Ginger Gibson, who have been covering the Navy Yard scene all day. Kasie, you are at the scene of the press conference. What is it that we expect to learn at this hour? KASIE HUNT, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: At this point, it`s not definitive what we`re going to actually hear. But at this hour we`re really waiting for the sad accounting for the victims. We still don`t have a full picture of how many people died, although officials have said at least 13 civilians and we haven`t begun to understand who they are and go through that grieving process. So, at this hour, just a few blocks from where we are, there are still, by all accounts, thousands of people inside the Navy Yard waiting to be bussed out. The FBI has been talking with those who actually did have some connection with the event before they have been letting them out. They have been bussing people over to nationals park where there was supposed to be a baseball game tonight. So, we are still getting the full picture from people who were actually witnesses to what happened today. I did speak with one man who was nearby and who said they barricaded he and nine of his colleagues barricaded themselves inside a conference room. At one point, the ceiling was sprayed with bullets, and he said, while he didn`t see any casualties on his way out, he did hear from somebody that he knew that one of his friends, somebody he`d served with at the Pentagon had, in fact, been killed. So, at this point, we`re on hour almost 14 of sorting through exactly what happened today and still no real end to this terrible day for all of these people here -- Lawrence. O`DONNELL: Ginger Gibson, a place where thousands of people work, what was your -- how would you describe the confusion level today among people trying to get out of there, and people trying to figure out who`s left in there? GINGER GIBSON, POLITICO: I was at Nationals Stadium earlier today. As Kasie pointed out, it was supposed to have a baseball game, instead, it`s being used as a place where they a reunited families. A lot of families confused. A lot of families still looking for the woman whose mother was working inside the building where the shooting was. She was able to get in touch with her through a co-worker`s cell phone to a neighbor, but unable to get text messages or calls right away. A lot of people were texting assured that their family member was safe but still very worried, very nervous, not knowing what was going to happen next. And, you know, there are lots of people on the Navy Yard, still waiting to be able to go home. And their family members don`t know when they will get to see them next. They can`t drive their car. They don`t have any other way to get home for some of them. So, there is a lot of confusion and a lot of people trying to sort out what exactly took place. O`DONNELL: The latest update we have from law enforcement sources in Washington indicates that they have located the suspect`s rental car in the garage across the street from the building where the shooting occurred. The authorities are in the process of obtaining warrants to search that car and to search the hotel rooms of the suspect and his fellow contractors at the southwest Washington, D.C. residents` inn, where those contractors were staying. The same law enforcement sources said that it appeared that Alexis entered the building armed and one of the first persons shot was the security guard at the entrance. It is believed that he then took that guard`s side arm and either picked up the assault rifle from a safe or cabinet nearby, or also the guard may also have had a long gun with him. Kasie, this is one of the mysteries of the day, is it seems that the shooter ended up with three weapons but probably didn`t start with three weapons. HUNT: Absolutely. And there`s also been over the course of the day, as you remember questions about how many active shooters there were at any given time. And then you had police even confused, or not necessarily confused but warning the general public and reporters who were gathered outside the scene here that there could be more than one suspect in this case. We have since learned that it was just this, they believe now it was just confined to this one active shooter. We are starting to get some, as you outline, details more of where the guns came from. My colleague Michael Isikoff points out that a source told him that he would have passed a criminal background check to get the gun that he may have brought on to the premises himself. O`DONNELL: Let`s listen to what the suspect`s brother-in-law said earlier tonight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)	ANTHONY LITTLE, BROTHER-IN-LAW OF ALLEGED GUNMAN: Their initial reaction, I was not here for, but when I got here they were very distraught, stressed out, tears. They didn`t see it coming. It`s very hurtful. The hearts are going out more to the victims, the people that got hurt. (END VIDEO CLIP)	O`DONNELL: Ginger Gibson, I don`t want to read too much into that, but he doesn`t seem completely shocked. I mean, just says didn`t see it coming. But there`s -- I don`t hear a comment there about this is unimaginable. You know, he -- we would think he would never do something like this. GIBSON: We`re going to be waiting to hear maybe tonight the details of what happened inside that building or in the morning. But the more difficult part and the part we all want to know is why. How did he get to a point where he could do something like this? Listening to what the brother had to say. I know there are folks in Texas talking to friends, former roommates, co-workers, trying to put together those pieces is going to be difficult to try to grasp. We all want to grasp what would make someone do such a horrific thing. The brother-in-law didn`t seem too surprised but we have to remember, too, that shock is at play here. It`s very difficult to try to put together in such a short amount of time why and how someone could do something like this. O`DONNELL: We`re joined now by NBC News national investigative correspondent. Michael, what is your understanding of the latest version of where we are? MICHAEL ISIKOFF, NBC NEWS NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT: Well, the latest version is, as you just reported, the rental car has been located across the street in the garage. And law enforcement authorities are trying to get the search warrant to search those. But there`s still, you know, the big unanswered question here is why. Motive has not yet been established. The closest that I have seen, Lawrence, are the interviews with the friends who talk about that he had some sort of beef with the contracting firm that had employed him, didn`t feel he was being paid, and was ticked off at them, and then also had this propensity for violent games, that I think one of his friends or acquaintances described him as obsessed with violent video games. Now, we heard that before with Adam Lanza and the Newtown shooting. But, you know, it`s still a far cry from playing those video games to committing an atrocity like this. So, it`s fair to say there`s a lot of unanswered questions. Just a couple of points on access to the base. We did get this statement tonight from Hewlett-Packard confirming that Alexis had been employed by a subcontracting firm called The Experts, which was part of an HP contract to refresh equipment used on the Navy Marine Corps intranet network. Apparently, that involved installing new PCs when they went down and refreshing them, replacing them. But that did apparently give him access to the base and might explain how he got in there in the first place. O`DONNELL: We`re still waiting for the latest update from a press conference that Casey Hunt is attending. And, Michael, the -- there is information that has been developed now in the last few hours saying that this suspect had been treated multiple times for psychological issues, including sleep deprivation, anger, paranoia. Most recently, they said he had been treated at a V.A. hospital in New England, Rhode Island, possibly Massachusetts. So we are still in the process of developing this psychological profile. ISIKOFF: Exactly. There is clearly a lot that we don`t know. We do know we found that he had this arrest record. He had been arrested on misdemeanor charges in September of 2010, which is just a few months before his discharge from the Navy. It`s worth pointing out that the charges were dropped and they would not have been a barrier to him buying the weapon. We know that he -- or weapons. We know that or believe that he did purchase this shotgun in northern Virginia just -- northern Virginia, not far from Washington D.C. But nothing that we know of in his background would have prevented him from doing that or passing a background check. O`DONNELL: Michael, I have to interrupt you. We are going to a press conference. The mayor is about to speak. MAYOR VINCENT GRAY (D), WASHINGTON, D.C.: We will follow the same order of presentation that we did earlier. I will be followed by Chief Lanier, who will be followed by our FBI Washington director, and then Chief Chambers and Congresswoman Norton. We don`t have a great deal of new information to present to you at this point. I think we mentioned earlier that we had ruled out one of the suspects. No longer being a suspect. We continue to pursue the possibility of there being another shooter. We don`t have any evidence, any indication at this stage that there was yet another shooter even though we haven`t completely ruled that out. That was the person as you probably will recall who was identified as wearing an olive, drab uniform -- somebody around 55 years of age, around 5`10"", with graying sideburns. We have not identified that person nor do we have a lot of corroborating evidence. And maybe Valerie will talk a little bit about that, too, when she comes up. We don`t know what the motive is at the stage. We were asked earlier if there was likely terrorism involved. We have no indication of that. We haven`t ruled that out. We continue to investigate that. We know that there are 13 fatalities, including the shooter who perished today. We do have more information now on the decedents. Their ages are 46 years of age to 73 years of age. The families now are still in the process of being notified. Seven families have been notified and the process continues to notify the other six. We don`t know exactly when that process will be completed, but it is continuing now as we speak. I also want to update the issue around injuries. We didn`t have precise numbers earlier. We were using estimates. We now know that there are eight people who incurred one or another kind of injury. Of the eight, three were shot. They all are -- that includes Officer Scott Williams who the chief and I just went to visit earlier this evening who is doing well. He is in great spirits. There were two other civilians who were shot and they are relative minor injuries. The other five injuries range anywhere from stress action and someone who fell and had head injury, a contusion chest, arm abrasions and chest pain. So, again, a total of eight injuries, people who were hospitalized as a result of those and there`s absolutely no reason to think that there won`t be fined. One other point before I turn it over to Chief Lanier. We anticipate tomorrow morning that the traffic patterns will be back to normal in the city. All the bridges will be open, all the streets in the area of the Navy Yard will be open, even as the investigation, of course, will be continuing tomorrow and the days ahead. Again we have been in close contact with the White House. They`ve been a close contact with us and the president has reached out. His staff and the president through them have reached out to connect with us as this process has unfolded throughout the day. So again, this is a horrific tragedy. I want to thank all of the first responders who have done a terrific job dealing with this horrific tragedy. Our police officers and various law enforcement agencies that have done a sterling job, and I want to especially thank fire and emergency medical services for the work that they have done today as well. They had obviously many transports that they had to make and they did an extraordinary job doing that. And Chief Eleve (ph), where are you, Chief? I want to thank you for the work that you did today in order to be able to handle that important responsibility. So, with that having been said, let me ask Chief Lanier to come up and share some things with you -- Chief. LANIER: Thank you. I`ll pick up where the mayor left off. I can`t say enough about the first responders. All the training, exercising and daily interaction that we have here with more than 30 law enforcement agencies of some type in the district. The team work as we hear story after story and having been on the scene and listening to transmissions throughout the course of the day, 24 years doing this in the city. I`m very proud of the team work. The ability to quickly pull together to spare the teams of law enforcement, the heroic efforts, United States Park Police working with Metropolitan Police Department quickly entering the building along with security from the Navy Yard, as well as support from partners quickly brought in mutual aid, Maryland state and park police helicopters, as well as Fairfax, to see three difference jurisdictions had less than 45 minutes to coordinate emergency response, whether it`d be fire, emergency, medical, support from Prince Gorges County brought to DC fire EMS, to medevac support brought in through United States park police and their medevac, just incredible work. United States Marshall Service entering buildings with teams of MPD. Also, NCIS who assisted in picking up and carrying an injured police officer out of the building, story after story, we`ve heard from police officers and firefighters just terrific responses and thank you for all of the local and regional partners who responded. I will say Metro Transit as well. The special recognition that really stepped up today to help us get large numbers of victims and survivors to various places that we needed to transport witnesses, never had to ask for any support. They are always there to provide what we need so we really appreciate the work of Metro Transit. As of right now with the last outstanding lookout that we had for the potential last person connected to the deceased shooter, that was a lookout we put out for a black male between the ages of 40 and 50 in an olive drab uniform. Obviously, we had multiple witness accounts that we were sorting through. We have now exhausted all means that we have available to either support or discount that lookout. And we are comfortable at this point to lift the shelter in place to the residents of the neighborhood. Thank them first of all, residents and businesses, for supporting us and sheltering in place for an extended period of time, but we feel comfortable right now that we have exhausted all means to eliminate that possible last suspect. So, we do now feel comfortable that we have the single and sole person responsible for the loss of life inside of the base today. If anything changes, as we continue to go forward we certainly will make that available to the public. But again we are lifting the shelter in place and we appreciate the support from our community members. We will most likely have all of the traffic closures around the area open by 5:00 a.m. for morning commute. But we will make sure that is put out for the public in advance. Listen to your local news media before you come to work in the morning. And as of right now, we have, as we go through finalizing next of kin. We have identified one D.C. resident so far that are among the victims. So, in terms of our outreach in local community, our hearts go out to all of the victims certainly and at least one of our victims we have confirmed as a D.C. resident. At this point, we don`t have anything to support that any of the victims so far identified are active duty military. We have civilian and contractors so far that have been identified. We still have some work to do, but no active military have been identified amongst the victims at this point. So, with that, I will turn it over to the assistant director of the FBI, Val Parlave, and let her update you on their investigation. VALERIE PARLAVE, FBI: Good evening. As we have stated, this continues to be a very active investigation. The FBI`s evidence response teams continue to process the shooting scenes. These teams have special capabilities to include bullet trajectory analysis and crime scene mapping. We continue to follow every lead related to the shootings, to include piecing together the movement and activities of Aaron Alexis. While we have learned some information about his recent whereabouts, we continue to work to determine where he has been, who he has talked to, and what he has done. This includes determining the origins of the weapons he used, but because this investigation still continues, we will not comment further on the weapons used in today`s shooting. We can confirm, however that Mr. Alexis had legitimate access to the Navy Yard as result of his work as a contractor. And he utilized a valid pass to gain entry to the Navy Yard. We continue to work to identify and locate additional witnesses to today`s events and any individuals who may have information about Mr. Alexis. We appreciate the information provided so far by the public and we continue to ask for any and all information related to Mr. Alexis and today`s tragic events. Please report this information by calling 1-800-CALL-FBI. That`s 1-800-225-5324. And we again thank the public for your cooperation and will continue to update you on this investigation as it progresses. Thank you. CHIEF TERESA CHAMBERS, PARK POLICE: And simply from the United States Park Police. You heard Chief Lanier talk about team. We were part of that team this morning. We now have a more subordinate role, but we commit to her and to Assistant Director Parlave and the mayor that we will provide whatever resources available and appropriate to help complete this investigation. Thank you. DEL. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON (D), WASHINGTON, DC: Thank you more mayor for bringing us to this last report to the city and to the region. As in the beginning, our thoughts are with the victims and their families and they will also be our first thoughts tomorrow when Congress reconvenes and I go on the floor to lead moments of silence. We`re not going to be silent about the tragedy that occurred here today. There are many outstanding questions. I would say most of the questions are outstanding. For many of us in this city who have been plagued by gun violence, among them is how someone, whatever his badge, managed to get a high powered gun into one of the most secure facilities in the District of Columbia. I`m sure the Navy will be doing its own investigation. Tomorrow I will be working with others to get an independent investigation of what occurred here. I`m very, very proud and very grateful for the federal and D.C. police who responded so promptly. They have made the District of Columbia since 9/11, the most protected and secure city in the United States. But we do not fool ourselves. We understand that in an open and democratic and free society, you cannot make yourselves impenetrable, especially when there are more guns than there are people in the United States today. We take very seriously security at one of our most secure facilities is penetrated and where the security is breached. But we also regard the Naval Sea System Command as a neighbor, a part of this residential mixed use neighborhood. And we like it that way. I appreciate -- continue to appreciate the banquet room they built so that they could accommodate residents. And I`ll be working with the Navy and the Naval Sea System Command to maintain the relationship with the neighborhood while shoring up the security here in the neighborhood and at the facility. Thank you very much. GRAY: All right. We will take a few questions. REPORTER: Question to the special agent in charge, can you just characterize the (INAUDIBLE)	PARLAVE: There is still quite a bit of work left to do inside, processing the scene. I would expect them to be there for the next couple of days finishing up. It took us a while to clear the building with our tactical teams and they haven`t actually been in there that long, processing the evidence on scene. So, I would say, you know, 48 hours wouldn`t be unreasonable. REPORTER: There are a lot of people still left in there, the Navy Yard? PARLAVE: I believe most of the people who were alive have been cleared from the Navy Yard. REPORTER: All civilians and contractors were among casualties. Do you have any belief that the shooter was intentionally avoiding shooting military personnel? PARLAVE: We have no information right now as to motive. REPORTER: The congresswoman was talking about bringing a high powered weapon into the building, into the yard. Is there any sense that the suspect was able to lift any of the weapons off of the victims? PARLAVE: That is part of the ongoing investigation and I can`t comment on that. REPORTER: There have been reports that a rental car has been found near the scene that belong to the gunman. Can you confirm? PARLAVE: We are processing vehicle at the scene related to the shooting. REPORTER: Are there reports of other officers injured in the Navy guards on base or park place -- LANIER: We do have one park officer with injuries, not a gun shot injury, but other related injuries to the incident. I believe we do have one contract, I believe contract security working with the naval district of Washington. We will confirm as we go forward, but I do believe we do have at least one. (INAUDIBLE)	LANIER: He`s in very good spirits. His family is here, parents, brothers and sisters. He has been on the department 23, almost 24 years. In fact, came on right about the time I did. We worked together for many, many years. He is a K-9 officer. He`s in very good spirits. He`s got a pretty serious injury, but right now, his family is here with him and he is in good spirits. The mayor was up visiting with him as well and he was certainly very complimentary of the partner agencies who helped to get him out of the building and D.C. Fire and EMS helped to get him medical attention that he needed. He is just very grateful for all the other responders that helped to get him out of the building and get him the medical attention he needed. But great police officer. I have known him for most of his 23 years and he`s got a stellar record. REPORTER: Chief, why did you think there was a second shooter and why is that not so? LANIER: Well, obviously, the more information that we can put out, as time goes on. But we always err on the side of caution through conglomeration of witness victim interviews, some camera views. There was potential that there could have been other shooters involved and we believed that the best action for us to take was to make sure our community was safe first. And we weeded through that information, secondly. We certainly want to clear the community as quickly as possible but we would rather err on the side of caution so we did that. And we have spent the last several hours trying to go through everything possible to make sure that we were 100 percent comfortable that we had cleared that information and get it out as quickly as possible. So, again, sometimes we ask for a little bit of patience from our community but our goal is to make sure that everybody is safe and that there is no additional harm. And that`s our goal, no addition harm once we arrive on the scene. GRAY: Last question, last question. REPORTER: At one point (INAUDIBLE)	LANIER: No, there will be a press release put out following this event. I believe that is already completed. So, those victims that have been identified, confirmed and notified will release that following. This press briefing, I believe it is here with us so we can hand that out. And as the next of kin are notified, we`ll put out the remainder. GRAY: Thank you all very much. O`DONNELL: Michael Isikoff, so there we have the investigation conclusion at this stage that the suspect that was killed today is as the police chief put it, the single and sole person responsible. ISIKOFF: Right. And one piece of new information that is worth noting here is that he did have a valid pass and legitimate access to the Navy yard in his capacity as a contractor. And what is interesting about that, Lawrence, he was working, according to the statement we got from Hewlett Packard on this Navy Marine Corps intranet network, which is a clues network, which does suggest that there would classified work involved. And in order to do that, the presumption would be, he would have to have some sort of security clearance and have undergone some sort of background check. Now, we have not confirmed what level that is or what sort of background checking underwent. But to work on a closed military network like that would normally require that kind of clearance, some sort of clearance. So, I think there is g to be an addition to the questions that Congresswoman Norton raised about the billing to purchase the weapon. And as I put it up before, we have no felony conviction that we know of in his background. There is, I think additional questions about what sort of background check he underwent to get this job. O`DONNELL: Michael Isikoff, thanks very much for joining us tonight. ISIKOFF: Thank you. O`DONNELL: Coming up, the chief medical officer of the hospital that took in the wounded joins me. And who the extraordinary press conference today, Dr. Janis Orlowski forced us to think about why these kinds of shootings keep happening in America. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)	(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)	DOCTOR JANIS ORLOWSKI, CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER, MEDSTAR WASHINGTON: I`m Doctor Janis Orlowski. I`m the chief medical officer at MedStar Washington hospital center. I`m here to give you an update regarding the three individuals brought to the hospital center. (END VIDEO CLIP)	O`DONNELL: The Doctor Orlowski was then able to announce that the three shooting victims her team was treating are all going to recover including the police officer who was shot multiple times. Then 15 minutes later in that press conference, in a response to a question about the hospital`s experience treating gunshot victims, Dr. Orlowski said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)	ORLOWSKI: We see a lot of trauma and, you know, sometimes it`s just accidents that occur. And then you see what I call senseless trauma. And there is something evil in our society that we as Americans have to work to try to eradicate. I have to say I may see this every day. I may, you know, be the chief medical officer of a very large trauma center, but there is something wrong here when we have these multiple shootings, these multiple injuries, there is something wrong. And the only thing that I can say is we have to work together to get rid of it. I would like you to put my trauma center out of business. I really would. It`s a great city. It`s a great country and we have to work together to get rid of this because we just cannot have one, you know, more shooting with, you know, so many people killed. We have got figure this out. We have got to be able to help each other. It`s a challenge to all of us. Let`s get rid of this. This is not America. This is not Washington D.C. This is not good. (END VIDEO CLIP)	O`DONNELL: Joining me now from MedStar Washington hospital, Dr. Janis Orlowski. Thank you very much, Dr. Orlowski, for staying up late on this very long day to join us now. Your know, your comment there towards the end of your press conference really captured the nation`s attention today beyond the very helpful information that you gave about your patients. It sounds like it is a truly wearisome duty that you have there, processing a of these gunshot victims not just today but Washington D.C. in and out of that hospital. ORLOWSKI: Well, I think it is. The recorder asked me a question. She said we know you to be a great trauma center. We know that you are taking care of victims, but is there something different about today? And I think that I spoke not only as a physician as the chief medical officer, but I spoke as a mother, as someone who is in this community and it is not only weary. I have to say that I worry about this. I worry about our community. Mass murders, people walking through schools, people walking through movie theaters, people walking through workplaces. Unfortunately it is common or more common than what it should be. And I think that I spoke from the heart when I said we have got to work together as a community to stop this. O`DONNELL: You are certainly in emergency medicine doing your end of this terrible task. But does it feel at the end of this task that society, that government that we are in fact not coming together as you said we must in order to minimize how much of this burden we are sending into our hospitals? ORLOWSKI: I think that there is much more that we can be doing and that we should be doing. We have multiple mass murders throughout the United States. We have individuals who some of them we know needed mental health care. A number of them could have been identified. I think that we just as you would see anyone who is bleeding on the street to call 911, I think we he to be able to identify and help those individuals who suffer other illnesses that make them act in this way. I believe that it`s not just rage. I believe that it`s not just anger. I believe that it is an illness. So, it`s an evilness to have someone raise arms against their fellow man. It`s wrong. We need to work to eradicate it. And whether it`s more support, more mental health, whether it is programs to help individuals, I spoke frankly when I said to the country and to the people who were listening we have got to work on this together. We have got to do better than this. O`DONNELL: Doctor, I would like to hear the latest about the patients that you have there at the hospital, the three victims of the shooting. At the press conference, we just heard about officer Scott Williams, a 23-year veteran of the D.C. police department, ak-9 officer, his chief said that he has, quote, a star record and that he is in good spirits at this hour. ORLOWSKI: He is. I met officer Williams when he entered MedStar medical center. I would tell you that he came in. He was speaking to the staff. He was immediately thanking individuals in the staff. I told the story that one of the things that he wanted to do is get his mother on the telephone so that she wouldn`t worry and he asked to be able to address her personally. He is gone off to surgery and I have seen him afterwards remains in great spirits. We are confident that her will continue to do well. And I would say he is the kind of person that everyone would like to meet. He is someone you would love to have as a neighbor. He just comes across as a warm and personal man. And if you think about it, he has been a police officer in this community for 23 years and protecting us, just a terrific guy. So, I would tell you that he is doing well. We have another woman who was shot, her main entry was in her shoulder although she had a few other minor areas of injury. She is just coming out of surgery right now. This is individual also who was speaking when she came into the hospital center. She was again making jokes and trying to keep things going as we were talking with her and she talked about her time being on the roof and waiting. She talked about her wonderful captain who had helped her up to the roof and had packed her wounds and wanted to make sure we said thank you to him. And then, the last individual is a person who luckily did not need surgery. She is a young woman in her 20`s who was at her desk. She actually got under her desk. She stated that she put her hands up when the shooter was there. He ended up hitting her finger and then hit the back of her skull. She is very lucky. She has not required surgery because the bullet fragment did not go through her skull, but we are watching her to make sure there is no bleeding. She is here with her parents and with her sister and in good spirits. In particular, she is very concerned about the colleagues that were around h at her workplace and has talked to us many times about whether we knew information about it. So, I have to tell you the three shooting victims who came to the hospital center are doing well. Two of them have had surgery. They are recovering and I expect a full recovery of all three of them. O`DONNELL: Dr. Janis Orlowski, the chief medical officer of Washington hospital center, thank you very much for joining us tonight. I`m sure that those wounded feel lucky to be in your care. And I think the nation is -- feels very lucky that you are able to get their treatment done so quickly as soon as they were there. Doctor, thank you very much for joining us. ORLOWSKI: Thank you very much. Bye now. O`DONNELL: We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)	O`DONNELL: President Obama has given four state of the union addresses. But he has had to address the nation on gun violence more than that. It has now become more routine for the president of the United States to speak to the nation after a mass murder than it is for the president to give state of the union addresses. The authors of the second amendment never anticipated that. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)	BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I want to begin by offering an update on the tragedy that took place yesterday at Fort Hood. There are families, friends, and an entire nation grieving right now for the valiant men and women who came under attack yesterday in one of the worst mass shootings ever to take place on an American military base. So, from now until Veterans Day, I have ordered the flags at the White House and other federal buildings to be flown at half staff. Earlier today, a number of people were shot in Tuscan, Arizona, including several meeting at a super market with their Congress woman, Gabrielle Giffords. We are still assembling all the facts but we know that Representative Giffords is one of the victims. She is currently in a local hospital and she is battling for her life. Obviously, our hearts go out to the family members of those who have been slain. We are going to get to the bottom of this and we`re going to get through this. By now many of you know, many of you have heard that a few miles outside of Denver, in a town called aurora, at least 12 people were killed when a gunman opened fire in a movie theater. And dozens more are being treated for injuries at a local hospital. Some of the victims are being treated at a children`s hospital. Tonight our prayers in particular are with our friends and fellow Americans in the community. We mourn those who were senselessly murdered and injured in their place of worship. We may never understand what motivates such hatred and violence, the perpetrators must know that your twisted thinking is no match for the compassion and the goodness and the strength of our united American family. The majority of those who died today were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of five and 10-years-old. They had their entire lives ahead of them, birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. As a country we have been through this too many times. We are confronting yet another mass shooting and today it happened on a military insulation in our nation`s capital. It`s a shooting that targeted our military and civilian personnel. These are men and women who were going to work doing their job protecting all of us. They are patriots and they know the dangers of serving abroad. But today, they face the unimaginable violence that they wouldn`t have expected here at home. (END VIDEOTAPE)	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	O`DONNELL: Gary Kasparov has a few things he wants us to know about Vladimir Putin, things that he learned the hard way by living in Vladimir Putin`s Russia. Gary Kasparov will join me next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)	O`DONNELL: On Saturday, the United States and Russia reached a deal on how to eliminate Syria`s chemical weapons. Here is secretary of state John Kerry announcing the deal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)	JOHN KERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE: We have no illusions about the challenges ahead. The United States and Russia have not always see eye to eye that is known. And we still don`t see eye to eye on everything. (END VIDEO CLIP)	O`DONNELL: The next day, President Obama said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)	OBAMA: Ronald Reagan said trust and verify and I think that has always been the experience of U.S. presidents when we are interacting with first soviet leaders and now Russian leaders. You know, Mr. Putin and I have strong disagreements on all range of issues, but I can talk to him. We have worked together on important issues. So, this is not the cold war. This is not a contest between the United States and Russia. (END VIDEO CLIP)	O`DONNELL: Joining me now, political activist and former world chess champion, Gary Kasparov. Gary, thank you very much for joining us tonight. GARY KASPAROV, POLITICAL ACTIVIST: Thanks for letting me. O`DONNELL: So, you have learned the Putin way of doing business the hard way, by actually living in Russia and dealing it with on a daily basis. KASPAROV: (INAUDIBLE)	O`DONNELL: There are so many things I want to talk to you about beyond Syria but including Syria. What advice would you give John Kerry in going forward with his day to day negotiations over this? KASPAROV: I think they already lost because it`s not verifiable. And basically, the agreement gives Assad green light because suddenly, Assad who two weeks ago was seeing his bunker fearing for his life, now he is part of the deal. And as long as he is me complying or pretends he is complying, he can keep killing his people. And even if he does something outrageous again, there is no trigger there. Then, it goes back to United Nations. So, Putin got everything he wanted. I think it would beyond to his wildest expectations. And Obama who once said red line, he is just -- just blowing up the reputation of his office. O`DONNELL: Well, the president and secretary of state, their stated mission from the outside was to stop this use of chemical weapons by Assad. They seemed to have stopped the use of chemical weapons and the process they are engaged in is to prevent them from using it. KASPAROV: Wait, wait, wait. I think -- I agree that that was the goal and that`s why president said the line. I understand that red line means that if somebody crosses that line then you act and then talk anymore. Now, these redlines -- O`DONNELL: That`s not what he said. He didn`t say this is what I will do if you cross -- KASPAROV: No, red line, whether it is in Russia or in English or any other language means that you act. O`DONNELL: No, no, no. You can`t say if you use this phrase that means you must do this. KASPAROV: We are sitting here talking to studio, Barack Obama is a person he has with America. And if he says red line, he is shooting (INAUDIBLE). O`DONNELL: I would say, what I would say to you is if he says red line you shouldn`t assume this extra stuff that you are assuming about right now. KASPAROV: OK. Again, the problem is now what I assume. The problem is what Iran assume and North Koreans assume. O`DONNELL: But they have stopped using chemical weapons and the president has said if they do use chemical weapons again, the United States does reserve the right to strike militarily without --. KASPAROV: That is exactly what he said a few months ago. O`DONNELL: No. He did -- he never said. You have got to remember this, he never said if you use chemical weapons, I will strike militarily. He never said that. KASPAROV: So, the fact that Assad killing people by not using chemical weapons is acceptable now? O`DONNELL: It turns out that was acceptable, yes. Without using chemical -- I mean, that`s the story. That`s the weirdness of the story. KASPAROV: If he uses the chemicals again, what happens? O`DONNELL: The position now is -- No. We won`t put it that way. KASPAROV: No, no. That`s an agreement. O`DONNELL: No, no. You have got to pay attention to what the president and John Kerry are saying. They are saying if he uses chemical weapons again, John Kerry has been very clear, the president has been very clear, the president reserves the right to use a military strike. KASPAROV: (INAUDIBLE) in the United Nations again. O`DONNELL: OK. But we can continue to talk about overtime because we are going to watch how this goes if it will work or not work, we will see. You don`t think it is going to work at all, I get that. But tell me about what`s happening with Putin and the anti-gay laws and why he did that? KASPAROV: You cannot take it separate from other things, you know. This year, we saw in Russia a number of laws that were totally violating Russian constitution and international treaty signed by Russia. It started with the law -- it`s a ban on adoption by American. Actually now, it expanded to other nations that Putin didn`t like. And then, there were many other laws, you know, limiting you know, ability to Russian people to protest and exercise their fundamental constitutional rights. And you may, of course, (INAUDIBLE) was a very clear demonstration that any criticism of Putin, you know, would be severely punished. O`DONNELL: You got arrested over that one. KASPAROV: OK, but it happens, you know, so me and many others -- O`DONNELL: Garry, we are out of time right here. Can you stay and we will continue online and use the rest of this interview online because we run out of time. KASPAROV: So, there`s no other choice. O`DONNELL: OK. We will continue to talk about it online. Garry Kasparov, thank you very much for joining us on the program. Chris Hayes is up next. END <Copy: Content and programming copyright 2013 MSNBC.

Corker reacts to Iran deal; Catholic Church addresses persecution of ChristiansPublished April 05, 2015Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print This is a rush transcript from ""Fox News Sunday,"" April 5, 2015. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.CHRIS WALLACE, HOST: I'm Chris Wallace.Negotiators reached the outline for a nuclear deal with Iran, but did the U.S. give up too much?(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: This deal is good for the security of the United States, for our allies and for the world.BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: The deal would lift sanctions almost immediately and this at the very time that Iran is stepping up its aggression in terror.WALLACE: We'll have a report on the pros and cons of the deal.And how will Congress respond?We'll ask the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker, in his first television interview since the agreement.Then, religious freedom laws under fire, but who is really being intolerant?Our Sunday group weighs in on the latest debate over religion and gay rights.Plus, this Easter Sunday, the Catholic Church's take on the persecution of Christians and the fight against ISIS.CARDINAL DONALD WUERL, ARCHBISHOP OF WASHINGTON: It's instinctive in us to stay alive, and so everyone has a right to defend their life.WALLACE: The archbishop of Washington, Cardinal Donald Wuerl joins us.And our power players of the week, the stone mason putting the national cathedral back together after the 2011 earthquake.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Welcome to the tippy top of D.C.WALLACE: All, right now, on ""Fox News Sunday.""(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: And hello again. Happy Easter and happy Passover from Fox News in Washington.After months of intense negotiation, six world powers and Iran have finally reached a framework agreement to curb Tehran's nuclear program. But President Obama must still make a final deal and then convince Congress, Israel and our Sunni allies of its merits.Today, we're going to drill down into the framework. In a few minutes, we'll talk with the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker, who says Congress must approve any agreement.But first, chief Washington correspondent James Rosen with a closer look at the deal -- James.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)JAMES ROSEN, FOX NEWS CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Chris, Iran and U.S. issued separate documents describing what was agreed to is sowing some confusion into what, in fact, was achieved.According to the State Department's fact sheet, Iran will reduce its installed centrifuges from 19,000 to about 6,000, roughly the number Iran had when Barack Obama became president, and other components of Tehran's enrichment infrastructure will be constrained.OBAMA: Iran will no longer enrich uranium at its Fordow facility. Iran will not enrich uranium with its advance centrifuges for at least the next 10 years. The vast majority of Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium will be.JAVAD ZARIF, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: Our facilities will continue. We will continue enriching. We will continue research and development. Our heavy water reactor will be modernized and we will continue the Fordow facility.ROSEN: Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency would enjoy weekly and monthly access to key sites continuous surveillance at others and would have the ability to inspect suspicious sites, but not conduct snap inspections, and Iran would be able to dispute allegations of suspicious activity.MARIE HARF, STATE DEPT. SPOKESPERSON: These elements, as we've said, have -- are the best hedge really against a covert path.GEN. MICHAEL HAYDEN, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR: It's not good enough to smother the known facilities with inspectors. You've got to have the ability to go anywhere at any time for that unknown, newly-discovered or suspect facility.ROSEN: Iran's foreign minister accused the U.S. of spinning the terms agreed to, saying in a tweet, ""Iran/5+1 statement, U.S. will cease the application of all nuclear related secondary economic and financial sanctions. Is this gradual?""The U.S. side maintained that sanction relief will be phased and enacted in tandem with Iranian compliance.JOHN KERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE: If we find at any point that Iran is not complying with this agreement, the sanctions can snap back into place.NETANYAHU: The deal would greatly bolster Iran's economy. It would give Iran thereby tremendous means to propel its aggression in terrorism throughout the Middle East.ROSEN: Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken is hitting the road as we speak, visiting five Mideast states over coming days, starting today in Lebanon, Chris.(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: James Rosen reporting from the State Department -- James, thanks for that.Now, let's bring in the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Republican Bob Corker of Tennessee for his first television interview since the agreement.Senator, I know you have been briefed in some detail by top administration officials. What's your -- and I understand it's a framework, but what's your initial reaction to what you've learned?SEN. BOB CORKER, R-TENN., FOREIGN RELATIONS CMTE CHAIRMAN: Chris, I did reach out to the energy secretary and I've had three conversations with him over the last couple of days. I think it would be very difficult for anyone to ascertain at this moment, as you just reported in Iran, they're reporting sort of the mirror image opposite of what's being reported here. And as you saw, Zarif has actually challenged Secretary Kerry for presenting talking points that only intended to cause Congress to be pleased.So, look, there's a lot of water that needs to go under the bridge here. Many, many details are unknown at this point. And so, I don't know how anyone could really ascertain whether this is something good or bad yet for the American citizenry.WALLACE: Now, there are some key issues that both sides agree haven't been settled yet. One of the questions is how fast the sanctions will be lifted. Another one is how quickly Iran could ramp up its centrifuge program after the initial ten years.But let me just ask you -- and I understand that you don't know all the details -- are there any red flags that you see right now? Is there anything at least at this initial point that looks clearly unacceptable to you?CORKER: So, there are four things I would lay out. First of all, as you mentioned, how will the sanctions be relieved? Iran is saying immediate, the U.S. is saying phased. What are the elements that we're going to be looking at to alleviate those?Secondly, and very importantly, the covert activities. What are the snap types of inspections we're going to be able to do? What are the processes that can be in place? Is this going to create some long dispute?Thirdly, you refer to the -- the document refers not even in capital letters to a nuclear development program that Iran has agreed to. It's my understanding that this is actually been written out and yet none of us have been able to see that.And I'll just stop there. Those are three of the red flags. One more I would mention, there's a process through which Iran is going to lay out their previous military dimensions, and yet it doesn't say when that process is going to begin, when it's going to end, is this going to be done by the time there's a final agreement?So, those are some of the red flags. Again, I'm open. I know there are a lot of details that will be worked out over the next several months.That's why on behalf of the American people, Congress needs to be playing a role. What the American people may not know right now, Chris, is there will be all kinds of classified annexes that are very important. They lay out the details as to how much of this is going to take place. And that's why it's so important that Congress play its rightful role in approving this prior to the congressionally mandated sanctions that we put in place are alleviated.WALLACE: Well, let me -- let me get to that right now because your committee, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, will meet on April 14th, that's just nine days from now, to consider legislation that you have already introduced.And let me put up on the screen what that legislation would call for. The president would be prohibited from suspending, not even ending, but even suspending any congressional sanctions for 60 days while the House and Senate review the deal, but President Obama says this --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: If Congress kills this deal, not based on expert analysis, and without offering any reasonable alternative, then it's the United States that will be blamed for the failure of diplomacy. International unity will collapse and the path to conflict will widen.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Senator, couple of questions. Will your committee actually vote on your bill on April 14th? And will you insist on congressional review?CORKER: Absolutely, Chris.Again, I think everyone would say that the congressionally mandated sanctions are what helped in a strong way get Iran to the table. And so, certainly we should approve this deal. We should approve what we see prior to those being lifted.And, look, I've talked to the negotiators. No one, no one has said that Congress weighing in would have any effect on this deal. As a matter of fact, what we know is just quite the contrary. We know that during the negotiations, the fact that Congress was likely to weigh in was something that the administration, the other Western countries were able to use to ensure that this deal isn't worse than it is.So, the fact that they knew Congress was going to weigh in was helpful in the negotiations. Certainly, the American people want to know that someone is teasing out all of the details, especially as they see Iran reporting one thing in their country and the U.S. something else here. So, look, this is the place where sober and thoughtful people to dig in. Look, I want to see a negotiated agreement. I know that a lot of water has to go under the bridge over the next 90 days.And it's very important that Congress is in the middle of this, understanding, teasing out, asking those important questions -- just like the ones that you begun to ask this morning.WALLACE: But, Senator, Foreign Minister Zarif of Iran said yesterday that if there is no deal or if the West backs out, that Iran will be free to continue to resume and to build back its nuclear program. And President Obama says that sanctions, the existing sanctions prior to this negotiation, didn't stop Iran from developing its nuclear program. For instance, 19,000 centrifuge centrifuges.And then, the president said this --(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: Do you really think that this verifiable deal, if fully implemented, backed by the world's major powers, is a worse option than the risk of another war in the Middle East?(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: First of all, your reaction to foreign minister's comments about their ability to continue their nuclear program if the West backs out. And secondly, what about the president saying the sanctions don't work and if you kill this deal, we are going to end up with a war?CORKER: So, look, there's always this straw man. As has been said, Chris, we would be better off today with the interim deal, continuing as it is today if we think that we're moving to a bad deal. One of the things that most Americans may not be aware of, but we'd be releasing about $130 billion to the Iranian government once we make this deal over time. Their economy is going to flourish.So, again, I think to pose this straw man of a war, the fact is that Congress has a rightful role to play in this. We know that we've already played a positive role, going through this in detail and making sure that all the answer -- the questions are answered is an appropriate thing for us to do.And that doesn't mean that there won't be a deal. We just set in place a process to insure that if there's a deal, it's a deal that will stand the test of time, that will keep Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.WALLACE: Senator, there are some details I want to go through quickly with you, if I can, sort of housekeeping, if you will.CORKER: OK.WALLACE: One proposal that's been floated is a non-binding vote by Congress. You could disapprove the deal, but then the president could still go ahead and suspend sanctions. Is that acceptable?CORKER: No. No, it's not. I think the bill that we've laid out that has strong bipartisan support, Chairman Menendez, who now stepped down, Chuck Schumer supports this, Tim Kaine, who's been very active, very close to the administration, supports this.There is strong bipartisan support for a binding vote by Congress. This is not something -- look, the president needs to sell this to the American people and Congress needs to be involved in this way.WALLACE: All right. Let me ask you the second question. The White House has said that the president would veto the kind of legislation you're proposing. If he does, you don't need 51 votes or even 60 votes, you need 67 votes, which means 13 Democrats to override his veto.Do you have 67 votes?CORKER: Well, I don't know whether we have 67 votes or not, just with cosponsors and if every Republican supports it, we'll see how that all shapes out. But we've got 64 or 65 that we're aware of today if that were the case.I talked to a number of Democrats over the weekend, and I think there are many more that are considering this.Look, I think the American people want the United States Senate to go through this deal. They understand this is one of the most important geopolitical agreements that will take place during this decade. This is an appropriate place for us to be.If the president feels like this is something that's good for the nation, surely he can sell this to the United States Senate and the House.WALLACE: Finally, sir, I've got about 30 seconds left, the formerly top Democrat on your committee, Senator Bob Menendez, who you mentioned, of New Jersey, has taken a very hard line on a deal and, in fact, cosponsored your mandatory congressional review. He has just been indicted on bribery charges.Do you believe there is any connection between his opposition to the president on this and on Cuba and the fact that he's been brought up on charges?CORKER: Chris, I can't -- I don't know what's going on behind the scenes. I know that Bob Menendez has been a very good partner on foreign policy issues. He's been very constructive. I'm sure that he will continue to be. As to the motivations of Justice Department, I just would have no way of knowing.WALLACE: Senator Corker, we're going to have to leave it there. Thank you so much for coming in and talking to us today. And we'll follow what happens with your legislation, sir.CORKER: Thank you, sir.WALLACE: Up next, our Sunday group joins the conversation about this interim deal with Iran.Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the agreement? Just go to Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday and we may use your question on the air. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: We hope that their leadership takes the right decision, but the deal we'll accept is they end their nuclear program.JAVAD ZARIF, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: None of measures include closing our facilities. The proud people of Iran would never accept that.MARIE HARF, STATE DEPT. SPOKESPERSON: We absolutely made no concessions on your bottom line, and that is the only thing that's important here.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: President Obama setting a tough marker for a nuclear deal with Iran during a 2012 presidential debate, but Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif and State Department spokesperson Marie Harf putting very different spin this week on the framework deal that's actually been agreed to.It's time now for our Sunday group: syndicated columnist, George Will, Mara Liasson from National Public Radio, Jason Riley of The Wall Street Journal, and Fox News political analyst, Juan Williams.Well, as we say, President Obama started out with a firm red line, if you will, that Iran must end its nuclear program, we're obviously a long way from there. George, there are obviously concessions in any negotiation. Did President Obama and the West give up too much or is this a reasonable deal?GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, what was given up that really matters was given up a while ago, that is they conceded the right to enrich, the capacity to enrich and the possession of some low enriched uranium.This deal comes in the fourth quarter of an Obama presidency that has been characterized in foreign policy by four failures: the failure to leave a stable Iraq, the failure of the Russian reset, the failure to advance the Israeli/Palestinian peace process, and the failure to suppress the proliferation of al Qaeda emulators and franchises, if you will.So we went into this with a kind of asymmetry of urgency. The president wanted to stop the Iranian bomb, but he really wanted a deal that could be presented as revolutionary for the whole region. The Iranians wanted to lighten the sanctions, but they really want a nuclear weapon. And I think that's the asymmetry that defines this process.WALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel and we got sharply different reactions on Facebook.Bill Farro asked, ""Why would anyone who had Iran struggling because of the embargo take such a weak stance in negotiations?""But Mary Ann Arlotta writes, ""Kerry did the best he could. There is no way Iran will give up this program.""Juan, how do you answer Bill and Mary Ann?JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I don't think it's in so much about concessions, especially to Bill's question. I think this really is about commitments. And what we got here is Iran was forced to the bargaining table by the sanctions. And remember, the sanctions, Bill, the sanctions are imposed by an international committee, not the United States alone.So, unless you have the whole group, plus I might add, places like Japan, India, Pakistan, not buying oil from Iran, if that broke down and just U.S. sanctions would not have been sufficient to continue this and Iran would have continued building their nuclear weapons. Right now, I think the estimate it would take three months for them to have breakout capacity, to have nuclear weaponry under this current deal, it looks like it would be about a year. And you have a 15-year time frame in terms of inspections which are unprecedented.So, I think it's -- there were some concessions as you say, but this to me, and I might -- you know, if you're saying, Juan, you tend to be more Democratic than Republican. Take a look at ""The Wall Street Journal"". They're saying it too, this is a useful deal.WALLACE: That is the perfect segue to Jason Riley, because, in fact, I was a little bit surprised ""The Wall Street Journal"" editorial page, which was generally no fan of President Obama, I thought was surprisingly mild in its reaction to the deal, saying that there were useful limits on Iran's nuclear infrastructure but that enforcement and inspections need to be stepped up.So, the question I guess is, Jason, can this deal be saved?JASON RILEY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: I'm skeptical. I'm very skeptical. It is all about the enforcement. Iran has a perfect record of violating every inspection agreement. And I don't think that these snap-back provisions are -- they're easier said than done.WALLACE: Let's put it quickly what the agreement says snap-back, I never heard this before, is their sanctions would be lifted, but if there's any violation then they, quote, ""snap back"".RILEY: Right. But we're farming out the inspections to U.N. officials. Once those sanctions are lifted, you're going to have companies in Asia and Europe going in to cut deals with Iran. And then there will be tremendous pressure to keep those deals in place, snap-back provisions or no snap-back provisions, because there will be an economic interest from those countries to keep that business going.So, once we lift these sanctions, I think it will be very hard to get back to where we are now. I would also add that, you know, neither President Obama, or the Iran foreign minister mentioned that the Fordow facility was built secretly underground, which, of course, is where you build a facility when you have peaceful means in mind for how it will be used.So, I don't think, again, that we can expect Iran to keep up its end of the bargain here. They have no -- we have no reason to believe that they will do so, based on their history.WALLACE: Meanwhile, we -- I want to talk about another foreign policy development this week. We had this horrific attack by terrorists on -- deliberately targeting Christians at a college in Kenya, and meanwhile the civil war in Yemen just continues to spiral out of control.I want to play a clip from President Obama from just a little bit more than six months ago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: The strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us while supporting partners on the front lines is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Mara, do White House officials acknowledge that their lighter footprint counterterrorism strategy isn't working?MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Well, yes. I mean, George listed all the foreign policy failures. I can't remember if Yemen was in there or not. But it is certainly one of them. The world looks like it's on fire and ISIS and its imitators are growing, and not necessarily in Kenya but in a lot of places in the Middle East, Iran is part of this conflict and seems to be growing stronger everyday.So, that's a real challenge for the White House. I mean, what is it going to do about this? It's not a matter of root causes, economic -- you know, lack of economic opportunity. More and more this looks like a religious war, going and indiscriminately killing people who are of the other religion. And it's a huge problem.WALLACE: The question I'm asking is that -- I don't mean it as gotcha, but they had a strategy which was the kind of lighter footprint.LIASSON: They adjusted that lighter in Afghanistan. Remember, they were going to pull out faster, more troops. They've agreed to keep about as many troops as their military advisers wanted to.So, I do think there's a kind of adjustment. I don't know what they do in places like Yemen where they're literally falling out and had to pull out their counterterrorism troops. But they are adjusting and the footprint is getting a little less light.WALLACE: George, I was also struck by President Obama's statement this week about the terror attack many Kenya. Let's put this up on the screen. He condemned a terror attack, quote, ""where innocent men and women were brazenly and brutally massacred.""He never once mentioned the fact that it was Christians who were deliberately targeted.GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Yes. These innocent people were guilty in the eyes of their killers of being Christians, but this is of a piece with the administration's mincing vocabulary as it kind of tiptoes on egg shells to avoid saying there is a religious -- irreducible religious dimension to this conflict. They tried to avoid this but the facts keep rearing their ugly heads.WALLACE: Juan, how do you explain that? On the one hand, your attackers are clearly Islamic radicals, violent Islamic radicals. They don't want to say that. And when it's Christians who are the target, the president doesn't want to say that.WILLIAMS: Well, he should say it, because it's pretty obvious. I don't think there's any getting away from the religious dimension. You look at what ISIS has done when they beheaded those Coptic Christians, if you recall, Chris. And remember now where they have a situation where they had been pushing Christians out of Iraq, you know, kind of ancient homeland of Christianity.I don't think there's any question. Let me say this, these radical violent Muslim extremists also kill Muslims in greater numbers than they kill Christians. So, you have to take that into account. In the case of Kenya, I think it's quite clear, they want to foment a religious war as Mara was saying in Kenya because most of Kenya is Christian.So, they see it a way to destabilize that society, delegitimize the government and create the kind of anarchy that they see.WALLACE: But if it's a religious war, it might help to acknowledge it's a religious war.WILLIAMS: I mean, if you think it will have some kind of strategic value. In the president's mind, not my mind speaking here, but I think in the president's mind, you don't want to say to the Muslim world that this is a war against all of Islam.WALLACE: Well, I don't think we ever would say that.WILLIAMS: Right.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: We haven't ever said that.Jason, let me finish with you. Going back to this question of Iran, there is some talk at the White House perhaps you make a deal with Iran and this begins to open up a new chapter, there's more engagement, there's less isolation. It will change Iran's behavior. The flip side of it is, we're going to be giving them billions of dollars more, as Senator Corker mentioned, which only boosts their economy and their ability to be a bad actor.RILEY: Well, I think one way to look at this in terms of whether we conceded too much is to look at who is chairing the agreement and who is not. Why are our adversaries more excited about this deal than our strategic allies, like France and Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Sunnis and the Arab states, as well as Israel?WALLACE: All right.We have to take a break here. But when we come back, the firestorm of a religious freedom bill in Indiana and Arkansas raises questions over who is really being intolerant. Our Sunday group debates that.Plus, a dismal jobs report has experts wondering how strong is the economic recovery.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. ASA HUTCHINSON, R-ARK.: This is a bill that in ordinary times would not be controversial, but these are not ordinary times.GOV. MIKE PENCE, R-IND.: It's a fix of a bill that through mischaracterization and confusion has come to be greatly misunderstood.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Two Republican governors in full retreat this week over religious freedom bills they supported and then had to rework after protests, the measures would allow discrimination against gays. And we're back now with the panel. Jason, what is your take away from the retreat, if you will, that -- first of all, about the whole debate over religious freedom and the fact that the governors, as you saw here of Arkansas and Indiana after first saying they were going to sign these bills then had to insist that they be reworked before they did -- were finished with them.JASON RILEY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Well, both sides are claiming intolerance here. But I think only one side is really guilty of hypocrisy. And that's what I see going on here. Hillary Clinton who opposed gay marriage until two years ago is tweeting about Indiana's intolerance. The Democratic governor of Connecticut who banned state employees from traveling to Indiana even though Connecticut has essentially the same law in place. So that's what I think is going on here. It is the height of hypocrisy, positions held just a few years ago by Democrats are now considered anti-gay and bigotry in place.WALLACE: Juan, let me pick up on that because the initial push was that these laws and the people who supported them were being intolerant, the idea that a private business could discriminate, let's say, against participants in a gay marriage, that that was intolerant, but you began to hear a push back later, especially this week, that to insist that someone do something that violates their moral conviction, that that's intolerant. How do you balance those two?WILLIAMS: I think it's very hard to balance because, you know, someone who has religious beliefs myself, I want them to be respected. But I do think we're a nation of laws. And we are not a nation of religious beliefs. Everyone in our country can have their religious beliefs, but you have to come back to civil laws and liberties. And as such, I don't think there's any question that if the law specifies that you are open for business, whether it's gays or blacks, that under our laws, public accommodation laws, et cetera, that you have to treat people equally and fairly. That's the basis of our understanding.Now, I will say in response to Jason, there's been a tremendous shift in the terms of American public opinion, and that's why I think you see people who two years ago may have had one position, I think President Obama says he's evolved on this issue, I think much of America has evolved and changed on this issue and that's why you see corporate America taking the lead in this fight, by the way.WALLACE: Jason, let me just pick up on this conversation between the two of you. I think it would certainly agree that if somebody came in to the baker, you know, the proverbial baker's getting a lot of business as baker, that and said, you know, an interracial marriage and we want a cake. I think you would say that that's outrageous the idea that he would not participate in an interracial marriage. Why is that any different than the same sex marriage?RILEY: We have antidiscrimination laws in the book, we have public accommodation laws in the book and there's no indication that there's any pattern of courts allowing these laws, these religious freedom laws to trump those laws. I think this is a straw man. This is being gemmed up. And there's no reason we can't handle them on a case by case basis like we've been doing. But I do agree with Juan that there's an evolution in the country particularly among young people. Which is why you see some division, even on the right about how to proceed with these cultural wars, so to speak. This is very much a generational issue. And with the GOP out there looking at the next presidential election, wanting to appeal to younger voters, there's some indication that, you know, we've got other issues to talk about. Hilary is deleting e-mails. Obama is cutting deals with (INAUDIBLE) over nuclear weapons. Let's talk about those things, those unite the party. They don't want to talk about it.WILLIAMS: And I just quickly say before we let our friends in that, in fact in Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court said that in some cases where you have a family-owned business with strong religious beliefs that you can take into consideration their faith with regard to providing contraception to women. And what we've seen in Indiana is different than Connecticut and these other states, because they would say it's not just a matter of government having to have a high bar in terms of putting any pressure on a religious belief, but individuals and corporations could now go to court and say we're protected by the same kind of provisions.WALLACE: We could continue this conversation and I'm sure we will, but let's turn to the economy and some really disappointing numbers on the economy this week. Here they are. Only 126,000 jobs were added in March. That's the weakest hiring in 15 months. Labor force participation dropped to 62.7 percent, matching the lowest since 1978. And the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta estimates first quarter growth at zero, zero percent, flat. George, what's going on here?GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, for the second year in a row they've blamed poor quarterly growth on insufficient global warming, that is on winter, on an unusually cold winter. Let your mind go back to November last year. There was job creation of 321,000 jobs and the administration said this is a miraculous achievement and a harbinger of things to come. It wasn't a harbinger and it wasn't miraculous. During the Reagan recovery there were 23 months of job creation over 300,000. Reagan had a month of job creation of 1 million and this was at a time when there were 75 million fewer Americans. Now, never mind zero growth. We are now being told really that two percent growth may be the new normal. If so, that's a disaster because every day, today, yesterday, tomorrow, every day between now and 2030, 10,000 more baby boomers become eligible for Social Security and Medicare. If we have two percent growth, the crisis of the welfare state, the crisis of the private sector being able to throw off the revenues, to pay the bills for the promises we've made to ourselves becomes impossible.WALLACE: Just tell again that the labor force participation stat that you have, if it were what it was at the beginning of the Obama administration.WILL: If the workforce participation rate today were as high as it was on the day Barack Obama was inaugurated, the unemployment rate in this country would be 9.7 percent, we wouldn't be complaining about the bad recovery because we wouldn't call it a recovery.WALLACE: All right, let's talk about the bad recovery, Mara. How concerned are they at the White House with those latest jobs numbers? Do they think it's more? Because one of the things I was talking about, was we really had bad weather in the northeast in March and what do they think it says about the recovery?MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Well, I think they are concerned. And it says the recovery can't seem to get any lift off and stay there. I mean, one of the big things that Barack Obama said in the State of the Union address is it's time to turn the page. The recovery is growing. Unemployment is down. Deficit is down. Now it's time to talk about other things. How to get growth more broadly shared, inequality, all sorts of things like that. We don't even have growth now. I think this does shift the big economic debate in the country back to just getting growth. Because you can't talk about it being more widely shared if you don't have it.WALLACE: But you've got to think with the divisions between the Republican Congress and the White House is nothing that they -- the president talks about job stimulus, things like that, nothing he proposes is going to get ...LIASSON: No, absolutely not. Nothing is going to happen ...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is he worse than ...LIASSON: I don't think that they expect that, though. I do think what they were hoping to do was at least lay the table for 2016, get the kind of themes and frame the debate the way he wanted to, not necessarily pass things through Congress, with the exception of a few little things like trade, maybe, maybe some corporate tax reform.WILLIAMS: That's what I was going to say. I think it's even worse than that. Because I think your Congress is talking about sequestration. They cannot pass the kind of infrastructure support the highway trust fund bill. So, essentially Congress is not contributing to this. And I would add that there are lots of people, George, in our society that over time are reaching that baby boomer age you're referring to, and I think that's part of the labor force participation equation.RILEY: I think this president is perfectly happy with this supposed new normal. I mean this is someone who looks at the social welfare states of Europe, with their higher unemployment rates and lower productivity than we have here, and sees them not as cautionary tales, but as models for us to emulate. He wants more entitlements. He is willing to trade for that lower productivity, less labor participation rate for this cradle to grave entitlements and so forth. More social spending. Yeah.WALLACE: You know, Jason, one perhaps good piece of news that comes out of all this is that the Federal Reserve had been kind of shaking the cage talking about that they were about to or shortly going to start lifting short-term interest rates and everybody thinks now that Fed Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen may have to hold off because of this.RILEY: Well, that was always the question with her, whether she would take away the punch bowl when it was time to do so. But to tell you the truth, Chris, if 25 or 50 basis points, it's economy is that fragile that we would be tossed back into recession because of that, we're in much worse shape than the White House is acknowledging.WALLACE: So, anyway not out of the woods yet. Thank you all, panel. See you all next week.When we come back, the Archbishop of Washington Cardinal Donald Wuerl joins the debate over religious freedom. And what do you think? Where is the balance between religious conviction and perfection from discrimination? Let me know on Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday and use the #fns.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Now you can connect with ""Fox News Sunday"" on Facebook and Twitter. Be sure to check out exclusive material online at Facebook and share it with other Fox fans and tweet us at @FoxNewsSunday using #fns. Be part of the discussion and weigh in on the action every ""Fox News Sunday.""(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: A look at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City on this Easter Sunday. When we invited the Archbishop of Washington, Cardinal Donald Wuerl for a conversation this week, I expected to ask him about the pope's trip to the U.S. this fall and for his Easter message. We did discuss that, but there was also breaking news to cover about the debate over religious freedom laws and that savage terror attack on Christian students in Kenya. Your imminence, Happy Easter and welcome back to ""Fox News Sunday.""CARDINAL DONALD WUERL, ARCHBISHOP OF WASHINGTON: Chris, thank you. And Happy Easter to you. It's a pleasure to be back.WALLACE: The archdiocese is now involved in your own version of the religious freedom debate, much like what we're seeing in Arkansas and Indiana. The Washington D.C. City Council recently passed a measure that says ""religious institutions can't discriminate in hiring someone who doesn't follow your teachings on birth control and abortion."" And another measure that says ""religious affiliated schools must treat gay groups like any other."" How do you balance religious freedom versus gay and reproductive rights?WUERL: I think what we want to do is make sure we're using the same measuring rod for everybody. If we talk about discrimination, then we also have to talk about discriminating against the Catholic Church, its teachings and its ability to carry out its mission. I think at the heart of this is the ability to recognize everyone. Everyone has the dignity of who they are. But how they act now touches others. And no one should be forced to follow the actions of another and accept the actions of another. Our schools should be free to teach. We don't believe in abortion. And we need to be free to teach that.WALLACE: So, let's take the classic case that we're hearing about this week, the Christian baker who is being asked to make a cake for a gay wedding and doesn't want to do it. Is he being intolerant or is it intolerant to demand that he make that cake?WUERL: That's where we have to take a look at the word discrimination. Is it being used in the same way for both instances? I wonder if across the board we're not seeing different measuring rods being used when it comes to issues that we're facing here, for example. Why would it be discrimination for a catholic university to say we're not going to allow a gay rights or an abortion rights group to have their program on our campus? And it not be discrimination for that group to insist that the catholic school change its teaching? If we use the same measure, I think we'll find a way of lowering the decimal level and finding a way to recognize the dignity of everyone and at the same time recognize the freedom and the rights, especially religious liberty of everyone.WALLACE: Let me switch to another very difficult subject this Easter weekend. Christians are being hit across the Middle East and in Africa. In Kenya, the al Shabaab terror group killed 147 targeting Christians. In Libya, ISIS beheaded 21 Egyptian Christians. In Syria, they kidnapped 200 Assyrian Christians.Cardinal, ISIS talks about conquering Rome, their phrase. Is Christianity under attack at this moment?WUERL: I think it's fair to say that. When you look at all of these incidences, I think they're all directed at Christians. What just happened in Kenya, I'm told what I heard on the media was that those assassins went in and they separated the Christians from the Muslims and killed the Christians. This is something that the whole world should be shouting out about, the whole world should be rejecting this.WALLACE: But you know, shouting out and rejecting isn't enough. And I want to ask you about that because Pope Francis says that it is, quote, ""lawful to stop an unjust aggressor. So, what do you do in the case of ISIS? Is it moral to use force? Is it a just war to stop ISIS?WUERL: What the Holy Father said I think is absolutely true. It's also common sense. Everybody knows that you can defend yourself against an aggressor. All you have to do is try even with a child to smack the child. The child's hand is going to go up to protect itself. Why? It's instinctive in us to stay alive. And so everyone has a right to defend their life. What's happening with ISIS, what's happening with this idea of a caliphate, is simply taking intolerance and hatred and violence to a new institutional level. And, yes, everyone has a right to defend themselves. And institutions have a right to defend themselves.WALLACE: On a much happier note, the Holy Father will be visiting the U.S., including here in Washington in September. I know it's early, but do you have a sense of the message that he hopes to bring to this country?WUERL: I think what we're going to hear from him is something we've heard over and over and over again and that is we need to recognize no one is perfect. God loves all of us the way we are. God forgives us. And God asks us to love one another. The great commandment love God and love your neighbor is echoed over and over and over again in the teaching of Pope Francis. But I think what people see and why they're so attracted to him -- and I'm told he has the highest popularity rating of anyone -- I think one of the reasons for that, Chris, is we see in him not just the message, but how you do it. The way in which he lives, treats people, responds to people, says I think to many people says to me, he sounds and looks a lot like what Jesus would have sounded like.WALLACE: There are, on the other hand, some church practices that some American Catholics are not happy with. People who are divorced, unable to take communion, the status of gays in the church, the pope has seemed to try to move the church forward on some of these issues and some top officials in the church have pushed back. Will this pope be able to move the church?WUERL: I think what he's doing is already calling everyone at every level in the church to look at two things. The teaching, which never changes, and how we live that teaching, how we apply that teaching and how we try to make the best of the situation in which we find ourselves. He keeps saying, and this is a beautiful part of his ministry, he keeps saying, go out, meet people where they are, and accompany them on their journey so that perhaps all of us could get a little closer to where we all need to be. And I think that's the beauty of his ministry. I also think that's the secret to why so many people find him so inviting, so welcoming. He's saying you can, you can do better. You don't have to start with being perfect.WALLACE: Finally, your eminence, we would love an Easter message from you to our audience.WUERL: Thank you. As we know, Easter is the great joy of hope, the celebration of the resurrection of Jesus from the dead, but for the whole world, it's a sign of hope. We can do better. We can have a better world. We can build a better community. We, who walk with the risen lord, know that. And the call to everyone else is let's never give up hope, that we can really have a better world.WALLACE: Your eminence, thank you so much. It's always a great joy to have you here. Happy Easter.WUERL: Happy Easter to you as well. Thank you.WALLACE: Please come back.WUERL: All right. I will.WALLACE: Up next, our power player of the week making Washington's National Cathedral whole again.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: It has become the nation's house of prayer, where they held a day of remembrance after 9/11 and the state funeral for Ronald Reagan. And now they are putting it back together. Here is our power player of the week.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)JOE ALONSO, NATIONAL CATHEDRAL HEAD STONE MASON: I started hearing this - what I thought were explosions. I didn't know the whole thing was going to collapse.WALLACE: Joe Alonso is talking about the earthquake that hit Washington in 2011 and the damage it did to the National Cathedral.ALONSO: The energy of that quake traveled up through the masonry walls and then all these slender carved elements, that's what shifted and fell and rotated.WALLACE: As the headstone mason, he leads the team putting the cathedral back together. Two months ago, they finished phase one, repairing the stone and mortar of the ceiling inside. Now comes the hard part.ALONSO: All of these are going to have to be dismantled.WALLACE: A ten year, $22 million project to fix or replace intricately carved stones that weigh tons on top of the cathedral. Alonso took me up the central tower 300 feet.(on camera): Wow. This is a view I've never seen.ALONSO: Welcome to the tippy top of D.C.WALLACE (voice over): It certainly is. An extraordinary vantage point to see the sweep of our nation's capital. But the view of the tower is not so good. The tops of three of the four pentacles fell off, as for what's left ...ALONSO: It's separated. It's the big chunk of stone that joins this to the pinnacle, sheared off back here. Another two or three seconds of earthquake, we would have lost a tremendous amount more stone.WALLACE: One thing that struck us was the remarkable craftsmanship of carvings no visitor will ever see.ALONSO: That's the whole thing. You know, this cathedral, right?

Nathan Deal today announced that he will have the state pay off its bond debt on Dec. 1, 2013, and move rapidly after that to remove the Ga. 400 toll by the end of that year. This will stop collection four years earlier than previously planned.“Ga. 400 commuters have paid more than their fair share already, and this is the earliest we can bring it down without paying a penalty for early repayment of the bonds,” Deal said. “When the Ga. 400 toll went up, the state of Georgia promised commuters that it wasn’t forever. If we don’t keep that promise, we lose the faith of the people. We face many challenges when it comes to paying for new capacity, particularly in the Atlanta region. There are no easy answers, no secret pots of money, but it is imperative that governments build the trust of their people. As your governor, I will keep the promises I make to you.”The Ga. 400 toll was originally scheduled to come down after 20 years, ending in 2011. In 2010 – after then-candidate Deal promised to end the toll the following year – the state issued new bonds tied to the toll revenue in order to pay for needed improvements in the Ga. 400 corridor, including a new connector to I-85. The $40 million in new bonds were issued Dec. 1, 2010, and they mature June 1, 2017. But at the three-year mark the state can repay the bonds without a penalty. Further, the state needs time to plan for physically bringing down the gates and the dramatic restructuring that will be needed in the toll area.“As I have said many times before: I inherited a situation where we could not bring down the gates immediately, and we face a situation where we would have to pay a penalty for early repayment,” Deal said. “This timeline gives commuters a finish line, while still allowing us to meet our obligations. Moving forward, we’ll need to continue to work on long-term solutions to congestion in the 400 corridor. And I look forward to doing that in a transparent fashion that commuters can trust.”The governor's proposal requires approval of the State Road and Tollway Authority. 		1

Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland, came out in opposition to the bill. “I’m not for it, so I’m not going to commit to bringing it to the floor,” Mr. Hoyer said.Still, with the economy in a recession, pressure is certain to build on the House to vote on the measure.Congress has raised its own pay in standalone bills more than two dozen times, according to the Congressional Research Service. But in 1989, it passed a law providing for annual cost-of-living adjustments unless Congress votes otherwise.Lawmakers voted to skip their annual raises for several years in the 1990s and in 2007. They voted to forgo the pay increase for 2010 because of the recession.The latest raise, of $4,700, took effect in January and brought Congressional salaries to $174,000.In the Senate, Tuesday’s action was orchestrated by the majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada. He had promised the move as a result of a dispute last week with Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, who had wanted to attach the provision to a $410 billion spending bill.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A19 of the New York edition with the headline: Senate Scraps Automatic Raise.

We’ll never stop fighting to protect and expand this fundamental human right.The Supreme Court’s landmark 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade that affirmed abortion as a constitutional right for all was supposed to be the beginning of the fight for women’s equality and autonomy, not the end. Since then, we’ve been forced to defend it over and over again as anti-choice politicians and organizations focus on undermining and chipping away at our rights until they can do away with legal abortion access completely. They’ve passed hundreds of laws to restrict a woman’s ability to access safe, legal abortion care. These laws take many forms, including trying to outlaw abortion altogether, shutting down clinics, restricting access based on income level and dictating which medical procedures are available.Virginia’s abortion access has been rated “severely restricted,” and 92% of Virginia counties have no abortion clinic at all. For over two decades anti-choice legislators have held control of the state House and Senate and they have passed a series of laws – including mandatory 24-hour waiting periods, mandatory medically-unnecessary ultrasounds, biased counseling, and bans on abortion coverage – that limit a woman’s access to abortion. TRAP restrictions on abortion clinics have further decimated access. Fake clinics, or so-called “Crisis Pregnancy Centers” outnumber abortion clinics by about 5-to-1.When the right to abortion is endangered, the fundamental equality of women is threatened. A woman can never be equal if she is denied the basic right to make decisions for herself and her family.While access in Virginia is severely restricted, seven in 10 Virginians support the right to legal abortion. NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia will continue to fight to expand access and keep abortion safe and legal for all, regardless of ZIP code or income. We will mobilize together to defeat attacks in the states and in Congress. We’ll help elect candidates who will be champions for reproductive freedom. And we will continue to educate, inform and rally the public to protect and expand the fundamental human right of all people to make their own decisions about their lives.Restrictions on Abortion AccessClick the issues below to learn how anti-choice politicians and activists are blocking access to abortion care.Legislative Restrictions on Access to AbortionA woman’s access to abortion shouldn’t depend on her ZIP code, her health insurance or how much is in her bank account.Learn moreWomen’s access to abortion care shouldn’t be limited by medically unnecessary, anti-choice regulations.Learn moreMedication AbortionThe method for terminating a pregnancy should be determined by a woman and her doctor, not politicians.Learn moreAbortion Refusal LawsEveryone should have access to quality health care and accurate medical information when they need it.Learn moreBiased Counseling & Mandatory DelaysWomen seeking abortion care shouldn’t face judgment, shame or unnecessary delays in accessing that care, and nobody should be lied to about their health care.Learn moreForcing a patient to undergo a medically unnecessary procedure is unethical and demeaning.Learn moreYoung Women’s Access to AbortionYoung women need access to all reproductive-health-care options.Learn moreAnti-Abortion ViolenceWomen seeking medical services, and the health-care professionals who provide them, should be free from acts of violence, harassment and intimidation.Learn moreA woman facing an unintended pregnancy deserves medically accurate, comprehensive and unbiased information.Learn moreBirth ControlAdd Your NameWe fight for a future that includes access to all reproductive health care no matter your zip code or employer.

Luis Gutierrez and Rep. Brian Bilbray to appear on ""This Week.""0 SharesEmailTAPPER: Hello again. From the Gulf to the unemployment lines, from Kabul to Baghdad, America is facing many difficult challenges, and Democrats are facing a tough political environment.With the exception of Michelle, Sasha and Malia, there's probably no one in Washington who knows President Obama as well as our guest this morning, the president's top political adviser and close friend, David Axelrod.David, thanks for being here.AXELROD: Jake, thanks for having me.TAPPER: So the president's popularity among independents is sinking. It's a real problem for him politically. One year ago, he was at 56 percent approval with independents. Now it's 38 percent. Why do you think independents are turning away from the president?AXELROD: Well, first of all, there are all kinds of numbers out there, so this is one set of numbers. There are other sets of numbers.But, look, I think I've said this to you before. When I -- when I sat down with the president and his economic advisers, a group of us in the middle of 2008, and they told us what was about to ensure and -- about the recession that we were well into at that point, I said to him, you know, we're going to -- your numbers are going to suffer here, and we're going to have a difficult election, because these are going to be difficult times for the country.Our job is not, though, to worry about that, Jake. Our job is to worry about how we get people back to work, how we move this country forward, and if -- if we do our job, the rest will take care of itself.And, remember, elections -- the presidential election is an eternity away. Elections are about choices, though. They're not referendums. And on the other side of the ballot in November will be a party that has an economic theory, and it was tested, and it led to catastrophe.We lost 3 million jobs in the last six months of 2008. The financial market almost collapsed. They turned a $237 billion surplus that Bill Clinton left into a $1.3 trillion deficit. And they're running on the same policies.So people have to decide, do they want to go forward or do they want to go back?TAPPER: OK, but you're a smart guy, and you know underneath these numbers are things other than the fact that we're in tough economic times. White voters in particular have developed an even stronger skepticism about the ability of government to perform effectively. That's the exact opposite message of President Obama's campaign theme of a competent, yet activist government.Do you think you overestimated your ability to convince the public that government can be effective?AXELROD: No, look, Jake, you say ""that aside."" You can't say ""that aside."" When you run your...(CROSSTALK)AXELROD: No, no, no, no. When you govern -- when you're governing in a very difficult economic time, the worst economy since the Great Depression -- and that's what we walked into -- people are going to be unhappy, and they have a right to be unhappy. These are difficult times.And so this is not unexpected. And the best thing we can do is make the right decisions for the country, and that's what the president is going to do.TAPPER: Well, let's talk about those decisions, because -- because obviously there is what Democrats on Capitol Hill call spending fatigue on Capitol Hill. How can you and how can the president create jobs without there being any willingness on Capitol Hill to spend money to do so?AXELROD: Well, I think it's true that there's not a great -- there's not a great desire, even though there's some argument for additional spending in the short run to continue to generate economic activity. There's not a great appetite for it.But I do think there are some things we still can accomplish. I do think that we can get tax -- additional tax relief for small businesses. That's what we want to do, additional lending for small businesses. They're an engine of economic growth. We're hoping we can persuade enough people on the other side of the aisle to put politics aside and join us on that.Unemployment insurance, we ought to extend unemployment insurance. People are suffering.TAPPER: You can't get the votes, though.AXELROD: Well, we'll see. We'll see. But at a time when there's one job vacancy for five unemployed workers looking for jobs, clearly we have a responsibility to do it. The Republicans met that responsibility each time under President Bush, when he asked for -- to extend unemployment insurance. They ought to do it now. Let's not play politics with this issue.But we also -- there are many other things that we can do. One of the things that's driving us in a positive direction is exports. And the president talked last week about how we expand exports and steps we can take to -- we are very committed to innovation in our economy and to spurring innovation.The president went on Friday to a plant in -- in Missouri that is producing electric cars, and that -- that -- that plant would not be there but for the actions we took. The investments that we have made have leveraged four times on some of these clean-energy projects, four times private investment, and that's going to create jobs.He's going on Thursday to Michigan to a plant that produces battery -- advanced batteries for electric cars. We had 2 percent of the global market when he started. We now have 16 percent, headed to 40 percent by 2015, because we helped spur and leverage private investment, and that's what we want to do.TAPPER: Why do you think 7 out of 10 Americans don't think the stimulus had a positive economic effect?AXELROD: Because we're still coming out of a very deep recession. Remember, it took years to dig the hole that we're in, and the president was clear from the beginning it was going to take a while to come out of this. Plainly -- plainly...TAPPER: You spent more than $400 billion. Obviously, according to every economist, the unemployment rate would be higher would it not for -- would it not be for the stimulus bill.AXELROD: Of course.TAPPER: But the American people don't believe that.AXELROD: But, Jake, we are still in the midst of a very difficult economic time. The fact that it's much better than it was when we took over does not mean that it's good. And we don't accept it that way. We accept the challenge of moving this economy forward, and we're going to keep launching initiatives, and they don't all involve spending.Things like patent reform are things that -- is something that we want to pursue so that small businesses and start-up businesses with a good idea can -- can -- can move without the kind of bureaucratic obstacles that the current patent system provides.TAPPER: Well, let's talk about the business community, because you're talking about things that they would like. But in the last few days, in the last few weeks, the business community, members of it, have been voicing concerns about the Obama administration.Here's the CEO of Verizon and the chairman of the Business Roundtable, Ivan Seidenberg.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEIDENBERG: By reaching into virtually every sector of economic life, government is injecting uncertainty into the marketplace and making it harder to raise capital and create new businesses.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: And the Financial Times reported that a member of the White House recovery board, General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt, in a private dinner recently, quote, ""had harsh words for Barack Obama, U.S. president, lamenting what he called a terrible national mood and expressing concern that overregulation in response to the global financial crisis would damp a tepid U.S. economic recovery. 'Business did not like the U.S. president, and the president did not like business,' he said.""Now, I know you reject the notion that the White House and the president is anti-business. But if that -- that perception's out there, and it's having an effect on the business community's willingness to create jobs, is that not a failure of the Obama administration?AXELROD: Let me -- let's just review history here. When we took office -- no, no, no, this is important.TAPPER: Don't go -- don't go that far.AXELROD: This is important, Jake, because you -- you have to recognize what the kind of -- you know, there's no doubt that there was a kind of ""Katie, bar the doors"" philosophy in Washington during the eight years previous to us. And what it led to was a financial disaster.And all these companies were -- were in very difficult straits. In fact, their -- their profits are up 65 percent since -- since that time, over the last two years. Our financial system is now stable instead of collapsing, which would have been a devastating thing for every business in this country, large and small.But, yes, and we're working closely with business and we want to continue to work closely with business, but working closely doesn't mean that we -- that -- that we simply turn away from the kinds of corrective measures that are necessary to prevent that kind of disaster from happening again, and that's what we're pursuing.We need a financial reform that -- that is commensurate with the challenges that we saw, and we pushed for that. We need commonsense environmental policies to -- to prevent what happened in the -- in the gulf, and you can't simply let industry in each and every case self-regulate. We're not micromanaging anything, but we are looking after the public interest.TAPPER: Let's talk about the BP oil spill, as long as you brought it up. BP is attempting this weekend to replace one cap with a more secure cap, but right now, the oil is spilling into the gulf unabated. Is the president worried -- is he watching what's going on in the gulf right now, this weekend, and is he worried it's not going to work?AXELROD: Well, he's been fully briefed on a -- on a daily and more than daily basis on this. And our scientists have met and -- at some length with BP, and their technicians and scientists on this, and we have confidence that this is the right decision, because once this cap is on, we believe it will allow the capacity to -- to -- to collect all the oil that's leaking, and it'll make it easier to kill the well when those relief wells are completed in August.So there is some short-term back step here in order to get a much more secure situation.TAPPER: So he's confident it will work?AXELROD: Well, yes, we have every reason to believe that this will work. You know, this is obviously uncharted waters. Everything about this is uncharted waters, no pun intended.So -- but, you know, we think there is a very, very good chance that this -- this will provide the kind of relief that we need.TAPPER: This week, the president recess-appointed Dr. Don Berwick as administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, responsible for roughly $800 billion in health care spending. Republicans had wanted to give Berwick a hearing, and the chairman -- the Democratic chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Max Baucus, said in a statement, quote, ""Senate confirmation of presidential appointees is an essential process prescribed by the Constitution that serves as a check on executive power and protects Montanans and all Americans by ensuring that crucial questions are asked of the nominee and answered.""Aren't you setting the stage for a future Republican president to bypass the Senate's constitutional requirement of advise and consent just because that future Republican president doesn't want a political fight, which is -- seems to be the reason why you guys recess-appointed Don Berwick? He -- he could have had a hearing. You didn't want one.AXELROD: Jake, you're a student of history, so you know that recess appointments have been a part of -- of administrations, Republican and Democrat, for a very long time.TAPPER: Yes, but not because you want to avoid a hearing, usually because there's some other reason.AXELROD: No, look, the hearing is not the issue. The issue is that we've had nominees who have had hearings and then have waited months and months and months for a vote. And the fact is...TAPPER: Not Berwick.AXELROD: ... the Republican Party -- the Republican Party has made it a policy in the United States Senate to hold up...TAPPER: I grant you all of that.AXELROD: ... as many nominations...(CROSSTALK)TAPPER: I grant you all of that, but that's not -- that's not Berwick.AXELROD: But this is too -- this is -- but this is too important. This -- this position is too important. In the midst of implementing health -- health reform, it is too important to allow that kind of game-playing to go on. And the president needed to act, put someone in place, and get the -- and get policies in place that will make -- make the reform a success.TAPPER: But Republicans were not delaying. Grassley wanted a hearing two weeks ago. The only game-playing...(CROSSTALK)TAPPER: ... you could say is that they were maybe going...(CROSSTALK)AXELROD: Jake, the delays -- the delays haven't occurred at the -- in the hearings. The delays have occurred after the hearing. In the first year of our administration, the Senate had to invoke cloture, in other words, to stop filibusters 21 times...TAPPER: Right, I got it.AXELROD: ... 21 times. That didn't happen once under the Bush administration.TAPPER: I grant you all of that, but this one case -- there wasn't even a hearing. You didn't want to have a hearing, because he was going to be attacked.AXELROD: That's -- we didn't -- we -- we wanted to move because we needed someone in place, and we knew that -- that the plan of -- on the other side was to draw this out, and we simply felt, given the gravity of the situation we face -- understand that Dr. Berwick is -- is -- is widely and highly regarded.TAPPER: Absolutely.AXELROD: Mark McClellan, who had this position under George Bush...TAPPER: Thomas Scully.AXELROD: ... Mr. Scully, yes, the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, the AARP, who has more than a passing interest in how the Medicare program is administered, have all warmly endorsed his candidacy. And there is no question about his -- his credentials or his preparedness or his -- or the desirability of having him there.But what we don't want in this midst of an election is to -- is to let this be drawn out in a long kind of political circus while the job that needs to be done is not getting done or not getting done with the man who should be doing it.TAPPER: All right. We're running out of time, so I only have a couple questions. In Afghanistan, the U.S. plan supported by General David Petraeus is to empower local village defense forces. President Hamid Karzai has expressed serious concerns about this, fearing it's going to lead to village militias. Will the White House intervene? Or is this just Petraeus' show to run?AXELROD: Well, look, Petraeus has -- I think he met four times with -- with President Karzai last week. And he will work this through with him. Obviously, we want to work in partnership with the government there. And I think these issues will be resolved.Ultimately, we want to create a situation where the Taliban is not -- insurgency is not on the upswing in these communities, and we want to take the steps that are necessary to -- to stop it. And I think both the Afghan government and -- and the United States has an interest in that.TAPPER: Last question. It appears from the Blagojevich trial this week that the White House's version of what discussions occurred may conflict with the testimony of the SEIU's Tom Balanoff. Balanoff said that the president told him that Valerie Jarrett wanted to be a senator, and Balanoff told the president he would talk to Blagojevich. Did the president -- is that testimony correct?AXELROD: I'm not going to comment on testimony, but I -- there's -- if you go back and look at the -- at the report that Greg Craig put out in December of 2008 for -- for the administration or the soon-to-be administration, he acknowledged that the president spoke to people within his staff and to people outside.TAPPER: But it doesn't say that he spoke to somebody about how Valerie Jarrett met the qualifications and would be interested in being a senator?AXELROD: Well, there -- look...TAPPER: It was incomplete, at the very least.AXELROD: The -- what -- what -- again, I don't want to comment on the -- but what nobody seems to disagree on is that the president wanted to bring Valerie Jarrett here to the White House...TAPPER: Balanoff said that, too, absolutely.(CROSSTALK)AXELROD: ... and that no -- no offers were made in order to promote her candidacy and so on. And that -- those are the essential facts that I think people want to know and need to know.TAPPER: All right, David Axelrod, thanks so much for joining us this morning.AXELROD: OK. Thank you.TAPPER: Arizona's new immigration law takes effect on July 29th. Already seven lawsuits have been filed to try to stop it, including the one filed by the Obama administration this past week. It's a legal and political debate that will play out throughout the rest of the year and the foreseeable future.This morning, a special ""This Week"" debate. Representative Luis Gutierrez is chairman of the Immigration Task Force of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. He opposes the Arizona law. Representative Brian Bilbray, Republican, chairs the Immigration Reform Caucus, and he supports it.Gentlemen, thanks for being here.GUTIERREZ: Good to be with you, Jake.TAPPER: So, first of all, Congressman Gutierrez, just to establish our parameters here, is there a serious crime problem in Mexico that's spilling into the U.S. and necessitates more secure borders before an immigration reform bill should be worked on?GUTIERREZ: I think we have a problem at our border. I think we have increased -- when I got to Congress, there were 5,000 Border Patrol agents. Today, we have 20,000 Border Patrol agents.TAPPER: Do we need more?GUTIERREZ: We may need more. We should do everything we need to do in order to secure that border. But we should do it in a comprehensive manner. And we should do it in a bilateral manner.I mean, let's face it: It is also the craving for the drugs here in America which is driving the drug trade from Mexico to the United States.So this is what we have. We have a border which we have put a lot of resources on, which the president has committed more resources to, but shouldn't we segregate -- that is, divide -- those criminal elements that exist, that are causing damage on both sides of the border?I mean, there are people in Mexico dying every day, prosecutors, justice department, police, fighting these criminal elements. They're also damaging us. Should we have a joint response? Shouldn't that joint response say, we're going to secure that border. We're going to do everything. But let's separate those that are coming here, crossing that border, looking for jobs, who are also a victim and prey to that very same criminal element, from the criminals, and have laws the effectively combat the criminals and resolve our immigration problem?TAPPER: Well, let's -- let's talk about that, because, Congressman Bilbray, I want to -- there's been a lot of overheated rhetoric in this debate. And I want to play this clip for you from last month. Here's the Arizona governor Jan Brewer.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BREWER: They're coming across our border illegally, and the majority of them, in my opinion -- and I think in the opinion of law enforcement -- is that they're not coming here to work. They're coming here and they're bringing drugs, and they're doing drop houses, and they're extorting people, and they're terrorizing the families. That is the truth, Matt. That is the truth.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: Congressman Bilbray, that's not the truth. And I've never heard you make any comment along those lines. A majority of the individuals crossing the border are criminals and seeking criminal enterprise? Should that rhetoric be condemned?BILBRAY: The majority is not -- they are not actively engaged in the drug traffic. The difference is the perception of those of us on the border, like myself who grew up down there, and somebody who's up -- up in the northern areas like Chicago see this differently.She is seeing this, the fact that she's seeing the crime, she's seeing that her community is becoming the kidnap capital of the world. She's seeing the drugs tied to...TAPPER: That's not necessarily true, either, by the way.BILBRAY: Well, Tucson is supposed to be -- I mean, not in the world, but (inaudible) United States, a major issue here. But the fact is, anywhere in the United States, this place has gone out of control. We saw it in San Diego, and the same people that are opposing Arizona's actions are the same ones who said in San Diego our fences wouldn't work.I think her perception is this. You cannot separate the drug cartels from the smuggling cartels. They're the same. You cannot separate the fact that the border region is out of control because there's all this illegal activity.The problem is that Arizona took a leadership role two years ago when the United States didn't follow, and that is go to the real source. Watch out when they say secure the border, because the border is a symptom. The real problem is out-of-control illegal immigration getting to illegal jobs that are going all the way up to Chicago. But we're looking at the border.You really want to secure the border? Secure the workplace in the United States. Have more ICE agents breaking down the -- the barriers to enforcement that we need to be breaking down the employment opportunities in places like Chicago. Then we'll be able to secure the borders.TAPPER: Do you agree? Do you disagree?GUTIERREZ: Here's the problem, and here's the fact that Mr. Bilbray leaves out of this debate. The fact is that 40 percent of the undocumented workers in this country didn't cross that border. They came here legally to the United States. They came on a tourist visa. They came on a student visa. They came on a temporary worker visa, and they overstayed their visa.So what we do is we continue to focus on the border as if though that were the exclusive problem that we have with our immigration system and those staying here.Look -- and we're in Washington, D.C. There are going to be tourists here this summer that aren't going back to their country, OK? There are going to be students that are going to graduate that aren't going back.So what I would suggest to Mr. Bilbray is that we agree on so much. I am ready to work with him to put whatever more border enforcement -- although we have quadrupled the number of resources on that border, but we also have to look internally if we're going to end illegal immigration as we know it.So here's where Mr. Bilbray and I agree, all right? Put more border...(CROSSTALK)TAPPER: More Border Patrol.GUTIERREZ: We -- we agree. It's in the bill. I have 102 Democrats who are ready to do it. I'm sure he's ready to do it.TAPPER: How many Republicans do you have?GUTIERREZ: Well, none. They don't have -- they don't have a comprehensive proposal. But let me just make -- I think...TAPPER: But you can't get anything passed if you don't have Republicans for it. In the House you can...GUTIERREZ: Exactly. Exactly.TAPPER: ... but in the Senate you can't.GUTIERREZ: Exactly. So, Jake, here's -- but -- but I think, first, we should see what it is what agree on so then we can figure out the others.(CROSSTALK)GUTIERREZ: And -- and -- no, but, seriously, I think if he wants a Social Security card that -- that...(CROSSTALK)TAPPER: Right, that's in the Democratic bill in the Senate.GUTIERREZ: It's in our Democratic bill, too.TAPPER: But here's the question, Mr. Bilbray, Congressman Bilbray. I've read a lot of transcripts with you, interviews with you, and I've never heard you say what should happen with the 12 to however many million illegal immigrants are in this country, what should happen to them. You say stop the employing -- the employment of them...BILBRAY: Right.TAPPER: ... but you don't say, do we deport them? Do we make them temporary guest visa workers? What happens to these people?BILBRAY: Jake, the first thing you do is pass the two Democratic bills the Republicans agree on, the Heath Shuler bill, where you have 230 people support it, Republicans and Democrats. Then you have Silvestre Reyes' bill, which has Republican -- we could pass that tomorrow if Speaker Pelosi allowed it to be done.First you do is stop paying them to be here. Then what you do is you give enforcement the chance. You have not had interior enforcement.When we talk about this, again, the 40 percent, don't hire 80 percent Border Patrol agents and 20 percent ICE. Ask the Border Patrol association. They would prefer to have ICE agents enforcing the employment. What you do with the people once you -- once you have done enforcement, you can do a true guest worker program where people come here legally and go home, but you do not create a special status for those illegally in the country and expect the rest of the world to follow our rules, if we announce that if you want to come to America you break the law...TAPPER: So you don't have a problem with the idea, if these individuals -- the however many million, 12 million -- have to go back to their home countries, right, have to re-apply, have a temporary guest worker program, get in the back of the line, fine -- fine, learn English, that's OK with you?BILBRAY: No, no, no. You had to say back of the line. The fact is, you've got to clarify. As long as we offer the same proposal to those who are waiting patiently to immigrate legally, as we're going to offer those who are illegally here -- because once you send the message that we're going to reward and create a special status for those who are illegally here, you will not be able to build a fence tall enough.TAPPER: Congressman Gutierrez, let -- let me ask you a question. Isn't Arizona's inclination to take matters into its own hands understandable, given the failure of the federal government to deal with this?GUTIERREZ: Yes. It is understandable. The federal government has not exercised its preeminent role, its constitutional role in enforcing our immigration policy. And I think what President Obama has done is, first, he laid out a speech before the American people in which he says, here's our immigration problem as I see it, and here's my solution as I see it.And the following week, the Justice Department basically didn't go down to Arizona -- although I can argue with racial profiling and civil rights violations, and I think I can argue them well -- they didn't go down there and make that argument. They just said the federal government is the preeminent authority on immigration policy, and we're taking control.But now we have to take control. So what Mr. -- Mr. Bilbray basically answered to you is that he thinks this is kind of like Fantasy Island, right, where 12 million people are just going to disappear like a mirage. They're not going to -- they're not going to...(CROSSTALK)GUTIERREZ: If I could just finish -- they're not going to disappear. Let me just describe who these 12 million people are. Half of them have children. There are 4 million American citizen children attached to them. Do you know that two-thirds of them have been 10 years or longer, millions of them have been here 20 years?(CROSSTALK)TAPPER: We only have a minute left, so I just want to have -- let Congressman Bilbray...(CROSSTALK)BILBRAY: ... what they are. The fact is, is you've got 15 percent work in the construction trades. You've got 14 million unemployed Americans and legal residents. The fact is, what are you going to do with the next 20 million illegal? Because you've announced a policy -- is it going to be a policy that we're going to give amnesty every year?And my question is this, is like you said. We would support if they were at the back of the line, but why can't we do the enforcement? Why can't we give enforcement a chance?The Obama administration is saying now -- they're doing now that when they bust an employer, they just -- they just let loose the illegals on the assumption that the illegals will deport themselves. Even the Obama administration is recognizing, once employment is...GUTIERREZ: They will not leave. There are 12 million. Listen to that 7-year-old girl who asked the first lady.BILBRAY: Ask...GUTIERREZ: Can I just finish? Listen to that 7-year-old...(CROSSTALK)BILBRAY: ... how do you know they won't leave?GUTIERREZ: Answer the question of that American citizen innocent child. There are 4 million like her. There are 12 million other. There are families. They have deep roots in our country. And we should find a way -- here's what I want to do with them.TAPPER: You know what?(CROSSTALK)GUTIERREZ: I want to bring them into the federal government, register them, have them learn English, pay taxes, and be good with the law.BILBRAY: Look, Arizona -- Arizona is about the fact the federal government hasn't given enforcement a chance.GUTIERREZ: I'm ready to do -- listen to this program. I am ready to give...(CROSSTALK)BILBRAY: Then pass the Shuler bill. Pass the Silvestre Reyes bill, and we've...(CROSSTALK)TAPPER: OK. I have to -- you know what? I have to leave it right there. Not surprisingly, we didn't settle upon a common ground bill. But, Congressman Gutierrez, Congressman Bilbray...GUTIERREZ: Thank you, Jake.TAPPER: ... thanks so much for joining us. We really appreciate your time.TAPPER: Yes, so that was the LeBron-a-thon from earlier this week. It's one of the many topics we will discuss on our roundtable with George Will, Ron Brownstein of National Journal, Reihan Salam of National Review, and the Washington Post's Ruth Marcus.I want to start with President Obama out on the campaign trail again this week trying to sharpen his message. Here's a glimpse.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: They're not coming back and saying, ""You know what? We really screwed up, but we've learned our lesson, and now we've got this new approach, and this is how things are going to turn out really well."" That's not their argument. They are trying to sell you the same stuff that they've been peddling. They are peddling that same snake oil that they've been peddling now for years.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: So the president, George, is trying to make this not a referendum on him, but rather a choice between him and Republicans. Is it going to work?WILL: No, because he is an expert on snake oil. This is the man who said, if we pass the $767 billion stimulus bill, which it turns out costs $862 billion, a $95 million oops, we would have unemployment at 8 percent and no higher, and it went higher.This is the man who, in another form of snake oil, said we have this wonderful idea of homeowner tax credits for buying first-time homeowners, which we now realize has largely subsidized home purchases that would have been made anyway.This is the man who last week was out saying, ""I'm going to give $2 billion, about $2 billion, to two companies to create about 1,600 jobs."" That's $1.5 million per job. That is snake oil.TAPPER: Ron, you were just in the Denver suburbs talking to voters. What's their take?BROWNSTEIN: Well, look, it is, as George says, the aspiration of every president who presides over tough times to frame the midterm as a choice, not a referendum, and it's an especially attractive idea now, because as you can see when you go out and talk to voters, the decline in esteem of Democrats has not been matched by a rise in appreciation of Republicans.But, in fact, it is very difficult to change the frame of the election that way. The tendency of voters is to view the midterm primarily as a referendum.Two statistics worth noting. In 2006, when Democrats took back the House, if you looked at the national exit polls on the House races, 84 percent of the voters who approved of George W. Bush voted for Republican House candidates; 82 percent of the voters who disapproved of Bush voted for Democrats.In '94, when the Republicans took the House and the Senate, 82 percent of the voters who approved of Bill Clinton voted for the Democrats; 83 percent of those who disapproved voted for the Republicans. There is that strong tendency.And when I was out talking to voters, it was clear that it is Obama who was front and center, not the Republicans, and what he is facing is an opposition that is more energized and ardent than his supporters.And doubts even among some of those -- I thought the thing that was most striking to me, in talking to voters, was even those who felt that the TARP was necessary, that it prevented us from falling off the cliff into another depression were still enormously offended by the idea of bankers getting this kind of assistance without paying a more direct consequence.TAPPER: Reihan, are we facing a wave here? Are Republicans going to take over the House and maybe even the Senate, do you think?SALAM: I think we are, but I also think it's kind of a gimmie. Republicans aren't performing nearly as well as they ought to be. Consider the folks who've been hit hardest by the recession. It's younger voters. It's African-Americans. And these are constituencies that are not giving Republicans a second look.But another thing is, there was a tremendous vulnerability among those college-educated, upper-middle-class white voters who turned to Obama in droves. And there was some indication that maybe they were tilting towards the Republicans, and they're not in big numbers.And that is the real opportunity, because those working-class, blue-collar whites that Ron writes about, they have tilted Republican for a long time. The real opportunity was in those big-city suburbs, and they don't seem to be moving as quickly as they ought to be for Republicans to have a real lasting, effective impact, the kind of thing that would tell you that in 2012 they might have a real shot at taking back the White House. So I think that it's a problem.TAPPER: Ruth, does -- we'll get to you in a second, Ron -- Ruth, what's your take? Is the president doing the right thing here? Is this -- is this the effective message to help at least lower the losses in November?MARCUS: Well, that presumes there's any effective message. And the president says, look, these guys drove the car into the ditch. Why would you give the keys back to them? The only problem with that is, who's been driving the car for the last 18 months and where are we?And I agree with George in the sense that I don't think this message is going to -- it may tamp things down and make people think a little bit, but the reality is, one side is energized, the other side isn't energized.I disagree that it's snake oil. I actually think the administration -- I wouldn't stand by every single thing they've done, but they did what they could do to get the economy back on track. It just hasn't happened quickly enough, and they are paying the inevitable price for that.TAPPER: Ron?BROWNSTEIN: They have a case to make on that front, but I think the challenge they have -- Reihan, I think, was -- was alluding to it. Blue-collar America is really hurting, and it had been trending Republican even before this downturn. It is very hard to imagine any of that turning around between now and November.If there was an opportunity -- if there is an opportunity for Democrats to avoid a true debacle, it is probably in those upper-middle-class suburbs. Two points: There's a sharp gender divide. College-educated white-collar women, white women with college degrees, are open to Obama. They are his strongest group in the white electorate, and they're pretty evenly divided on the election.College-educated white men are -- tend to be more ideologically suspicious of government, and they could break very sharply toward the Republicans.The other point, though, is that the Dow is a big indicator of economic health in these kind of white-collar suburbs. And -- and the fall in the Dow, the correction really, I think, has soured some of these voters on the economy.But what the administration wanted was a narrative that said, look, we have been through the dark valley, things are beginning to turn up, and do you want to go back? Without that predicate, the ""do you want to go back"" message loses a lot of its sting.TAPPER: But, George, we are in the middle of something of a recovery, are we not? Does he not have a case to make?WILL: No, because the general...MARCUS: You're surprised by that answer?WILL: ... the general American experience is that the sharper and more abrupt the downturn, the sharper and more abrupt the upturn, the V-shaped recovery. This is looking dangerously like an L-shaped recovery, in terms of what really interests people, which is job-creation.An -- an economist has made the following analogy that I think Americans understand. If I pay my neighbor $1,000 to dig a hole in my backyard and fill it up again and he pays me $1,000 to dig a hole in his backyard and fill it up again, according to the national income statistics, that's a $2,000 increment to GDP and two jobs have been created. The American people understand, however, there's no real wealth created in this kind of transfer payment.MARCUS: George makes a really important point about the shape of the recovery, because the reality is that it takes a while for voters to get that the economy is getting better, if it is getting better. And the fact that the economy is where it is now is pretty much where they're going to vote in November. If -- if suddenly the economy started to grow robustly, there just isn't enough time for the perception to catch up with the reality.TAPPER: Reihan, every single time a Republican member of Congress or even a Republican candidate makes a gaffe, whether it's John Boehner or Joe Barton or Sharron Angle, the White House pounces on it like a piece of meat. Does it have any effect? Is it getting -- is the message getting out there that, hey, if you give the Republicans control of Congress, Joe Barton, who apologized to BP, is going to be head of the Energy Committee? Is that having any resonance at all?SALAM: I think it does have an effect in a narrow way. The White House has a huge problem with the Democratic base. There are folks who are outside of that core African-American constituency, core liberal constituency who are wondering.The president says things like, ""Well, we should have a bigger stimulus, but we can't get it politically, so there you go."" They want to see him actually affirmatively make the case for it. Put your money where your mouth is. If you really believe that these more liberal, more aggressive solutions are going to work, then make the actual case.So then by playing this kind of partisan game, you know, heightening the partisan conflict, you're actually keeping your people on side in that kind of a way without actually delivering on the policies, the bold policies that a lot of folks on the left expected.TAPPER: And speaking of bold policies, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was at the White House this week. George, you were -- were not with us last Sunday, an anomaly, because you were in Israel and you met with Netanyahu.You -- you saw the meeting on Tuesday from Israel. Was anything accomplished?WILL: No, and here's why: 19 years ago, 1991, in Madrid, direct talks between Palestinians and Israelis, big breakthrough. You know what we're trying to get 19 years later? Direct talks between the Palestinians and the Israelis.The Palestinians are holding out hoping that American pressure will be put on Israel to make concessions that they should be trying to get at the negotiating table, which makes me think that, once again, the peace process itself is the biggest impediment to peace.We're constantly lecturing the Israelis, for whom getting up in the morning and getting on a bus can be a risk, that they ought to take a risk for peace. The Israelis say, we withdrew from Gaza. What did it get us? Hamas took over. We now have a terrorist state in Gaza armed with all kinds of rockets. We withdrew from southern Lebanon. Now we have Hezbollah dominating that with 65,000 short-range rockets and now scuds coming from Syria that can hit Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.Now the question is, what do you do with the West Bank? What has changed in 19 years are certain facts on the ground, facts that you can see by literally driving around Jerusalem, enormous set of new flourishing suburban areas that no conceivable Israeli government is going to hand over that territory to any Palestinian state.TAPPER: Ruth, there was a lot of pageantry this week with President Obama -- the last time Netanyahu was here, there was not even a photograph released or a photograph permitted by the press corps. This time, the press corps was allowed inside the Oval Office. There was this long extended handshake. President Obama walked Netanyahu to his car, told him, ""Be well.""MARCUS: I think he fluffed some pillows.TAPPER: Almost. There was -- it was very demonstrative. But what's the substance here, beyond this reaffirmation of friendship?MARCUS: Well, the reaffirmation of friendship is itself important. What we saw on Tuesday was a recognition by both the Israelis and the United States that this is a relationship that's too big to fail. It is not in anybody's interest to have the kind of bickering, hostility, dissing, whatever, that we have seen at various points earlier on in this administration. It was not working for either side.So we have a little bit of a reset going on here. And that is important because it sets the stage for a much better handled Mideast policy from the point of view from the Obama administration, which I think has been very good cop, bad cop, good cop, bad cop, and it's been the same cop, which has been President Obama, to try to set the stage for progress going forward.Will there be progress? George's history suggests how difficult that is. We'll, you know, see you in September on that. That's when the moratorium expires. We'll see if there's a movement towards direct talks. We'll see if there's an extension of the moratorium.TAPPER: And in the next...MARCUS: But we -- we needed this pageantry to get to the possibility of substance.TAPPER: And we're told in the next two months there will be an announcement about direct talks. Do you -- are you optimistic, Ron?BROWNSTEIN: Well, I mean, I think that you have to separate the process for the policy. I mean, look, it is -- it is the fate of Democratic presidents and Bibi Netanyahu to be linked to each other in this kind of mismatch and an Israeli government that probably is more comfortable with the point of view of a Republican conservative government.The White House feels that they have made progress in sort of imposing or advancing their view of how Israel achieves security on Netanyahu in the sense that he has moved on the process and is more likely to accept direct talks. But his -- whether his view of the ultimate value of those talks and whether what he is willing to give up or negotiate during those talks has really changed much, I think there's reason to be much more skeptical of that.In the end, it's hard to believe that the Obama view of what Israel needs to do to advance its security and the Netanyahu view of what Israel needs to do to advance its security are really ever going to truly converge.SALAM: I think that there's the bigger, deeper issue, and George alludes to this, which is that it's not clear who the Palestinian negotiating partner is, and the United States can exert as much as pressure as it wants, but, you know, as long as that's not the case -- and that's a process that has to be worked out and is only going to be worked out among the Palestinians.As far as the president goes, I think the -- you know, the Democratic foreign policy establishment really believes that the peace process or at least the projection that the United States intends to do something about the peace process is vitally important for achieving goals elsewhere in the Islamic world, and that means that it's just talk, talk, talk and nothing else.TAPPER: There was an interesting political development this week here domestically in the United States with former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin rearing her head and releasing this Web video for her PAC.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PALIN: Moms kind of just know when something's wrong. There in Alaska, I always think of the mama grizzly bears that rise up on their hind legs when somebody's coming to attack their cubs, to do something adverse toward their cubs. If you thought pit bulls were tough, well, you don't want to mess with the mama grizzlies.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: So, Ruth, you're the actual only mama grizzly at the table. What's your take on this?BROWNSTEIN: Rear. Rear for us.MARCUS: Well, yes, I think I'll withhold my rearing, unless there's an adverse event towards one of my cubs.BROWNSTEIN: Yes.MARCUS: I -- there's been a lot of talk about this video as signaling a kind of new, kinder, gentler Sarah Palin, trying to broaden her appeal beyond the kind of Tea Party base. I don't get it. I think it's the same, old, vapid, platitudinous Sarah Palin, not to put too fine a point on it.There is not a shred, not a shred of substance in this ad. What are the adverse events and what do you intend to do about them?TAPPER: Reihan's shaking his head. You liked it.SALAM: I thought it was an outstanding ad, very impressive, and I've got to say, quite a lot of issue -- non-issue issue ads from the Obama campaign during the 2008 that proved very successful. Basically, Republicans have a problem.TAPPER: Yes, we can.MARCUS: ""We're for vapidity.""SALAM: They have a problem. They have a problem, which is the gender problem. They have a huge problem with connecting with upper-middle-class women. And, you know, Sarah Palin might not be able to do that, but working-class women are huge. They're very important. Get them out there. Get them energized. Get them active.And if you look at Hillary Clinton circa this time in the cycle, she had very high negatives. And I don't think that issue ads were going to help her with those high negatives. Similarly, Sarah Palin has sky-high negatives. So I think that that's something she has to manage, something she has to work on, and this is a kind of plucky Sarah Palin that I think really appeals to people, that's not as hard-edged, not as polarizing, and I think that it was really impressive, far more impressive than anything I've seen from her in a long time.BROWNSTEIN: You know, Sarah Palin as a political figure is much more of a cultural statement than she is a policy agenda, and she really does divide the electorate along cultural lines. If there is an audience for Sarah Palin, as Reihan suggests, it is a blue-collar female audience, which does relate to her in some ways, but she is an enormously polarizing figure with a real low ceiling.If she runs in 2012, I believe you would see the Republican Party divide along the same class and cultural lines that the Democrats did in '08 between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.TAPPER: But, quickly, are mama grizzlies, as she predicts, going to be a force this November?BROWNSTEIN: I know about the lower 48, how many grizzlies there are. But yes. Yes. You know, blue-collar -- if she is referring there to culturally conservative, working-class white women, they have moved away from the Democrats pretty sharply under Obama. There's a lot more erosion there than there is the upper-middle-class, where he's still pretty strong.So in that sense, she is speaking to a constituency. Whether she is the voice that you want to ultimately be defining your party, that's another question.TAPPER: George?WILL: She's trying to get -- flatter people by telling them -- they may be grandmothers -- but telling them they're grizzly bears, and it makes them feel good.On the vapidness meter, that ranks nowhere near, ""We are the ones we have been waiting for,"" which was Obama's way of flattering the self-esteem of his supporters.TAPPER: All right. We have only a little bit of time, but obviously there was a big move in the sports world this week, with LeBron James moving from Cleveland to Miami. I want to do a quick whip-around on this.George, should we feel sorry for Cleveland?WILL: No, we -- well, yes, we should feel sorry for any city whose identity is bound up and who thinks its economy is bound up with one athlete.TAPPER: Ron, what did LeBron do to his image this week?BROWNSTEIN: I think he will be the Alex Rodriguez of basketball. He has gone from phenom to mercenary, and he will never go back on that continuum.TAPPER: What's -- I always read your stuff to find out what I'm missing, what I'm not thinking about with -- with the narrative. What am I missing in the story? What are we not paying enough attention to?SALAM: I think LeBron is a really impressive, bright kid who got in over his head. I think he didn't go for the most money. He didn't go for the highest profile. He did -- he wanted to play with friends, and he wanted to win some games, and I think it makes a lot of sense.And I think that he was handled very poorly by his young team of handlers. And I think that that's the tragedy. It is going to do great grievous damage to his reputation, and it's totally unfair, because he did something pretty impressive and mature.TAPPER: Give voice to the people of Cleveland who are hurting this morning. You wish he stayed?MARCUS: I wish he stayed. I saw somebody from Cleveland saying, ""We're from Cleveland. We're used to losing."" And my heart really went out to them -- to them. I understand he wanted to go play with his friends. It would have been nice if he stuck around. You wouldn't have to put a little ""dis"" in front of the ""loyalty"" tattoo he's got on his chest.And, also, it's not just -- it was the self-involved nature of the decision that really just turned me off.TAPPER: A reminder that later today on ABC News, the World Cup final, if you're interested in athletics, and our roundtablers will give their picks in the world table -- in the World Cup in the green room at abcnews.com, where later you can also find our fact checks courtesy of PolitiFact.Coming up here, the Sunday funnies.0 Shares"		1
http://www.politifact.com/illinois/statements/2018/mar/21/bruce-rauner/rauner-cites-own-remarks-proof-outside-support-ele/	"""Newspapers have framed this election as my fight against the Illinois mafia."""	false	['Elections']	http://chicago.cbslocal.com/	http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2018/03/20/illinois-republican-primary-governor/	2018/03/21	CHICAGO (CBS) — Gov. Bruce Rauner declared victory over Jeanne Ives in the Illinois Republican primary for governor. Rauner, despite spending millions, faced a much stronger than expected challenge from the arch-conservative West Point graduate Ives. The governor declared victory around 10:15 p.m. in a speech to supporters. “I am honored and humbled by this victory,” he said. Early polls had Rauner with a big lead, but the race tightened considerably into a single digit race in the final days. The Rauner campaign was pressing a get-out-the-vote campaign heading into the final hours. Ives represented Wheaton in the statehouse but decided to enter the race after Rauner flip-flopped, signing a bill providing public funding of abortions for the poor. Rauner has already spent $12 million and is sitting on another $55 million in cash. The bulk of his resources come from his fortune earned as a hedge fund investor. Rauner has stated he will spend whatever it takes to compete in both the primary and the general election. Ives’ campaign was largely funded by conservative packaging mogul Dick Uihlein, who has donated $2.5 million.		0

[AP photo]By David Smiley, Miami HeraldPublished: July 11, 2014Updated: July 12, 2014 at 01:21 AMMIAMI — Unable so far to goad Charlie Crist into a debate, underdog gubernatorial candidate Nan Rich continued Friday to attack the former governor's credibility as a Democrat while downplaying questions about her chances in a general election.Rich, a former state senator from Weston and Crist's lone opponent in the Democratic primary, compared Crist to a ghost during a morning forum with the Florida Press Association and Florida Society of Newspaper Editors. Crist himself spoke during their convention Thursday at the Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables and defended his record as governor, back when he was a Republican.Whoever wins the primary will face off in November with Gov. Rick Scott, who declined an invitation to speak at the event.""We need to make sure we don't have two Republicans running in the gubernatorial election,"" Rich said.Rich also took shots at Scott, saying he cost the state 122,000 jobs by not pushing the Legislature to approve an expansion of Medicaid. She said the state's economy continues to rely on ""lower-paying service industry jobs"" tied to an economy based on retirees and tourism, despite Scott's touting of jobs growth.But she focused most of her attention on her primary opponent, opening by likening him to an ""apparition who has no solid substance.""Where Crist touted his record as governor Thursday, Rich tried to savage it. She said he oversaw an expansion of Florida's controversial school voucher program, appointed conservative justices to the Florida Supreme Court and opposed adoption by gay couples. She said Crist also was against the Affordable Care Act during a failed bid for the U.S. Senate.""I don't think people believe you can change 180 degrees on every single issue and have people trust that,"" she said.Rich said she had hoped to debate the former governor in Coral Gables. But ripping Crist's record without him in the room will have to do. The better-funded, better-known Crist has repeatedly declined her challenges to debate, saying Thursday that Scott is expected to raise $100 million and ""I really don't have the luxury to take my eye off the ball.""That's a slight to Rich, who has spent more than two years criss-crossing the state on a campaign for governor. But for all her efforts, she's raised just over a half-million dollars between her campaign and a political committee, Citizens for Progressive Florida. Crist, on the other hand, raised $500,000 in a single contribution to his political action committee in June from the Democratic Governors' Association, and has raised more than $13 million total.Trending Now"		0

Meyerson Symphony CenterDallas, Texas1:46 P.M. CDTTHE PRESIDENT: Mr. President and Mrs. Bush; my friend, the Vice President, and Dr. Biden; Mayor Rawlings; Chief Spiller; clergy; members of Congress; Chief Brown -- I’m so glad I met Michelle first, because she loves Stevie Wonder -- (laughter and applause) -- but most of all, to the families and friends and colleagues and fellow officers: Scripture tells us that in our sufferings there is glory, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope. Sometimes the truths of these words are hard to see. Right now, those words test us. Because the people of Dallas, people across the country, are suffering. We’re here to honor the memory, and mourn the loss, of five fellow Americans -- to grieve with their loved ones, to support this community, to pray for the wounded, and to try and find some meaning amidst our sorrow. For the men and women who protect and serve the people of Dallas, last Thursday began like any other day. Like most Americans each day, you get up, probably have too quick a breakfast, kiss your family goodbye, and you head to work. But your work, and the work of police officers across the country, is like no other. For the moment you put on that uniform, you have answered a call that at any moment, even in the briefest interaction, may put your life in harm’s way.Lorne Ahrens, he answered that call. So did his wife, Katrina -- not only because she was the spouse of a police officer, but because she’s a detective on the force. They have two kids. And Lorne took them fishing, and used to proudly go to their school in uniform. And the night before he died, he bought dinner for a homeless man. And the next night, Katrina had to tell their children that their dad was gone. “They don’t get it yet,” their grandma said. “They don’t know what to do quite yet.”Michael Krol answered that call. His mother said, “He knew the dangers of the job, but he never shied away from his duty.” He came a thousand miles from his home state of Michigan to be a cop in Dallas, telling his family, “This is something I wanted to do.” Last year, he brought his girlfriend back to Detroit for Thanksgiving, and it was the last time he’d see his family.Michael Smith answered that call -- in the Army, and over almost 30 years working for the Dallas Police Association, which gave him the appropriately named “Cops Cop” award. A man of deep faith, when he was off duty, he could be found at church or playing softball with his two girls. Today, his girls have lost their dad, for God has called Michael home.Patrick Zamarripa, he answered that call. Just 32, a former altar boy who served in the Navy and dreamed of being a cop. He liked to post videos of himself and his kids on social media. And on Thursday night, while Patrick went to work, his partner Kristy posted a photo of her and their daughter at a Texas Rangers game, and tagged her partner so that he could see it while on duty.Brent Thompson answered that call. He served his country as a Marine. And years later, as a contractor, he spent time in some of the most dangerous parts of Iraq and Afghanistan. And then a few years ago, he settled down here in Dallas for a new life of service as a transit cop. And just about two weeks ago, he married a fellow officer, their whole life together waiting before them. Like police officers across the country, these men and their families shared a commitment to something larger than themselves. They weren’t looking for their names to be up in lights. They’d tell you the pay was decent but wouldn’t make you rich. They could have told you about the stress and long shifts, and they’d probably agree with Chief Brown when he said that cops don’t expect to hear the words ""thank you"" very often, especially from those who need them the most.No, the reward comes in knowing that our entire way of life in America depends on the rule of law; that the maintenance of that law is a hard and daily labor; that in this country, we don’t have soldiers in the streets or militias setting the rules. Instead, we have public servants -- police officers -- like the men who were taken away from us.And that’s what these five were doing last Thursday when they were assigned to protect and keep orderly a peaceful protest in response to the killing of Alton Sterling of Baton Rouge and Philando Castile of Minnesota. They were upholding the constitutional rights of this country.For a while, the protest went on without incident. And despite the fact that police conduct was the subject of the protest, despite the fact that there must have been signs or slogans or chants with which they profoundly disagreed, these men and this department did their jobs like the professionals that they were. In fact, the police had been part of the protest’s planning. Dallas PD even posted photos on their Twitter feeds of their own officers standing among the protesters. Two officers, black and white, smiled next to a man with a sign that read, “No Justice, No Peace.”And then, around nine o’clock, the gunfire came. Another community torn apart. More hearts broken. More questions about what caused, and what might prevent, another such tragedy.I know that Americans are struggling right now with what we’ve witnessed over the past week. First, the shootings in Minnesota and Baton Rouge, and the protests, then the targeting of police by the shooter here -- an act not just of demented violence but of racial hatred. All of it has left us wounded, and angry, and hurt. It’s as if the deepest fault lines of our democracy have suddenly been exposed, perhaps even widened. And although we know that such divisions are not new -- though they have surely been worse in even the recent past -- that offers us little comfort.Faced with this violence, we wonder if the divides of race in America can ever be bridged. We wonder if an African-American community that feels unfairly targeted by police, and police departments that feel unfairly maligned for doing their jobs, can ever understand each other’s experience. We turn on the TV or surf the Internet, and we can watch positions harden and lines drawn, and people retreat to their respective corners, and politicians calculate how to grab attention or avoid the fallout. We see all this, and it’s hard not to think sometimes that the center won't hold and that things might get worse.I understand. I understand how Americans are feeling. But, Dallas, I’m here to say we must reject such despair. I’m here to insist that we are not as divided as we seem. And I know that because I know America. I know how far we’ve come against impossible odds. (Applause.) I know we’ll make it because of what I’ve experienced in my own life, what I’ve seen of this country and its people -- their goodness and decency --as President of the United States. And I know it because of what we’ve seen here in Dallas -- how all of you, out of great suffering, have shown us the meaning of perseverance and character, and hope.When the bullets started flying, the men and women of the Dallas police, they did not flinch and they did not react recklessly. They showed incredible restraint. Helped in some cases by protesters, they evacuated the injured, isolated the shooter, and saved more lives than we will ever know. (Applause.) We mourn fewer people today because of your brave actions. (Applause.) “Everyone was helping each other,” one witness said. “It wasn’t about black or white. Everyone was picking each other up and moving them away.” See, that’s the America I know.The police helped Shetamia Taylor as she was shot trying to shield her four sons. She said she wanted her boys to join her to protest the incidents of black men being killed. She also said to the Dallas PD, “Thank you for being heroes.” And today, her 12-year old son wants to be a cop when he grows up. That’s the America I know. (Applause.) In the aftermath of the shooting, we’ve seen Mayor Rawlings and Chief Brown, a white man and a black man with different backgrounds, working not just to restore order and support a shaken city, a shaken department, but working together to unify a city with strength and grace and wisdom. (Applause.) And in the process, we've been reminded that the Dallas Police Department has been at the forefront of improving relations between police and the community. (Applause.) The murder rate here has fallen. Complaints of excessive force have been cut by 64 percent. The Dallas Police Department has been doing it the right way. (Applause.) And so, Mayor Rawlings and Chief Brown, on behalf of the American people, thank you for your steady leadership, thank you for your powerful example. We could not be prouder of you. (Applause.) These men, this department -- this is the America I know. And today, in this audience, I see people who have protested on behalf of criminal justice reform grieving alongside police officers. I see people who mourn for the five officers we lost but also weep for the families of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile. In this audience, I see what’s possible -- (applause) -- I see what's possible when we recognize that we are one American family, all deserving of equal treatment, all deserving of equal respect, all children of God. That’s the America that I know.Now, I'm not naïve. I have spoken at too many memorials during the course of this presidency. I’ve hugged too many families who have lost a loved one to senseless violence. And I've seen how a spirit of unity, born of tragedy, can gradually dissipate, overtaken by the return to business as usual, by inertia and old habits and expediency. I see how easily we slip back into our old notions, because they’re comfortable, we’re used to them. I’ve seen how inadequate words can be in bringing about lasting change. I’ve seen how inadequate my own words have been. And so I’m reminded of a passage in *John’s Gospel [First John]: Let us love not with words or speech, but with actions and in truth. If we’re to sustain the unity we need to get through these difficult times, if we are to honor these five outstanding officers who we’ve lost, then we will need to act on the truths that we know. And that’s not easy. It makes us uncomfortable. But we’re going to have to be honest with each other and ourselves.We know that the overwhelming majority of police officers do an incredibly hard and dangerous job fairly and professionally. They are deserving of our respect and not our scorn. (Applause.) And when anyone, no matter how good their intentions may be, paints all police as biased or bigoted, we undermine those officers we depend on for our safety. And as for those who use rhetoric suggesting harm to police, even if they don’t act on it themselves -- well, they not only make the jobs of police officers even more dangerous, but they do a disservice to the very cause of justice that they claim to promote. (Applause.) We also know that centuries of racial discrimination -- of slavery, and subjugation, and Jim Crow -- they didn’t simply vanish with the end of lawful segregation. They didn’t just stop when Dr. King made a speech, or the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act were signed. Race relations have improved dramatically in my lifetime. Those who deny it are dishonoring the struggles that helped us achieve that progress. (Applause.) But we know -- but, America, we know that bias remains. We know it. Whether you are black or white or Hispanic or Asian or Native American or of Middle Eastern descent, we have all seen this bigotry in our own lives at some point. We’ve heard it at times in our own homes. If we’re honest, perhaps we’ve heard prejudice in our own heads and felt it in our own hearts. We know that. And while some suffer far more under racism’s burden, some feel to a far greater extent discrimination’s sting. Although most of us do our best to guard against it and teach our children better, none of us is entirely innocent. No institution is entirely immune. And that includes our police departments. We know this. And so when African Americans from all walks of life, from different communities across the country, voice a growing despair over what they perceive to be unequal treatment; when study after study shows that whites and people of color experience the criminal justice system differently, so that if you’re black you’re more likely to be pulled over or searched or arrested, more likely to get longer sentences, more likely to get the death penalty for the same crime; when mothers and fathers raise their kids right and have “the talk” about how to respond if stopped by a police officer -- “yes, sir,” “no, sir” -- but still fear that something terrible may happen when their child walks out the door, still fear that kids being stupid and not quite doing things right might end in tragedy -- when all this takes place more than 50 years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, we cannot simply turn away and dismiss those in peaceful protest as troublemakers or paranoid. (Applause.) We can’t simply dismiss it as a symptom of political correctness or reverse racism. To have your experience denied like that, dismissed by those in authority, dismissed perhaps even by your white friends and coworkers and fellow church members again and again and again -- it hurts. Surely we can see that, all of us.We also know what Chief Brown has said is true: That so much of the tensions between police departments and minority communities that they serve is because we ask the police to do too much and we ask too little of ourselves. (Applause.) As a society, we choose to underinvest in decent schools. We allow poverty to fester so that entire neighborhoods offer no prospect for gainful employment. (Applause.) We refuse to fund drug treatment and mental health programs. (Applause.) We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book -- (applause) -- and then we tell the police “you’re a social worker, you’re the parent, you’re the teacher, you’re the drug counselor.” We tell them to keep those neighborhoods in check at all costs, and do so without causing any political blowback or inconvenience. Don’t make a mistake that might disturb our own peace of mind. And then we feign surprise when, periodically, the tensions boil over.We know these things to be true. They’ve been true for a long time. We know it. Police, you know it. Protestors, you know it. You know how dangerous some of the communities where these police officers serve are, and you pretend as if there’s no context. These things we know to be true. And if we cannot even talk about these things -- if we cannot talk honestly and openly not just in the comfort of our own circles, but with those who look different than us or bring a different perspective, then we will never break this dangerous cycle.In the end, it's not about finding policies that work; it’s about forging consensus, and fighting cynicism, and finding the will to make change.Can we do this? Can we find the character, as Americans, to open our hearts to each other? Can we see in each other a common humanity and a shared dignity, and recognize how our different experiences have shaped us? And it doesn’t make anybody perfectly good or perfectly bad, it just makes us human. I don’t know. I confess that sometimes I, too, experience doubt. I've been to too many of these things. I've seen too many families go through this. But then I am reminded of what the Lord tells Ezekiel: I will give you a new heart, the Lord says, and put a new spirit in you. I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.That’s what we must pray for, each of us: a new heart. Not a heart of stone, but a heart open to the fears and hopes and challenges of our fellow citizens. That’s what we’ve seen in Dallas these past few days. That’s what we must sustain.Because with an open heart, we can learn to stand in each other’s shoes and look at the world through each other’s eyes, so that maybe the police officer sees his own son in that teenager with a hoodie who's kind of goofing off but not dangerous -- (applause) -- and the teenager -- maybe the teenager will see in the police officer the same words and values and authority of his parents. (Applause.) With an open heart, we can abandon the overheated rhetoric and the oversimplification that reduces whole categories of our fellow Americans not just to opponents, but to enemies.With an open heart, those protesting for change will guard against reckless language going forward, look at the model set by the five officers we mourn today, acknowledge the progress brought about by the sincere efforts of police departments like this one in Dallas, and embark on the hard but necessary work of negotiation, the pursuit of reconciliation.With an open heart, police departments will acknowledge that, just like the rest of us, they are not perfect; that insisting we do better to root out racial bias is not an attack on cops, but an effort to live up to our highest ideals. (Applause.) And I understand these protests -- I see them, they can be messy. Sometimes they can be hijacked by an irresponsible few. Police can get hurt. Protestors can get hurt. They can be frustrating. But even those who dislike the phrase “Black Lives Matter,” surely we should be able to hear the pain of Alton Sterling’s family. (Applause.) We should -- when we hear a friend describe him by saying that “Whatever he cooked, he cooked enough for everybody,” that should sound familiar to us, that maybe he wasn’t so different than us, so that we can, yes, insist that his life matters. Just as we should hear the students and coworkers describe their affection for Philando Castile as a gentle soul -- “Mr. Rogers with dreadlocks,” they called him -- and know that his life mattered to a whole lot of people of all races, of all ages, and that we have to do what we can, without putting officers' lives at risk, but do better to prevent another life like his from being lost.With an open heart, we can worry less about which side has been wronged, and worry more about joining sides to do right. (Applause.) Because the vicious killer of these police officers, they won’t be the last person who tries to make us turn on one other. The killer in Orlando wasn’t, nor was the killer in Charleston. We know there is evil in this world. That's why we need police departments. (Applause.) But as Americans, we can decide that people like this killer will ultimately fail. They will not drive us apart. We can decide to come together and make our country reflect the good inside us, the hopes and simple dreams we share. “We also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope.”For all of us, life presents challenges and suffering -- accidents, illnesses, the loss of loved ones. There are times when we are overwhelmed by sudden calamity, natural or manmade. All of us, we make mistakes. And at times we are lost. And as we get older, we learn we don’t always have control of things -- not even a President does. But we do have control over how we respond to the world. We do have control over how we treat one another. America does not ask us to be perfect. Precisely because of our individual imperfections, our founders gave us institutions to guard against tyranny and ensure no one is above the law; a democracy that gives us the space to work through our differences and debate them peacefully, to make things better, even if it doesn’t always happen as fast as we’d like. America gives us the capacity to change.But as the men we mourn today -- these five heroes -- knew better than most, we cannot take the blessings of this nation for granted. Only by working together can we preserve those institutions of family and community, rights and responsibilities, law and self-government that is the hallmark of this nation. For, it turns out, we do not persevere alone. Our character is not found in isolation. Hope does not arise by putting our fellow man down; it is found by lifting others up. (Applause.) And that’s what I take away from the lives of these outstanding men. The pain we feel may not soon pass, but my faith tells me that they did not die in vain. I believe our sorrow can make us a better country. I believe our righteous anger can be transformed into more justice and more peace. Weeping may endure for a night, but I’m convinced joy comes in the morning. (Applause.) We cannot match the sacrifices made by Officers Zamarripa and Ahrens, Krol, Smith, and Thompson, but surely we can try to match their sense of service. We cannot match their courage, but we can strive to match their devotion.May God bless their memory. May God bless this country that we love. (Applause.) END"		1

SD 25 includes a chunk of of South Austin, plus all or part of Hays, Kendall, Comal, Bexar and Guadalupe Counties. It is pretty hard-core Republican territory.Y'all should remember Dr. Donna from 2010, when she ran a spirited race against Lloyd Doggett, and lost. She's a Tea Party zealot and extreme right winger, so it will be interesting to see how she does in a 2012 primary with Rick Perry also on the ballot. (She won a GOP primary in 2010, besting George Morovich 70%-30%.)This should be interesting. Dr. Donna is viewed by many as being actually insane. Wentworth raised more than a few eyebrows last session with his relentless determination to pass his Guns in Campus Buildings bill, even trying to prevent Senator Wendy Davis from attending her own kid's high school graduation in Fort Worth, threatening to bring the bill up for a vote while she was away.Expect escalating rhetoric around abortion. Wentworth has always been moderate on the issue — he even voted against the Sonogram bill this last session, providing one of the best lines of the debate when he said “I personally am a hairy-legged male who will never be pregnant.” True.Meanwhile, Dr. Donna thinks abortion runs counter to her medical training. She wrote on her former Congressional campaign website ,There is perhaps no issue closer to my heart than protecting the sanctity of life. The lost lives that result from abortions are lost hopes, our lost moments with future family members, and the lost dreams of an entire generation. In founding America, we made a promise to protect Life, liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. In keeping that promise, we are called by a higher power to speak up for those who cannot defend themselves.Fear not — if elected, Dr. Donna will do absolutely nothing to provide for the pursuit of education, health care, or quality of life of these forced births. Also, “those who cannot defend themselves” will most assuredly mean only the unborn Texans, not the millions of people victimized by Rick Perry and the Republican legislature this last session.By the by, she also had an “Issues” page on God.Wentworth's probably going to have a difficult time explaining the abortion issue away — if there's one thing Republican primary voters hate more than LGBT rights or minorities, it's women's reproductive rights!Also interesting to see is if Campbell's army of Tea Party activists who came to help in 2010 from around the country will return this cycle. They were pretty creepy, canvassing every house in South Austin in red shirts and camoflage pants, as I recall. At least by blanket-canvassing precincts with >60% DPI they saved TCDP and the Doggett campaign some work.Should be an interesting race. Wentworth has served in the Senate since 1993, and in the Texas House from 1988-1993. He already announced that he's running again. Wentworth tried to get a cushy university administrative gig, but it didn't pan out. (I guess he's no Brian McCall or John Sharp.) It would not have surprised me if he had retired after this past session; apparently Dr. Donna is going to try and do the honors for him.Dr. Donna, by the way, does not currently live in the district (she lives in Hagar's district), but is apparently planning to move to Hays County. She's originally from Oklahoma. She wants to “make America exceptional again.” Strategic upside: since she ran for CD-25 last cycle, and is running for SD-25 now, all of her old campaign merch with “25” on it can be repurposed. (I am guessing she's opposed to recycling, but arguably she should be in favor of saving money, right?)In any case, this primary is likely to be pretty brutal. There's a chance the candidates will run so far to the right, they may actually fall off the edge of the 6000-year-old flat earth Donna Campbell thinks she occupies.Good times!		1
http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2016/aug/10/david-canon/professor-house-speaker-paul-ryan-has-only-propose/	"""(Paul Ryan) has actually proposed three — total, three — bills that have become law in his entire career dating back to 1999."""	mostly true	['Candidate Biography']	http://www.nytimes.com/	http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/10/opinion/sunday/paul-ryans-worst-ally.html?_r=0	2016/08/10	July 9, 2016ImageHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, who is chairman of the forthcoming Republican convention.CreditZach Gibson/The New York TimesWHATEVER drama plays out when Republicans meet in Cleveland next week to nominate their party’s presidential candidate, the most consequential story line might well be the nationally televised debut of the awkward political partnership between Donald J. Trump, the presumptive nominee, and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, the highest-ranking elected Republican and thus chairman of the convention. But it offers just a sample of the spectacles sure to ensue between them should Mr. Trump become president.How could Mr. Ryan, for years his party’s self-styled ideas guy, share power with a president whose ill-formed, often baffling ideas are in significant cases the opposite of his own, and of conservatives generally — on trade, Medicare and Social Security, immigration policy and more?Could Mr. Ryan, as he suggests, really expect compromise from Mr. Trump, who has already served notice that Republican congressional leaders should “just be quiet” and leave running the country to him? Might Mr. Ryan even use the House’s legislative power to block some initiatives, though President Trump would be certain to claim a mandate for them? Where difficult trade-offs are needed to bring Trumpian ideas into legislative reality, can Mr. Ryan corral support from his fractious Republican colleagues (and even a few Democrats when necessary)?That last question suggests another, bigger one that predates the Trump ascendance: Can Mr. Ryan himself compromise in the interest of getting legislation signed into law? Many in both parties have come to doubt it after 17 years in which the 46-year-old congressman from Wisconsin has held increasingly influential positions in the House, with Republicans holding a majority for all but four of those years.This is, after all, someone whose self-described bold ideas have never gained liftoff; he has rarely taken the really bold step of writing them into legislation, with specifics. “He has actually proposed three — total, three — bills that have become law in his entire career dating back to 1999,” said David T. Canon, chairman of the political science department at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. One named a post office in Wisconsin, a second changed taxes on arrows used by deer hunters, and the third, this year, established a $3 million presidential commission on “evidence-based policy making.”“Paul Ryan is not a detail kind of legislator in terms of putting bills together to pass, and he never has been,” Professor Canon said. “He is an ideas guy. He’s not Lyndon Johnson — ‘let’s crack heads and get stuff done and actually pass some laws.’ ”As he promised on becoming speaker in January, Mr. Ryan recently rolled out a series of aspirational ideas, packaged with help from his Republican colleagues — on poverty, health care, taxes, government regulation and national security — not to vote on but to take to voters. He calls the agenda “A Better Way.”While Mr. Ryan means a better way than Democrats, he has left little doubt he also means to define a better way than Mr. Trump. Yet he is not simply reacting to Mr. Trump’s heresies and negativism. For years, especially in even-numbered election years, Mr. Ryan has espoused similar conservative agendas of ideological red meat, served up with his Reaganesque civility and optimism, as both a platform for Republicans to run on and a mandate for action if they win.Republicans did recapture control of the House after President Obama’s first two years with a Democratic-controlled Congress, and the Senate, too, in 2014. But few achievements followed. Mr. Ryan and his defenders say that reflects the reality of facing a Democratic president unwilling to sign his signature ideas into law without unacceptable compromises.Yet suppose that Mr. Trump is elected and Mr. Ryan gets the Republican presidential partner he has pined for. He can hardly claim a mandate for “A Better Way” when it is not the Trump way.Start with Medicare: Mr. Trump opposes spending less on that program and on Social Security; Mr. Ryan has long argued that only by sharply throttling back spending on entitlement benefits can the nation cut its debt. Mr. Ryan has called Mr. Trump’s plan to bar Muslims unconstitutional, opposes deporting the 11 million people in the country illegally and has advocated for immigration changes offering legal status. Approval of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade pact with 11 other Pacific Rim nations, could be punted to the next president and Congress; Mr. Trump has called it “a horrible deal” while Mr. Ryan has been supportive. Mr. Ryan is an internationalist who favors solidifying alliances like NATO, checking Russia’s expansionism and assuming a greater role in East Asia; none of that describes Mr. Trump.Whatever the election outcome, it “is sure to put him in a bad place,” said Donald F. Kettl, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. “If Trump wins, it will be because he will have found a way to campaign by marginalizing the core party and its leaders. Trump will conclude he doesn’t need Ryan’s ideas.”“If Clinton wins,” Mr. Kettl continued, “it will be because Trump has made a shambles of the party and Ryan will have had to spend months diminishing himself by distancing himself from Trump. Either way, Ryan will face a massive rebuilding job. It’s conceivable that his wonky agenda will provide an ideological keel on which to rebuild the party. But that’s not likely.”And as Mr. Ryan’s troublesome first year as speaker has shown, his challenges in passing legislation stem as much from Republicans’ divisions as from who is president. Congressional Republicans failed to agree on a budget resolution, which does not require a president’s signature. Efforts to pass appropriations bills to finance government operations have collapsed; Republican leaders are considering simply extending current funding into 2017.Republicans divide not only over policy details but also over the very act of compromising. Mr. Ryan is speaker because his predecessor, John A. Boehner, was considered too inclined toward making deals and resigned under pressure from conservatives.“I think it’s neither in Ryan’s temperament nor is it the sentiment of a lot of his colleagues to have a speaker who is like that,” said Matthew N. Green, a political scientist at Catholic University and author of “The Speaker of the House: A Study of Leadership.”Mr. Ryan has known for years that legislative details would expose the intraparty fault lines behind his big ideas. Now Mr. Trump has shown that even some ideas themselves — like on trade and immigration — have become anathema to Republicans’ angry base.“He has tried to burnish his political brand as the carrier of a conservative, ideological torch,” said Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University. “That reputation would come crashing down very quickly if he actually had to write and negotiate a bill with trade-offs, compromises, ‘pay-fors,’ etc. That would open up fissures within his G.O.P. conference, let alone with Democrats who could filibuster in the Senate.”That is why Mr. Ryan has wanted to wait until Republicans again control both the White House and Congress, Ms. Binder said. A like-minded Republican president would minimize the need for compromises and help enforce support for those deals that were required.“Of course,” she added, “the ascendancy of Trump iced over that plan.”Jackie Calmes is a national correspondent in the Washington bureau of The New York Times who formerly covered Congress and the White House.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion) , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .A version of this article appears in print on , on Page SR4 of the New York edition with the headline: Paul Ryan’s Worst Ally.

Easing rules for those institutions, Warren argues, is risking another financial crash.“It’s outrageous,” Warren wrote in one fund-raising email that accused her colleagues of voting “against working Americans” and in favor of what she calls the “Bank Lobbyist Act.” She’s delivered five speeches against the bill on the Senate floor, convened a rare Capitol Hill press conference, and made the rounds on the Sunday news shows to rally opposition on the left. With backing from 17 Democrats, the measure could pass the Senate later this week.By her own acknowledgement , Warren has irked Democrats by attacking the bipartisan bill so aggressively. They’ve accused her of misstating its provisions and exaggerating its likely impact, raising what they say is unnecessary alarm about another financial crisis exacerbated by deregulation. Politically, Warren is burnishing her reputation as a progressive fighter ahead of a possible 2020 run for president, but by going after Democrats, she could undermine the party’s bid to recapture the Senate majority, since backers of the bill include some of the most vulnerable Democrats up for reelection in 2018.Chief among Warren’s Democratic critics is Heitkamp of North Dakota, a co-sponsor of the deregulatory bill who is in a tight reelection battle this year. Heitkamp and Warren sit next to each other on the Senate Banking Committee, but their perspectives on the bill could not be further apart. In a phone interview on Monday, Heitkamp told me Warren was misleading the public about the bill and that the debate exposed a fundamental divide between Democrats who represent rural states and those who hail from more urban and suburban areas. “She doesn’t live where I live,” Heitkamp said of her Massachusetts colleague.“I think it’s really unfortunate that she has misled people regarding this bill,” she continued. “Some of the things that she has said are incorrect, and I cannot let the legislative history of this legislation be what Elizabeth Warren says it is.”For years, Heitkamp said, Democrats have watched as smaller banks and lenders in their states have been eaten up by larger institutions, due in part to the added burden of regulations created by Dodd-Frank. “Fundamentally, what I would say is Dodd-Frank was designed to prevent too-big-to-fail,” she said. “And it became too small to succeed. And you’ve seen since Dodd-Frank the bigger institutions have gotten bigger and the smaller institutions have consolidated.”Other Democratic backers of the Senate bill, written by GOP Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo of Idaho, have made largely the same argument, and they include the party’s 2016 vice presidential nominee, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia.Warren has said that if the bill were solely about helping small, community banks, she’d be all for it. But the new proposal goes beyond that. The Dodd-Frank law defined “too-big-to-fail” banks as those with more than $50 billion in assets, subjecting them to annual stress tests and other regulations that smaller banks were exempt from. Even one of the bill’s namesake authors, former Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, has said that threshold was too low and could safely be raised to $100 billion or $125 billion. But the Senate bill raises that line all the way to $250 billion, exempting all but the nation’s 12 largest institutions from the stiffest regulations and mandatory stress tests.“Give me a break,” Warren said in a recent floor speech. “This bill is about goosing the bottom line and executive bonuses at the banks that make up the top one half of 1 percent of banks in this country by size. The very tippy-top. Your local community bank doesn’t have a quarter of a trillion dollars in assets.”Heitkamp said Warren was exaggerating the danger posed by the changes and pointed out that banks with assets below $250 billion would still be subject to stress tests if regulators determined they posed a risk to the system. She also rebutted the argument that the Senate bill, through a change to reporting requirements in the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), would make it easier for small lenders to discriminate based on race or other factors. The bill exempts mortgage lenders who make fewer than 500 loans a year from the reporting requirements. “We are only affecting less than 4 percent of the total data collected with this change,” Heitkamp told me. “So there’s this, ‘Oh, the sky is falling,’ but when you actually look at who is going to be affected, and the kind of data that will be collected, 95.5 percent of all the data that could be collected under HMDA will continue to be collected.”Heitkamp wouldn’t speculate on Warren’s political motives for picking an intra-party fight over the banking bill, saying they just see things “completely differently.” But when I asked her if having the liberal Warren as a foe might be helpful as she runs for a second term in a deep-red state, Heitkamp replied: “I think people in North Dakota don’t care what Elizabeth Warren thinks.”Below is a condensed and edited transcript of our conversation.Russell Berman: Why is this bill worthy of support for a Democrat and is not the cave to Wall Street and bank lobbyists that critics on the left say that it is?Senator Heidi Heitkamp: First off, this is something we’ve been working on for five years, and it started out in reaction to the small community banks and the credit unions saying, ‘Look, we’re getting out of mortgage lending. We don’t think that we can serve our communities because the compliance burdens are way too high. The risk is way too high for these basically family-owned corporations. And we don’t have the staff to basically do mortgage lending.’So for five years we’ve been working on a fix. Fundamentally, what I would say is Dodd-Frank was designed to prevent too-big-to-fail. And it became too small to succeed. And you’ve seen since Dodd-Frank the bigger institutions have gotten bigger and the smaller institutions have consolidated. So this is to respond to that economic reality out there and also to make sure that we have thriving lending institutions like credit unions, like small community banks in rural areas.Berman: Obviously the biggest, loudest critic has been Elizabeth Warren. You sit right next to her on the Banking Committee, and she has been, in contrast with some others, just as hard on you and your fellow Democrats as on the Republicans for supporting this. So let me just get you to respond to a couple specific things that she has said.From a fundraising email:It’s outrageous. Roughly a third of all Democratic Senators voted with Wall Street yesterday and against working Americans in Massachusetts and across the country.From Meet the Press on Sunday:I don’t understand how anybody in the United States Senate votes for a bill that’s going to increase the likelihood of taxpayer bailouts. This bill also makes it easier for banks that discriminate against people on home mortgages, charges more for African Americans or Latinos than they do for whites. Makes it easier to cheat people who buy mobile homes …How do you respond to that?Heitkamp: I’d respond by saying she doesn’t live where I live. I live in rural America, and she could say this about big banks or Wall Street bailouts—that’s certainly not what my community banks believe in North Dakota. I think it’s really unfortunate that she has misled people regarding this bill. I intend to go to the floor before this bill goes to final passage and correct the record. Some of the things that she has said are incorrect, and I cannot let the legislative history of this legislation be what Elizabeth Warren says it is. So we are doing everything we can to correct the record.There are no provisions in here that substantially affect or advantage the big Wall Street bankers. That is a misstatement and highly unfortunate. As it relates to discrimination, I can tell you that less than 4 percent of all the data that’s collected is going to be affected by this amendment to HMDA. What we’re basically looking at is reducing the compliance burdens for small institutions that make less than 500 loans a year. So there is an exaggeration to the statement about discrimination, there’s been exaggeration to the statement about this being about a Wall Street bailout. The reality is this is a bill that advantages and makes more competitive our Main Street lending institutions.Berman: Given all the talk about Elizabeth Warren and 2020, do you see her critique of this bill as being on the level, or do you see her as trying to rev up opposition on the left to bolster her credentials ahead of a possible presidential run?Heitkamp: Unlike some people here, I never ascribe motivation to what people say. I’m assuming that Elizabeth feels strongly about this. She did during the discussions about this when we drafted the Democratic bill in the last Congress. This is no surprise to me that she’s in opposition. She and I see it differently. In fact, completely differently, and I think that’s a result of the perspective that I have coming from a rural community.Berman: Do you think her coming out against this will actually help you sell this bill to people in North Dakota given how different North Dakota is from Massachusetts?Heitkamp: I think people in North Dakota don’t care what Elizabeth Warren thinks.Berman: You said she was involved in some of the discussions. Have you talked to her in recent days? Did she give you any heads up about her plans to rally so aggressively against this?Heitkamp: I think we all at the end of the day as United States senators have to make decisions that are best for our constituency and we have to call it the way we see it. Obviously Elizabeth and I do not see this bill at all the same way. I intend to correct the record. I think she has misstated the facts of this legislation, and I intend to make sure the record is corrected before we go to final passage.Berman: One of the big criticisms of the bill, from Barney Frank and others, is that if this was solely about helping small and community banks, they’d be on board, but that it goes far beyond that and that it’s ridiculous to call banks with holdings of up to $250 billion, which get relief from this bill, as small. How do you respond to that?Heitkamp: Nothing in this bill in any way weakens the prohibition about making shaky loans, loans to people with weak credit and packaging them within a security. I think we have to be clear in what former Congressman Frank has said about this bill. The first thing I would like to clarify is we moved an assumption: The assumption was any bank over $50 billion could be systemically risky, right? So now we have to pick a number. The number that we picked that would create the presumption was $250 billion. But remember this: There’s a couple of really important caveats.First off, it does not take away from the fact that those institutions will continue to be stress-tested. They’re going to be regulated so that they aren’t taking unnecessary risks. Those institutions still have to comply with qualified mortgage standards. The only QM changes that we made were for institutions under $10 billion and then only if they kept those mortgages in portfolio. So all the qualifying mortgage standards that Dodd-Frank adopted continue to be part of the overall regulatory scheme. And we did not change capital or liquidity requirements for those institutions. And so that one change simply changes an assumption with allowing the regulators to continue to regulate them if in fact they find that those institutions present systemic risk.Now if I can just clarify one point. There’s a whole lot of attention to what happened in 2008. Bad mortgages were the foundation, but what really happened in 2008 was securitizing those mortgages and putting the entire system at risk. The only thing that we changed as it relates to mortgage lending is we said you can make these mortgages without meeting qualified mortgage standards, but only if you don’t put those mortgages into the secondary market and you keep them in portfolio. So to say that we are creating the same conditions that created the 2008 meltdown is a gross exaggeration.Berman: On the threshold issue, why go up that high at all, to $250 billion in assets? It seems to allow critics of the bill to say you’re not talking about small and community banks anymore if you’re going up to a quarter of a trillion dollars as opposed to, say, $100 billion, which is what Barney Frank suggested.Heitkamp: I think we’ve been persuaded that we shouldn’t always just look at the number. What we need to do is look at what the bank does, and a lot of institutions at that level, less than $250 billion in assets, they’re not sophisticated and they’re not complex. A lot of them really don’t do anything more sophisticated than what a community bank does, except they do it in greater amounts.Berman: One change Warren suggested was just taking out the provision amending the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. Why not do that?Heitkamp: Because the paperwork that’s required for the HMDA standards is overwhelming. It is absolutely one of those things that my small-town banks and my lenders say is absolutely overwhelming. It’s really important to point out here that it does not weaken any of the traditional HMDA standards or data that helps regulators combat lending discrimination. It does change for those institutions that make less than 500 loans the step-up in data collection that was in Dodd-Frank. But think about this. We are only affecting less than 4 percent of the total data collected with this change. So there’s this, ‘Oh, the sky is falling,’ but when you actually look at who is going to be affected, and the kind of data that will be collected, 95.5 percent of all the data that could be collected under HMDA will continue to be collected.Berman: The senators in the Democratic Party who support this largely represent rural communities. So how much of this debate comes down to an urban or suburban-rural divide, and do you think your colleagues who oppose this have an appreciation for the challenges like the ones in North Dakota face?Heitkamp: The short answer is no, they don’t. It’s interesting. We were talking to a reporter recently who was saying, ‘Well, why don’t they just hire another compliance officer?’ That kind of argument I just shake my head at. These are institutions that may employ 12 people total. And to ask them to hire one more compliance officer to no good end? They are not, by putting that compliance officer in that institution, guaranteeing security and soundness of the overall financial system in this country. All they’re doing is adding a burden to that institution and making their conditions in providing capital to people in rural communities less than optimal.About the AuthorRussell Berman is a staff writer at The Atlantic, where he covers politics.Loading ...		1

What started as a Facebook post by a Hawaii retiree became an unprecedented international rebuke of a new president that packed cities large and small — from London to Los Angeles, Paris to Park City, Utah, Miami to Melbourne, Australia. The organizers of the Women’s March on Washington, who originally sought a permit for a gathering of 200,000, said Saturday that as many as half a million people participated. On Sunday, Metro officials announced that Saturday was the second-busiest day in the Washington subway system’s history, with 1,001,613 trips. Many in the nation’s capital and other cities said they were inspired to join because of Trump’s divisive campaign and his disparagement of women, minorities and immigrants. In signs and shouts, they mocked what they characterized as Trump’s lewd language and sexist demeanor. The marches provided a balm for those eager to immerse themselves in a like-minded sea of citizens who shared their anxiety and disappointment after Democrat Hillary Clinton’s historic bid for the presidency ended in defeat. “We just want to make sure that we’re heard,” said Mona Osuchukwu, 27, a D.C. native. “I want her to know that she has a voice,” she said of her 3-year-old daughter, Chioma, who was with her at the march. The Washington demonstration was amplified by gatherings around the world, with march organizers listing more than 670 events nationwide and overseas in cities including Tel Aviv, Barcelona, Mexico City, Berlin and Yellowknife in Canada’s Northwest Territories, where the temperature was 6 degrees below zero. In Chicago, the demonstration was overwhelmed by its own size, after 150,000 demonstrators swamped downtown blocks. It forced officials to curtail their planned march, although thousand of protesters still paraded around the Loop. In Boston, police estimated a gathering of 125,000. In Los Angeles, officials temporarily closed some side streets to accommodate the crowds. “We are doing our best to facilitate, because they are squeezing into every street right now,” said Capt. Andrew Neiman of the Los Angeles Police Department. New York, Miami, Denver and Seattle also had huge gatherings. In Juneau, Alaska, one man marveled that the crowd was the biggest he had ever seen on the state Capitol’s steps. In Philadelphia, marchers filled city bridges. In Lexington, Ky., they shut down streets. In New Orleans, participants played brass instruments. The fear — and anger — about Trump’s rise to the most powerful position in the United States reverberated at renowned protest sites around the world, from the Trocadero in Paris to Trafalgar Square in London. Marina Knight, a 43-year-old executive assistant, and her 9-year-old daughter were two of the tens of thousands marching in London. “This is her first march,” Knight said, referring to her daughter. “It’s the first time we felt it was vital to march. In the United States, the crowds marched in weather ranging from balmy to snowy. But common to every gathering was fiery rhetoric, pink knit hats and repeated references to the boast that offended so many women: Trump’s infamous taped comments in 2005 about groping women’s genitals. Among the thousands of signs that marchers dumped at the end of the day in front of the Trump International Hotel, just blocks from his new home at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.: “P---y Power” and “This P---y Bites Back.” Protesters got as close as they could to the presidential mansion, crowding metal barriers less than a block away as police and Secret Service personnel watched closely. Demonstrators came to Washington from around the country, sometimes sleeping on the couches of people they had never met. They choked Metro stations as they made their way to the protest. The city issued about 1,800 bus parking permits for the march, and Amtrak added extra trains in and out of Union Station. The huge crowd delighted iconic feminist Gloria Steinem, 82, who was among the first speakers. “This is the upside of the downside,” she exulted. Clinton did not attend the march but tweeted her gratitude: “Thanks for standing, speaking & marching for our values @womensmarch. Important as ever. The size of the gathering proved challenging. The audio from sound system did not reach everyone in the massive crowd, and far more portable toilets were needed. When the toilets behind the stage broke down, security instructed women to use cups and ushered them into a box truck for privacy. “I’m afraid to shake anyone’s hand,” one woman joked. Although the marchers were mostly female and white, men and people of color also joined the throngs. John Fischer, a 34-year-old locksmith from Grand Rapids, Mich., drove more than nine hours with his wife, Kara Eagle. I’m here to support my wife,” Fischer said. Cynthia English, a 61-year-old Jamaican American who lives in Florida, said she wants the new president to know that women will be fighting during his presidency to ensure that the country and laws treat them equally. She was with her daughter and marching for her two granddaughters in the hope that no future president feels comfortable making lewd comments about women. “I don’t want this to happen to them 20 years from now, so I am making my mark now,” said English, who wondered, “Why are we the ones that bring people into this world, and we are treated the worst? The crowd was buoyant, even joyous. Many held up signs — “I Am Very Upset!” and “Love Trumps Hate” and “Bridges Not Walls” — while others took videos of the experience on their cellphones. Every few minutes, a rolling roar swept over them. D.C. police said they had made no march-related arrests, compared with more than 200 Friday when protesters created chaos in downtown Washington. March organizers briefly considered suspending the formal march to the Ellipse out of concern that the crowd had grown too large to safely navigate the route to the White House. But speakers soon told the marchers to set out. Lorraine LaHuta, 66, who came to the march from New York City, said that at times she wasn’t sure where to go, but that it never felt chaotic. “It was organized disorganization that worked very well,” she said. Judith Snyder-Wagner, a 67-year-old former fundraising consultant, came because she sensed a shift in the rural, blue-collar community near Canton, Ohio, where she lives with her wife, Joy. A neighbor mowed a piece of grass along their property line and put up a Trump sign facing their home. Someone recently drove through the neighborhood flying a Confederate flag. “We’ve been afraid,” she said, her voice quavering. She was limping up the sidewalk on Independence Avenue. She has had both her knee and hip replaced, and she held a cane in one hand and a poster in the other. The couple boarded a bus at 1 a.m. Saturday in Ohio and would head home less than 24 hours later. “We needed to feel inspired,” Joy Snyder-Wagner said, looking around. Trump’s election was the wake-up call that progressives needed, said Erin Edlow, 28, the membership director of the Virginia Beach Young Democrats. She was in town with her sister to demonstrate her support for the rights of immigrants and of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. “Democracy is not a spectator sport,” Edlow said. The march turned into a star-studded event, with celebrities such as Madonna, Janelle Monáe, Scarlett Johansson and Ashley Judd making appearances. D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) introduced herself as a proud “chick mayor” and implored the Republican majority in Congress to stop meddling in the District’s local lawmaking. “It’s been a heart-rending time to be both a woman and an immigrant,” said Ferrera, whose parents are from Honduras. “But the president is not America,” she said. As the march grew in prominence, it highlighted long-existing racial and political rifts in the feminist movement. The initial organizers were white women — a group that narrowly voted for Trump in November — although they quickly handed its leadership over to a diverse group of longtime organizers from New York. They have embraced an imperiled liberal agenda, in sharp contrast to much of what Trump laid out for his presidency. The march platform focused on issues such as workers’ rights, reproductive rights, environmental justice, immigrant rights, ending violence against women and more. But a group of women who oppose abortion also came, beseeching the larger march to recognize their variety of feminism. Whether to include the conservative viewpoint sparked controversy in the days before the event. Antiabortion activists said they were excluded. Siobhan Rooney, 32, drove from Philadelphia on Saturday morning to march for women’s rights. For her, that includes the rights of fetuses. “We are in the same page on so many issues. It’s just this one issue,” she said. Teresa Shook, who is in her 60s, was on hand to marvel at what emerged from her original proposal for a march in a November post on Facebook. The grandmother of four from outside Hono­lulu accepted hug and after hug as the crowd surged around her. “This is the woman who came up with the idea for today’s march,” one woman said. “Thank you!” shouted another. “I’m so blown away,” Shook said.

Horizontal interseismic motions of the fault system are largely predictable, but vertical motions arising from tectonic sources remain enigmatic. Here we show that when carefully treated for spatial consistency, global positioning system-derived vertical velocities expose a small-amplitude (±2 mm yr−1), but spatially considerable (200 km), coherent pattern of uplift and subsidence straddling the fault system in southern California. We employ the statistical method of model selection to isolate this vertical velocity field from non-tectonic signals that induce velocity variations in both magnitude and direction across small distances (less than tens of kilometres; ref. 9 ), and find remarkable agreement with the sense of vertical motions predicted by physical earthquake cycle models spanning the past few centuries 6 , 10 . We suggest that these motions reveal the subtle, but identifiable, tectonic fingerprint of far-field flexure due to more than 300 years of fault locking and creeping depth variability. Understanding this critical component of interseismic deformation at a complex strike–slip plate boundary will better constrain regional mechanics and crustal rheology, improving the quantification of seismic hazards in southern California and beyond.Subscribe to Nature Geoscience for full access:$59		1

REUTERS/Hannibal HanschkeIn Brussels, he bashed NATO partners for not spending more on defense, shoved the prime minister of Montenegro and renewed his attacks on Germany’s trade surplus with the United States.America’s allies witnessed the two sides of Trump on his first foreign trip as U.S. president, a nine-day tour that began with sword dancing in Saudi Arabia and vague pledges in Israel to deliver Middle East peace.As Trump headed home, European officials were left with mixed feelings: relief that he had been patient enough to listen to their arguments and unsettled by a Jekyll-and-Hyde figure who is still finding his way on the big policy issues.“It all fits with his strategic ambiguity approach to life,” said Julianne Smith of the Centre for a New American Security. “It may do wonders when dealing with adversaries. But it doesn’t work when dealing with allies,” she said.Other leaders of the Group of Seven nations had viewed with trepidation their summit, held at a cliff-top hotel overlooking the Mediterranean, after four preparatory meetings failed to clear up differences with the Trump administration on trade, how to deal with Russia and climate change.But in the end, officials said, the result was better than they had feared.The final communique acknowledged a split between the United States and its six partners over honoring the 2015 Paris accord on climate change. That followed a debate with Trump that German Chancellor Angela Merkel described as “very dissatisfying”.However on trade, Trump bowed to pressure from allies to retain a pledge to fight protectionism. And on Russia, he did not insist on removing - as some allies had feared - the threat of additional sanctions for Moscow’s intervention in Ukraine.U.S. President Donald Trump reacts after a family photo at the G7 Summit expanded session in Taormina, Sicily, Italy, May 27, 2017. REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi“I found him very willing to engage, very curious, with an ability and desire to ask questions and to learn from all his interlocutors,” said Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, the G7 summit’s host.NATO “DISASTER”Still, there was irritation at Trump’s refusal to show his hand on the Paris agreement to curb carbon emissions. Near the end of the summit, he tweeted teasingly that he would make a decision on Paris next week, leaving delegations to scratch their heads about why he could not commit in Taormina.The most critical words were reserved for Trump’s appearance at NATO headquarters in Brussels, which was described as a “disaster” by more than one European official.With the leaders of America’s NATO partners standing like school children behind him, Trump upbraided them for not spending more on defense and repeated the charge that some members owed “massive amounts of money” from past years - even though allied contributions are voluntary.Most disturbingly for allies, Trump did not personally affirm his commitment to Article 5, NATO’s mutual defense doctrine, after pre-trip signals from the White House that he would do just that. Trump also failed to mention Russia, which remains NATO’s raison d’etre in the eyes of most Europeans.It was a speech that reminded some of Trump’s doom-laden inauguration address in January, one that seemed written for the hardest of his hard-core domestic audience. “Proud of @realDonaldTrump for telling NATO deadbeats to pay up or shut up,” former Republican governor Mike Huckabee tweeted in response.Slideshow (6 Images)Trump’s appearance in Brussels was particularly galling to the Germans, who after months of painstaking relationship building with Trump - including Merkel’s invitation to his daughter Ivanka for a G20 women’s summit in Berlin - found themselves under attack from him on two fronts.Before heading to NATO, Trump criticized Germany’s trade surplus in a private meeting with senior European Union officials.“If Trump really wants to go down a path of isolation, it will only speed up China’s rise to the top,” one senior German official grumbled.ZERO-SUMBeyond the rhetoric, Trump’s body language also confounded his hosts. He muscled aside Montenegrin Prime Minister Dusko Markovic as NATO leaders walked into the alliance’s new headquarters for a photo session.And he engaged in two alpha-male handshakes with France’s new 39-year-old President Emmanuel Macron, who seemed to get the better of Trump on both occasions.The macho posturing in Europe contrasted to the images, a few days earlier, of Trump and his team swaying, swords in hand, with the absolute rulers of Saudi Arabia at a lavish welcome ceremony given by King Salman.Summing up the tour on Saturday, Trump’s advisers seemed most enthused about the Saudi leg, where he clinched a $110 billion arms deal and forged what one aide described as a “personal bond” with the king.“The president was able to make some of the most amazing deals that have really been made by any administration ever,” enthused his economic adviser Gary Cohn.Daniela Schwarzer, research director at the German Council of Foreign Relations in Berlin, said the trip had confirmed Trump’s “zero-sum game” view of the world in which you are either a winner or a loser and relationships are transactional.“His rhetoric and actions suggest he does not consider it a priority to build good and engaging relations with allies the U.S. so far considered its most important ones,” she said.Writing by Noah Barkin; Additional reporting by Crispian Balmer; editing by David Stamp		0

MaloneRepublican presidential candidate Ohio Gov. John Kasich laughs as he speaks to supporters Tuesday, Feb. 9, 2016, in Concord, N.H., at his primary night rally, (AP Photo/Jim Cole) (Associated Press)John Kasich makes play for the misogynist vote: He wants women out of the doctor’s office and into the kitchenJohn Kasich slashes Planned Parenthood funding on the same day he gives a speech mentioning women in their kitchensAmanda MarcotteFebruary 22, 2016 7:02pm (UTC)Gov. John Kasich is still in the race and still trying to frame himself as the moderate, compassionate Republican, but on Monday, the governor issued two glaring reminders of his very un-moderate contempt for women. During a campaign event, in a video that went viral almost instantaneously , Kasich made a comment about his female supporters that was as bizarrely unnecessary as it was condescending.""How did I get elected?"" Kasich said. ""I didn't have anybody for me. We just got an army of people, and many women who left their kitchens to go out and to go door to door to put up yard signs for me."" He did not specify if they untied their aprons or put on their shoes.Later, a woman in the audience decided to confront him, sort of, on this. ""I'll support you,"" she said. ""But I won't be coming out of the kitchen.""""I gotcha,"" he replied. It read like a morality play about life as a female conservative, an on-the-nose illustration of how you'll never get anything more than condescending head pats if you keep supporting men who refuse to offer basic respect in return.The whole thing would just be a comical distraction, if it weren't for the fact that Kasich applies this loathing for female independence to his policy choices. The same day he was spinning out this fantasy of women living a kitchen-centric lifestyle, he also signed a bill drastically slashing access to affordable contraception services for women in his state.The bill doesn't name Planned Parenthood, but it's the clear object of a ban on state funding for health services for places that offer or even just ""promote"" abortion, a procedure that over a million women get every year nationwide.The funding in question is not for abortion, however. Abortion, as is customary these days, is just the word invoked to justify what are actually cuts to a wide array of reproductive health services that make it easier for women to have sex without getting sick, pregnant on accident, or even dying: Contraception, cancer screenings, STI prevention and treatment and other gynecological services. The hostility towards women underpinning these cuts is made even more evident in this case, as funding for prenatal programs and programs to prevent domestic violence were cut.The message of today's Kasich campaign couldn't be clearer: Women belong in the kitchen, not the gynecologist's office. Though you can get day passes from your culinary prison if you're willing to pass out fliers for the Kasich campaign.Kasich's office, of course, denies ill intent towards women in the cutting of services, claiming that there are other places women can go for ""new born babies, infant mortality, expectant mothers, violence against women, and minority HIV/AIDS"". (Notice that they aren't even pretending to support contraception any longer.)The reality, however, is that these kinds of defunding schemes are extremely effective at pushing women, at least low income women, into the kitchens that Kasich dreamily imagines as their natural homes. A recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine , found that cutting Planned Parenthood's funding, even if it's redirected to other agencies, reduces women's contraception use, especially when it comes to the most effective forms of contraception. The study focused on Texas, which has been cutting funding to Planned Parenthood for years now.The result was a surge in births for women who had previously relied on government subsidies for reproductive health care, though it's doubtful that many of them lived up to Kasich's dreams by donning pearls over a shirtdress before putting on a pot roast for their hardworking husband. The ugly fact of the matter is that unwanted child-bearing for low income women just makes it harder to escape poverty . Pushing women into the kitchen, in our day and age, usually comes with a side dose of pushing them and their children into poverty.Admitting that contraception cuts just lead to more unintended births is politically unsavory for anti-choice legislators and politicians. (They prefer the myth that it will cause women to swear off sex until their prince comes along and marries them into the kitchen of their dreams.) The result of the Texas study is that one of the researchers , Rick Allgeyer, was pressured by the Republican-dominated Texas government into quitting his job at the Texas Health and Human Services Commission.Puncturing the cheerful hausfrau fantasies of Republicans like Kasich is a dangerous job these days.This is hardly the first time that the contempt for women underlying Kasich's policies came bubbling to the surface during a campaign event. Back in October, Kasich, seemingly annoyed at a female college student for her eagerness to ask him a question , decided to put her in her place.""“I’m sorry, I don’t have any Taylor Swift tickets,"" he said, while laughing at her.Kasich isn't doing well in the presidential race, but, sadly, it can't be said that it's because of his attitudes towards women. Nearly every candidate in the race has expressed similar beliefs that contraception services at Planned Parenthood should be eliminated, even if they don't acknowledge that obvious end goal, of derailing women's lives with unintended pregnancy, that such a policy promotes.The one candidate who has been less than full-throated in his hatred for the organization's contraception funding, Donald Trump, just appeals to the misogyny of the conservative base in a different way, by objectifying every woman he comes across and lobbing misogynist insults at any woman who dares question or stand up to him.Kasich's days are numbered in this race, but, as Monday's events remind us, the surge of anti-feminist legislators and governors across the country are as much, if not more, of a threat to women's rights than the presidential candidates on their own. Kasich doesn't need to be in the White House to push the back-into-the-kitchen agenda, as the women of Ohio, especially those who just lost their gynecological services, could be the first to tell you.Amanda MarcotteMORE FROM Amanda Marcotte • FOLLOW @AmandaMarcotteFearless journalism in your inbox every daySign up for our free newsletterBy signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from Salon.com.

This left-side bias holds true for both men and women and it also applies to the skin cancer melanoma. Researchers Örjan Hallberg of Hallberg Independent Research in Sweden and Ollie Johansson of The Karolinska Institute in Sweden, writing in the June issue of the journal Pathophysiology, suggest a surprising explanation that not only points to a common cause for both cancers, it may change your sleeping habits.For unknown reasons the rates of breast cancer and melanoma have both increased steadily in the last 30 years. Exposure to the sun elevates the risk of melanoma, but the sun's intensity has not changed in the last three decades. Stranger still, melanoma most commonly affects the hip, thighs and trunk, which are areas of the body protected from the sun. What is responsible for the left-side dominance and increasing incidence of these cancers?An intriguing clue comes from the Far East. In Japan there is no correlation between the rates of melanoma and breast cancer as there is in the West, and there is no left-side prevalence for either disease. Moreover, the rate of breast cancer in Japan is significantly lower than in the West; only 3 percent of what is seen in Sweden, for example. The rate of prostate cancer in Japan is only 10 percent of that in the U.K. and U.S.The researchers suggest an explanation based on differences in sleeping habits in Japan and Western countries. Previous research has shown that both men and women prefer to sleep on their right sides. The reasons for this general preference are unclear, but sleeping on the right side may reduce the weight stress on the heart, and the heartbeat is not as loud as when sleeping on the left. Still, there is no reason to suspect that people in Japan sleep in positions that are any different from those in the West. The beds in Japan, however, are different. The futons used for sleeping in Japan are mattresses placed directly on the bedroom floor, in contrast to the elevated box springs and mattress of beds used in the West. A link between bedroom furniture and cancer seems absurd, but this, the researchers conclude, is the answer.The first line of evidence they cite comes from a 2007 study in Sweden conducted between 1989 and 1993 that revealed a strong link between the incidence of melanoma and the number of FM and TV transmission towers covering the area where the individuals lived. Despite epidemiological correlations like this one suggesting the possibility that electromagnetic radiation from FM and TV broadcasts stations could suppress the immune system and promote cancer , the strength of these electromagnetic fields is so feeble it has been difficult to imagine any biological basis for the correlation.Consider, however, that even a TV set cannot respond to broadcast transmissions unless the weak electromagnetic waves are captured and amplified by an appropriately designed antenna. Antennas are simply metal objects of appropriate length sized to match the wavelength of a specific frequency of electromagnetic radiation. Just as saxophones are made in different sizes to resonate with and amplify particular wavelengths of sound, electromagnetic waves are selectively amplified by metal objects that are the same, half or one quarter of the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave of a specific frequency. Electromagnetic waves resonate on a half-wavelength antenna to create a standing wave with a peak at the middle of the antenna and a node at each end, just as when a string stretched between two points is plucked at the center. In the U.S. bed frames and box springs are made of metal, and the length of a bed is exactly half the wavelength of FM and TV transmissions that have been broadcasting since the late 1940s. In Japan most beds are not made of metal, and the TV broadcast system does not use the 87- to 108-megahertz frequency used in Western countries.Thus, as we sleep on our coil-spring mattresses, we are in effect sleeping on an antenna that amplifies the intensity of the broadcast FM/TV radiation. Asleep on these antennas, our bodies are exposed to the amplified electromagnetic radiation for a third of our life spans. As we slumber on a metal coil-spring mattress, a wave of electromagnetic radiation envelops our bodies so that the maximum strength of the field develops 75 centimeters above the mattress in the middle of our bodies. When sleeping on the right side, the body's left side will thereby be exposed to field strength about twice as strong as what the right side absorbs.If this study is correct, the solution is simple: Replace the metal in our beds with a nonmetallic mattress or orient your bed, like an antenna, away from the direction of the local FM/TV transmission tower. Call it high-tech feng shui if you like, but if this new study has not identified the cause of left-side cancer, it will, for some, be the cause of insomnia.ABOUT THE AUTHOR R. Douglas Fields, Ph.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/white-wilderness/	filmmakers staged lemming death scenes for the disney nature documentary white wilderness.	True	['lemmings', ' white wilderness', ' wild inaccuracies']	http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/	http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlifenews.view_article&articles_id=56	2017/05/23	"Disney Film Faked Bogus BehaviorBy Riley WoodfordLemmings do not commit mass suicide. It's a myth, but it's remarkable how many people believe it. Ask a few.""It's a complete urban legend,"" said state wildlife biologist Thomas McDonough. ""I think it blew out of proportion based on a Disney documentary in the '50s, and that brought it to the mainstream.""Lemmings are a kind of short tailed vole, a mouse-like rodent that favors tundra and open grasslands. Three kinds are found in Alaska, including the collared lemming, the only rodent that turns white in winter.In 1958 Walt Disney produced ""White Wilderness,"" part of the studio's ""True Life Adventure"" series. ""White Wilderness"" featured a segment on lemmings, detailing their strange compulsion to commit mass suicide.According to a 1983 investigation by Canadian Broadcasting Corporation producer Brian Vallee, the lemming scenes were faked. The lemmings supposedly committing mass suicide by leaping into the ocean were actually thrown off a cliff by the Disney filmmakers. The epic ""lemming migration"" was staged using careful editing, tight camera angles and a few dozen lemmings running on snow covered lazy-Susan style turntable.""White Wilderness"" was filmed in Alberta, Canada, a landlocked province, and not on location in lemmings' natural habitat. There are about 20 lemming species found in the circumpolar north - but evidently not in that area of Alberta. So the Disney people bought lemmings from Inuit children a couple provinces away in Manitoba and staged the whole sequence.In the lemming segment, the little rodents assemble for a mass migration, scamper across the tundra and ford a tiny stream as narrator Winston Hibbler explains that, ""A kind of compulsion seizes each tiny rodent and, carried along by an unreasoning hysteria, each falls into step for a march that will take them to a strange destiny.""That destiny is to jump into the ocean. As they approach the ""sea,"" (actually a river -more tight cropping) Hibbler continues, ""They've become victims of an obsession -- a one-track thought: Move on! Move on!""The ""pack of lemmings"" reaches the final precipice. ""This is the last chance to turn back,"" Hibbler states. ""Yet over they go, casting themselves out bodily into space.""Life-loving lemming: lemmings do not commit mass suicide, although in lean times they may become cannibalistic. These mouse-like rodents are found in Alaska and in northern countries around the world, mostly favoring tundra and open grassland.Lemmings are seen flying into the water. The final shot shows the sea awash with dying lemmings.Certainly, some scenes in nature documentaries are staged. In Sir David Attenborough's recent documentary, ""The Life of Birds,"" the close-up footage of a flying duck, filmed razor-sharp from the bird's wingtip, was shot from a car using a mallard drake trained to fly alongside the car. But faking an entirely mythical event is something else.""Disney had to have gotten that idea from somewhere,"" said Thomas McDonough, the state wildlife biologist. Disney likely confused dispersal with migration, he added, and embellished a kernel of truth.Lemming populations fluctuate enormously based on predators, food, climate and other factors. Under ideal conditions, in a single year a population of voles can increase by a factor of ten. When they've exhausted the local food supply, they disperse, as do moose, beaver and many other animals.Lemmings can swim and will cross bodies of water in their quest for greener pastures. Sometimes they drown. Dispersal and accidental death is a far cry from the instinctive, deliberate mass suicide depicted in ""White Wilderness,"" but Hibbler explains that life is tough in the lemmings' ""weird world of frozen chaos."" The voice-over implies that lemmings take the plunge every seven to ten years to alleviate overpopulation.""What people see is essentially mass dispersal,"" said zoologist Gordon Jarrell, an expert in small mammals with the University of Alaska Fairbanks. ""Sometimes it's pretty directional. The classic example is in the Scandinavian mountains, where (lemmings) have been dramatically observed. They will come to a body of water and be temporarily stopped, and eventually they'll build up along the shore so dense and they will swim across. If they get wet to the skin, they 're essentially dead.""""There's no question that at times they will build up to huge numbers,"" Jarrell added. ""One description from Barrow does talk about them drowning and piling up on the shore.""Jarrell said when people learn that he works with lemmings, the mass suicide issue often comes up.""It's a frequent question,"" he said ""'Do they really kill themselves?' No. The answer is unequivocal, no they don't.""Subscribe to be notified about new issuesReceive a monthly notice about new issues and articles.Facebook"		1

Bush did sign the bail out with a push from a (D) congress and lets try to remember for just a second, OBAMA was a sitting member at the time! Why do (D) ALWAYS forget that? What of other bails outs/stimulus packages that were enacted by the Obama administration; what you don’t want to count those? Yeah, they proved to be such a great success. I mean, the summer of recovery has really employed Americans and brought down the unemployment rate. Oh wait, IT HASN’T. Then let’s also remember the additional wars he has gotten us into WITHOUT congressional approval. Talk about your “warmonger” – remind me how many wars are we involved in now? I lost count after FOUR! Heck, why don’t we just do away with the Constitution, it gets in the way and it’s not as the people really matter anyway, right? BTW Bush DID get congressional approval, overwhelming approval. As far as the financial crisis we are in, we need to understand the housing bubble and the financial collapse of the market we need to take it back to Slick Willy. – Slick Willy signed a waiver for a few of his buddies like Goldman Sacks, Lehman brothers AIG etc to take higher risk in the market. You remove the safe guard and then people wounder why it failed? Additionally, Both Carter and Clinton passed similar bills entitled “the reinvestment act” lowering banking standard. Some how Clinton thought that allowing food stamps and unemployment checks should be considered “income” what a GREAT idea Billy! The spin and the way it was sold was to “help” minorities own the American dream, in the end it only proved that NOBODY could. GREAT JOB SLICK WILLY!! When people speak of Regan they forget that the economy boomed and people way of life was improved. The debt that was created during that era was the bad policy that was passed prior to his administration. Carter is the worst president in American history second only to Obama. Obama has increased debt that surpassed ALL debt combined in American history. Thanks to him, we are the worlds greatest debtor in the world. Only a part of the debt that can be attributed to the prior administration. However, let me remind you that congress was controlled by (D) in the last term of George W.Bush’s presidency. They not only didn’t stop out of control spending, they encouraged it. Guess what, the economy is owned by the (D). Even the DNC chair claims it to be theirs. Finally, something we agree on. People also conveniently forget that George W attempted to fix Fannie and Freddie but (D) yelled and screamed it was a ploy to hurt minorities so it was never fixed. Standard operating procedure, pull out the race card when you find yourself in trouble. Since (R) tend to be accused of racism, let’s visit the subject and history and see what we discover, shall we? The first (R) president was Abraham Lincoln. After the civil war and the passing of amendments 13 and 14; it was the REPUBLICAN party who believed African Americans should not only have the right to vote but to hold public office. The first Congressional seat held by an African American was a (R)in 1869. The (D) despised the (R) for permitting African Americans to hold office or even be part of the process that a militia strong arm was created for the (D) party; more commonly knows as the KKK. During this dark period of history the KKK created flash cards with pictures of all the (R) sitting members of congress so they knew who to go after and kill. The (D) party was never attacked simply because they knew no (D) would ever allow African Americans into their party. In other words, all (D) were white while not all (R) were. The word “lynching” comes from John Roy Lynch (R)-African American congress-member from Mississippi. Thankfully, he was never killed, however; the method in which they went after him and others in the hallowed halls of congress that day, is where the word comes from. Out of the 4800 Americans killed by the KKK aka (D) party, 3500 were African Americans and 1300 were white (R). Under (D) presidents, the nation sees debt and civil liberties decline. Under (R) Presidents we see economic growth and liberties restored. Wilson and FDR both passed bills to have Hispanics rounded up and taken to Mexico and both commonly refereed to them as “wet backs”. Term limits were created after FDR for a reason. I’ll give you a hint, it wasn’t because he was a GREAT and righteously leader. Teddy Roosevelt, was able to restore liberties with the help of a friend, Booker T. Washington. LBJ was able to pass the civil rights act with (R) help, NOT (D) in congress. Voting records show more (R) voting for the civil rights act and (D) voting against it. After all, who wants to see segregation end other than minorities and (R), surly not the (D). Margret Sanger the creator of “Planned Parenthood” was anti Semitic and hated ALL minorities. She believed there should be a limitation of minorities in the nation and understood if you offered abortion and planned parenthood, it way a way to “control” them. She often expressed her hatred of minorities in magazines articles. She was evil to the core and received praise from the KKK. I find it interesting that when Hillary Clinton was asked, what historical figure has inspired you she responded “Margret Sanger” Bill Clinton “excuses” Byrds association with the KKK as nothing more than a “good ol boy” trying to get elected. In other words, being affiliated with a grotesque mentality and slaying of African Americans is “a-okay” if you want to be elected. I wonder if that is what the party told themselves when the KKK was created? Although I applaud (not really) your attempt to defend the (D) policy and point to the evils of the (R) party, your a day late, a dollar short and historical truth is on my side, not yours. BTW everything I have said can be verified and confirmed. I just refuse to do any more research for lazy liberals who fail to acknowledge what their party stands for and where it’s roots are found. You want an education, get a library card and read. Stop assuming MSM is telling you the truth or that the DNC talking points have any real validity in the real world.		1

Thanks to Chris Guanche for letting us know.The new version of the show will air on Disney XD, which promises both the “same energy and bumbling crime-fighting spirit” and a new “gritty look that this generation of kids love.” The gritty look is an interesting comment, since, if anything, Disney XD has been much lighter and softer in its programming than Disney animation of years past. Just three years ago, the channel replaced the excellent Avengers: Earth’s Mightiest Heroes with the much gentler Avengers Assemble.If they’re really looking to make sure that Darkwing Duck has a dark tone, that could be great.

To many of us it doesn't make a whole lot of sense,"" Texas Rep. Michael McCaul said Saturday. ""All we really have at this point in time ... are his own words from his confession tape where he describes himself as a psychopath, apparently expressing no remorse for the killings that he committed.""It's hard to imagine someone whose mind is so sick that they could commit bombings like this and feel absolutely no remorse,"" McCaul said.Read MoreBoth McCaul and Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said Conditt does not address race in the recording, but authorities have not ruled anything out as the investigation continues.The two victims in the bombings were African-American and the first three bombings were carried out in a largely minority area of Austin, prompting fears of a racially motivated killer .The bomber's mistakeA security camera at a FedEx store south of Austin caught Conditt's red SUV on video, McCaul said.The bomber went to the store on Sunday and made the mistake of parking within view of a surveillance camera that captured the vehicle's license plates, the congressman said.Surveillance photos from the mail delivery office in Sunset Valley showed Conditt wearing a baseball cap, blond wig and pink gloves as he brought two packages to the store.A security camera captured this image of Conditt, in a wig, at a FedEx store.Investigators used cellphone technology to track down Conditt on Wednesday and to confirm that he had been to all of the bombing locations, McCaul said.His SUV was ultimately found later Wednesday, running in a parking lot of a hotel in Round Rock, Manley said. As plainclothes officers and unmarked vehicles descended on the area and authorities worked to get SWAT, tactical and ballistic teams in place, Conditt pulled out of the lot.Authorities followed and a SWAT team performed a tactical maneuver to force Conditt to stop the SUV.The scene where Conditt blew himself up as a SWAT team closed in.Manley praised the officers who confronted Conditt, saying, ""they charged up to a vehicle they knew was likely occupied by the suspect in this incident and that he had a bomb with him. And what happened next was chilling to watch as that explosion went off and one of our SWAT officers flew backward and landed on the ground.""The officer was not seriously injured.Austin's weeks of 'collective fear'Austin Mayor Steve Adler said the city's ""collective fear and anxiety"" was growing as the bomber carried out the string of attacks.""There was feeling that there was not much that we could do. There was a collective helplessness,"" Adler said Thursday at a City Council meeting.""Our community was beginning to fray,"" he added.Some residents have breathed sighs of relief since Conditt's death, while others remain shaken up.Narcisa Velasco had rushed to help a friend, a 75-year-old woman who was severely injured on March 12 after picking up a package in front of a southeast Austin home.She said the sight of the woman's bloody wounds and the chaotic scene of debris from the bomb are still haunting her and her family members, some of whom also witnessed the aftermath of the explosion.""We are sleeping with all the lights on,"" she said.The victimsThe lives of Anthony Stephan House and Draylen Mason were cut short when explosive packages arrived on their doorsteps.The first blast on March 2 killed House, a 39-year-old father who worked as a project manager for Texas Quarries.On March 12, Mason was killed when he brought a package indoors to open it and it exploded, police said. The 17-year-old high school student played bass in a youth orchestra, and was taking college classes.These are the victims of the Austin bombingsBoth men were African-American. Also among the injured were an African-American woman and one Hispanic woman.Prior to Conditt's death, authorities believed the bombings could be racially motivated. But police said Wednesday that Conditt did not mention anything in his video confession about terror or hate.""I know everybody is interested in a motive and understanding why,"" said Manley, the Austin police chief. ""And we're never going to be able to put a (rationale) behind these acts.""In a statement, Mason's family thanked law enforcement, saying they felt that Mason has ""received justice.""""The most recent chain of events have brought some sense of closure that our beloved has received justice, and we are prayerful that we can now start to move forward with our lives,"" said the statement obtained by CNN affiliate KEYE .Search of bomber's houseFederal agents searched Conditt's home in Pflugerville for almost two days, cautiously removing explosive materials and looking for clues that could point to a reason for the bombings.Authorities surround the home of the Austin bombing suspect Mark Conditt in Pflugerville, Texas, on Wednesday.Investigators discovered components for making similar bombs to the ones that exploded in the past few weeks, but no finished bombs were found, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.The devices that exploded in Austin and near San Antonio were pipe bombs with batteries and smokeless powder and were constructed with materials found in a hardware or sporting goods store, a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN.Austin killer used pipe bombs, source saysThe bombs had distinctive shrapnel inside. Some had ""mousetrap"" switches and others had ""clothespin"" switches, the source said.Two of Conditt's roommates were detained and questioned by police. One of them was released hours after Conditt's death, but the other was not free to go until the next afternoon, police said.They were not arrested, and neither roommate has been publicly identified.Manley on Saturday left open the possibility the roommates could face more questioning as the investigation continues.CNN's Tristan Smith reported from Austin, Texas, and CNN's Nicole Chavez and Sarah Aarthun reported and wrote in Atlanta.

In this latest social media fad, teenagers are putting detergent pods in their mouths in what's being called the ""Tide Pod Challenge.""Ingredients in the pods include ethanol, hydrogen peroxide and polymers – a highly-toxic mix of detergent meant to wipe out dirt and grime. Manufacturers have been concerned about toddlers mistakenly ingesting them , but now teens are popping them on purpose and posting videos of the results online, reports CBS News correspondent Anna Werner.Nineteen-year-old Marc Pagan, who did it on a dare, told CBS News he knew better but did it anyway.""A lot of people were just saying how stupid I was or how – why would I be willing to do that,"" he said. ""No one should be putting anything like that in their mouths, you know?""Ann Marie Buerkle, acting chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, says ingesting any of the liquid carries a deadly risk.""This is what started out as a joke on the internet and now it's just gone too far,"" Buerkle said.The pods are bright and colorful and to children they can look like candy. At least 10 deaths have been linked to ingesting these pods. Two were toddlers, eight were seniors with dementia.Procter & Gamble, the maker of Tide products, told CBS News: ""They should not be played with... Even if meant as a joke. Safety is no laughing matter.""More than 62,000 children under the age of six were exposed to laundry and dishwasher detergents, between 2013 and 2014.The next year, Consumer Reports said it would no longer recommend detergent packets, citing ""the unique risks"" while urging the ""adoption of tougher safety measures.""Buerkle says her group has worked with manufacturers to make the packets less attractive to children.""Making that laundry packet opaque, less attractive, less colorful, reducing the toxicity and the strength of laundry detergent,"" Buerkle said.The CPSC also found that elderly adults with dementia were confused by the product and have also ingested it. The danger to little kids is so high that researchers have recommended the parents of children under six years old not buy these at all and instead use regular detergent only.Anyone concerned about the dangers of laundry pods can get more information from the American Association of Poison Control Centers .

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/mothman-returns-to-point-pleasant-west-virginia/	a man in point pleasant, west virginia, caught the legendary mothman on camera.	Unproven	['mothman', ' point pleasant', ' unidentified flying objects', ' west virginia']	http://urbanlegendsonline.com/	http://urbanlegendsonline.com/mothman/	2016/11/25	Mothmanby storyteller · August 8, 2012Mothman is described as a man sized, or larger, creature with glowing red eyes and wings of a moth. It may have eyes set in his chest. It is described as a 7-foot-tall (2.1 m) creature, with long wings and huge red eyes. It possesses an unusual shriek.On November 15, 1966, two young couples from Point Pleasant, Roger and Linda Scarberry, and Steve and Mary Mallette, along with their young cousin, Lonnie Button, were traveling late at night in the Scarberrys’ car. They were passing the West Virginia Ordnance Works, an abandoned World War II TNT factory, about seven miles north of Point Pleasant, in the 2,500 acre (10 km²) McClintic Wildlife Management Area, when they noticed two red lights in the shadows by an old generator plant near the factory gate. They stopped the car, and reportedly discovered that the lights were the glowing red eyes of a large animal, “shaped like a man, but bigger, maybe six and a half or seven feet tall, with big win gs folded against its back,” according to Roger Scarberry. Terrified, they drove toward Route 62, where the creature supposedly chased them at speeds exceeding 100 miles per hour.A Mothman sighting was again reported on January 11, 1967, hovering over the town’s bridge, and several other times that same year. Fewer sightings of the Mothman were reported after the collapse of the town’s bridge, the Silver Bridge, when 46 people died. The Silver Bridge, so named for its aluminium paint, was an eyebar chain suspension bridge that connected the cities of Point Pleasant, West Virginia, and Gallipolis, Ohio, over the Ohio River. The bridge was built in 1928, and it collapsed on December 15, 1967. Investigation of the bridge wreckage pointed to the failure of a single eye-bar in a suspension chain due to a small manufacturing flaw. There are rumors that the Mothman appears before upcoming disasters and seems to try to warn people of them. Mothman was never again seen in Point Pleasant after the demolition of the Silver Bridge.John Lepper from New YorkAnother VersionOriginal PostThe Mothman is a creature reported in the Charleston and Point Pleasant areas of West Virginia between November 12, 1966, and December 1967. It’s described as a winged, man-sized creature with large reflective red eyes and large moth-like wings. Sometimes it appeared to have no head, with its eyes set into its chest.On November 15, 1966, two young, married couples from Point Pleasant, David and Linda Scarberry and Steve and Mary Mallette, were traveling late at night in the Scarberrys’ car. They were passing the West Virginia Ordnance Works, an abandoned World War II TNT factory, about seven miles north from Point Pleasant, in the 2,500 acre McClintic Wildlife Station, when they noticed two red lights in the shadows by an old generator plant near the factory gate. They stopped the car, and reportedly discovered that the lights were the glowing red eyes of a large animal, “shaped like a man, but bigger, maybe six and a half or seven feet tall, with big wings folded against its back”, according to Roger Scarberry. Terrified, they drove toward Route 62, where the creature supposedly chased them at speeds exceeding 100 miles per hour. However, as quoted in Keel’s The Mothman Prophecies, the Scarberrys, despite driving more than 100 miles per hour, claimed to have noticed a dead dog on the side of the road, and in fact made such accurate note of its location that they claimed to have gone back the very next day and looked for it. Explanations for how they were able to make so accurate a mental note at a time of such great distress, or why they would go back to look for the dead dog, are not included in Keel’s book.The following night, on November 16, several armed townspeople combed the area around the TNT plant for signs of Mothman. Mr. and Mrs. Raymond Wamsley, and Mrs. Marcella Bennett, with her infant daughter Teena in tow, were in a car en-route to visit their friends, Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Thomas, who lived in a bungalow among the “igloos” (concrete dome-shaped dynamite storage structures erected during WW-II) near the TNT plant. The igloos were now empty, some owned by the county, others by companies intending to use them for storage. They were heading back to their car when a figure appeared behind their parked vehicle. Mrs. Bennett said that it seemed like it had been lying down, slowly rising up from the ground, large and gray, with glowing red eyes. While Wamsley phoned the police, the creature walked onto the porch and peered in at them through the window.On November 24, four people allegedly saw the creature flying over the TNT area. On the morning of November 25, Thomas Ury, who was driving along Route 62 just north of the TNT, claimed to have seen the creature standing in a field, and then it spread its wings and flew alongside his car as he sped toward the Point Pleasant sheriff’s office.On November 26, Mrs. Ruth Foster of Charleston, West Virginia reportedly saw Mothman standing on her front lawn, but the creature was gone by the time her brother-in-law went out to investigate. Further, on the morning of November 27, the creature allegedly pursued a young woman near Mason, West Virginia, and was reported again in St. Albans the same night, by two children.A Mothman sighting was again reported on January 11, 1967, and several other times that same year. Fewer sightings of the Mothman were reported after the collapse of the Silver Bridge, when 46 people died. The Silver Bridge, so named for its aluminumn paint, was an eyebar chain suspension bridge that connected the cities of Point Pleasant, West Virginia and Kanauga, Ohio over the Ohio River. The bridge was built in 1928, and it collapsed on December 15, 1967. Investigation of the bridge wreckage pointed to the failure of a single eye-bar in a suspension chain due to a small manufacturing flaw. There are rumors that the Mothman appears before upcoming disasters, or that the Mothman causes disasters.Share this:		1
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dod-bullets-into-flowers/	the u.s. army is investigating ways to build biodegradable bullets that will sprout into plants.	True	['']	http://www.seeker.com/	http://www.seeker.com/the-us-army-wants-biodegradable-bullets-that-sprout-plants-2188620267.html	2017/01/13	"The US Army Wants Biodegradable Bullets That Sprout PlantsThe Department of Defense is soliciting proposals for training rounds that won't pollute.EmailNot only are bullets a physical hazard, but they're an environmental hazard, too. At US Army training facilities around the world, hundreds of thousands of spent shells litter proving grounds. Because there is no efficient way to clean up the shells, they're left where they fall.But that's a problem. The shells, which contain metal and other chemicals, can rust and pollute soils and groundwater.The DoD wants to do something about it, though. They're soliciting proposals for biodegradable bullets ""loaded with specialized seeds to grow environmentally beneficial plants that eliminate ammunition debris and contaminants.""Such materials best suited for these bullets could include the same biodegradable plastics used to make water bottles or plastic containers. Or it could be some other material altogether.According to the request for proposal, the US Army Corps of Engineers' Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory has already developed and tested seeds that can be embedded into a biodegradable composite. They've been bioengineered to germinate only after they've been in the ground for several months.Proposals are being solicited until February 8, after which time, the chosen contractors will produce the biodegradable bullets as part of a three-phase process. In phase one, the contractor will focus on making 40 mm to 120 mm training rounds. ""Bullets"" might be a bit of an understatement here. Even the smaller 40 mm rounds, which are essentially grenades, are pretty hefty (see image below)."		1
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/virginia-police-child-shootout/	police in richmond, virginia killed a young child during a shootout with two suspects.	False	['antonio zambrano-montes', ' react365', ' react365.com', ' virginia']	http://www.cnn.com/	http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/28/us/police-shooting-mexican-laborer/	2017/06/08	"""Toño,"" as loved ones called him, was one of 16 children, and he migrated to the United States about 10 years ago to join other relatives and harvest food on farms, said his mother, Agapita Montes. That police fired 17 bullets at one of her 16 children leaves the mother aghast, she said. In an frame taken from a YouTube video posted by Dario Zuniga, Antonio Zambrano-Montes, 35, (far left) is seen immediately before he was fatally shot by Pasco, Washington, police officers who confronted him (three, to the right). ""My son was a happy person, a hard worker and he got along with his siblings,"" the mother said last week in an interview with CNN en Espanol shortly after a funeral service for her son at Pasco's Saint Patrick Catholic Church. ""I had not seen him in 10 years, but I would talk to him over the phone,"" said the mother, who traveled to Pasco from her rural home in the central Mexican state of Michoacán for her son's funeral. ""I felt good that he was here. He was happy, and as a mother that was good for me,"" she said. It was at a funeral home where the 60-year-old Montes saw her son for the first time in a decade. More precisely, what she saw was his body. ""Imagine so many years without seeing him and to come and see him in this situation. For a mother, it's heartbreaking, something you never hope for or want to happen to your children,"" Montes said. The video of officers gunning down Zambrano-Montes keeps playing over and over in the minds of the family. The tape shows Zambrano running across a street with police in pursuit before he was fatally shot. Police have said that Zambrano-Montes was throwing rocks at cars and trucks when confronted by police. He then allegedly stoned two officers, and police resorted to deadly force, authorities said. Officers had used a Taser on him, but it wasn't effective, police said. From what the mother has seen of the video, she noticed her son isn't shown throwing rocks. ""I don't see him throwing rocks. The only thing I can see is that he's running, he raises his hands and they still shoot him. Why? I ask myself. Why?"" Montes said. ""And when he falls, they still handcuff him, and that is what hurts me the most."" Zambrano-Montes' family said his limited English left him unable to understand the officers' commands, shouted in English. More than half of Pasco's 68,000 residents are Latino. Of the 71 sworn officers in the police department, 12 are certified as fluent in Spanish, a spokesman said. Montes now wants justice for her son. ""I ask for justice to be done because it's not right what they did to my son,"" Montes said. Erlinda Zambrano, an aunt of Zambrano-Montes, also found it very difficult to accept the police version of events, she said. ""We are living with profound pain from how he died, and it's something very bad and terrible,"" the aunt said. ""I look at the videos now and I cannot sleep because it's too hard."" The police killing of Zambrano-Montes has left the family grief-stricken and torn apart. In fact, a rift has developed between his mother's family and his former wife, Teresa De Jesus Meraz Ruiz, 32, who's also mother to his two young daughters. Each side commissioned a separate autopsy on Zambrano-Montes' body. The mother and the former wife haven't spoken to one another for years. In fact, Zambrano-Montes and the former wife had been separated for many years, according to the mother and the former wife's attorney. In all, the case involves three autopsies, including the one conducted by authorities. In a surprising revelation this past week, one of the autopsies appeared to conflict with the official account. The autopsy commissioned by Meraz Ruiz and her attorney appeared to show that Zambrano-Montes had bullet wounds to the buttocks and the back of the arm. An autopsy report commissioned by the estranged wife of Antonio Zambrano-Montes shows bullet entry wounds to his buttocks and back of arm. That is at odds with what authorities said a day earlier, when Kennewick Police Sgt. Ken Lattin told reporters, ""We do know this from the preliminary autopsy report, there were no shots in the back."" Kennewick police belong to a team of local law agencies, called the Tri-City Special Investigative Unit, that is conducting an independent investigation of the police shooting of Zambrano-Montes in Pasco. Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney Shawn P. Sant declined to comment this week on how the conflict between the two autopsies. Sant was shown a copy of a body diagram in the second autopsy, conducted by the former wife's side, he said. ""Our office is waiting for complete reports from both pathologists before making any conclusions,"" Sant said in a statement. ""There are several questions that will be answered in the final pathology reports including number of gunshot wounds, number of bullets recovered, bullet trajectories, etc.,"" Sant said. Ultimately, an inquest jury will ""decide what information is significant to the cause and manner of death and whether anyone is criminally liable for Mr. Zambrano's death,"" Sant said. Zambrano-Montes's mother said her son married Meraz Ruiz in a church ceremony in Mexico more than 10 years ago, but the marriage wasn't officially registered with civil records. Meraz Ruiz couldn't be reached for comment, but her attorney, Charles Herrmann, acknowledged his client's church marriage in Mexico and asserted that Meraz Ruiz is the legal wife and widow of Zambrano-Montes. The couple had been separated for ""quite some time,"" and Meraz Ruiz and the couple's two daughters now live in California, Herrmann said. Meanwhile, Ruiz and her two children this week withdrew a $25 million claim against the city of Pasco alleging that officers killed Zambrano-Montes ""execution style,"" Herrmann said. #AntonioZambrano with a rock. What will you be carrying? #AntonioZambrano with a rock. What will you be carrying? Herrmann said his client wants to do more research and investigation into the shooting. The former wife plans to file a renewed claim at a later date, Herrmann said. For her part, Zambrano-Montes' mother has hired attorney Benjamin Crump, who has represented the families of Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin, both young African-American men whose deaths caused national protests. Brown, 19, was unarmed when he was fatally shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri; the officer was cleared of criminal wrongdoing. Martin, 17, was also unarmed when he was fatally shot in a physical confrontation in Florida with former neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman, who was later acquitted of a murder charge by a jury. Meanwhile, the Mexican consul in Seattle, Eduardo Baca, has written a letter to Pasco Police Chief Robert Metzger expressing ""deep concern over the unwarranted use of lethal force against an unarmed Mexican national by police officers."" Zambrano-Montes' mother and family have asked U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to conduct ""a full, fair and complete investigation"" into the killing, according to a Friday letter provided by the mother's attorney. The U.S. Justice Department office in Seattle is monitoring the case, a spokesman said. Also, the FBI in Seattle ""is monitoring the investigation of this use of force, conducted by the Tri-City Special Investigative Unit,"" FBI spokeswoman Ayn Dietrich-Williams in Seattle said. Meanwhile, Latino community leaders in Pasco met Wednesday with the U.S. attorney for Eastern Washington, Michael Ormsby, and Assistant U.S. Attorney A. Aine Ahmed, according to the group Consejo Latino. Protesters challenge why police used lethal force against Antonio Zambrano-Montes, who was killed in a hail of 17 police bullets. The meeting lasted two and a half hours, the group said. That organization is advancing a community demand for a U.S. Department of Justice inquiry into Zambrano-Montes' killing because of ""widely-held community beliefs that the local police investigation of the police shooting was perceived as a conflict of interest and was lacking in credibility and impartiality,"" Consejo Latino said. According to the group, the federal prosecutor's office will provide remedies and suggestions to Pasco police on their practices and procedures. For now, Zambrano-Montes' mother has taken control over her son's body, which she plans to send to Mexico for burial on a little ranch called Pomaro in the Michoacán municipality of Aquila, she said. The former wife isn't contesting the mother's control over Zambrano-Montes' body, said Herrmann, attorney for the former wife. The plot is near where the mother and her family live, in the mountains far from people. In fact, they must walk a good distance just to go shopping, Montes said. His burial has been delayed because the mother commissioned an autopsy on her son in Florida, conducted this past week, and she has ordered more tests on his remains. His grave will mark the end to a long journey. He came to the United States looking for his own American dream, Zambrano-Montes's family said. But he left the world through what his family says is a continuing nightmare."		0

The gunman, James T. Hodgkinson, a 66-year-old unemployed home inspector from southern Illinois, died after the shootout. Two Capitol Police officers assigned to Scalise’s security detail were wounded. Hodgkinson, who had been living in his van in Alexandria for the past few months, had posted anti-Trump rhetoric on his Facebook page and had written letters to his hometown newspaper blaming Republicans for what he considered an agenda favoring the wealthy. The shooting, coming amid harsh political rancor and a divided country, reverberated through Washington and beyond, as Trump and members of Congress began talking about unity for the first time since the presidential election. The targeted lawmakers were practicing for the Congressional Baseball Game, a charity competition against a team of Democrats. The game will be played on Thursday night at Nationals Park as planned. A gunman, who was identified by law enforcement as James T. Hodgkinson, unleashed a barrage of gunfire at a park in Alexandria, Va. Wait 1 second to continue. Several congressmen at the Eugene Simpson Stadium Park in Alexandria praised the officers who engaged Hodgkinson, including two Capitol Police officers who were injured. One lawmaker said the baseball team members would have been sitting ducks had the gunman been able to make it onto the field. “It would have been a bloodbath,” said Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.). Rep. Jack Bergman (R-Mich.), a former Marine Corps general, said, the shooter was kept off the field by a chain-link fence, which was locked. As of Wednesday evening, Scalise (La.) remained in critical condition after undergoing surgery at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, a hospital spokeswoman said. A lobbyist, a congressional aide and a Capitol Police officer also were shot, while a second officer was struck by shrapnel. Rep. Roger Williams (R-Tex.) injured his ankle while helping others take cover. In a televised statement from the White House, Trump called for people to come together and commended the injured officers. “Many lives would have been lost if not for the heroic actions of the two Capitol Police officers who took down the gunman despite sustaining gunshot wounds during a very, very brutal assault,” he said. Trump said he spoke with Scalise’s wife and offered his full support to the congressman’s family, calling Scalise a friend, patriot and fighter. He also thanked the first responders. “We may have our differences, but we do well in times like these to remember that everyone who serves in our nation’s capital is here because, above all, they love our country,” Trump said. Lawmakers and bystanders described a horrific attack that began shortly after 7 a.m., when the shooter began firing more than 50 rounds from a military-style rifle and a handgun, taking aim through the chain-link fence. Scalise was felled by a bullet to the hip as he fielded grounders at second base, witnesses said. Then the aide and the lobbyist were struck as the gunman moved methodically around the fence and toward the home-plate backstop. As Scalise crawled across the field, leaving a trail of blood, the gunman advanced toward a dugout, where several people were hiding. Congressmen said the Capitol Police officers emerged from the dugout, moving toward the gunfire. A woman walking her dog said she heard a female officer scream, “Drop your weapon,” before the gunman “shot her and she fell to the ground.” House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said the officers “went out into the fire to draw the fire. Authorities said five people were taken to hospitals, including Hodgkinson. Matt Mika, a lobbyist for Tyson Foods, was in critical condition at George Washington University Hospital, a spokeswoman said. Zach Barth, a legislative correspondent for Williams, was shot in the leg and released from the hospital Wednesday afternoon. The House speaker’s office identified the injured Capitol Police officers as Special Agents David Bailey, who was treated and released from a hospital, and Crystal Griner, who was struck in the ankle and hospitalized in good condition. Capitol Police Chief Matthew Verderosa said both are expected to recover fully. Police identified a third officer who participated as Special Agent Henry Cabrera. They did not say which officers fired their weapons. Alexandria Police Chief Michael Brown said two city officers who arrived at the scene opened fire, joining Capitol Police officers who already were in a gun battle with Hodgkinson. Scalise’s office said in a statement that the congressman was in good spirits and speaking to his wife, Jennifer, by phone before he went in for surgery. Wednesday night, the hospital said Scalise was shot in the left hip and that the bullet fractured bones and struck internal organs. They said Scalise had lost a lot of blood and would need additional surgeries. He has been in Congress since 2008 and represents a district that includes some New Orleans suburbs and bayou parishes. He and his wife have two children. Verderosa said it “will take a while to sort through all the details” during the investigation, which is now being led by the FBI. Tim Slater, the special agent in charge, said it is “too early to tell whether anyone was targeted. . . . But focus immediately turned to political statements Hodgkinson had made on social media, interactions he had had with lawmakers, and run-ins he had had with law enforcement officials near his home in Belleville, Ill., a suburb of St. Louis. Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) told reporters that, just before the shooting, he spoke briefly with a man he believes was Hodgkinson and that the man “asked me if the team practicing was a Democrat or Republican team.” Duncan added, “I told him they were Republicans. He said, ‘Okay, thanks,’ and turned around. “I’m shaken up. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said Hodgkinson volunteered on his 2016 Democratic presidential campaign, although an aide said that he had no formal role and that no one could remember him. Hodgkinson had sent letters to his local newspaper in Illinois decrying income inequality, encouraging the government to tax the rich and supporting President Barack Obama, according to the Belleville News-Democrat. “A strong middle class is what a country needs to prosper,” he wrote in one of his letters to the editor. Police in Belleville reported responding in March to a complaint that Hodgkinson was shooting at the end of his street, firing 50 rounds “in the pine trees.” Police said that he had a valid license for the weapon, and that he agreed to stop when they told him to. Rep. Stephen Brennwald, a lawyer who lives in Alexandria, said he realized after seeing Hodgkinson’s photo on the news that he was the same man who had been hanging out for at least the past several weeks in the lobby of a YMCA adjacent to Simpson field. Brennwald said Hodgkinson would regularly show up first thing in the morning — about the same time the shooting took place — and look at his laptop or stare out the window. “He never worked out. He never talked to anybody. He never did anything,” Brennwald said. Authorities said Hodgkinson used a rifle and a handgun in the attack. They are investigating whether they were obtained legally. The shooting started at 7:09 a.m. at the popular park on East Monroe Avenue in the Del Ray neighborhood of Alexandria, near Old Town Alexandria and the Potomac Yard shopping complex on Route 1. The Republican lawmakers were holding their final practice before Thursday night’s game, a traditional event designed to bolster goodwill between two sides of the partisan aisle. Scalise, who plays second base, was accompanied by members of the Capitol Police’s executive protection unit because as majority whip, he is the third-highest-ranking member of the House. His security detail was positioned behind the first base dugout; witnesses said the shooter started on the other side of the diamond. About 20 people were on the field at the time, many catching fly balls from batting practice, and when the gunfire started, players and onlookers took cover in dugouts, under a sport-utility vehicle or in the open on the ground. Barton, the team manager, said the gunman, dressed in blue jeans and a blue shirt, shot at Scalise at second base and fired toward the third baseman, Rep. Trent Kelly (R-Miss.). Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) saw the shooter and described the scene as “bedlam.” Brooks had just stepped up to home plate with a bat in his hand when he heard the first two or three shots. He heard Scalise scream and then go down. Brooks said he ran behind the batting cage and watched Scalise drag himself toward the outfield. Brooks lay down in the dirt with two or three others, but then realized that if the shooter moved, “he’d have a clear shot.” So he ran to the first base dugout. There, he found Barth, who had been shot in the leg. Brooks said he used his belt as a tourniquet. He said two officers emerged from the dugout and advanced toward the oncoming bullets. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), still wearing a red and white baseball shirt with “Republicans” on it, said he recalled seeing the rifle and then hearing shots. He said the gunman was firing “at anybody he could hit. Katie Fillus of Alexandria had just gotten out of her car to walk her dogs in the park when she said she heard “very, very loud popping sounds.” She said, “Everybody started screaming, ‘Hit the ground! She said she watched an officer yell at the gunman and then get shot. “She fell on the ground in front of us,” Fillus said. “And I belly crawled, dragging through the mud. Bullet holes were left in windows of the YMCA, and bullets were in the swimming pool. On Wednesday evening, about 100 people gathered at a church in Del Ray for a community prayer service. Trump, accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, visited the hospital where Scalise and Griner were being treated. Aides carried in flowers. Rep. Mike Doyle (D-Pa.) and Barton — managers of the respective teams — said they will still take to the field Thursday night. “We’re united not as Republicans and Democrats but as United States representatives,” Barton said.		0

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/super-blue-blood-moon/	a rare confluence of celestial events will bring what nasa terms a “super blue blood moon” to the skies on 31 january 2018.	True	['blood moon', ' blue moon', ' earth', ' eclipse', ' full moon', ' lunar eclipse', ' moone', ' nasa', ' supermoon']	https://science.nasa.gov/	https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/news-articles/a-supermoon-trilogy	2018/01/29	Nov 30, 2017A Supermoon TrilogyMark your calendars: a series of three supermoons will appear on the celestial stage on December 3, 2017, January 1, 2018, and January 31, 2018. A supermoon is a Moon that is full when it is also at or near its closest point in its orbit around Earth. Since the Moon’s orbit is elliptical, one side (apogee) is about 30,000 miles (50,000 km) farther from Earth than the other (perigee). Nearby perigee full Moons appear about 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full Moons that occur near apogee in the Moon's orbit.“The supermoons are a great opportunity for people to start looking at the Moon, not just that once but every chance they have!” says Noah Petro, a research scientist from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.It’s hard for our eyes to distinguish these small changes in size when the Moon is high amidst the vastness of the night sky. But any time you catch a full Moon as it rises or sets, while it’s suspended low on the horizon beaming through the silhouettes of trees or buildings, its apparent size might make you do a double-take. You almost feel as though you could reach out, grab the glowing orb, and drop it into your coffee cup. Even more so if it’s a supermoon.If you can only catch one episode of the supermoon trilogy, catch the third one. It will be extra special.First of all, the January 31st supermoon will feature a total lunar eclipse, with totality viewable from western North America across the pacific to Eastern Asia. The Moon’s orbit around our planet is tilted so it usually falls above or below the shadow of the Earth. About twice each year, a full Moon lines up perfectly with the Earth and Sun such that Earth’s shadow totally blocks the Sun’s light, which would normally reflect off the Moon.“The lunar eclipse on January 31 will be visible during moonset. Folks in the Eastern United States, where the eclipse will be partial, will have to get up in the morning to see it,” notes Petro. “But it’s another great chance to watch the Moon.”The Moon will lose its brightness and take on an eerie, fainter-than-normal glow from the scant sunlight that makes its way through Earth’s atmosphere. Often cast in a reddish hue because of the way the atmosphere bends the light, totally eclipsed Moons are sometimes called ‘blood Moons.’“We’re seeing all of the Earth’s sunrises and sunsets at that moment reflected from the surface of the Moon,” says Sarah Noble, a Program Scientist at NASA headquarters.The January 31st supermoon will also be the second full Moon of the month. Some people call the second full Moon in a month a Blue Moon, that makes it a super ‘blue Moon.’ Blue Moons happen every two and a half years, on average. With the total eclipse, it’ll be a royal spectacle indeed: a ‘super blue blood’ Moon.Sometimes the celestial rhythms sync up just right to wow us. Heed your calendar reminders. On the three dates marked, step out into the moonset or moonrise and look up for a trilogy of sky watching treats!To learn more about the many wonders of the Moon, go to moon.nasa.gov .For more on the many skywatching events to be found throughout the year, visit science.nasa.govTop Stories		1

She raced to her room and stuffed a pair of Barbie dolls, a tub of peanut butter and a toothbrush into a bag. She insisted on bringing boots for the long boat ride she imagined was coming.When her mother, Melissa, arrived home from her work as a human resources manager, Sofia ran into her arms and cried.""I want people to understand the impact that their words have on these children,"" said Melissa Yassini, who described the experience in a Facebook post that had been shared more than 21,000 times as of Monday. ""We often forget, we're waging war on one another with words, and we're adults. We can take it. The kids are suffering with this. They go to school every day and they're afraid to tell people they're Muslim. This has to stop."" Sad day in America when I have to comfort my 8 year old child who heard that someone with yellow hair named Trump wanted...Posted by Melissa Chance Yassini on Wednesday, December 9, 2015Anti-Muslim sentiment was building in the days before 14 people were killed Dec. 2 in the massacre at a disability center in Southern California by a Muslim couple investigators say were inspired at least in part by the Islamic State group. Some governors had already said they wouldn't allow Syrians fleeing civil war into their states because of extremist fears. Experts say Trump's call Dec. 7 to keep all Muslims from entering the United States -- a plan he said would apply only temporarily and to non-citizens -- only fanned the flames.Parents say their children hear disparaging remarks in their own communities, see hateful bumper stickers and T-shirts, and have had friends abandon them because of their faith.Ahad Khan, 12, came home from school in rural Westminster, Maryland, in tears because his best friend called him a future terrorist who couldn't be trusted, according to Ahad's father, Raza Khan.Khan, the chairman of the science department at Carroll Community College, shared Ahad's experience in an open letter to Trump on Facebook. As of Monday, it had been shared more than 4,300 times.""He is the engine right now for that fearmongering,"" Khan said in an interview. ""I don't think he realizes that his words matter. He doesn't realize the damaging effect his words can have on people, especially kids.""In the minds of children -- many long on imagination and short on political understanding -- phrases like ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims"" can be traumatic, experts say.""Children expect that society will be nurturing and protective,"" said Mark DeAntonio, a child psychiatry professor at the University of California Los Angeles. ""Statements implying detainment or exclusion for arbitrary reason like race ethnicity or religion create anxiety and trauma.""Some children have questioned their faith and place in American society.Kafumba Kromah, of Minneapolis, said his 8-year-old daughter asked him: ""Why we are Muslims? Why can't we be what everybody else is?"" His daughter encouraged him to cancel a trip to his native Liberia for fear he would be barred from returning.Mehnaz Mahmood, of Dallas, said her 7-year-old son urged her to switch to a black-and-white hijab -- so she would look more like a nun -- after they were subjected to anti-Muslim remarks outside his school this week.Sam Madi, of New Orleans, watched coverage of Trump's remarks with his 11-year-old son. He said he feared anti-Muslim sentiment would set back progress in integrating Muslims into American society. Zane Madi plays soccer and spends most weekends with his mother helping the city's homeless.""We're not prepared for this,"" said Madi, whose father fled Iraq in the 1970s. ""We're not prepared to sit and educate our children why they're not any different from anybody else. I don't think any parent is prepared for that. I don't care what religion you believe or don't believe.""Parents needn't shoulder the burden themselves, said Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor at UCLA. Teachers should talk about not generalizing Muslims and ask children to reinforce their friendships with Muslim students, she said in an email.As Khan, the father in Maryland, tucked his son in last week, he left him with the words he recited when he became a U.S. citizen two decades ago: ""One nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.""""I don't know why, I don't know how people forget that,"" Khan said later, fighting back tears. ""We have to; otherwise we're dividing ourselves.""I had no idea when I published Sofia's story on Facebook that her fears would reach over 20,000 people. It has been a..."		0

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-to-strike-down-obamas-regulation-expanding-overtime/	donald trump plans to do away with a new regulation put in place by president obama that expands overtime to more workers. see example( s )	Mixture	['donald trump', ' labor', ' obama']	http://www.nytimes.com/	http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/business/obama-rule-to-expand-overtime-eligibility-is-suspended-by-judge.html	2016/11/23	Judge Suspends Rule Expanding Overtime for Millions of WorkersImageA worker pushing carts outside a Walmart in La Habra, Calif. A federal judge in Texas issued an injunction against an Obama administration rule that would expand eligibility for overtime pay by raising the salary limit to $47,476 from $23,660. The change was to take effect on Dec. 1.CreditJae C. Hong/Associated PressBy Noam ScheiberNov. 22, 2016A federal judge in Texas issued a nationwide injunction on Tuesday against an Obama administration regulation expanding by millions the number of workers who would be eligible for time-and-a-half overtime pay.The regulation was scheduled to take effect on Dec. 1. It would raise the salary limit below which workers automatically qualified for overtime pay to $47,476 from $23,660.The judge, Amos L. Mazzant III of the Eastern District of Texas, ruled that the Obama administration had exceeded its authority by raising the overtime salary limit so significantly. The ruling was hailed by business groups who argued the new rules would be costly and result in fewer hours for workers.The Labor Department said it “strongly disagreed” with the decision and was “considering all of our legal options,” raising the possibility of an appeal in the waning days of the Obama administration. Ross Eisenbrey of the Economic Policy Institute, whose writings on the subject helped shape the administration’s regulation, called the ruling “a disappointment to millions of workers who are forced to work long hours with no extra compensation.”While the injunction is only a temporary measure that suspends the regulation until the judge can issue a ruling on the merits, many said the judge’s language indicated he was likely to strike down the regulation.“We are, assuming that this preliminary injunction holds and there isn’t an appeal or some other thing that disrupts it, done with this regulation,” said Marc Freedman, executive director of labor law policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which had challenged the rule.The fate of the regulation had already been thrown into question by the election of Donald J. Trump as president two weeks ago. Mr. Trump has promised to reverse many regulations approved during the Obama administration, and the Republican Congress has generally criticized the scope of the expansion of overtime eligibility.Nov. 22, 2016Still, because undoing the regulation could have required a months- or yearslong rule-making process similar to the one that produced it, the new overtime limit appeared likely to survive in some form. Some business lobbyists had anticipated a legislative compromise that phased in the new limit over a longer period of time and eliminated an automatic increase in the limit every three years.The injunction would appear to make such a reprieve far less likely, although the question remains whether the Trump administration will seek a legislative deal that would raise the salary limit above the $23,660 that has prevailed since 2004, but below the Obama administration’s preferred level.“There’s no question that this decision changes a number of different points of leverage over the future of the rule,” said David French, senior vice president for government relations at the National Retail Federation, which opposed the new rule. Mr. French added, however, that his group and many other business organizations were open to some increase in the limit.“We’re 12 years past the last update,” he said.Supporters of the regulation have observed that the politics of essentially withdrawing a planned salary increase from many workers could prove complicated for an incoming president elected on a message of improving workers’ economic circumstances.Further complicating the picture is the fact that many large employers have already raised the pay of some employees over the new $47,476 limit, concluding that it would be more cost-effective than paying them overtime. It is rare for employers to reverse such pay increases, making large employers potentially sympathetic to an overtime compromise that would effectively extend the salary increase to some of their smaller rivals.Tuesday’s ruling arose from a case filed by a coalition of 21 states, who argued that the administration had exceeded its statutory authority in raising the overtime salary limit so significantly. A large number of business groups filed a similar lawsuit, and the suits were later consolidated.In his ruling, Judge Mazzant, whom President Obama appointed , agreed with that logic and appeared to go even further, suggesting that the administration lacked the authority even to establish a salary limit — which the Labor Department has raised repeatedly since Congress enacted the underlying legislation in 1938.“The court’s decision suggests that the Department of Labor has no authority whatsoever to regulate a salary minimum,” said Allan S. Bloom, of the law firm Proskauer Rose. (Judge Mazzant pointed out in a footnote that he was not commenting generally on the legality of establishing a salary limit, however, only the particular increase that the plaintiffs had challenged.)In a statement, the Labor Department defended how the rule was created.“The department’s overtime rule is the result of a comprehensive, inclusive rule-making process, and we remain confident in the legality of all aspects of the rule,” the statement said.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Obama Rule to Expand Overtime Eligibility Is Suspended by Federal Judge in Texas.

HATCH: Mr. Chairman, it's with a great deal of honor and privilege that I present you, as our new chairman, with this very, very important gavel...(LAUGHTER)... to be able to keep order during these hearings and hearings thereafter. But here's the gavel. You have it.SEN. LEAHY: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will protect the gavel carefully in the few hours, the brief few hours, I get to do it. And I have a feeling I'll be presenting you with one next week.This, for the public to know, this gavel is actually made by my son, Kevin, in seventh grade. Shows you how long it's been since I've been chairman of anything.(LAUGHTER)It's a privilege to call these hearings to order, and I welcome my friend, Orrin Hatch, and all the continuing members on both sides of the aisle.We're being rejoined this year by Senator Durbin of Illinois. Senator Durbin was a very valuable member of this committee when he served here before, before leaving to go to a different committee.Dick, we're delighted to have you back.We're also joined by Senator Brownback, who has been in the Senate for some time, but this is his first time this year. And Sam and I have worked together on a number of significant pieces of legislation.And, Sam, I'm delighted to have you in the committee.SEN. BROWNBACK: Happy to join you.LEAHY: I understand my neighbor from New Hampshire who was sitting on these hearings will be leaving, and I'm sorry to have that happen because Senator Smith and I have also worked together on matters. And we do have the ability to check with each other on what the weather is along the Connecticut River.And Senator Cantwell of Washington state will be joining us, but she and Senator Biden are at the funeral of our former colleague, Alan Cranston, in California. Senator Cantwell first came to Washington as a staff member of Senator Cranston, and Senator Biden and I and several others here served with him.And they would be here other than that. And of course, we have the nominee, Senator Ashcroft, his wife, Janet, and others who we'll get to in a few minutes.I welcome Senator Ashcroft, who certainly is no stranger to this committee room, and his family here.I have said many times, as most of us have, that the position of attorney general is of extraordinary importance. The attorney general is the lawyer for all the people, as the chief law enforcement officer in the country. That's why the attorney general not only needs the full confidence of the president, he or she also needs the confidence and trust of the American people. We all look to the attorney general to ensure even-handed law enforcement and protection of our basic constitutional rights, including the freedom of speech, the right to privacy, a woman's right to choose, freedom from government oppression, and equal protection of all our laws.The attorney general plays a critical role in bringing the country together, in bridging racial divisions and inspiring people's confidence in their government.Senator Ashcroft has often taken aggressively activist positions on a number of issues that deeply divide the American people.Now, he had a right to take these activist positions, but we also have a duty to evaluate how these positions will affect his conduct as attorney general.On many of these issues and on battles over executive branch or judicial nominees, Senator Ashcroft was not just in the minority of the United States Senate, but in a minority among Republicans in the Senate. Now we have to ask if somebody who has been that unyielding in a policy outlook can unite all Americans. And that's an important question for the Senate.Now, the hearing is not about whether we like Senator John Ashcroft or call him a friend. All of us do. All of us like him; all of us know him. It is not about whether we agree or disagree with him on every issue. Many of us have worked productively with him on selected matters and then we've disagreed with him on others.Let me be very clear about one thing: This is not about whether Senator Ashcroft is racist, anti-Catholic, anti-Mormon or anti-anything else. Those of us who have worked with him in the Senate do not make that charge.But at the same time, I know that all senators and the nominee agree that no one nominated to be attorney general should be given special treatment just because he or she once served in the Senate.So fundamentally, the question before us is whether Senator Ashcroft is the right person at this time for the critical position of attorney general of the United States. The appointment clause of the Constitution gives the Senate the duty and responsibility of providing both its advice and its consent.Among the areas we will explore with Senator Ashcroft is how he fulfilled his constitutional duty as a senator in exercising his own advise and consent authority in connection with executive and judicial nominations. We'll explore the standards he would use in making recommendations to the president on executive and judicial appointments if he's confirmed as attorney general.President Kennedy observed that to govern is to choose. What choices the next attorney general makes about resources and priorities will have a dramatic impact on almost every aspect of the society in which we live. The American people want to know not just whether this nominee will commit to enforce the laws on the books, but what his priorities will be, what choices he is likely to make and what changes he will seek in the law. Most importantly, we will want to know what changes he will seek in the constitutional rights that Americans currently enjoy.These include what positions he would urge upon the Supreme Court; in particular, whether he'd ask the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade or to impose more burdensome restrictions on a woman's ability to secure a safe and legal contraceptives.Now, we're proceeding expeditiously with these hearings as requested by President-elect Bush, as I told him I would. But I have also said from the outset that these hearings have to be thorough, but they have to be fair and they will be.Senator Hatch?HATCH: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.I'm glad to welcome the members of the Ashcroft family and you, Senator Ashcroft, the witnesses here today, including Senator Ashcroft's highly accomplished wife, Janet, who has been a professor of business law here in Washington, D.C., at Howard University for the past five years. I want to take a moment to let the Ashcroft family know how much we appreciate their sacrifices while John has served in public office.John Ashcroft is no stranger to the Senate Judiciary Committee. He served on our committee with distinction over the past four years, working closely with members on both sides of the aisle on a variety of issues ranging from privacy rights to racial profiling.As a member of the committee, he proved himself a leader in many areas, including the fight against drugs and violence, the assessment of the proper role of the Justice Department, and the protection of victims' rights.John has an impressive record--almost 30 years of public service.Eight years as Missouri state attorney general, during which time he was elected by his 50 state attorney general peers to head the National Association of Attorneys General.Eight years as governor of the great state of Missouri, during which time he was elected by the 50 governors to serve as the head of the National Governors' Association.Six years in the United States Senate, four of which, he has served here with us on the Senate Judiciary Committee.Of the 67 attorneys general in the history of this country, only a handful come even close to having even some of the qualifications that John Ashcroft brings in assuming the position of chief law enforcement officer of this great nation.The Department of Justice, of course, encompasses broad jurisdiction. It includes the executive administration of organizations ranging from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the U.S. Marshals Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, all of the United States attorneys throughout the country, to the Bureau of Prisons.It includes, among other things, enforcement of the law in areas including antitrust, terrorism, fraud, money laundering, organized crime, drugs and immigration--just to mention a few.To effectively prevent and manage crises in these important areas, one thing is certain: We needed to have a no-nonsense person with the background and experience of John Ashcroft. Those charged with enforcing the law of the nation must demonstrate both the proper understanding of that law and a determination to uphold its letter and spirit. This is the standard I have applied to nominees in the past, and this is the standard that I am applying to John Ashcroft here.During John Ashcroft's 30-year service for the public, he has worked to establish a number of things to keep Americans safe and free from criminal activities: tougher sentencing laws for serious crimes, keeping drugs out of the hands of children, improving our nation's immigration laws, protecting citizens from fraud, protecting competition in business. He has supported funding increases for law enforcement. He held the first hearings ever on the issue of racial profiling.And he's been a leader for victim's rights in accordance of law and otherwise; helped to enact the violence against women bill, provisions making violence at abortion clinics fines nondischargeable--and bankruptcy; authored anti-stalking laws, fought to allow women accused of homicide to have the privilege of presenting battered-spouse syndrome evidence in the courts of law. As governor, he commuted the sentences of two women, who did not have that privilege. He signed Missouri's hate crimes bill into law. I could go on and on. His record is distinguished.Senator Ashcroft, during these hearings, we are eager to hear and the American people are eager to hear your plans for making America a safer place to live. A great number of people have said to me that they are tired of living in fear. They want to go to sleep at night without worrying about the safety of their children or about becoming victims of crime themselves.I know you and I am familiar with your distinguished 30-year record of enforcing and upholding law. And I feel a great sense of comfort and a new-found security in your nomination to be our nation's chief law enforcement officer.Mr. Chairman, I have one request of my colleagues as we proceed: In keeping with our promise to work in a bipartisan fashion, I ask that we begin with a rejection of the politics of division. If we want to encourage the most qualified citizens to serve in government, we must do everything we can to stop what has been termed the politics of personal destruction.This is not to say that we should put an end to an open and candid debate on policy issues.Quite the contrary. Our system of government is designed to promote the expression of these differences, and our Constitution protects it. But the fact is that all of us, both Democrats and Republicans, know the difference between legitimate policy debate and unwarranted personal attacks promoted and sometimes urged by narrow special interest groups.John Ashcroft, like many of us, is a man of strongly held views. I have every confidence, based on his distinguished record, that as attorney general he will vigorously work to enforce the law, whether or not the law happens to be consistent with his personal views.Finally, Mr. Chairman, you know that I would have preferred a format similar to that followed for President Clinton's nominees and prior nominees for the last four attorney general nominees: no more than a two-day hearing with outside interest groups submitting their testimony in writing. But I'm sure that you will endeavor to be fair as we proceed with this hearing. I have confidence in that. And I look forward to these proceedings and look forward to participating in them.Thank you, Mr. Chairman.LEAHY: Thank you, Senator Hatch. And I can assure you the hearings will be fair. There are 280 million Americans who have views on who should be attorney general. There will be interest groups to the left or the right who may have suggestions. Ultimately, there's only 100 Americans who'll get to vote on that issue, and that's the 100 members of the Senate. And it will be--the whole tone of the debate and all will be decided by us.Just so we can understand, we'll do this. We should give each senator an opportunity for brief opening remarks. I'd ask if they could keep it at three or four minutes. We'll then turn to the nominee, both for the introductions and an opening remark. And then we'll have the opportunity to question the nominee for 15 minutes each in the first go-round and then shorter ones if we need to after that.What I would do, too, once we have all finished, we'll take a very short break just so that those who are going to introduce him and all will know what's going to happen.But with that, I would turn to the distinguished senior senator from Massachusetts, and also a former chairman of this committee, Senator Kennedy.SEN. KENNEDY: Thank you.Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding these hearings. They may well be the most important hearings that our committee will have this year. The power and reach of the Department of Justice is vast and the person at its head must have the ability and the commitment to enforce the laws vigorously. The reality and perception of fairness must be without question.During Senator Ashcroft's quarter-century in public service, he has taken strong positions on a range of important issues in the jurisdiction of the Justice Department.Unfortunately and often, he has used the power of his high office to advance his personal views in spite of the law of the land. The vast majority of Americans support vigorous enforcement of our civil rights laws, and those laws and the Constitution demand it.Senator Ashcroft, however, spent significant parts of his term as attorney general of Missouri, and his term as governor, strongly opposing school desegregation and voter registration in St. Louis. The vast majority of Americans believe in access to contraception and a woman's right to choose, and our laws and Constitution demand it. Senator Ashcroft does not. His intense efforts have made him one of the principal architects of the ongoing right-wing strategy to dismantle Roe v. Wade and abolish a woman's right to choose.Deep concerns have been raised about his record on gun control. He has called James Brady the leading enemy of responsible gun owners. Senator Ashcroft is so far out of the mainstream that he has said citizens need to be armed in order to protect themselves against a tyrannical government. Our government, tyrannical? In fact, he relies on an extreme reading of the right to bear arms under the Second Amendment to the Constitution to oppose virtually all gun control laws.He doesn't show the same respect for the right of free speech under the First Amendment. In 1978, as attorney general of Missouri, he tried to use the antitrust laws to undermine the right to free speech of the National Organization for Women and prevent a boycott of Missouri by the organization over the state's refusal to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment.As these few examples demonstrate, the clear question before the Senate is whether, if confirmed as attorney general, Senator Ashcroft will be capable of fully and fairly enforcing the nation's laws to benefit all Americans, even though he profoundly disagrees with many of the most important of those laws. His past actions strongly suggest that he will not.Senator Ashcroft's record in Missouri and in the Senate is extremely troubling on this basic question. Many of us, probably all of us, who have served with Senator Ashcroft respect his ability on the issues and his intense commitment to the principles he believes in, even though we disagree profoundly with some of those principles.We know that while serving in high office, he has time and again aggressively used litigation and legislation in creative and inappropriate ways to advance his political and ideological goals. How can we have any confidence at all that he won't do the same thing with the vast new powers he will have at his disposal as attorney general of the United States?President-elect Bush has asked us to look in Senator Ashcroft's heart to evaluate his ability and commitment to enforce the laws of our country. But actions speak louder than words, and based on his repeated actions over many years, it's clear that Senator Ashcroft's heart is not in some of the most important of the nation's laws.The person who serves as attorney general must inspire the trust and respect of all Americans. Inscribed in stone over the center entrance to the Department of Justice is this phrase: ""The place of justice is a hallowed place."" All Americans deserve to have confidence that when the next attorney general walks through the doors of justice and into that hallowed place, he will be serving them too.Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I look forward to the hearing.LEAHY: Thank you, Senator Kennedy.We'll put Senator Biden's statement in the record and turn to my good friend from South Carolina, Senator Thurmond.SEN. THURMOND: Thank you.Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased that President-elect Bush has chosen John Ashcroft to serve as his attorney general.Senator Ashcroft is one of the most qualified people selected for this position in many years. He served two terms as attorney general of Missouri, rising to become the leader of the National Association of Attorneys General. He was then elected governor of Missouri, also serving for two terms, and rising to chair the National Governors Association. I would also note that he has a fine wife and family.Most recently, Senator Ashcroft has been an effective leader in the Senate with a record of legislative accomplishments. For example, he was instrumental in passing a methanphetomine bill to help keep drugs out of the hands of children. Also, he worked in a bipartisan manner with Democrats to support COPS program funding for law enforcement.In the Senate, his job was to make the laws, but as attorney general, his job will be to enforce the laws. It is clear that he understands that people in different positions have different roles because he has expressed concerns about federal judges who do not understand the separation of powers. I am confident that as attorney general he will enforce all the laws to the best of his ability, whether he helped enact them or not.I hope that these hearings will not be about whoever the nominee agrees with each senator on every issue. After all, he is the president's choice and the president makes the ultimate policy decisions. A question should be whether he is qualified and will enforce the laws. The answer is clearly, yes.Twenty years ago, I recommended him to be attorney general for President Ronald Reagan, and would like to place that letter into the record.LEAHY: Without objection.THURMOND: And I'd like for that to appear at the end of my statement.I recognized his abilities then, and the passing years, while he has served as governor and senator, have only reinforced my belief he would have made a fine attorney general in 1981. He will make an outstanding attorney general in 2001.Thank you, Mr. Chairman.LEAHY: Thank you, Senator Thurmond.We'll put into record a statement by Senator Biden, who is, as I said, is at Senator Cranston's funeral.And we turn to the distinguished senator from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl.SEN. KOHL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Senator Ashcroft, welcome back to this committee.Based upon what I know of your record thus far, I could not vote for you to be a Supreme Court justice, but this is different. As I said to previous nominees for attorney general, when considering Cabinet nominations I approach the process prepared to give deference to the president's choice. The president is entitled to surround himself with the people he trusts.This deference, however, does not rise to the level of blind acceptance. And so, Senator Ashcroft, you have a responsibility to convince this panel and the American people that your views will not interfere with the administration of justice.Laws are administered and interpreted by people. You have strong convictions. You often wear them on your sleeve and you take great pride in your convictions. You certainly are not to be faulted for this.But it is not credible to say that you are or anyone can just administer the law like a robot, as if the law is not subject to feelings or strong convictions. It is up to you to explain to us why your convictions will not permeate or dominate or even overwhelm the Department of Justice.Remember, the attorney general must be a role model and not a lightning rod for certain causes. You have been passionate about many issues: civil rights, abortion, gun safety and the environment, to cite just a few.But there must be no doubt in the minds of Americans that you will fairly enforce the law. The attorney general must vigorously advocate for all Americans and, most particularly, protect those who cannot defend themselves.Your many years as a politician make some people wonder whether you are prepared to dispassionately administer the law. Surely, you understand that many of the positions you've taken are unpopular with some members of this committee. You shouldn't be condemned for disagreeing with people, but rather you must convince the American people that you will enforce the laws of the land in a way that will make us proud and will make us feel that it is justice that is certainly being done.I've enjoyed working with you as a colleague, and I look forward to this hearing and your answers to our questions.Thank you.LEAHY: I turn to the distinguished senior senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley.SEN. GRASSLEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm pleased to welcome Senator John Ashcroft back to the committee today. I know him, from working with him, to be a man of integrity and also a person who loves America.I've been privileged to serve with John here in the Senate and on the Judiciary Committee for the past six years. During this time, I've come to respect John's legal abilities and his keen insight into public policy.John shares my concern about crime and has worked hard in the war against drugs. He's helped increase funding for local law enforcement and pushed for tougher sentences for criminals. John is also extremely concerned about the victims of crimes, having signed into law Missouri's Victims' Bill of Rights when he was governor of that state. John also cosponsored the Violence Against Women Act when he was here in the Senate.Now John and I come from states where agriculture issues are very important, and we've had a number of discussions about how to best address the myriad of problems that are facing the family farmers today. He's concerned about ensuring competitive markets and a level playing field for farmers and independent producers. Based on my experience with Senator Ashcroft's work here in the Senate, I know that he is committed to doing what is right for the family farmer.John Ashcroft is a man of the law. He is eminently qualified to serve as this nation's attorney general. His background as governor and attorney general of Missouri are some of the strongest qualifications that I've seen for this job. I believe that he will vigorously enforce all of our nation's laws. I believe that Senator Ashcroft will uphold the rule of law for all Americans, which will be a refreshing change from the way things were done in the present administration, where the Justice Department was more a defense counsel for the president than the nation's chief law enforcer.John Ashcroft's integrity, then, will be a breath of fresh air.I do want to make a comment about the mob of extremists who have hit the airwaves and are trying to intimidate members of the Senate into voting against Senator Ashcroft. I hope that my colleagues have the intestinal fortitude to stand up to these extremist accusations. It's remarkable that accusations of bias and racism have increased to a roaring crescendo now that John Ashcroft has come up for confirmation, because if John Ashcroft is so bad, then why did the people of Missouri elect him Missouri attorney general, governor and senator? Would the majority of Missouri citizens support such a biased and extreme man to serve and represent them for well over two decades? I don't think so.Would the National Association of Attorneys General and the National Governors Association, two national associations representing both Republican and Democratic attorneys general and governors, name such a biased man to lead their organization?I don't think so. But the smear goes on.I, for one, will make my decision based on facts, not innuendo, and rumor and spin. I will not let special interests groups with an agenda far out of the mainstream hijack the Judiciary Committee.John Ashcroft is a man of great character, integrity and trust--all values which are absolutely necessary for public service. He is an excellent lawyer, committed to enforcing all the laws.Above all, I know John Ashcroft to be a man concerned about the well-being of our country and committed to doing what is right for all Americans. I believe John Ashcroft will be an excellent attorney general, and at this point, I see absolutely no legitimate reason why he should not be confirmed.I yield.LEAHY: I thank the senator.I should just note for the record, Senator Hatch had expressed a wish that we follow procedures of holding the hearing for the nominee, or at most two days. Our committee hearing has been a little bit more varied than that. I would note that the Democratic president nominated Griffin Bell, it was a Democratic-controlled Senate. We had a hearing for seven days. We heard from 26 witnesses. When President Reagan nominated Ed Meese, and there was a Republican-controlled Senate, the hearing was in two parts: the first was four days with 31 witnesses, the second part was three days with 17 witnesses. With President Clinton, his first nominee Ms. Baird, was for two days. There were going to be a number of outside witnesses, but of course the nomination was withdrawn.Having said that, you know, as I have told the distinguished senator, my good friend from Utah, that if he has witnesses that he wants heard, of course, they'll be heard. There will be no unnecessary delays. I turn now to the distinguished...HATCH: If the senator would yield for just one comment on that.LEAHY: Of course.HATCH: In the last four attorneys general, we had one day for Richard Thornburgh, we had two days for Attorney General William Barr, we had one day for Janet Reno--or two days for Janet Reno. And I might mention--and she was the sole witness. Bill Barr was his sole witness, other than the introducers, and I think Dick Thornburgh was his sole witness.And I might add that I can remember when Janet Reno came up and I had every special interest group on the right wanting to oppose her, I refused to allow that. We took their statements and paid attention to them, but I didn't do what we're doing here today.LEAHY: Mr. Chairman...HATCH: Now, you have the right to make this decision. All I'm saying is is that I want to point out that the last three or four didn't go more than two days.LEAHY: Well, I notice among our...HATCH: And they were the sole witnesses.LEAHY: ... our list of left-wing witnesses, The Heritage Foundation and a few like that, I suspect...HATCH: For Mason, two conservatives, that's true...LEAHY: I suspect that you're going to have...HATCH: ... way back when.LEAHY: ... that you're going to have all you want, but I would also note, as I said, when the Democrats were in control of the Senate and the Democratic president, it did take us seven days and 26 witnesses when the Republicans controlled. These are my seminal hearings, you see, Senator Hatch. It's...HATCH: And I put...LEAHY: ... the influence of your party and probably four days--anyway.HATCH: Well, just one more...LEAHY: Can we hear from the distinguished...HATCH: Mr. Chairman, just one more point of privilege.LEAHY: I'm trying to speed this thing up.HATCH: Well, we know that J.C. Watts asked to testify and he's not on the members' one, and we would like to have the Honorable Kenneth Holsaw (ph) testify on the same panel as the Honorable Ronnie White because he can...LEAHY: He's on the members' panel.HATCH: ... he was the prosecutor in one of the...LEAHY: He's on a members' panel and...HATCH: But we would like him to be on that panel because then it would be fair because then he can explain what happened.LEAHY: All right. Let's go on with the...HATCH: Well, I hope you'll give consideration to that because it would be highly unfair if you don't.LEAHY: Well, I think the difficult thing, as you know, we sent you over our list of witnesses. And then we waited and waited for days to hear back from you.HATCH: I always waited for yours, as well.LEAHY: This is the distinguished and highly confident senior senator from California.SEN. FEINSTEIN: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.Mr. Chairman, I believe that the people of this nation deserve an attorney general who will be honest, strong and fair, whose integrity is beyond question and who will vigorously protect the rights of every American under law.In my meeting with Senator Ashcroft, I assured him that I would keep an open mind and do everything I possibly could to see to it that he got a full and fair hearing. And I believe he's going to get just that. So I've not yet taken a position on whether I would or would not support his nomination to be attorney general of the United States.But Mr. Ashcroft's past positions on civil rights, on human rights, on segregation, on affirmative action, on a woman's right to choose, on gun laws are very different from my own. All of the above areas are, today, covered by law. For civil rights, we have the Civil Rights Act and Title VII. For a woman's right to choose, the United States Supreme Court has adjudicated Roe v. Wade. For gun control, the ban on assault weapons, which I had something to do with, the National Firearms Act and the Brady bill are all laws of our land.We all know Senator Ashcroft as an independent thinker, as a strong advocate for his beliefs. Many of us on this committee have worked with him on various pieces of legislation; I, for one, on methamphetamine. And he has been gracious, true to his word and a very good person with whom to work.For the past six years as senator and before that as governor, John Ashcroft served as a representative of the people of Missouri. This advocacy was both appropriate and strong-minded. But the attorney general of the United States must be prepared to use the full force and authority of that position to vigorously enforce all laws, regardless of personal belief. It's not enough, for example, for an attorney general to say he will enforce the laws and then appoint a solicitor general whose goal will be to undercut them.And all of this raises in my mind serious questions. Can we expect, for example, an unabashed and vocal opponent of reproductive rights for women to vigorously enforce laws that protect a woman's right to choose? Will Senator Ashcroft continue to vigorously enforce the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act and retain the National Task Force on Violence against Health Care Providers? Would Justice under his leadership provide a vigorous defense of Roe v. Wade?Will he fully enforce and support the ban on assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition clips, and the Brady law? Would he be steadfast in opposition to allowing violent felons to obtain guns, simply by applying for this right to be restored?Would he unwaveringly and vigorously use the office of attorney general to protect Americans from violent hate crimes and other civil rights violations? Would he ensure that no citizen's right to vote is compromised by an illegal act?These are questions that don't relate to character or integrity, but they are also questions that must be answered.Today, we begin the process of ensuring that our system of laws will be enforced with moral authority and fair effectiveness. So I look forward to asking some tough questions, hopefully receiving good answers, and giving Senator Ashcroft the full and fair hearing.Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.LEAHY: And I turn now to the distinguished senior senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter.SEN. SPECTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.From the opening statements, it's perfectly apparent that the battle lines are pretty well drawn--pretty hard to even agree on a schedule. Fortunately, the hearing room table is set in advance, so there's no dispute about that. And for a Senate which has talked so much about bipartisanship, we haven't gotten off to a very good start on the first issue which we are confronting.It would be disingenuous for any of us to say that we don't have views about former Senator John Ashcroft. Having worked with him for six years, including extensive work on this committee, I had thought that I knew John Ashcroft pretty well until I started to read about him in the papers and listen to the electronic media.Well, seriously, we know about his strong ideological views, and the critical factor, obviously, is whether John Ashcroft has the ability and the willingness and the temperament to separate his own personal views from law enforcement. And there is a big difference.On a lesser scale, I served as a prosecuting attorney, DA of Philadelphia, so I know what it's like to enforce laws that I don't particularly agree with.And I think it is fair and this committee has a constitutional responsibility to find out from John Ashcroft that he will give assurances to the American people on critical issues.A matter has already been raised about the right to choose and access to abortion clinics. And I think it is significant that Senator Ashcroft voted on a bankruptcy issue counter to those who would try to stop abortions. The issue is whether somebody who had a judgment in a civil case would be discharged in bankruptcy, which is the general rule. Without getting too deeply involved, John Ashcroft voted that they should not be discharged in bankruptcy if the judgment came from blocking an abortion clinic.There are legitimate concerns about the First Amendment as to Attorney General John Ashcroft's views, if he is confirmed, enforcing the separation of church and state. There is no doubt about the latitude for a president's Cabinet, for, in effect, the president's lawyer, although the attorney general is the lawyer of the American people as well. And there is also no doubt about the enormous difference between a federal judgeship, say a Supreme Court judgeship, where ideology would play a very different role than would the nation's chief law enforcement officer.We are under a microscope, as we all know, ladies and gentlemen, and I hope that we can put partisanship aside. There is no doubt that if it becomes a partisan issue, that this nomination can be blocked by a refusal to cut off debate. And feelings are running very, very high, lots of calls on both sides, great intensity. I haven't seen this much intensity for more than a decade, not that we haven't had it in this room, but not for more than a decade.And if the passions run high enough and partisanship takes over, it will not be in the interest of the American people.Thank you, Mr. Chairman.The distinguished senator from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold.SEN. FEINGOLD: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Let me begin by touching on two general principles to guide our consideration of Cabinet nominations. The first principle is that the Constitution imposes the duty on the president to faithfully execute the laws, and he is expected to propose new laws. To carry out these duties, the president needs advisers and policy-makers in the Cabinet to advance the president's program. Over the history of such nominations, the Senate, with rare exceptions, has given the president broad leeway in choosing subordinates.The second principle that I think should govern nominations is what we might call the political golden rule. We, as Democrats, should, if at all possible, do unto the Republicans as we would have the Republicans do unto us. A Democratic president ought to be able to appoint to the Cabinet principled people of strong progressive or even liberal ideology. And therefore, a Republican president ought to be able to appoint people of strong conservative ideology.Now, whether doing so is good politics, or more importantly is wise, in light of a promise to unify the nation after a very close election, is a very important issue for a sustained national debate. But that is not at the core of our responsibility in this body to advise and consent on Cabinet nominations.Now, as to the case of former Senator John Ashcroft for attorney general, I think John Ashcroft is highly qualified, from the points of view of competence and experience. During the past six years, I've had the opportunity to get to know John Ashcroft as a colleague. I have had little contact with him outside the Senate floor or the committee rooms. In one of those very few encounters, I and Senator Paul Wellstone were walking outside the Capitol, and John Ashcroft offered us a short ride to our homes.Let me tell you on the record, it should give at least some comfort that he was not nominated for secretary of transportation.(LAUGHTER)It was a kind gesture, but a wild, somewhat hair-raising ride.Advise and consent, however, is not about who is a nice guy or collegiality. And in all seriousness, this is a very painful nomination for many Americans in light of John Ashcroft's views and votes on many issues, ranging from the right to choose, to gay-lesbian rights, to affirmative action, to the environment, to others. And I am also alarmed by some of these views.Yet my own direct experience with John Ashcroft has been positive in the sense that he has been much more open to my strong feelings on issues, such as the outrageous practice of racial profiling, than almost all of his Republican colleagues on this committee and in the Senate as a whole. He and his staff not only permitted, but assisted in a significant and powerful hearing on racial profiling in the Constitution Subcommittee which John Ashcroft and I led at the time.Nonetheless, although that experience is certainly relevant to my consideration, I want the individuals and groups that have raised concerns about the nomination to know this: I understand and agree that that experience should be one and only one of many other more important factors to be considered in judging the fitness of this nominee as attorney general.In fact, as I consider the merits of this nomination, I can't help but take this moment to express my concern about the attitude and approach that the former and then future Republican majority in the Senate has taken since 1996 in considering executive appointments and judicial appointments. The previous majority--and, yes, sometimes led by John Ashcroft--seemed never to accept the legitimacy of President Clinton's 1996 victory.Instead, in my view, they unfairly blocked many legitimate qualified appointees, such as Bill Lann Lee, Ronnie White and James Hormel. I think this is wrong. And even Chief Justice Reinquist blamed the under-staffing of the federal judiciary on this questionable approach. This is the very partisanship with which the American people have grown so frustrated and dismayed.So it is not easy to tell those who fought so hard for Clinton and then for Gore that we should follow the golden rule, do the right thing, and not use a similar approach during the next four years. That's my inclination, but I openly wonder at what point we have to draw the line, given the previous majority's refusal to accord the Democrats the very deference that they, the Republicans, now seek.Let me also commend the individuals and groups with whom I agree on virtually all of the key issues for prompting a significant national discussion on this nomination. Despite criticism, you are right to intensely scrutinize this nomination. Regardless of the outcome, this process will reap long-term benefits as these legitimate and heartfelt concerns I heard by all senators and the American people.But in the end, Mr. Chairman, let me also repeat my conviction, as this hearing begins, that voting records and conservative ideology are not a sufficient basis to reject a Cabinet nominee, even for attorney general. I say this as a progressive Democrat from Wisconsin who hopes that the William O. Douglases and Ramsey Clarks of the future will be appointed to executive positions and Cabinets and not be rejected on that basis alone.In other words, Mr. Chairman, being in the middle of the road is not a requirement for a Cabinet position.Thank you, Mr. Chairman.LEAHY: Thank you, Senator.I turn to the distinguished senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl.KYL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think it is appropriate, first, that we welcome our colleague back to this committee, and I do that with great fondness--and also his wife, Janet, who is here.Second, that we focus a little bit on the standard for judging nominees of the president to Cabinet positions. And both Senators Feinstein and Feingold have, I think, spoken eloquently to that point here. And I would like to in a moment, as well.The last Cabinet secretary we had a chance to vote on was the treasury secretary, Larry Summers. And I remember at the time, he had spoken out very strongly against tax cuts, and I'm very much for tax cuts. I thought some of the things he said were relatively outrageous in that regards. But I voted to confirm him, as did I think every one of my colleagues, because of the standard which I think has historically been applied. And I'd like to quote an eloquent statement of that standard by a member of this committee in connection with another nominee a few years ago.Our colleague at this time said, ""The Senate has a responsibility to advice and consent on Department of Justice and other executive branch nominees. And we must always take our advice and consent responsibilities seriously because they are among the most sacred. But I think most senators will agree that the standard we apply in the case of executive branch appointments is not as stringent as that for judicial nominees. The president should get to pick his own team. Unless the nominee is incompetent or some other major ethical or investigative problem arises in the course of our carrying out our duties, then the president gets the benefit of the doubt. There is no doubt about this nominee's qualifications or integrity. This is not a lifetime appointment to the judicial branch of government. President Clinton should be given latitude in naming executive branch appointees, people to whom he will turn for advice.""And our colleague went on to say, with respect to this particular nominee, ""Yes, he has advised and spoken out about high profile constitutional issues of the day. I would hope that an accomplished legal scholar would not shrink away from public positions on controversial issues as it appears his opponents would prefer. One can question Professor Delanger's (ph) positions and beliefs, but not his competence and legal abilities.""The eloquence, of course, is easily recognized as that of the chairman, Senator Leahy of Vermont, speaking on behalf of Walter Delanger (ph), who was confirmed for assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel, in which he acquitted himself admirably.And I think that is the standard. And when applying it to John Ashcroft there can be no doubt that he should be confirmed.Others have spoken of his qualifications. Perhaps it would be of interest to note that he is the first attorney general nominee in the history of the United States that has served as state attorney general, governor and U.S. senator.Only six of the 67 former U.S. attorneys general had even some of Senator Ashcroft's experience. He led the National Association of Attorneys General. He was chairman of the National Governors Association, as well as chairman of the Education Commission of the states. And as all of my colleagues know, he served on this committee and chaired the subcommittee on the Constitution. He has the intelligence, a degree from Yale and the prestige law degree from the University of Chicago. And, of course, I think no one has questioned his integrity.Now, there have been questions raised. I think, if my colleagues have an open mind, as both Senator Feinstein and Senator Feingold noted, Senator Ashcroft can answer many of these questions. I would just note, for example, that with respect to the charge that he opposes virtually any gun control, you can be assured that that's simply incorrect. And he will make that clear.I think at the end of the day one thing is very clear. There have been two interesting assertions made with respect to Senator Ashcroft by opponents. The first is that he has very strong convictions, faith and belief in God. Indeed, he does.The second is that he may not enforce the law and the Constitution. Well, the second assertion is at odds with the first. You can be assured that when John Ashcroft places his hand on the Bible and swears to uphold the laws and the Constitution, that he will do that on behalf of the people of the United States of America.LEAHY: I would note, as my friend from Arizona has quoted me, just so people understand the setting for that vote on Walter Delanger (ph), this was a matter that had been delayed by secret holds on the Republican side for months. And I was arguing they should vote him up or vote him down. He was not the attorney general; he would take orders from the attorney general, something that makes a big difference. But what I wanted was a vote up or down. And when the secret holds were released, he was confirmed.I turn to the distinguished senior senator from New York.SCHUMER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.And welcome, Senator Ashcroft. I know we have our differences, but I want to thank you for being open and honest with us in this process and making yourself available to all of our questions.In return, let me be straight with you. As you know, I have misgivings about your nomination to be attorney general. I haven't come to this conclusion easily. Unquestionably, you deserve a full and fair hearing and a real chance to tell your side of the story.Moreover, I believe we owe a significant level of deference to the president in his choices for Cabinet. The president does not have carte blanche, but usually the presumption at least begins in favor of his nominees. I will support the vast majority of the president-elect's nominees, even though I don't agree with them on many issues.I know that a number of my Democratic colleagues initially voiced some support for your nomination because of this presumption, but I think now that the record has been more closely reviewed, the burden of proof has shifted back to you.When we met privately last week, I asked Senator Ashcroft what role ideology should play in our confirmation process. I meant that question sincerely. It's a difficult issue that many of us are wrestling with.A few years ago, Senator Ashcroft opposed the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to be the assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division at DOJ. At the time, this is what he said about Lee, quote, ""He has, obviously, the incredibly strong capacities to be an advocate, but I think his pursuit of specific objectives that are important to him limit his capacity to have a balanced view of making judgments that will be necessary for the person who runs that division.""Looking back now, I think Senator Ashcroft was correct, at least when it comes to evaluating nominees who have an ideological bent that is significantly outside the mainstream. In other words, the issue should be whether a nominee's fervent beliefs and views are so one-sided that we lose faith, that the American people lose faith, in that person's ability to carefully evaluate, abide by and uphold the law, the law as it is not as he might like it to be.This is even more the case for an attorney general nominee, because the position requires the utmost in balanced judgment, clarity of thought, sound use of discretion, and cautious decision-making.The question I hope these hearings will help us to answer is whether John Ashcroft's passionate advocacy of his deeply held beliefs over the past 25 years will limit his capacity to have the balanced worldview necessary for an attorney general.This is a man who has dedicated his career to eliminating a woman's right to choose. He believes that abortion is murder, that it's wrong and that it must be stopped. He has led the charge to enact new hurdles and restrictions against choice.Senator, you have told me you will enforce the law, but just saying so isn't enough. When your solicitor general gets the chance to tell the Supreme Court to follow Roe v. Wade, will you demur? When the HHS secretary calls you for an analysis of new regulations restricting the right to choose, will your analysis be based solely on the current state of law? When you allocate the billions of dollars that DOJ receives, how much will go to protecting the clinics where you think murder is being committed?Senator Ashcroft, as much as I respect you as a person and your faith, your past causes me grave concern on these issues. And like Bill Lann Lee, when you became the attorney general of Missouri, you did not relinquish your role as a passionate advocate. You sued nurses who dispensed contraception and continued litigating against them for years, despite being told by every court you came before that you were wrong.You sued the National Organization of Women under the antitrust laws to muzzle their attempt to pass the Equal Rights Amendment. Will you now use, as United States attorney general, that office to continue crusading against those you passionately and fervently disagree with?Senator Ashcroft, the issue boils down to this: When you have been such a zealous and impassioned advocate for so long, how do you just turn it off? This may be an impossible task.And I would say to my friend from Wisconsin, this goes beyond ideology; it goes directly to and is unique to the Cabinet position of attorney general, the chief law enforcement officer of the land.Senator Ashcroft has been a leading advocate against gun control. He has fought to kill legislation that would have made it easier to catch illegal gun runners. He has vociferously opposed even child safety locks and the assault weapons ban. When the U.S. attorney from New York or Wisconsin calls him and pleads for more resources to prosecute gun runners, will this be a priority?For many years in Missouri, Senator Ashcroft was a leading advocate against desegregation, he's been on the forefront of arguing against gay rights and for lowering barriers between church and state. In short, John Ashcroft has for decades now been knee-deep in many of the most significant, yet decisive, issues in our country.What this hearing must get at is whether he can now step outside this ideological fray, set his advocacy to one side and become the balanced decision-maker with an unclouded vision of the law that this country deserves as its attorney general.Thank you, Mr. Chairman.LEAHY: The distinguished senator from Ohio, Mr. DeWine.DEWINE: Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.We are now at a place in our nation's history where it sometimes seems as if there is a direct relationship between the qualifications, the experience, the length of service of the particular nominee and how contentious and how difficult the nomination process is.Today, we have a nominee who has extensive experience, who is extremely well-qualified: assistant attorney general of Missouri, eight years as attorney general, eight years as governor, six years as U.S. senator, member of this Judiciary Committee.Therefore, I guess it should come as no surprise that he's taken positions, that he's taken positions on many, many issues. He's cast thousands of votes and he has a long track record.Nor, frankly, should it come as a surprise that a record of a quarter of a century would generate criticism. I think we would worry if he hadn't taken tough positions. I think we would worry if, after a quarter of a century, there wasn't something controversial about what he had said or what he had done.I intend, during this hearing, to listen. My personal experience with John Ashcroft over the last six years convinces me that he is a man of integrity, he is a man of honor, he is a man of courage.The position of attorney general is unique, as my colleagues have already pointed out, among members of the United States Cabinet. His is, in many respects, the most difficult job, because he is the person who must, by statute, give advice to the president of the United States. But he is also, in essence, the chief law enforcement officer of the country.Ultimately, the tenure of John Ashcroft as attorney general or the tenure of any attorney general will be judged not on any one particular decision that he will make, not on any one particular policy that he will take.Ultimately, this attorney general and any attorney general will be judged on how he is perceived, how he is perceived by the public on much more essential issues and much more essential questions: the question of whether or not he was a man of integrity, whether or not he was a man of honesty, whether or not he had the courage to tell the president yes when it was right to tell him yes, and also to tell him no, if that was he needed to tell him.I'm going to listen. But I am convinced, based upon what I have heard so far and what I know about John Ashcroft, is that after he has been attorney general the people will look up and say, ""Yes, this was a man of integrity. We did not always agree with him. We may have disagreed with him on some issues. Maybe he wasn't always right. He gained the respect of the American people and he brought honor and integrity to the office.""LEAHY: Thank you, Senator.Just so we'll let people know where we are, we have four more senators to speak and we will try to stay within the three to four minutes each. And then, what I will do at the end of these four, we will take--as I've told Senator Ashcroft and Senator Bond, Senator Hutchison and others, we'll take a short break just so we can recoup and then come back and have the introductions and the opening statements.The distinguished senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin.DURBIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.It is good to be back on the committee and it's interesting that this would be the kick off for my return to the committee, a hearing of this consequence.LEAHY: We like you senior senators over here.DURBIN: Well, thank you.I agree wholeheartedly with the statement made by Senator Hatch relative to the nature of this hearing and this investigation.John Ashcroft, this should have nothing to do with your personal life or family life. As some have said, the politics of personal destruction should come to an end. And I don't believe this hearing will engage in any questions relative to that, nor should it. For a good reason: You have a fine family you're very proud of, and we have plenty to concern ourselves with, relative to the issues before us.Some have suggested, though, that we're off to a rocky start here in this evenly divided Senate by having such a contentious hearing. Well, this hearing was not the idea of any Democrat, it happened to be the idea of the founding fathers in Article II, Section 2, when they said it would be the responsibility of the Senate to give advice and consent to the president of the United States in his nominations.I don't think that that was a casual reference or surplus verbiage. I think, in fact, they decided very carefully that they would restrain the part of the president and make certain that the chosen leader of our nation would be subject to review in these decisions by another branch of government.Senator Ashcroft, on the day, December 22, when President-elect George Bush nominated you to be attorney general, you made a brief statement which many of us have seen, and said at one point, and I quote, ""President-elect Bush, you have my word that I will administer the Department of Justice with integrity, I will advise your administration with integrity, and I will enforce the laws of the United States of America with integrity.""Integrity, by common definition, is a unwavering commitment to a set of values. There is no quarrel that your public life shows a commitment to a set of values. There is no doubt that your service as attorney general will be guided by a set of values.The question before this committee is, what will those values be? Will they be the values embodied in the laws of the land, many of which you have publicly opposed: a woman's right to choose, sensible gun control, civil rights laws, human rights protections? Will they be the values of President-elect Bush and Vice President-elect Cheney, many of which differ from your own public record? Will they be your values, the values in your heart, which have guided you throughout your public life?The role of the attorney general, as described in the definition of the Department of Justice, first to enforce the law, and that is fairly obvious. And in conclusion, it says to ensure, quote, ""the fair and impartial administration of justice for all Americans.""Can you guarantee fair and impartial administration of justice if you believe some Americans are undeserving or engaged in conduct which you find morally objectionable?As sound as America's principles may be, we must concede that we are not a perfect people. We have struggled throughout our history with issues of equality for women, African-Americans, Hispanics, new Americans, the disabled, people of diverse religious belief, people with different sexual orientation.This last election has left America divided, and I know that the new president has suggested that he wants to unite this great nation. And I sincerely hope that he can.He knows that his biggest challenge will be to reach out and win the confidence of many who opposed him--families and women and minorities and new Americans and those concerned that his views are outside the mainstream of American values. And no office has a more direct impact on the lives and fortunes of these groups and all Americans, for that matter, than the office of attorney general.If minority voters feel disenfranchised by backward election technology and politically biased oversight, it's the attorney general who must protect their rights. If women feel their reproductive choices, including their right to choose the best family planning for them, is threatened by violent demonstrators, it's the attorney general who must protect them. If those with different sexual orientation feel the pain of discrimination and threat of bodily harm, it is the attorney general and the Department of Justice who must protect them.Senator Ashcroft, several weeks ago you and I were on an airplane together, you with your wife and I went alone to the funeral of former Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan.It was a wonderful gesture on your part to be there, considering the fact that you were in the midst of a campaign. It was a funeral service that I will long remember.At the end of that service, as I was leaving, someone pointed to me and said, ""Senator Durbin, this group over here is the Missouri Supreme Court.""And I said, ""Is Justice Ronnie White among them?""They said, ""Yes, he's the gentleman standing over here.""And I went over and met him for the first time and introduced myself. And I said, ""I'm Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, and you're Justice Ronnie White, are you not?""He said, ""Yes.""And, Senator Ashcroft, I said to him, ""I want to apologize to you for what happened on the floor on the United States Senate. That never should have happened.""He faced an embarrassment and a humiliation on the floor of the Senate which did not have to happen. If there was a heartfelt belief by the senators from Missouri that he should not have been a federal district court judge, it should never have reached that point in time. And it rarely ever does in the history of the United States Senate.I have said to you personally and I will say to you at this hearing, I'm going to be asking you a number of questions about that decision and about the process and the way this man was treated. I think that is going to tell me a great deal about your conduct if you become attorney general.During the course of this hearing, Senator Ashcroft will be given a chance to explain his vision of the office, to reconcile clear conflicts between his public record and the new responsibilities he seeks, and to give us and America a chance to look into his heart. This open, fair hearing is an opportunity which was often denied to many who sought the approval of this committee, but it is an opportunity which you will have.Thank you, Mr. Chairman.LEAHY: Thank you, Senator.And we will put Senator Cantwell's statement also in the record. As I said, she's at former colleague Senator Cranston's funeral.And I would recognize the distinguished senator from Alabama, Senator Sessions.SESSIONS: I thank the chairman.John, welcome to the pit. Those were the words of Alan Simpson, I believe, when Justice Scalia appeared here. And it's not a pleasant place to be. There are effective organized groups. One of the members said they are a seasoned coalition. There is a seasoned group that knows how to tarnish individuals who come before a committee when they want to.And as Senator DeWine noted, you, indeed, have a long and distinguished career that includes a lot of litigation and a lot of positions that you've taken, as you believed was right, and there's somebody that can complain about a lot of that. And I hope the burden of proof has not shifted; that wouldn't be appropriate, but it would be consistent with what Senator Simpson said in this committee once that we're more like prosecutor and accused than a confirmation hearing.Well, I love the Department of Justice. I spent 15 years in the department as an assistant United States attorney, 12 years as United States attorney, served five different attorneys general. I believe in that department. It is a great department. It is the Department of Justice and, frankly, we may have had an attorney general who was right on some of our colleagues' ideological issues, but I don't think the department has run well. I think there's some problems there. I think it needs new, vigorous, positive leadership and as people have described your background, I think you're perfect for that and I'm honored to support you.I don't expect anything to come out that would change my mind. Certainly the things that have come out that I have seen and studied are insignificant--differences of opinion that we might have that should not change our view about your qualifications.The attorney general is a law enforcer. There is a big difference between a politician and a senator, where we vote on policy, and executing policy. To me, I haven't had much difficulty making the switch from prosecutor, professional career, attorney general in Alabama to the--actually, I may have had more problem than you're going to have going back.(LAUGHTER)But there is a difference and it's pretty cleared in our minds. And I think, as an eight-year attorney general, you'll not have any difference problem going back and enforcing the law as written.I would say this: I was surprised, Senator Specter, that John supported Chuck Schumer's bankruptcy bill. I tried my best to stop that amendment and I didn't know you had voted the other way on that, but it was...(LAUGHTER)LEAHY: You're going to have plenty of time to let him know how you think about that.SESSIONS: But I don't think the attorney general is particularly unique in setting policy.HHS people, they set policy about whole kinds of contraceptives, very sensitive issues and health issues. There are sensitive issues in Labor that the labor secretary gets to set. I'm not sure the attorney general gets to set many issues at all; basically just has to carry out the laws that are set.I do think bipartisanship is important. I support President Bush's commitment to bipartisanship. I'm going to try to do better this time.I supported Trent Lott in trying to reach an agreement that we wouldn't be fighting here in the beginning of this session, even though some felt maybe it had gone too far. We need to work together. And I think this hearing is a bit of a test.The independent groups, hard-left that they are, have every right to speak and advocate and raise questions. But I think this body needs to evaluate it and give John Ashcroft a fair hearing, in terms of what was known to him, what was the circumstances when he made these decisions, and not take them out of context and give it a spin that's unfair to him. All of us have done things, if taken out of context and twisted about, could be an honest statement, but be a misrepresentation of what's happening.John has not been an obstructionist here. I've looked at the numbers. He voted for 95 percent of President Clinton's judicial nominees. He voted for 26 of 27 African-Americans; the only one that was raised, Ronnie White, is the only one he's opposed. And he had a personal and good reason for that, in my view.He's going to be a champion of prosecution of gun laws. Under this administration prosecutions have dropped. I've talked to John about it. He's committed to me that he's going to work to increase the number of people that are prosecuted for violation of gun laws in America. And in my view, they can be done dramatically with no new resources, frankly.And on Bill Lann Lee, this committee split on that vote.And, Chairman Hatch, if you'd like to read a brilliant address on it, read his speech on the floor about why he opposed Bill Lann Lee. That was not a racial thing. It was a serious discussion about his views about whether or not he would actually follow the Adarand Supreme Court decision. The Adarand case, he said he would support, but the way he defined it, in our view, was not an accurate definition of it. So then he would not be enforcing Adarand if he didn't properly understand Adarand. So that was the basis of our opposition there.So I would just say this: I believe that John Ashcroft has all the gifts and graces to make a great attorney general. I believe he will be a great attorney general. I believe he will serve this country with distinction. I believe this department will flourish under his leadership. I know he will be responsive to us if we have problems. I know and he knows who the captain of the ship is, and that's the president, at whose pleasure he serves.I believe in John. I think all of us do. I ask each member of this committee: Listen to the complaints, but think about the context, the values he held, ask yourself if he abused his office or did wrong on any significant matter. I don't think you will find that to have occurred. And I would like to see a very strong vote for John Ashcroft for attorney general.Thank you.LEAHY: Thank the senator from Alabama.I give it now to my neighbor from New Hampshire, Senator Smith.SMITH: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.And Senator Ashcroft and Janet, welcome.I think Thomas Paine once said, ""These are the times that try men's souls,"" and then he spoke of the sunshine patriots. You're not a sunshine patriot. You're willing to stand here and take it. You don't deserve some of the things that have been said about you and will be said about you. And I know it's tough, but there are a lot of us, I think frankly on both sides of the debate, that appreciate the fact that you're willing to do just that.It is not pleasant for me, as a personal friend of yours--and I will admit that publicly--to hear terms such as racism applied to you, my friend. It's unworthy--those who make the charges. And it's certainly not in the best interest of the political debate of this country.Senator Kohl, I believe, a few moments ago said that the attorney general of the United States should be a role model. If I could pick a role model for my two sons, I'd pick John Ashcroft. And I wouldn't hesitate one moment to do just that.Throughout his entire career in politics, in his own words, he has sought to bring America to its highest and best. He loves his country, he loves Missouri, he loves his family, he loves the law, and he loves the Constitution. And yes, he loves his God. That's not a disqualifier; that's a qualifier. That's not a divider; that's a uniter.There's a lot of cynicism in this town. And people think there's too much politics in politics. We've heard some of it in the public debate leading up to this hearing. We'll hear some of it, and we've already heard some of it in the hearing.But John Ashcroft is a guy who's always looking to do what is right. I'm reminded, and I think Senator Durbin alluded to it, of John Ashcroft coming in to the Republican Conference after the sudden and tragic death of Governor Mel Carnahan, his opponent; emotionally talking about that in the confines of that room with only his colleagues there; announcing to all of us he would suspend his campaign immediately for at least the next 10 days. While that happened, the other side geared up to defeat him, but John did the right thing.That's the kind of man he is. That's the kind of man he is, so when you hear the criticisms, be reminded of the kind of person that he really is. I've never known him to look at a poll or a focus group to make a decision. He looks to the law, he looks to the Constitution, he looks to the founding fathers.America does not need an attorney general who is concerned about public opinion. Americans want an attorney general who is concerned about the law and the Constitution, an attorney general who will not only enforce it, but be an aggressive and vociferous advocate for it and the Constitution.President-elect Bush could have picked another person for attorney general, but he couldn't have picked a better person for attorney general.There will be witnesses who are going to say that because John Ashcroft is a man of religious faith that he won't enforce the law. On the contrary, I would say that knowing the importance Senator Ashcroft places in his faith, I can't think of anyone I'd place more confidence in to support the law.Senator Feingold mentioned a few moments ago that some of the decisions or some of the views that Senator Ashcroft has taken are painful to some on his side. I might also say some of the views that the current attorney general has taken have been painful on our side.But when he puts his hand on the Bible, as Senator Kyl said, and swears to enforce the law, he means it. He'll do it.We're not going to hear much today, except on this side of the table, about the qualifications of Senator John Ashcroft. They've been mentioned a thousand sides, yet I want to say them again: two-term Missouri attorney general; head of the National Association of Attorneys General, receiving a commendation for that; two-term Missouri governor; head of the National Association of Governors; U.S. senator and former member of this Judiciary Committee. We won't hear a lot about that from the other side, because that's not the issue to them.As a matter of fact, John Ashcroft may be the most qualified candidate ever nominated for attorney general. Again, we're not going to be focusing on those qualifications from the other side.In 1993, Janet Reno said, quote, ""The only reason for the death penalty is vengeance. What I want is to put the bad people away and keep them away."" A strong statement from the attorney general, opposed to the death penalty, but Janet Reno applied the law of the land, which is the death penalty.There's no fear here.In conclusion, President-elect George Bush has chosen a like-minded conservative to serve as his U.S. attorney general. We should respect that choice, as has been said here, just as Republicans, by a vote of 98 to 0, confirmed Janet Reno.And I'll say to my colleagues, if it is painful, if I can vote for Janet Reno, you can vote for John Ashcroft.(LAUGHTER)Again, Mr. Chairman, let us set aside the mud slinging, set aside the rhetoric. This is a decent, honorable man. Let's focus on the qualifications on John Ashcroft to be the next U.S. attorney general.My friend, they're going to put you down a bumpy road; there's no question about it. But you've got good shock absorbers. And you're bigger than the politics of self-destruction. Handle it well, as I know you will.And the American people, once they know who you are, once they get to know you, they'll be with you.Thank you.LEAHY: I thank the senator from New Hampshire. And I do want, if he is feeling as badly about voting for Attorney General Reno, at least he has the satisfaction of knowing that while the national crime rate went up for the 12 years before she came there, it went down for the eight years she was there. So that will give you a chance to point to a very good accomplishment.Having said that...SESSIONS: It didn't go down all those years. Just a few, about 12 years before.LEAHY: Didn't go down any before...SESSIONS: Yes, it did.SESSIONS: I'll show you the numbers.LEAHY: Well, we can...SESSIONS: I was there.LEAHY: Well, maybe when you were U.S. attorney.HATCH: It's going to go down a heck of a lot more under Attorney General Ashcroft. I guarantee you that.(LAUGHTER)LEAHY: I wish you'd stop delaying this, Senator Hatch. We got to get going with this.And now, I welcome, again, the distinguished senator from Kansas, who is a friend to all of us in this body, and delighted to have him here in the committee and please go ahead.BROWNBACK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And it's a pleasure to join this committee. I look forward to serving on it and important issues that come here and before this committee. And this is one of them.John, welcome, and Janet, delighted to have you folks here. I'm looking forward to your confirmation as attorney general and your serving with distinction in that capacity, as you have every place else you've served in your long public career that you have had thus far.As a personal note, you know, they say a true friend is somebody who will give you the shirt off their back. I was in my apartment complex I was, in town, was in a fire this last year. And I was standing out in the streets with not much else that I got out with. And the Ashcroft's came over and gave me a roof over my head for several days and took me in. And unlike Senator Feingold's experience driving, I would put you as Secretary of HUD in a moment.(LAUGHTER)Housing was excellent, wonderful accommodations. And they were very kind. And I would dare say, they would do that for anybody in this room, not just me. That's the kind of people that John and Janet Ashcroft are. And I had a personal experience, and I deeply appreciate that kindness you showed me then and you have all along.Our states share a common border. We served on two committees together, in the Commerce and Foreign Relations Committee. Our offices are just down the hall from each other. So we've had a chance to work on a lot of things together.But, really, much more important than either geography or committee assignments, John has shared with me, through his life through the things that he has done, through what I've observed, what I've seen, what I've talked with him about: his honesty, his integrity, his devotion to his family and to his creator, his principled character and his steadfast belief that each of us, each of us is put here on Earth to help our fellow man and to leave this world a better place for all of our children, for those here now and those yet to be.And contrary to the assertions of those who make a living exacerbating the tensions that divide us as a nation, I know John Ashcroft is committed to our nation's promise of equal justice for all, no matter what their stage of life.He has been an outstanding public servant, an example of public service that many of us in this dais would be proud to have.Now in the Constitution, Article II, Section 3 provides that the president, quote, ""shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed,"" end of quote. I'm certain John has already read that provision many, many times.John, when President-elect Bush nominated you to head the Department of Justice he stated that he believed in your, quote, ""commitment to fair and firm and impartial administration of justice."" When you accepted President-elect Bush's nomination, you reaffirmed for the world to hear, your commitment to equal justice under the law, something you've served your entire life with distinction and will continue to do so.Mr. Chairman, let me close my brief statement by saying to our guests at the witness table that, John, you're missed here in the Senate, you really are. But I look forward to voting for your confirmation and towards working with you as attorney general of the United States, and you're going to do an outstanding job. Thanks.LEAHY: Thank you.I see no other senators have statements to make. We will take a 10-minute break.Before everybody leaves, there are a lot of people who want to come in. If there's anybody who is--I say this without a great deal of expectation--but if there are those who wish to leave and give their seats to others, there are those available to take the seats. I mention this because we will have closed circuit TV in Dirksen 226, with chairs and so forth.With that, we'll stand in recess.(RECESS)LEAHY: So we can understand where we stand before we go to Senator Ashcroft's testimony, we will first have three distinguished senators who are here, who I wish to introduce them.And following tradition, as he is from Missouri, we'll go first to the senior senator from Missouri, Senator Bond.SEN. BOND: Mr. Chairman, if you don't mind, I might defer to the other members of the panel for their first introductions, and I would be happy to relinquish my spot and follow as the third and least of the introducers.LEAHY: And the senator, of course, has that right. I thank him for his courtesy, and then we'll go to Senator Carnahan as the other senator from Missouri.SEN. CARNAHAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Hatch. Three months ago this very day I could not possibly have imagined that I would be here. And I suspect that Senator Ashcroft could say the same.During the time that John Ashcroft served the state of Missouri, my late husband, Mel Carnahan, also served in public life as state treasurer, lieutenant governor and governor. So I have an appreciation for the many burdens that Senator Ashcroft and Janet and his family have had to bear in order to serve.Now a new burden rests upon his shoulders and upon each member of the United States Senate. We are considering the nomination of Mr. Ashcroft to be the attorney general of the United States, one of the most powerful and sensitive offices in the nation. I urge you to show him fairness but not favoritism, to welcome all of the facts without fear, and to base your decision on principle and not partisanship.I ask you to look beyond any history of friendship or disputes, and to look beyond the bonds or divisions of party, and to look beyond the urging of interest groups expressing either support or opposition to this nomination. Instead, let us base our decision on the facts as they are determined by a full and fair hearing. I believe that is how we can best serve the interests of the people of America.Mr. Chairman, Senator Hatch, as a proud resident of the Show Me state and a member of this esteemed body, I come here today to introduce to you my fellow Missourian, John David Ashcroft.Thank you.LEAHY: Thank you very much, Senator.And Senator Hutchison? Following our regional procedure, we will go to you, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas.SEN. HUTCHISON: Thank you, Chairman Leahy, Chairman Hatch and other members of this committee.I'm pleased to be here in support of my good friend, former Senator John Ashcroft, whom I've known for many years before he became my colleague. In fact, I was in Kansas City with him and Janet when he had his first press conference after suspending his campaign for the United States Senate for 10 days out of respect for his deceased opponent. The people of America saw the true heart of John Ashcroft in the way he handled the tragic death of Mel Carnahan. He showed magnanimity in his defeat. He put the people of Missouri before his own self-interest.Mr. Chairman, I think he will do the same for the people of America as attorney general of the United States.John and I have served together for six years. He brings an impressive background which all of you have heard several times today. I also think it is worth mentioning, because I think it adds to the integrity of this family, to mention his wonderful wife Janet, who has spent the last five years showing her commitment to education and diversity by teaching at one of our great historically black colleges, Howard University.Senator Ashcroft and I have worked together on many issues and I want to mention a few of those here because he was a leader. He was a leader in co-sponsoring my legislation to eliminate the marriage tax penalty which has the effect of taxing many women at higher rates when the enter the workplace. Last year, he and I worked together to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. He and I both introduced legislation to amend the current stalking laws to make it a crime to stalk someone via electronic means such as the Internet. This new criminal law is now in place.John led the effort to allow hourly wage earners, particularly working mothers, the ability to craft flexible work schedules to better meet the demands of both job and family. While in the Senate, John Ashcroft voted to prohibit people convicted of domestic violence from owning a firearm.John also took a very important issue increasing the rights of victims.While he was governor, he enacted a victim's rights law in Missouri, and has been a staunch co-sponsor with Senator Kyl on the victim's right constitutional amendment, along with Senator Feinstein.Also while governor, he appointed the first women to the Missouri Supreme Court.So I would say to this committee, maybe you might not agree with John Ashcroft on every issue, I think there will be legitimate philosophical differences between Congress and the executive branch, but as I have heard all of the opening statements today, there has been no question whatsoever of John Ashcroft's qualifications, his experience for this job and his absolute total integrity.On the question of enforcing the law, I don't think there's any question that John Ashcroft will uphold and enforce all the laws of our country, and do it vigorously.So in nominating John Ashcroft, President-elect Bush has made his choice. And I believe the Congress should respect the new president's decision.I am pleased to be here, and I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for giving me the opportunity to say a few words on behalf of my former colleague, a person for whom I have great respect.LEAHY: Thank you, Senator Hutchison. And I appreciate you taking the time to be here.And, Senator Bond, we'll go now to you, please.BOND: Mr. Chairman, ranking minority member, temporarily, Senator Hatch...(LAUGHTER)HATCH: We want you to repeat the ""temporarily,"" Kit.BOND: ... temporarily, Senator Hatch, if I may submit my full statement to the record, I'll try to summarize it, because I have a good bit to say about the man I'm honored to present today, President-elect Bush's nominee for attorney general.It's a proud day for me, for the state of Missouri, and for this body. As a well-respected former member of this body, John Ashcroft doesn't need to be introduced to you.I go back to 1973.I had the responsibility to appoint a state auditor for Missouri, and based upon what I saw as promise in John Ashcroft, his character, intelligence and commitment to public service, I selected him. For 28 years I have watched him work every day in the best and highest traditions of this country. Those of you who work with him in the Senate have had an opportunity to see that.If you were to ask me one word to describe John Ashcroft, it would be ""integrity."" And integrity means a steadfast adherence to a strict moral or ethical code. And I'm saying to my colleagues on the committee, that code subsumes within it the adherence to the Constitution and laws. Throughout John Ashcroft's career as attorney general and governor, he has done that.But in this new position, I can think of no one better to be the chief law enforcement agent of this country. He believes in strong and fair law enforcement. He has a consistently strong record on law enforcement, and it's supported by those on the frontlines of law enforcement.If you would permit me, Mr. Chairman, I wish to recognize Mary Ann Vevrett (ph), chief of police for Gaithersburg, Maryland, who is here today on behalf of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, 18,000 members strong, who know firsthand how crucial it is to have the support of someone like John Ashcroft in the attorney general's office. They are behind John. And I thank you very much, Chief.Mr. Chairman, in recent weeks we've seen self-described proponents of various activist groups, trying to convince senators that there is a different John Ashcroft than the man we know personally. Like a sidewalk con-artist, these groups are asking senators, ""Who are you going to believe, me or your own lying eyes?"" Well, they're asking members of this body to embrace the caricature of John Ashcroft over senators' own close knowledge of the man's fine record, built in this committee and on the Senate floor.I've been disappointed in some of the things that I've heard said about John Ashcroft; slash and attack methods are something we've seen far too often in Washington, and I believe the American people are sick and tired of it.Nevertheless, there are legitimate questions that can and should be raised. And several members of the committee have raised the reasonable question of whether John Ashcroft can be trusted to enforce laws with which he personally disagrees.Well, I'm here to tell you that I have observed him, and I can give you the Missouri ""show me"" test. He will enforce the laws.We can assume that most, if not all, United States attorneys general have disagreed with some of the laws they were charged with enforcing. But why is it now that John Ashcroft, a conservative and committed Christian, is charged by some extreme groups of special interest that he would somehow be unable to enforce the laws because of his beliefs? I see some elements of religious bigotry in that.John Ashcroft has stated and repeated firmly that he believes his religion teaches him that he should not impose his religious beliefs on anybody else. He has, however, sought, as we all have, to change the law where he deeply believes it was inadequate or wrong.Undoubtedly, every member of this committee can find votes cast or positions taken by John Ashcroft with which we disagree. I certainly can. Obviously, some of you find many issues on which you disagree legislatively with John Ashcroft.But that is not the point. When you look at the record, you'll see that John Ashcroft believes in enforcing the law as it stands.As Missouri's attorney general, he was my lawyer when I was governor. In 1981, despite his opposition to abortion, he issued an opinion in which he ruled that the Missouri Division of Health could not release to the public information on the number of abortions performed by particular hospitals.Despite his personal view that life begins at conception, he issued an opinion that Missouri law did not require a certificate of death if a fetus was 20 weeks old or less.Despite his own personal commitment to the distribution of Bibles and other religious materials, he issued an attorney general's opinion in 1979 that a board of education has no legal authority to grant permission to any organization to distribute religious material to any or all the student body on school property.Although he stated his opposition to racial set-asides, he issued an opinion in 1980 that allowed the Missouri Clean Water Commission to award a 15 percent state grant to the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District to establish a minority business enterprise program.The John Ashcroft you and I know will be a good attorney general. I can think of no nominee who is better qualified. Senator Kyl and many of you have already spoken about the qualifications. I must say, in deep regret, that the characterization of John Ashcroft's record by my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts is flat, simply wrong. That is not the person that we in Missouri know and respect.John Ashcroft will and can continue to serve this nation with distinction. He knows the legislator's job is to write the laws and the attorney general's job is to enforce it. The American people have a right to expect something better than an attorney general who bends the law to serve a president's political needs and personal views. I know John Ashcroft would never engage in such behavior. He will faithfully, fairly, and effectively administer the laws of this great land. He is not one to bend the laws to his personal beliefs.I come before this committee and respectfully asks that John Ashcroft's nomination to be attorney general be judged on the basis of the content of his character and that charges against him which are personal and insubstantial be dismissed, and this committee and that the full body confirm him as United States attorney general.SEN. KENNEDY: Mr. Chairman, I appreciate what Senator Bond has mentioned. I'll come back during the question period and we'll have an opportunity to have an exchange with the nominee.LEAHY: What the senator wants is somewhat extraordinary for somebody introducing somebody to take issue with an opening statement of a senator on the panel. I would give opportunity for you to respond now, if you want it, but if not, it's up to you.KENNEDY: I'd be happy to. We'll wait until the question period.LEAHY: Why don't we do this? I think all three of the introducers, and I'll let you leave and maybe the staff can move this around a little bit so that Senator Ashcroft could sit in the center, move the name tags around the rest.I thank Senator Hutchison, Senator Carnahan and Senator Bond, I thank you for being here.Senator Ashcroft, will you please stand to be sworn?Do you swear or affirm that the testimony you are about to give before the committee will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?JOHN ASHCROFT: I do.LEAHY: Please be seated.And Senator Ashcroft, before you begin your statement, it's been mentioned several times that you have family and friends here. Would you like--following our normal procedure at these things--to point out family or members or others you may wish to in the audience?ASHCROFT: Mr. Chairman, if it pleases the committee, I will make that part of my opening remarks.LEAHY: It's totally your choice. Go ahead.ASHCROFT: Mr. Chairman, Senator Leahy, Senator Hatch, members of the committee.THURMOND: Will you speak in your loudspeaker?ASHCROFT: Yes, Senator Thurmond, I will. Thank you very much.(UNKNOWN): You should know that by now, John.(LAUGHTER)ASHCROFT: It's a case of how soon we forget. What struck me most is that I came here, and I had a distinct and clear signal that being out of the Senate is different because each other member of the Senate was designated as honorable, and I'm just designated as senator. And I'm just trying to figure what the difference is between being honorable and being a senator.(LAUGHTER)LEAHY: Be careful, you may lose some votes over here.(LAUGHTER)HATCH: I don't think so.ASHCROFT: Thank you. It is a high honor for me to appear before you today for consideration as the attorney general of the United States of America.I first want to extend my appreciation to the senators from my home state of Missouri, Senators Bond and Carnahan, for the courtesy and kindness of participating in an introduction for me at this committee today.And, of course, it's most pleasing that Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas would join them by adding introductory remarks on my behalf. I extend to her my sincere appreciation as well.For four years, I had the privilege of sitting with you on this committee. During that time, I never thought of it simply as the Judiciary Committee.Instead, I thought of it being the Justice Committee, for this distinguished body is the ultimate legislative voice on American justice. It was an honor to serve with you in that noble endeavor.Today, I'm here in a far different capacity: President-elect George W. Bush has designated me to lead the Justice Department, the principal executive voice on American justice and what must be, should be and continue to be the role model for justice the world over.It's not only with honor, therefore, that I sit before you today, it's with an awesome sense of responsibility. For I know that if confirmed on my shoulders will rest the responsibility of upholding American justice, a tradition that strives to bring protection to the weak, freedom to the restrained--I wasn't going to introduce my grandson, Jimmy, at this point...(LAUGHTER)Jimmy, what you've got going for you is there are a lot of grandparents on this panel, so.He upstages me around the house, too. I'm not what I used to be.Our tradition in the Justice Department that strives to bring protection to the weak, and freedom to the restrained, liberty to the oppressed, and security to every citizen.Mine will be the same mantle carried by my predecessors, by Edmund Randolph, President George Washington's choice to be America's first attorney general; by Robert Kennedy, who found within himself the courage to surmount America's historic racial intolerance and to lend powerful assistance to the burgeoning civil rights movement.I understand the responsibility of the attorney general's office. I revere it. I am humbled by it. And if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed as the attorney general, I will spend every waking moment, and probably some sleeping moments as well, dedicated to ensuring that the Justice Department lives up to its heritage, not only enforcing the rule of law, but guaranteeing rights for the advancement of all Americans.The attorney general must recognize this: The language of justice is not the reality of justice for all Americans.My wife has helped me with anecdotes of hers from her experience to understand that there are millions of Americans who wonder if justice means hostility aimed at ""just us."" From racial profiling to news of unwarranted strip searches, the list of injustice in America today is still long. Injustice in America against any individual must not stand; this is the special charge of the U.S. Department of Justice.No American should be turned away from a polling place because of the color of her skin or the sound of his name. No American should be denied access to public accommodations or a job as a result of a disability. No American family should be prevented from realizing the dream of home ownership in the neighborhood of their choice just because of skin color. No American should have the door to employment or educational opportunity slammed shut because of gender or race. No American should fear being stopped by police just because of skin color. And no woman should fear being threatened or coerced in seeking constitutionally protected health services.I pledge to you that if I'm confirmed as attorney general, the Justice Department will meet its special charge. Injustice against individuals will not stand, no ifs, ands or buts, period.The attorney general is charged with the solemn responsibility of serving as the attorney for the United States of America. The attorney general is the people's counsel. The attorney general must lead a professional, nonpartisan Justice Department that is uncompromisingly fair, defined by integrity and dedicated to upholding the rule of law.I pledge to you that if I am confirmed as attorney general I will serve as the attorney general of all the people.Today, I'd like to spend a few minutes telling you a bit about myself and my family and my beliefs. I am the grandson of immigrants. My father was a pastor and a college president. I was raised in Springfield, Missouri, in a home where all of God's children were welcome. In fact, my parents gave up their bed so many times that I thought that they actually knew all of God's children who came to visit. That lesson of hospitality and generosity was just one of many my parents urged on me.I went to Yale University, where I dreamed of playing quarterback. When I got there, I discovered that either I was slow or everybody else was really fast. So I studied hard and I was fortunate enough to graduate and then attend the University of Chicago Law School.For me, the law was about the promise of justice, the promise that under law, all men, all women, all people are equal.While in Chicago, however, I did find one person I thought a little more equal than all the others, a woman of grace and charm and intellect and not insignificantly to me, as a young man, a woman that I thought was the most beautiful I'd ever seen. Only thing better than her, I thought, would be two of them.(LAUGHTER)After rebuffing me several times, my persistence overcame her better judgment and she has stuck with me for 33 years. And members of the committee, her name is Janet Ashcroft. I'm privileged to have her with me today.I'm also pleased to tell you she is an accomplished legal author and has spent the last five years teaching law in the Business Department of Howard University, here in Washington, D.C. I'm also pleased, as well, to welcome her identical twin sister--they're not as identical as they used to be, but I could always tell them apart--Ann Giddings (ph), to the hearing today.THURMOND: Tell her to raise her hand.ASHCROFT: Yes.ASHCROFT: Would the real Janet Ashcroft please stand up?(APPLAUSE)ASHCROFT: And Ann (ph), would you stand up with your sister, please? Thank you.And I also wanted to introduce my daughter, Martha Grace Patterson (ph), who is an attorney from Kansas City--attorney and mother. My grandson, Jimmy Patterson, who has already made his presence known to you.(LAUGHTER)I regret that my eldest son, John Robert Ashcroft, whose faculty responsibilities at Forest Park Community College in St. Louis require his presence with students and cannot be with us today. Additionally, I regret that active duty responsibilities of my son, Andrew David Ashcroft, in the United States Navy, make impossible his attendance at this hearing.I'm grateful for my family, they are wonderful people. They are not wonderful because of me, they are wonderful in spite of me. They are wonderful, a support and help to me. I thank God for them.Upon graduating from law school, I returned to Missouri where I taught business law at Southwest Missouri State University. And after five years of teaching, I embarked on a quarter-century career in public service serving the people of Missouri.In 1973, the then-governor, Kit Bond, appointed me as state auditor. Two years later, then-attorney general, Jack Danforth, appointed me assistant attorney general. I could not have had two more accomplished and distinguished mentors in public life than Jack and Kit.Beginning in 1976, I was elected to the two terms as attorney general, then two terms as governor and, unfortunately--well, pardon me, just one term as the United States senator.In the course of the six state-wide election campaigns, I came to know the people of Missouri very well. Missouri is representative of the rich diversity of the American people. The people of the Show Me state respond to the plain-spoken honesty and tolerance of men like Jack and Kit and, of course, Harry Truman. I'm pleased they elected me to state-wide office five times.Eighteen years of my service in elective office have been focused on enforcing the law, six years enacting the law. I know the difference between enactment and enforcement, and my record shows that.I am here today as the attorney general-designate, I know what the office requires. I've been an attorney general before. I understand that being attorney general means enforcing the laws as they are written, not enforcing my own personal preference; it means advancing the national interest, not advocating my personal interest.For example, in 1979, I issued an attorney general's opinion stating that under the state constitution and the law of Missouri, a local school board of education had no legal authority to grant permission for the distribution of religious publications to the student body on public school grounds.On another occasion, contrary to the demands of pro-life advocates, I directed the state government of Missouri to maintain the confidentiality of abortion records because a fair reading of the law required it.Throughout my tenure, I did my level best to enforce fully and faithfully the laws as they were written and to protect the legal interests of the state of Missouri when it was attacked and when the institutions of the state were attacked.I did this without regard to any personal policy preferences. And when I left the attorney general's office, Missouri was a state more committed to fairness and justice.From my experience, I also understand that the citizens' paramount civil right is safety.Americans have the right to be secure in their persons, in their homes and in their communities. Gun violence, violence against women, drug crime, sexual predators, they all threaten to deny this most fundamental of rights to be secure in the person, property and community of individuals.It is a core responsibility that government, led by the attorney general and the Department of Justice, cooperating with local law enforcement officials, will secure this right.Children don't learn in schools overrun by neighborhood violence. Jobs will not be found in communities where criminals own the streets. No American who now feels threatened should have to move in order to live in a safer neighborhood.My record on these issues is clear and unmistakable and my determination is unwavering. I will continue to work to deter and punish violent criminals who use guns. I will vigorously enforce federal domestic violence laws and utilize the Violence Against Women Act to assist states in this effort. Likewise, we will put new vigor into the fight against the illegal drug organizations and redouble our vigilance against terrorists.During my service as both state attorney general and governor, we increased the number of full-time law enforcement officers by over 60 percent. We also lengthened prison sentences for criminals and significantly increased juvenile prosecutions for serious crimes. During my tenure as governor, we won passage for a Missouri victim's bill of rights. We secured $100 million in increased funding to combat violence against women. We also increased funding for anti-drug programs by almost 40 percent and 3/4 of that went for education, prevention and for treatment.As a senator, I voted to deny the right to bear arms to those convicted of domestic violence. I supported increased funding for victims and helped enact legislation combating telemarketing scams against seniors. I supported mandatory background checks for gun show sales and increased federal funds for law enforcement at the local level. I've always been pleased by my support from law enforcement officers. Those who are here today--for whom I am grateful and those who in past times have endorsed me, most recently in my campaign for the Senate, by the Missouri Federation of Police Chiefs and the St. Louis Police Officer's Association.On the strength of this record and my commitment to the personal security and safety of the people of the United States of America, I pledge my commitment to secure the rights of all Americans to safety and security in their daily lives.I also know from my service that a successful attorney general must be able to listen and find common ground with leaders of diversely held viewpoints. Few organizations reflect the diversity and strongly held views as much as the bipartisan National Association of Attorneys General.I was honored when my fellow state attorneys general elected me president of that associate. I was humbled when they recognized me for outstanding service and presented me with the distinguished Wyeman (ph) Award.I was similarly honored when the bipartisan National Governor's Association elected me to serve as their chairman.I know something about the role of an attorney general. As I said earlier, the Justice Department has a special charge to protect the most vulnerable in our society from injustice. I take pride in my record of having vigorously enforced the civil rights laws as attorney general and governor.Not only did I enforce the law, I took proactive steps to expand opportunity. I signed Missouri's first hate crime statute. By executive order, I made Missouri one of the first states to recognize Martin Luther King Day. I lead the fight to save Lincoln University, the Missouri University founded by African-American Civil War veterans. I took special care to expand racial and gender diversity in Missouri's courts. I appointed more African-American judges to the bench than any governor in Missouri history, including appointing the first African-American on the Western District Court of Appeals and the first African-American woman to the St. Louis County Circuit Court.It was my to appoint the first two women to the Missouri Courts of Appeals and the first woman to the Missouri State Supreme Court, the only woman ever to have been appointed to that court.No part of the Department of Justice is more important than the Civil Rights Division. I look forward to the president's appointment, with your advice and consent, of a talented and dedicated leader of that division. It is essential that such strong leadership pursue fair treatment for all Americans.Before leaving the topic of civil rights, I want to address an issue that has been raised in the weeks since President Bush nominated me to this post. Some have suggested that my opposition to the appointment of Judge Ronnie White, an African-American Missouri Supreme Court judge, to a lifetime term on the federal bench was based on something other than my own honest assessment of his qualifications for the post.During my eight years as governor, I was the appointing authority for judges. As I have just noted, I exercised the power with special care to promote racial diversity on the Missouri state court bench. Because of my experience as governor, when I became senator I approached the judicial confirmation process with both the appropriate deference due an executive and also a personal commitment to ensuring diversity on the bench.Of the approximately 1,686 Clinton presidential nominees, both judicial and nonjudicial, voted on by the Senate, I voted to confirm all but 15. I voted to approve every Cabinet nomination made by the president of the United States.Of President Clinton's 230 judicial nominees, I voted to confirm 218 of them. Perhaps it is needless to say, but I had philosophic disagreements with many, if not most of those judicial nominees. But I think the record of votes stands for itself.On the floor of this body, I voted to confirm 26 out of 27 African-American judicial nominees. My opposition to Judge Ronnie White was well-founded. Studying his judicial record, considering the implications of his decisions, and hearing the widespread objections to his appointment from a large body of my constituents, I simply came to the overwhelming conclusion that Judge White should not be given lifetime tenure as a U.S. district court judge.My legal review revealed a troubling pattern of his willingness to modify settled law in criminal cases; 53 of my colleagues reached the same conclusion. While I will not take time during my brief opening statement to discuss particular matters in Judge White's record that compelled me to my decision, I welcome the opportunity to discuss those matters later.Another issue merits specific mention in these opening remarks, and that is the issue that we would identify with the case of Roe v. Wade, which established a woman's constitutional right to an abortion. As is well known, consistent with Republican United States attorneys general before me, I believe Roe v. Wade, as an original matter, was wrongly decided. I am personally opposed to abortion.But as I have explained this afternoon, I well understand that the role of attorney general is to enforce the law as it is, not as I would have it. I accept Roe and Casey as the settled law of the land. If confirmed as attorney general, I will follow the law in this area and in all other areas. The Supreme Court's decisions on this have been multiple, they have been recent and they have been emphatic.I have been entrusted with public service for more than 25 years. It's a responsibility I have honored and a trust that, I believe, I have kept. During those years, I have not thought of myself as a public servant of some of the people, but a keeper of the public trust for all the people. If I become United States attorney general, I, again, commit to enforcing the law, all of the law for all of the people.I appear here today as a man of faith, a man of common sense conservative beliefs, a man resolutely committed to the American idea. On occasion, some of you have disagreed with my views. You have done so respectfully, and I thank you. In turn, I hope that my disagreements with you have reciprocated your respect.But whether we are conservatives or liberals, religious or secular, Republicans or Democrats, what we have in common is far greater and more important than what divides us. As Americans, we live under a Constitution, uniting us under a rule of law, a Constitution that allows us to live side by side in harmony, working for the mutual interest of all Americans and our communities.It is indeed adherence to the rule of law that is the basis of our democracy. Never in the history of the world has any country so thoroughly dedicated itself to respecting laws, for it is in respecting laws that we respect the individual dignity and freedom of people. Nowhere in government is thorough obedience to the rule of law more powerfully evident and more urgently necessary than at the Department of Justice.If I am fortunate enough to be confirmed by the United States Senate and to become the next United States attorney general, I pledge to you that strict enforcement of the rule of law will be the cornerstone of justice.As a man of faith, I take my word and my integrity seriously. So when I swear to uphold the law, I will keep my oath, so help me God.LEAHY: Thank you, Senator.What we will do now, we will have in the first round of questioning...(UNKNOWN): (OFF-MIKE)LEAHY: The committee will be in order. The committee will stand in recess until the police can restore order.Officer, restore order.The police will restore order.(CROSSTALK)LEAHY: The committee will also stay in order.It will be the policy of the chairman to not allow any demonstrations for or against the nominee. You're all guests of the United States Senate. The 100 senators have a duty to vote for or against this nominee.We will make up our mind based on the testimony within this room and the testimony of the nominee. We will not allow demonstrations of any sort. Everybody has a chance to write or call their individual senators for or against Senator Ashcroft. I thank the Capitol Police for restoring order.Now, as I was saying, it will be the intent of the committee to have 15-minute rounds of each senator, doing the usual alternating on the first round. If there are further questions, we'll have shorter rounds after that. I have told the nominee if at any time he wants a break, of course, we will take one, again following normal time.So I will start the questioning, and then we turn to Senator Hatch.Senator Ashcroft, while you served in the Senate, you did not have an opportunity to vote on a nomination for attorney general, and, in effect, this is your first hearing that you have attended in any capacity in the Senate for an attorney general. But from 1995 to last year, as you pointed out, you voted for a number of President Clinton's nominees. You also chose to oppose and vote against a number of President Clinton's nominees to the executive branch; in both cases exercising the right any senator has.But I want to explore with you what appears to be the, for want of a better term, the Ashcroft standard that you used when you reviewed presidential nominations, and I'll start with that of Bill Lann Lee.You opposed the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to head the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. In November of 1997, you said, ""This is what I've been sent to Washington to do; to evaluate whether or not an individual will be the kind of an administrator, in an agency, that people are entitled to have.""And then you opposed Mr. Lee because, as a civil rights lawyer, you thought, and I quote you again, ""His pursuit of specific objectives that are important to him limit his capacity to have the balanced view of making the judgments that would be necessary for the person who runs that division.""And you also said, quote, ""We don't need an individual who is trying to go against the Constitution as recently interpreted by the Supreme Court. We need someone who is going to say, 'I'm here to provide the administration""'--and that's an actual quote--""'I'm not here to amend the Constitution; I'm here to defend the Constitution.' That is what we need.""Now, Senator, using this Ashcroft standard, do you adhere to those views as setting the proper standard by which senators should evaluate presidential nominations?ASHCROFT: Well, I'm pleased, first of all, Mr. Chairman, to thank you for the question. It's an important question. I thank you also for the way you're conducting this hearing. I appreciate the willingness to make sure that we have an opportunity to make these discussions in a setting which is conducive to understanding.I think the ability to enforce the law as it is written and as it has been defined by the United States Supreme Court is very important. And when I have evaluated individuals, that's a very important criteria, especially for someone in an administrative or enforcement role and not in an enactment role.Obviously, in the Senate we take a variety of positions because we--I say advisedly we--I'm no longer a senator, and I don't mean to be presumptive--but because in the debate and in the exchange we arrive at what the law will be.I joined with eight other Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee in opposing Bill Lee's nomination to be assistant attorney general because I had serious concerns about his willingness to enforce the Adarand decision which was a recent decision of the United States Supreme Court.He was an excellent litigant, but I had concerns that he viewed the Adarand decision as an obstacle rather than as a way in which the law was defined. Adarand held that government programs that establish racial preferences based on race are subject to strict scrutiny, that is the highest level of scrutiny under the Supreme Court's equal protection clause. Adarand was a landmark decision, it was substantial, it was important. Mr. Lee did not indicate a clear willingness to enforce the law based on that decision.LEAHY: In the last part, if I could disagree with you on that. Mr. Lee testified on a number of occasions--in fact, testified under oath, including, incidentally directly in answer to your questions, that he would enforce the law as declared in Adarand.And he also said, in direct answer to questions of this committee, he considered the Adarand decision of the Supreme Court as the controlling legal authority of the land, that he would seek to enforce it, he would give it full effect, but you say that he would not accept that decision and apply it fairly.Was Bill Lann Lee lying under oath to this committee?ASHCROFT: I certainly don't want to say that. I simply want to say that when asked what the standard was, he did not repeat the strict scrutiny standard of ""narrowly tailored and directly related.""LEAHY: But how could he be more strict...ASHCROFT: He stated another standard, and when asked whether the standard which he applied would affect programs, he basically said it wouldn't have any effect on the programs of the federal government. Now in my judgment...LEAHY: But he said he would uphold it. I mean, what more could he say?ASHCROFT: Well, frankly, he could have said that when applying a test, he would use the same test that the Supreme Court of the United States said should be used in strict scrutiny cases.And, if he had, I believe that people would have been more likely to give credence--when Chairman Hatch--of course, he made an eloquent floor statement about this in speaking on this matter, but when Chairman Hatch delivered his remarks on this matter, I think he made clear what the rest of us felt, that while he said he considered the Adarand decision the law of the land, when he discussed the way in which it was implemented, it was clear that it would be applied in the way that the Supreme Court would require its application.LEAHY: OK. Then I understand, as I said, the Ashcroft standard on that, but let's go a little further, let's take another step.Like Bill Lann Lee, you have a long history of pursuing specific objectives that are important to you. And I would assume, like he, within the law. But throughout your public life as attorney general and governor of Missouri and as U.S. senator, you have opposed a women's constitutionally protected right to reproductive freedom and choice, even in cases of rape and incest, you have fought voluntary school desegregation, affirmative action and gay rights. When you were running for president in 1998, you were quoted as saying, quote, ""There are voices in the Republican Party today who preach pragmatism, who champion conciliation, who counsel compromise. I stand here today to reject those deceptions."" Again, your words.Now, given that history, you can understand why some might be troubled by it. What assurances can you give us that you would serve as the chief enforcement officer of this country with the kind of balanced view that you acknowledge is necessary for top official in the Department of Justice, the balanced view that you said others must have before you would vote for their confirmation?ASHCROFT: Mr. Chairman, with all due respect, I would like to just have a chance to go back to that list, the litany of things...LEAHY: Of course.ASHCROFT: ... and positions you attributed to me. You said I opposed voluntary desegregation of the schools. Nothing could be farther from the truth. I don't oppose desegregation, I repudiate segregation. I am in favor of integration.When the state of Missouri was asked to fund, with hundreds of billions of dollars, a program imposed by a federal court...LEAHY: Hundreds of billions?ASHCROFT: Hundreds of millions of dollars, pardon me. I thank you for correcting me. I've been in Washington so long, I've forgot how to say millions. I've just started saying billions.(LAUGHTER)LEAHY: I'm more interested in what you said at the time of the desegregation orders in Missouri.ASHCROFT: I opposed a mandate by the federal government that the state, which had done nothing wrong, found guilty of no wrong, that they should be asked to pay this very substantial sum of money over a long course of years. And that's what I opposed.I have always opposed segregation. I have never opposed integration. I believe that segregation is inconsistent with the 14th Amendment's guaranteeing of equal protection. I supported integrating the schools.Now, while I was the Missouri attorney general, I inherited a desegregation lawsuit in St. Louis from my predecessor in office, Jack Danforth. The state had been sued. I argued on behalf of the state of Missouri that it could not be found legally liable for segregation in St. Louis schools because the state had never been a party to the litigation.Now, one of the responsibilities of an attorney general, in my judgment, is that when the entity which you represent legally is attacked or sued, you should defend it. Here, the court sought to make the state responsible and liable for the payment of these very substantial sums of money, and the state had not been found really guilty of anything.I also took the position, on behalf of the state, that the court's inter-district remedy in that case was inappropriate because there was never any finding of an inter-district violation.Now, to me, I just want to try and make it clear, it's been mentioned on several occasions, and I just think I want to have the opportunity to say with clarity that I do not support segregation; I support integration.I happened to have been a young person in school when Brown v. Board of Education was announced. The schools in my town had been segregated. They were immediately integrated. And I support that. And so I would be very pleased--there was a list of things that were similarly...LEAHY: And we'll go back to them, and I will make absolutely sure, I can assure you, that you will have the time to go on them.I would point out, though, that on the case you speak about, the federal district court threatened to hold the state in contempt if it didn't submit a specific desegregation plan within 60 days and said, quote, ""The court can draw only one conclusion: The state has, as a matter of deliberate policy, decided to defy the authority of this court.""What I'm driving at...ASHCROFT: Mr. Chairman, I'd be glad to respond to that if you'd like to have me do so.LEAHY: I will. Hold on one moment.ASHCROFT: I take these very seriously...LEAHY: Well, go ahead. Respond to that.ASHCROFT: Well, you know, if the state hadn't been made a party to the litigation and the state is being asked to do things to remedy the situation, I think it's important to ask the opportunity for the state to have a, kind of, due process and the protection of the law that an individual would expect.A person swears to uphold the law of the state and to become the attorney general, when the state is attacked, I think it's important to expect the attorney general of the state to defend the state. Now over time it may be that if there had been a different structure, something different would have happened.LEAHY: Did you consider--and this you actually can answer yes or no--did you consider the district court was fair in suggesting that you, on behalf of the state of Missouri, that you were basically dragging your feet? Do you think that was fair?ASHCROFT: I think it's unfair to characterize a person as being uncooperative if they are asked to indemnify a situation when there was no opportunity for them to originally be a party to the lawsuit and if they weren't in a position to defend themselves. That would be unfair.LEAHY: So you found the criticism of you by the court to be unfair?ASHCROFT: Frankly, I thought the ruling by the court that the state would have to pay when there was not showing of a state violation to be unfair.LEAHY: Thank you, but now my question--do you feel that their criticism of you in your role as attorney general was unfair?ASHCROFT: Would you mind--this is 20-some years ago...LEAHY: ""The court can draw only one conclusion: The state has, as a matter of deliberate policy, decided to defy the authority of this court.""Would you consider that unfair?ASHCROFT: Yes.LEAHY: Thank you.Now, Dr. Satcher--David Satcher--you opposed his nomination to be our surgeon general even though the Senate eventually approved him. In your speech, you said, ""Dr. Satcher says he has a mainstream approach; he's going to pursue consensus."" But then you went on to say that you didn't believe that.You told the Senate that he was, ""a person of incredibly strong medical credentials, in terms of his expertise and his capacity, but you said the United States has participated in confirming nominations or ratifying proposals without looking carefully at the ethics involved of the guys that are being challenged.""So the opposition to Dr. Satcher, by your own statement, was not based on his professional qualifications. Indeed, is it fair to say that applying an Ashcroft standard you were articulating as a U.S. senator that you are going to oppose a nominee who you believed to be out of step with the mainstream of America, to use the words you used in your speech.ASHCROFT: Mr. Chairman, I'm pleased to have the opportunity to express my concerns here. Dr. David Satcher supported a number of activities that I thought were inconsistent with the ethical obligations of a medical doctor and a physician, particularly the surgeon general, because I think the surgeon general is an individual to whom America must look for guidance in terms of not just technical expertise, but the kind of ethics that ought to accompany people who have life-and-death decision-making in their hands. We all know how important the medical profession is.LEAHY: And you disagreed with those ethics and values.ASHCROFT: Yes, for example, he supported an AIDS study on pregnant women in Africa where some patients were given placebos, even though a treatment existed to limit transmission of AIDS from the mother to the child. In my understanding, this would not be an acceptable strategy for a study in the United States, but he was willing to support the study under those terms in Africa. That was a matter of deep concern to me.Let me--if I might--he lobbied Congress to continue an anonymous study testing newborn infants' blood for the AIDS virus, without informing the mother if the test was positive. Now, I have real problems with a situation where someone wants to be the surgeon general of the United States, wants to learn about whether or not there's AIDS present in a medical situation, and not tell the people involved about the AIDS virus.This is a matter of deep concern to me. The idea of sending fatally infected babies home with their unwitting mothers, even after a treatment had been identified for AIDS, to me was an idea that was unacceptable for an individual who wanted to be the leader in terms of the medical community and a role model in the United States. It was on those grounds that I made the decision.Now, it's my decision and I'm not trying to duck responsibility for the decision. But those are the facts as I understood them, and that's the reason I made the decision.LEAHY: So it'd be fair to say you disagreed with his ethical choices and his values, and you felt you should vote against him because of that.ASHCROFT: I think it's fair to say that I believed he violated the ethical values that are characteristic...LEAHY: I'm not trying to parse words, and I just want to make sure I understand, because I'm trying to get this...(CROSSTALK)ASHCROFT: It was a shortfall in his adherence to ethical values of the American medical community that I think were...LEAHY: And because you disagreed with what you saw as his ethics and values, you voted against him. I'm not trying to place words in your mouth, I want to make sure I understand.ASHCROFT: Well, then maybe...LEAHY: Trying to give you the fairest...ASHCROFT: Well, maybe if you will let me state my words...LEAHY: Sure.ASHCROFT: ... then you don't have to worry about placing words in my mouth.(LAUGHTER)I believed that his willingness to accept a standard for medical research in Africa, on African women, that would not be acceptable in the United States was an ethical lapse that was very important. I, secondly, believed his willingness to send AIDS-infected babies home with their mothers without telling their mothers about the infection of the children was another ethical problem that was very serious.Based on those standards, which I believe are less than acceptable standards in the medical community in this country, I voted against him.LEAHY: That's what I was trying to get you to say. Thank you.ASHCROFT: I'm sorry.LEAHY: Maybe we were speaking past each other. But thank you.Senator Hatch?HATCH: Well, thank you.Senator Ashcroft, the principal argument raised against your nomination by some people is because of your firmly held personal beliefs, which happen not to be consistent with the views of the abortion right groups, the People for the American Way, and other similar interest groups; that you will not enforce the laws of the land as attorney general. That seems to be the argument.Now, your record, however, which the special interest groups seem to ignore, seems to provide clear evidence to the contrary. For example, as attorney general for the state of Missouri, you repeatedly issued legal opinions regarding how a particular statute should be interpreted and enforced.Time and again, Senator, your record reflects your dedication to enforcing the law, regardless of your particular views in areas like the environment, abortion, guns, religion and rights.Let me give just a couple of examples, and you gave some other examples in your opening remarks. You issued an opinion in 1981 that the Missouri Division of Health could not release information to the public on the number of abortions performed by particular hospitals. You determined that the state legislature made clear its intent that such reports remain confidential and be used only for statistical purposes. You also determined that in order to protect the patient-client privilege access to health data maintained by the Division of Health, that it only be subject to review by public health officers, something that people in the right-to-life community disagreed with you on. That's correct, isn't it?ASHCROFT: It is correct.HATCH: You also, in Attorney General Opinion Number 50--I'm just going to mention two, there are all kinds of these.ASHCROFT: Well, don't ask me to quote them. We had 800 or more.HATCH: I won't ask you to quote them. Let me see what I can do.""In Attorney General Opinion Number 50, dated March 2, 1977, Attorney General Ashcroft issued an opinion, which interpreted state law to prohibit prosecuting attorneys from carrying concealed weapons, even while engaged in the discharge of their official duties. Attorney General Ashcroft reached this opinion, despite the fact that some prosecuting attorneys conducted their own investigations, and as a result faced dangerous situations."" That's true too, isn't it?ASHCROFT: Yes, sir, it is true. And it may not have been my personal judgment that their safety was best regarded by that, but the law was, we thought, clear.HATCH: That's what the law said, and so you enforced it. I mean, I have to admit I don't agree with that law either. They ought to be able to protect themselves. But I could go on and on with further examples, but I want to hear from you.The special interest groups who have sharply attacked you, seem to ignore these instances where you have interpreted the laws as written, despite your personal beliefs.Now, if confirmed as attorney general of the United States, will you enforce the laws of this land irrespective of your personal beliefs?ASHCROFT: I will. And I think I should clarify that just a little bit.My primary personal belief is that the law is supreme; that I don't place myself above the law, and I shouldn't place myself above the law. So it would violate my beliefs to do it.So I spent 24 years in elective public offices as--the auditor's office in Missouri is really a compliance office. We audit not only for financial integrity but for compliance with legal mandates to the agencies. I spent two years there as state auditor, and then the eight years as attorney general and eight years as governor.And there are other things you do as governor, but you also are a law enforcement individual. The executive branch does that. And most of my time in government has been in enforcement. And I'm pleased to say that I have enforced the law faithfully to the best of my ability in those settings.HATCH: With regard to Mr. Bill Lann Lee--I happen to like Mr. Lee, but I voted against him. Not because I wouldn't have supported him for any number of other positions; I would have, because he's a sincerely dedicated, decent, honorable man.But when he appeared before the committee, I have to say that one of the problems that I had at that particular time was that I was concerned, because of his prior background, that he force consent decrees on local municipalities, cities, counties and other governments by bringing very expensive lawsuits that would cost millions of dollars to defend where they'd have to cave in to consent decrees that would require quotas that were really wrong under the Adarand and other decisions by the Supreme Court.I can remember--and like I say, while I have the highest personal regard for Mr. Lee's accomplishments when he was in the private sector, I was extremely concerned about his interpretation of civil rights laws.His lifetime's work was devoted to preserving constitutionally suspect, race-conscious public policies that sort and divide citizens by race. For instance, Mr. Lee, when he appeared before the committee, interpreted the Adarand v. Pena case to mean that racial preferences are permitted if, quote, ""conducted in a limited and measured manner,"" unquote.Now, as I noted on the floor of the Senate, his statement mis-stated the court's fundamental holding on such programs that are presumptively unconstitutional. And unfortunately, I have to say, that his recent record indicates that's what he has been doing in a large degree, or at least to a significant degree, in his position in the Justice Department.So there was a legitimate reason to vote against Bill Lann Lee, even though I think all of us would admit he's a nice person and probably could fill any number of other positions in government. I suspect that that's the reason you voted against him, and I can see why others might have voted for him, but the fact is, I had to do what I thought was the law. What about you?ASHCROFT: Well, frankly, I struggled to say that perhaps earlier, not as effectively as you have just said it or as you said it on the floor. When he indicated that the test of whether a program would survive strict scrutiny was that it be limited and measured, he really basically was expanding the test substantially.The district court on remand in that case said it, and I quote ""is difficult to envisage a race-based classification that is narrowly tailored."" But Mr. Lee, when asked if he could identify a single racial preference program that was unconstitutionally suspect, could only identify one out of all the programs.I think the key, though, is the material that you presented at the time, which I found persuasive, and his statement of a test for programs, which was just monumentally different than the test provided for by the court in the Adarand case.HATCH: It's been mentioned that you opposed certain aspects of federal court decrees surrounding the desegregation of schools in Kansas City. Well, Senator Ashcroft, isn't it time that in Missouri v. Jenkins, which is a poster-child case for what many think is judicial activism, that the Supreme Court found that the district court had exceeded its authority by ordering remedies beyond its power? Was your position not vindicated by the Supreme Court after some 18 years of litigation?ASHCROFT: Well, very frankly, the Jenkins case was a five-four case...HATCH: Right.ASHCROFT: ... and it was a case in which the judge imposing a tax was upheld in imposing the tax...HATCH: Yes, it wasn't the Congress the imposed the tax, it was the judge.ASHCROFT: No, nor was it the state legislature or the city council.HATCH: That's right. So it was a legitimate argument.ASHCROFT: Obviously, it's a legitimate argument. And I hope these hearings will allow me to clarify the fact that a state attorney general has a responsibility to defend the state when it is asked by other parties to open its treasury to fund one thing or another.The situation in Kansas City, at the order of the federal district court judge, was tragic, in terms of the amount of money spent. And really, frankly, this hadn't become--this really wasn't that much of a partisan issue; it became clear that this was not helping children, but it was a very, very serious diversion of the state's resources, in a way which made difficult the achievement of other objectives.For example, busing had strong opponents in Missouri, Democrat and Republican, black and white. Freeman Bosley, St. Louis' first African-American mayor, opposed forced busing, as did Democrat state Attorney General Jay Nixon. This forced busing that was opposed is not on their part or on my part an opposition to integration. It was an opposition to a counterproductive, inappropriate effort to impose on the state, transportation of students to and from, at great expense and at little benefit educationally to the students.HATCH: Well, I've heard some arguments against you, because of your firmly held religious beliefs. In fact, I've seen it over and over in the press in this country.When Vice President Gore selected our esteemed colleague, Joseph Lieberman, to be his running mate, many individuals and organizations supported that choice and applauded Senator Lieberman for his strong religious beliefs. I have to say, I felt the same way.Unfortunately, many left-wing groups have not been as supportive of your religious beliefs and convictions. Almost like it's OK for a liberal, but it's not OK for somebody who is conservative.Personally, I, as a Christian, am very unsettled by the different treatment accorded you and Senator Lieberman. I think it's wrong.Now, the job of the attorney general of the United States is an extremely important job, and it is to enforce the laws enacted by Congress. The only issue for me is the manner in which you execute the job, or will execute the job.Doesn't matter to me whether you're Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, whatever, or an atheist or agnostic. I'm sure that goes for--I hope that I'm sure that that goes to the rest of our fellow senators. In fact, the Constitution of the United States specifically forbids religious qualifications for office.Now, having gone through that type of, I think, offensive criticism, which is continuing right up to today, is there anything in your religious beliefs that would impair you from faithfully and fully fulfilling your responsibilities as attorney general of the United States?ASHCROFT: Well, I don't believe it's appropriate to have a test based on one's religion for a job. I think Article V of the Constitution makes that clear.In examining my understanding and my commitment and my faith heritage, I'd have to say that my faith heritage compels me to enforce the law and abide by the law rather than to violate the law. And if in some measure somehow I were to encounter a situation where the two came into conflict so that I could not respond to this faith heritage which requires me to enforce the law, then I would have to resign. I do not believe that to be the case.Can I just say a word about this? America has struggled in this respect for quite some time, and people who come from different religious and faith perspectives have emerged at one time and another, and when they have, there have been questions about this. This is not new.Before I was old enough to vote, but when I was old enough to be very active in watching elections, in 1960, the first person became president of the United States from a Catholic perspective. In my part of the country there were people who thought, ""He will not be free. He will have to do whatever the pope tells him to do. He will be a client of a foreign individual."" You know, I heard that talk. But America got by that talk, and I think it's good that we did.And my own view is that, yes, people won't understand different kinds of individuals from time to time. Most people hailed, as I did, the elevation to national candidate status of my college classmate and former colleague here in the United States Senate, Joe Lieberman. We need more people like Joe Lieberman in public office, not fewer people like Joe Lieberman in public office.But I was the first person from my faith denomination to be elected to a statewide public office, as attorney general. I was the first governor ever from my denomination.ASHCROFT: I was the first senator from my denomination. I understand these things, and I think this is something we work our way through as Americans. And we're going to come to an understanding that well-intentioned people of good faith, when they raise their hand and take an oath to support the Constitution and enforce the law, they do it.And as I look back across America and this heritage--and it's been focused on different kinds of people at different times--I, frankly, don't see that our faith has been misplaced. As I look across--when we had our first Catholic president, we didn't suffer.So, you know, I think this is something we will work our way through.HATCH: My time's just about up. Let me just ask you one last question.You've publicly stated your agreement with the law of Adarand, which states that all racial classifications made by the government must be able to withstand strict scrutiny.You were also a sponsor of the Civil Rights Act of 1997. This Civil Rights Act basically seeks to implement the Supreme Court's holding in Adarand with respect to federal racial classifications. The Civil Rights Act of 1997 does state that affirmative action, such as encouraging qualified women and minorities to apply for government contracts and employment, would not be affected.Now what sort of affirmative action programs would you support, if confirmed, and what would be your plans for the Civil Rights Division?And my time is up.ASHCROFT: Well, very frankly, there are lots of ways that are acceptable, and some have been working their way through the courts and I think will be sustained.The president-elect of the United States has identified a series of things that he calls affirmative access. I think those are good ideas. They've been in place now in Texas and in California and in Florida and are making their way in the educational system where access is so very important.We can expand the invitation for people to participate aggressively so that no one is denied the capacity to participate simply because they didn't know about the opportunities. We can work on education, which is the best way for people to have access to achievement.There are a wide variety of things. We can size government opportunities so that people can bid who don't have the megastrength of the big, old-time contractors but some new entrants into the marketplace.These are all policy decisions that I believe this next administration--President-elect Bush is eager to consider. And, certainly, the affirmative access that he's described is something that I think the entire country would be well-served to work on.HATCH: Thank you, Senator Ashcroft.LEAHY: I just would not want to leave one of the questions from my friend from Utah to give the wrong impression to the people here and just, sort of, make it very clear. Have you heard any senator, Republican or Democrat, suggest that there should be a religious test on your confirmation?ASHCROFT: No senator has said, ""I will test you,"" but a number of senators have said, ""Will your religion keep you from being able to perform your duties in office?""LEAHY: I'm amazed at that.ASHCROFT: Pardon?LEAHY: Well, I'm amazed at that--at any more than...ASHCROFT: I understand, and I accept the opportunity to say with clarity that not only will I represent that I will enforce the law, but there is some record here of my two years as auditor, eight years as attorney, eight years in the governor's office, that when the law is clear and decided, that I enforce the law.LEAHY: Senator Kennedy?KENNEDY: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.If we could, Senator Ashcroft, come back to the St. Louis situation. Let me just spell out very briefly, as you remember, but just so that we have the common understanding.In the '70s, more than 20 years after the Brown v. Board of Education, St. Louis still maintained a segregated school system. Finally, responding to the lawsuits brought by the parents, the courts stepped in and ruled the state of Missouri and the St. Louis School Board were jointly responsible for violating the Constitution by creating and maintaining segregated and grossly unequal schools.The court ruled that the state had maintained an elaborate set of laws to enforce segregation. At one time, the state law even forced black children who lived in the suburbs and in white city neighborhoods to be bussed to all-black inner-city schools. According to the court, the state had completely abdicated its constitutional duty to desegregate the schools.You disagreed with that finding, but despite your repeated appeals, requests for injunctions, three denials of review by the Supreme Court over a four-year period, the final ruling of the courts were not changed. So you had your chance in the courts to make the case that you've just made here and rejected on each time.Let me just continue.(CROSSTALK)KENNEDY: Now the city of St. Louis and its schools and surrounding 23 county districts all accepted the ruling. They negotiated a model desegregation plan, relying on the voluntary public school. Black students from city schools could volunteer, transfer to white suburban schools. White suburban students would have the opportunity to transfer to magnet schools run by the city.In fact, the plan has been a lifeline for tens of thousands of students, with graduation rates that are consistently twice as high for the transferred students, more of them going on to college, and over 11,000 students are still using it today, including 900 suburban students.Now, given the voluntary nature of the desegregation plan and the fact that the city and country school districts all agreed to it, how do you justify your relentless opposition to the voluntary school desegregation and, sort of, a scorched earth legal strategy to try and block it?ASHCROFT: Senator Kennedy, first of all, the litany of charges that were made about the state's activities included a rather loose definition of things that the state had done prior to Brown v. Board of Education. Virtually none of the offensive activities described in what you charged happened in the state after Brown v. Board of Education. As a matter of fact, most of them had been eliminated far before Brown v. Board of Education.Secondly, in saying that the city maintained a segregated school system into the '70s, is simply a way of saying that after Brown v. Board of Education when citizens started to flee the city and move to the county--and you'll know that St. Louis, for a number of decades now, has been a place that has lost more population than virtually any other city as people moved into the county--the schools, as people changed their location, began to be more intensely segregated. That was after the rules of segregation had been lifted, and it was not a consequence of any state activity.Then I would just simply say that I think it's unfair to call the program totally voluntary and to suggest that we opposed a voluntary program when the thing was that the state was going to have to pay for everything people volunteered to do.Now the situation was basically this: The county school districts agreed with the city school districts that they could confess judgment and get a lot of money from the state of Missouri by saying, ""If we'll just say that we'll do this voluntary plan, the state will have to pay for the situation.""So you had a situation something like this--and I don't have all the material that you all have, but let me try and recreate it from my memory.KENNEDY: I want to give you a fair chance, but we've got...ASHCROFT: Well...KENNEDY: Go ahead.ASHCROFT: Thank you for your fairness. Because when the machine gun of charges comes out, I want to try and respond to all the lead.KENNEDY: Well, let me give you one point that you've just raised, because I want to move on. In earlier, you said, ""Well, the state wasn't involved.""ASHCROFT: Well...KENNEDY: Well, now let me just read you. ""Now, 1980, in the Adams v. United States, the city board and the state were jointly responsible for maintaining segregated school system. 1982, we again note that the state and the city board.""My question is, how costly was this going to be, Senator Ashcroft, before you were going to say that those kids going in lousy schools, that you were going to do something about it? You were there as an attorney general, you were there as governor and did virtually nothing about it. And a new governor came in, Mel Carnahan, and resolved that and basically accepted it.You used every kind of device to oppose it. You have the Economist magazine, which is not a liberal magazine, saying, ""The campaign""--and you were involved in a campaign--""quickly degenerated in 1984""--when this was still before you--""into a contest over who was most opposed to the plan for voluntary racial desegregation at St. Louis schools.""Mr. McNary claimed that Mr. Ashcroft had not done enough to defeat the plan in court. Mr. Ashcroft countered that Mr. McNary was a closet supporter of racial integration. Both ran openly bigoted advertisement on television.""This is what we have in terms of Gary Orfield (ph), the consultant for the court in St. Louis, a leading expert on desegregation cases, testifies against desegregation. He said that you had no positive vision, constantly stirred up racial divisions over the questions.Finally, rather than provide the conciliatory leadership, in 1990 a judicial order described the recent state filings--recent state filings--as, ""Extremely antagonistic and said that state was ignoring the real objective of this case, a better education for the city's students, to personally embark on a litigious pursuit of righteousness.""Now, that's a pretty tough record.That's a pretty tough record.Where in your priority would the rights of the interests of those black students that were trying to get a decent education? We've just heard you about what the cost was going to be, how you had a responsibility as an attorney general to protect the taxpayer. What about the interest of those black students? And the fact that you have those courts, repeatedly time, time, time again said that you failed to even offer an alternative. Did you offer an alternative?ASHCROFT: Now may I respond?KENNEDY: Sure.ASHCROFT: Thank you.In all of the cases where the court made an order, I followed the order, both as attorney general and as governor. It was my judgment that when the law was settled and spoken that the law should be obeyed.At one point, I had to detail the deputy attorney general of the state of Missouri to the state treasurer's office in order to urge the state treasurer to write the check. And the treasurer wrote the check. His name has been used in this hearing, but I won't use it. But it was because I explained to him that when the court spoke, the state had to respond and obey the law.Now, the framework for the system was that the state was to pay the city for the students who left, and the state was to pay again, in the county, for the students who had left and gone out there. It was not a way to integrate the city's schools.The facts which you specific show that the brightest students left the city, leaving the students in those schools behind with fewer people aspiring to college graduation and going on further for education, not improving those schools.I'm pleased to respond to your question about my priority for education. During my time as governor, funding for education in the state of Missouri went up about 70 percent. The vast majority of all state resources that were new and available went to education, because I believe in education.In Missouri v. Jenkins, the case in Kansas City...KENNEDY: Well, could we get on--I'm glad--I don't think we've...(CROSSTALK)HATCH: Let him answer the question.KENNEDY: All right, if he wants to take the--the question wasn't about Kansas City. I asked about St. Louis.HATCH: It was about education.ASHCROFT: Fine.KENNEDY: And if he wants to talk about Kansas City...ASHCROFT: I would like to talk about Kansas City, but it's not...(CROSSTALK)ASHCROFT: I'd rather answer your question than talk about Kansas City.KENNEDY: That isn't the question, but if you want to talk about it.ASHCROFT: Well, I'll just give you an idea...SESSIONS: You challenged his interest in education, Senator Kennedy, you suggested he didn't care about children.(CROSSTALK)LEAHY: All right, gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen.HATCH: Let him answer the question.LEAHY: First, I would note that whatever questions are asked, if the witness feels that he's not given time to answer all the questions he will be given time, as will senators be given time to do follow-up questions.KENNEDY: Well, I had one other area to cover, but whatever you want to do, John.ASHCROFT: Well, you're the senator.KENNEDY: Well, you're the...(LAUGHTER)ASHCROFT: Well, you know, I look forward to working with this committee upon confirmation, I do, and I don't know when there was last an attorney general that had previously served as a member of this committee. And, frankly, I think we can work together and I want to. I don't want any rancor to characterize our relationship, and I'm very pleased to defer.KENNEDY: Let me just go on one, hopefully, time, and this is on the questions of voter registration, vetoes, your vetoes on the voter registration. We talked about this.You know, obviously we've learned in this presidential campaign every vote does count, and obviously the procedures in Florida and across the nation, plagued by inequities, often result in disenfranchisement of poor and minority. The Justice Department is conducting the investigation whether any of the voting irregularities that occurred in Florida violating the federal Voting Rights Act. So if confirmed, you'll have a responsibility for completing the investigation and bringing suit if any violations are found.Now, your actions as governor of Missouri--I'm concerned about your willingness about where you might go with this. Now, let me mention this.As governor you appointed election boards in both St. Louis County and St. Louis city. The county which surrounds much of the city is relatively affluent, 86 percent white, votes heavily Republican. The city's poorer, 48 percent black, votes heavily Democratic.Like other communities across the state, the county election board has a standard procedure for training volunteers from nonpartisan groups, like the League of Women Voters, to assist the voter registration. And according to the press reports, the county trained as many as 1,500 volunteers, but the number of trained volunteers in the city was zero, because your appointed city board refused to follow the standard practice used in the county and throughout the rest of the state.As a result, the county had a voter registration rate higher than the state average and considerably higher than the city. Now concerned about the obvious disparity, the legislature passed bills in 1988 and '89 to require the city to use the same training procedures as the county and the rest of the state. On both occasions, you vetoed these bills.In 1988, you claimed it was unfair to impose this procedure just on the city of St. Louis, and in '89, the legislature responded by passing a bill applying the procedure to the entire state, but you vetoed it again. And you cited concerns about voter fraud, even though the Republican director of elections in the county was quoted as saying, ""It worked well here and I don't know why it wouldn't work in the city as well."" That makes sense. The only difference between the county and city is that the city is poorer, more heavily African-American, and votes Democratic.The question, rather than working to expand the right to vote, you and the appointed election board in the city did all you could to block the increased voter registration. The results of your stonewalling tactics are clear: By the time you left the governor's mansion, the city of St. Louis had the lowest voting registration in the state, 15 percent lower than St. Louis County. Eight years later, Governor Carnahan's reforms in the St. Louis city election, and now the rate for St. Louis city has increased dramatically.Why did you feel that you had to not provide the same kind of registrars in the city as you did in the county and as they did in the rest of the part of the state, particularly when those groups indicated their willingness to provide those services?ASHCROFT: Well, thank you for the question, Senator Kennedy. And let me just say, that I am concerned that all Americans have the opportunity to vote. I'm committed to the integrity of the ballot box. I know what it means to individuals who are deprived of the opportunity to vote, and I know what it means to candidates who have been the subject of elections where the integrity of the ballot box has been violated. I have personal experience in that respect.I vetoed a number of bills as governor, and, frankly, I don't say that I can remember all the details of all of them. Accordingly, I reviewed my veto message and recalled that I was urged to veto these bills by the responsible local election officials. I also appeared to anticipate the Supreme Court's recent decision, as I expressed a concern that voting procedures be unified statewide.I would like to read my relatively short veto statements from the two relevant bills. And these are statements which I made when I was governor.KENNEDY: OK.ASHCROFT: And it's quite sometime...KENNEDY: And if you could elaborate on the local officials that urged you to veto them, the reason why they did that. If you could add that, I'd appreciate it. And my time then is up.ASHCROFT: ""Conference Committee Substitute for House Bill Number 1333""--I believe it is--""is vetoed and not approved for the following reasons. The Comprehensive Election Act of 1977 was intended to simplify, clarify and harmonize the laws governing elections. Section 115.003 revised statutes of Missouri, 1988, the General Assembly has directed that the act be construed and applied so as to accomplish this purpose.""The few amendments to this law since 1977 have been acted only as necessary to further statewide policy goals. Election bills approved by the general assembly this year continue this trend by standardizing voter registration and other election procedures.""Conference Committee Substitute for House Bill 1333 stands in marked contrast to the overall trend of our election laws. It would single out one election authority and mandate for that one authority that certain procedures be followed. I see no compelling reason to impose this special requirement on the St. Louis Election Board.""There are more than 150 permanent registration sites spread throughout the city of St. Louis. Each of these sites is manned by bipartisan, board-appointed registrars and is in a public facility. Before every election, the board opens an additional 84 special registration sites manned by bipartisan registration teams at places such as shopping centers, churches and union halls. The success of the St. Louis Election Board in promoting voter registration is evidenced by the fact that the city has a registration rate of 73 percent compared to the national average of 69 percent.""I join with the proponents of this bill in encouraging the St. Louis Board of Election commissioners to review its present policy and to work to ensure that every resident has a clear opportunity to register to vote. But even as we work to increase voter registration, we must preserve the right of the voters to participate in fair elections.""The bipartisan St. Louis County Board of Election Commissioners, St. Louis Board of Aldermen President Tom Villa (ph), and St. Louis circuit attorney George Peach (ph), have expressed concerns about the impact of this bill on the democratic process and urged me to veto it.""I might add that Tom Villa (ph) was a noted Democratic leader in the state of Missouri from the city of St. Louis. The Villa (ph) family had a historic, sort of, reputation. I don't know whether some of you close to St. Louis will remember that.St. Louis circuit attorney George Peach (ph) was a Democrat who was the prosecutor in the St. Louis area, so we had a bipartisan county election board said, ""This is not good; this is not right.""You had the Democrat circuit attorney saying, ""I have reservations about this; this shouldn't be done."" You have the St. Louis Board of Aldermen president--an almost totally Democrat organization, the Board of Aldermen, City of St. Louis, is about as Democrat as the Democratic National Committee.(LAUGHTER)They all urged me to veto this bill.Now, I do think that when you look at the recent Supreme Court rulings pushing us more towards uniformity, that it's important to understand that creating and carving out special responsibilities in a variety of settings is something we shouldn't do.""The people of St. Louis,"" I went on to say, ""have an absolute and fundamental right to open, fair, and non-partisan elections. My veto of this bill today will protect that right. For the above and foregoing reasons, Conference Committee Substitute for House Bill Number 1333 is returned and not approved.""ASHCROFT: The second veto message is--I'd be happy to read another one.KENNEDY: No--Mr. Chairman, it's not necessary.The point, Senator, if I could just add and get your response and then I'll--you vetoed it because it was special legislation for St. Louis. Then, the next year the legislature said, ""OK, because you haven't done anything in St. Louis, we'll apply it statewide."" That's what I can't understand.I can see you saying, ""It's special legislation, so we won't do it for St. Louis because it's special."" Now you've just mentioned the Supreme Court wants uniformity. The state legislature said, ""OK, let's get uniformity."" And you've vetoed that as well. That's the point, if you could address that.ASHCROFT: Thank you very much. It just takes a lot longer to answer these charges than it does to make them, and I apologize for that.(LAUGHTER)LEAHY: Well, all right. Gentlemen, just a moment. I want him to answer that, but I also point out, the witness said that sometimes the charges, or the questions, come I think machine gun fashion was his expression.I can assure you, the chair will make sure that you are given time to answer all of the questions. If, when you review the transcript, there's further answers you want, you'll be given the time to respond to that. And of course, the senator asking his question can follow up. But I don't want any implication being given that you would not have a chance to answer all the questions asked.ASHCROFT: I appreciate that very much, Mr. Chairman, and I apologize if any of my remarks would indicate that you wouldn't fairly give me the opportunity to respond.This is the veto message from the next year: ""House Committee substitute for House Bill Number 200 is vetoed and not approved for the following reasons: The bill would require election authorities to permit, quote, 'any recognized non-partisan civic organization, political, fraternal, religious or service organization interested in voter registration and education to conduct registration at any reasonable place selected by the organization.' The election authority is required to have a deputy registration official present at the place. The bill provides that these deputies may be volunteers.""I encourage all qualified Missourians to register and vote in elections. I also encourage election authorities to improve voter registration efforts by keeping registration offices open for longer hours and by conducting registration drives at special registration sites.""As I noted last year, in St. Louis alone, the success of the St. Louis election board is apparent from the fact that the city has a registration rate of 73 percent, compared to the national average of 69 percent. Efforts to promote voter registration must be balanced with the need to ensure that the voters participate in fair elections. This bill would tie the hands of election authorities and give private organizations a virtually unbridled right to add names to state voter registration rolls.""As noted in a St. Louis Post-Dispatch editorial, there is no overwhelming reason to allow an individual group of any political persuasion to register people. With the numerous instances of voter fraud that the city has experienced in recent years, election officials should be cautious about their procedures. The registration apparatus must be available to everyone, but it also must be protected jealously to prevent its abuse.""The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, quote, 'Keeping Registration Fair', close quote, 'Election authorities are free to participate...""'--August 28. This was an editorial, not--I don't believe this editorial was about this specific measure. I don't want to create that impression.(LAUGHTER)LEAHY: Well, all right. Gentlemen, just a moment. I want him to answer that, but I also point out, the witness said that sometimes the charges, or the questions, come I think machine gun fashion was his expression.I can assure you, the chair will make sure that you are given time to answer all of the questions.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, quote, 'Keeping Registration Fair,' close quote.""Election authorities are free to participate...""--August 28. This was an editorial, not--I don't believe this editorial was about this specific measure. I don't want to create that impression.If it is about it, that be fine.""Election authorities are free to participate with private organizations, now, to conduct voter registration. Giving the overriding need to promote honesty and integrity in the process, I see no compelling reason to require that they do so in every instance in which a request is made.""For the above and foregoing reasons, House Committee substitute for House Bill number 200 is returned and not approved. Respectfully submitted, signed John Ashcroft, governor.""LEAHY: Senator Thurmond?THURMOND: When outgoing Attorney General Janet Reno appeared before this committee for confirmation, I expressed concerns about her opposition to the death penalty, but I still supported her. Those views did not prevent her from being confirmed. Do you think most attorney generals have had to impose some law that they did not personally support?ASHCROFT: Senator, I am virtually sure that everyone who has served in the attorney general's office has had to impose or enforce laws that he or she would not personally support.The definition of personal support is almost inconsistent with laws, because laws are compromises of what people decide to do in the legislative process where we have a give-and-take in terms of what's finally achieved. So very seldom is there any law that's identical to the way any of us would write it completely.So law enforcement officers uniformly, not just those in uniform, but those uniformly across the board, I think, always have to enforce laws that they wouldn't personally have written.THURMOND: During much of the Clinton administration, the number of gun prosecutioners declined. For example, I single out prosecutions for using a gun to commit a felony dropped 46 percent from 1992 to 1998. As attorney general, will you expand successful gun prosecution initiatives, like Project Exile, and make imposing gun laws a priority?ASHCROFT: I would hope that we would be able to more effectively enforce the laws relating to guns.From the data that I have seen out of Project Exile and other efforts around the country, we have a far greater and more dramatic impact on violent crime by enforcing gun laws than we do in many other efforts that we make to try and improve the personal security and safety of our citizens.As a matter of fact, in the last couple of years, I've sought additional appropriations when a member of the Senate to fund a similar program in St. Louis--a program which I think is entitled Project Cease Fire. But it's similarly a focus on saying to those who use guns in the commission of a crime, ""You can't do that with impunity, and we will make sure that if you use a gun in the commission of a crime, you will regret it.""In Project Exile, the remediation and the rates of crime was very, very dramatic, and it seems to be a promising program that ought to be explored further. I think enforcement of gun laws holds great promise.And incidentally, I might add that, as attorney general of the United States, obviously I would be interested in advancing the agenda of the president when possible. And he has stated clearly his attention to have more vigorous and energetic prosecution of gun crime.THURMOND: As a senator, you were very dedicated to the war on drugs. For example, you successfully led the fight to pass major drug legislation to combat the methamphetamine epidemic. As attorney general, would you continue that commitment to fight illegal drugs?ASHCROFT: Well, Senator, I think the illegal drugs are a mark and a stain on America, but they are a mark against the young people of this country that makes very difficult their success in the future, and I would hope I would have an opportunity to have an energetic enforcement of the drug laws in this country in a way which would curtail drug use. And I would hope we would be able to lead in such a way as to make it possible for young people to look to national officials and to the, kind of, atmosphere we create as one that rejects drug use.In the methamphetamine laws, which I had the privilege of working closely with members of this committee on, including Senator Biden and Senator Feinstein, we did a couple of things that were important. We took methamphetamine, which people had not taken seriously, and we put very serious penalties into the law.I think it was important that we put penalties in the law that were on a parity with the penalties for cocaine, because too often people thought that methamphetamine was not an important or challenging thing, and we needed to have an opportunity to make sure that we signalled our disapproval and the danger that these dangerous drugs really present to our young people.THURMOND: A great deal of attention is focused on the rights of criminals, but we do not hear as much about the rights of victims. Nevertheless, you have been a leader for victims' rights. Should crime victims be a top concern for the Justice Department?ASHCROFT: Indeed, they should. I had the privilege of being involved in signing victims' rights legislation in the state of Missouri, and I was eager to find a way to have a national program for victims' rights legislation, because too often technical problems relating to minor conflicts between the federal system and the state system made impossible an effective use of the state's victims' rights legislation to protect the interests of individuals who have been victims of crime.THURMOND: You have been endorsed by numerous law enforcement organizations, including the Fraternal Order of Police and the National Association of Chiefs of Police and the National Sheriffs' Association. Is it important for the attorney general to work closely with state and local law enforcement, including rural law enforcement?ASHCROFT: Well, it certainly is important.One of the things about methamphetamine that struck me in the state of Missouri is that it tended to be a rural drug. It wasn't as focused in our city centers, where drugs like cocaine were prevalent, but in the out-state portions of Missouri, the methamphetamine production in a variety of labs--and I'm sorry to say that Missouri is second only to California in terms of meth labs that were taken down.It exploded on our state. There were two meth labs taken down in 1992; there were about 1,000 taken down last year in the state. And many more--I talked to one county sheriff who was in what we call a collar county around St. Louis where he said that his sheriff's department would take down 200 meth labs in that one county during the year.And at the same time I met with that sheriff, there were five or six small city police chiefs from that same county, and they said they would break down another 100. So there you have one county with 300 meth labs in a single year. It's a very serious problem. And it is in rural America. And our ability to provide assistance through HIDTAs and other programs in the Justice Department can help curtail this very serious threat.LEAHY: I'll put in the record a number of statements of others so that we can have a chance--one, so that the witness can have a chance, if he wishes to add to his answers, to do so in the transcript; but so those who asked a question would have also a chance to see that.We will recess now. We will reconvene in the Senate Caucus Room in the Russell Building, third floor of the Russell Building, tomorrow morning at 10:00.SESSIONS: Mr. Chairman, we have leave to file a written statement? May I have leave to file a written statement?LEAHY: Oh, of course. Of course. All senators would.Citation: George W.

The first West Wing office was Theodore Roosevelt's office, which was a conventional rectangular room in the location of the current Roosevelt Room . In 1909, William Howard Taft had the West Wing expanded and extensively remodeled. He located the chief executive's office in the middle of the building and changed its shape to oval, like the Blue Room in the White House. Furnishing it were silk velvet curtains and a checkerboard floor made of mahajua wood from the Philippines. Caribou hide tacked with brass studs covered the chairs in the room. President Taft chose the olive green color scheme.For President Taft, an oval office may have symbolized his view of the modern-day president. Taft intended to be the center of his administration, and by creating the Oval Office in the center of the West Wing, he was more involved with the day-to-day operation of his presidency than were his recent predecessors. ( Clinton Birthplace Museum)When the West Wing caught fire in 1929, the original Oval Office was gutted. It was rebuilt, but Franklin Roosevelt chose to renovate and further expand the West Wing to accommodate additional staff in 1933. He moved the Oval Office to the southeast corner for better light, a higher ceiling (there is no second story over the modern Oval Office or the Cabinet Room), and easier travel back and forth to the Residence. Since its completion in 1934, the modern Oval Office has changed very little except in its furnishings.HeritageOver the years Americans developed a sentimental attachment to the Oval Office through memorable images. Television broadcasts from the Oval Office, such as President Reagan's speech following the Challenger explosion, would leave lasting impressions in the minds of Americans of both the office and its occupant.Each president has decorated the Oval Office to suit his tastes. Among the features that remain constant are the white marble mantel from the original 1909 Oval Office, the presidential seal in the ceiling, and the two flags behind the president's desk—the US flag and the president's flag. President George W Bush has selected several paintings depicting Texas scenes by Texas artists for his office. Many are on loan from museums in San Antonio and El Paso.The President's DeskMany presidents have used the famous Resolute desk in the Oval Office. This desk was made from wood taken from the ship HMS Resolute and was given to President Rutherford Hayes by Queen Victoria of England in 1880.More ImagesComputer recreation of George W Bush's Oval Office ( Google Sketchup - Pete Sharkey)George W Bush meeting with rock star and AIDS activist Bono in 2005 (White House - Eric Draper)George W Bush commemorating the Americans with Disabilities Act in Oval Office in 2005 (White House - Eric Draper)The Clinton Oval Office, circa 1996 (Clinton Library)George HW Bush and members of his staff at work Oval Office, circa 1992 (Bush Library)George HW Bush and members of his staff at work Oval Office, circa 1990 ( NARA - Bush Library)George HW Bush and members of his staff at work Oval Office, circa 1990 ( NARA - Bush Library)Ronald Reagan wraps up some business on his last day office in 1989 (Reagan Library)Replica of the Reagan Oval Office in the Reagan LibraryThe Reagan Oval Office in 1981 (using the Ford-Carter decor) ( Reagan Library )Jimmy Carter meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir in 1977 ( NARA - Carter Library)The Carter Oval Office in 1977 (Carter used Ford's final decor) ( NARA - Carter Library)Reproduction of the Ford Oval Office in the Ford LibraryGerald Ford in the Oval Office, circa 1974 (still using Nixon's decor) (Ford Library)Richard Nixon with comedian and golf-enthusiast Bob Hope in 1973 ( NARA )Richard Nixon talking with the Apollo 11 astronauts in 1969 (NARA)The Oval Office in 1969, with Johnson's decor and Nixon's desk (White House Historical Association)Replica of the Johnson Oval Office, circa 1966, in the Johnson Library ( Daniel Stout )President Johnson meeting with Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara in 1967 ( Johnson Library - Yoichi Okamoto)The Johnson Oval Office, temporarily using the final Kennedy rug and curtains but with LBJ's desk (White House Historical Society)The new Kennedy Oval Office in 1963, completed while the first couple was visiting Dallasand dismantled after the assassination, before Mrs. Kennedy returned (Kennedy Library)The new Kennedy Oval Office in 1963; note JFK's footrest to ease his back pain (Kennedy Library)John Kennedy in the Oval Office, 1961 (still using the Truman/Eisenhower decor) ( NARA - Kennedy Library)The modern Oval Office in 1947, famous for Truman's ""The Buck Stops Here"" sign (Truman Library)A recreation of Truman's Oval Office at the Truman Library (Truman Library)Truman Oval Office in 1946, with Roosevelt decor ( NARA )Truman Oval Office in 1945, with portraits of FDR, Simón Bolívar , and George Washington ( Truman Library )Close-up of the Roosevelt valance ( NARA )Franklin Roosevelt's first modern Oval Office, circa 1936 ( Library of Congress - Theodor Horydczak)Franklin Roosevelt with secretary Missy Le Hand, circa 1935 ( White House [Roosevelt Library])Aftermath of the Christmas Eve fire in the old West Wing, 1929 (Library of Congress)The original Oval Office in 1923 (the black crepe memorializes President Harding) ( Library of Congress )The original Oval Office circa 1923 (probably taken at the same time as the one above) ( Library of Congress )The original Oval Office, circa 1910Hand-tinted photo of the William Howard Taft's original Oval Office in the center of the West Wing, circa 1909 ( White House Historical Association )Hand-tinted photo of Theodore Roosevelt's original West Wing office in 1904 (now the Roosevelt Room ),The new Oval Office flooring, 2005 ( Rode Bros.

However, Dwight Eisenhower was an avid golfer and destroyed the floor with his golf spikes. Lyndon Johnson had the floor replaced in the mid-1960s with wood-grain linoleum. In 1982, fed up with the linoleum floor, Ronald Reagan had the floor replaced by the same contractors who had put the floor into his ranch in California with white pine and oak in a wagon-wheel pattern. In August of 2005, the floor was replaced again under George W Bush in almost exactly the same pattern as the Reagan floor.Most presidents have commissioned a new rug and drapes, but two presidents chose not to change the decor: Eisenhower and Carter. Kennedy's new decor was just being installed the day he was assassinated.President"		0

Decide for yourself what you see and how this will influence the viewpoints of children:In another video the recent knife murder of a young German girl by an Afghan migrant is downplayed as a romantic drama. It is another form of propaganda that ignores dangerous honour crimes within Muslim communities. Instead it focuses on the “dangers” of right-wing viewpoints and demonstrations. 		1

False	['veal']	http://www.tractorsupply.com/	http://www.tractorsupply.com/know-how_pets-livestock_cattle_calf-housing-and-management	2016/03/30	We do not share this information with anyone. For details,please view our Privacy PolicyCalf Housing and ManagementBaby calves need adequate nutrition, housing and other types of care to grow into a healthy and productive adult cow or bull. It helps to have a good understanding of best calf management practices and how each practice benefits both the calves and you as a livestock owner.Here are some quick tips for properly caring for calves:Keep young calves separated until they are weaned. Once a calf has been weaned and if a calf is healthy and disease-free, release the calf into the herd.Sanitize calf pens, hutches, waterers and buckets before introducing a new calf into a previously-occupied space.Work with your local ag extension service to develop a biosecurity plan for proper herd management.Separate Housing for CalvesCattle enjoy being part of a herd, and they often feel isolated and threatened when they become separated from the herd. Despite this, it is a best calf management procedure to keep young calves housed separately from one another and from the herd until they are weaned. This is to protect the calf from becoming infected by any type of contagious outbreak within the herd or from another calf. It is also to keep the rest of the herd protected from any type of contagion that could be transmitted by the calf.A calf may not enjoy being isolated from its peers; however having separate living quarters for young calves is an important part of herd management. To reduce anxiety in isolated calves, place single calf pens close enough together so that calves can hear or even see each other without having nose-to-nose contact.There are two types of single calf housing options, including calf hutches and indoor pens.Calf HutchesCalf hutches are not only the most popular form of housing for calves, but they also enable proper herd management. In the case of a contagious outbreak, calf hutches can be easily moved or re-organized, allowing for more flexibility in your biosecurity plan. Often made of Fiberglas or plastic, calf hutches can be easily cleaned and sanitized. Most commercially-available calf hutches have bottle and bucket racks built in. Calf hutches should be placed in a well-drained area and secured with stakes so the hutch can withstand heavy winds. Place the hutch with the opening facing south to ensure the calf will have the warmest and most secure environment possible.Indoor Pens and Livestock BarnsMany livestock owners keep calves in single pens inside a barn. Barns should be well-lit and have good ventilation. Livestock owners should keep barns and pens as sanitary as possible, especially when keeping calves. This will help reduce the chances of a contagious outbreak.One disadvantage to keeping calves in a single pen inside of a barn is that, in the case of a disease outbreak, pens are not easily moved and there is less space to work.Regardless of which calf housing option you choose, it is always good to provide the calf with an area of at least 12-16 square feet. Line the entire area with a thick layer of bedding to keep the calf warm, comfortable, clean and dry. Lay down an extra layer of straw on top of the calf's bedding to insulate from colder weather. Completely replace bedding and sanitize the stall when a new calf is introduced to the hutch or pen. If possible, allow the hutch or pen to sit empty for a month or two prior to introducing a new calf into the same space to prevent the spread of disease.How to Reduce Stress among Calves Transitioning to Group HousingOnce a calf has been weaned, it is almost ready to release into the herd. Weaning is usually a stressful time for a calf because the calf is used to suckling, and how it has nothing to suckle. Newly weaned calves will suckle just about anything they can get their mouths on, and this increases the chance of spreading disease. For this reason, it is recommended that cattle owners wait a few days after weaning to release a calf into the herd or into group housing. This will help reduce stress in the calf as well as give you time to introduce new feeds and feeding equipment. Introduce the calf into a small group of 3 or 4 calves that are similar in size and age and watch the PRICE CUTFor a limited time save even more.STORE LOCATORFind a store near you.Store Locator By City or StateStore Locator By City or StateORStore Locator By Zip CodeEnter a valid 5 digit zip codeEnter a Valid City		0
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/strange-signals-are-probably-extraterrestrial/	two scientists who analyzed 2.5 million stars have concluded that the signals coming from a small fraction of them are “probably” caused by aliens.	Mostly False	['extraterrestrials', ' seti']	https://arxiv.org/	https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03031	2016/10/25	Astrophysics > Solar and Stellar AstrophysicsTitle: Discovery of peculiar periodic spectral modulations in a small fraction of solar type starsAuthors: E.F. Borra , E. Trottier(Submitted on 10 Oct 2016)Abstract: A Fourier transform analysis of 2.5 million spectra in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey was carried out to detect periodic spectral modulations. Signals having the same period were found in only 234 stars overwhelmingly in the F2 to K1 spectral range. The signals cannot be caused by instrumental or data analysis effects because they are present in only a very small fraction of stars within a narrow spectral range and because signal to noise ratio considerations predict that the signal should mostly be detected in the brightest objects, while this is not the case. We consider several possibilities, such as rotational transitions in molecules, rapid pulsations, Fourier transform of spectral lines and signals generated by Extraterrestrial Intelligence (ETI). They cannot be generated by molecules or rapid pulsations. It is highly unlikely that they come from the Fourier transform of spectral lines because too many strong lines located at nearly periodic frequencies are needed. Finally we consider the possibility, predicted in a previous published paper, that the signals are caused by light pulses generated by Extraterrestrial Intelligence to makes us aware of their existence. We find that the detected signals have exactly the shape of an ETI signal predicted in the previous publication and are therefore in agreement with this hypothesis. The fact that they are only found in a very small fraction of stars within a narrow spectral range centered near the spectral type of the sun is also in agreement with the ETI hypothesis. However, at this stage, this hypothesis needs to be confirmed with further work. Although unlikely, there is also a possibility that the signals are due to highly peculiar chemical compositions in a small fraction of galactic halo stars.		0

True	['martha raye', ' uso', ' vietnam']	http://www.colonelmaggie.com/	http://www.colonelmaggie.com/vets.htm	2012/08/30	"This page was last updated on 20 January 2016. You are listening to the very familiar sound of""Taps"" as a tribute to Maggie. Although Maggie was not actually in themilitary, after she died on 19 October 1994 she was buried at Fort Bragg, NC and received an almost completemilitary funeral. The only things lacking were the playing of ""Taps""and a squad firing volleys. Members of the Special Forces, the 82nd Airborne, the Special ForcesAssociation, and Special Operations Association, along with hundreds of on-lookers were at thecemetery for her funeral. AND I was among them. BUT to liven things up a bit--here you will meet some of the Veterans who knew and loved Maggie. She served our country well through three wars but you seldom heard about whatshe did. Here you can see some of the photos our troops have sent me. Click on the pictures to see them better if you wish. LTC W.A. ""Tony"" Funderburg, USA SF (Ret) informed me he had been with Maggie and Frenchy at the 1988 SFA Convention banquet in Fayetteville, NC. Here is his photo with Maggie and his wife Pam. One of the many men who met Maggie sent me some photos of her that were taken on 11 September 1971 as she was departing Fort Bragg in Fayetteville, NC. She had been there during the 10th Anniversary of the 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne) celebration. Standing next to Maggie is her escort--then CPT Duncan ""Pete"" Thompson, now retired COL Thompson still looks just as good and is still a chic-magnet. Firstup is a photo that was donated by Kenneth Roberts. It is one of my favorite photos ofMaggie that was taken in Vietnam. This truck became well known in the BanMeThout area in 1971. Photo was actually taken by Chris Crain! Thanks Chris for letting me know who actually took it--I look forward to receiving more photos from you! Maggie got around by many modes of transportation during the various wars. Thispicture became her favorite way to travel--on board a chopper. Photo donated by John Mitchell and taken in AnLoc in 1969. The next picture was sent to me by Tom ""Stumpy"" Burke. It'shim, Maggie, and Neil Coady at the II Corps Mike Force ""Yard"" villagenear Pleiku in 1969. The next two photos are a bit scratchy but still show Maggie's caring for ourtroops. These photos were emailed to me by Bob Waller who said they were takenin late 1968 or early 1969 at the 5th Special Forces Group C-Team Officers Clubin DaNang. The photo on the left includes L-R: USAF FAC LTC Ralph Albrightbehind the bar, and unknown soldier smoking, LT Bill Glendenning, Maggie, and LTBob Waller. The picture on the right was taken the same night and that's Maggienext to LT Bob Waller. In 1968 T/SGT Jeffrey Saddlemire had the absolute pleasure of being selected to present Maggie with flowers at the end of a USO show. He will never forget meeting ""what a very sweet lady she was"" at Tuy Hoa. He stated that ""God has a special place in heaven for people like her. Rest in Peace job well done Maggie!"" Maggie visited many units. One stop was on 2 November 1968 in DucCo. There she posed with CSM Guy Sullivan (on the left) and SP4 Kelley from the 1st Bn, 35th Infantry, 4th Infantry Division. Maggie flew into LZCenter (Hill 348), about 40 miles Southwest of DaNang, in 1968 to visit members of theAmerical Division's 3/21 Light Infantry, Company D--a.k.a. Black Death. Thisphoto was submitted by Robert Boyd Jr. He is standing in the back on the rightand his friend ""Beard"" is in the front holding his helmet upside down. Beard's helmet was spotted by Maggie when she saw the words ""F*** THEARMY"" written on it. Click on it to see the whole picture better! Recently Larry Henderson wrote saying that the soldier to Maggie's left is Clarence W ""Chief"" Stoneroad from Oklahoma. Larry was working at the time in the bunker at the right rear of the photo. He said her visit was greatly appreciated by all the guys there. Whenevershe saw a soldier, sailor, airman, marine, or coast guardsman without a StChristopher medal--she would hand him or her a brand new one. She got them fromChaplin CPT Michael Ortiz who donated this picture taken of him with her in 1968while they were in NhaTrang. Like most of the Senior NCO, who roamed Smoke Bomb Hill, I had heard of Maggie, as she was fondly known, by the SF Community, yet I had never met her. However, during the New Years Season of December 1967-January 1968, ST New Jersey, which I was the One Zero, from FOB1 was on special duty, operating from FOB2, due to the weather in the northern area of operation. While there, we learned that Maggie was planning on sharing New Years with us, so we all gathered at the Club and awaited her arrival. Unlike the majority of the population of the FOB, my choice of alcohol was Smirnoff Vodka. So, when Maggie walked in I handed her a Vodka on the rocks, and we hit it off right on, except the Lady called me a candy ass for using a mix (7up) with my drink. Oh well, can't win them all, but we sat there shooting the shit and drinking the best alcohol, until after midnight. (Regrettably, there were no pictures of Maggie and I because I was still in the old fashioned Spook and SF mode of animosity, so it was by surprise when my picture was taken. Following this three month trip we returned to FOB1, and in May 1968, I returned to CONUS and a very boring stay on Smoke Bomb Hill, with B Company, 7th SFGA. Sometime in August or September, I called Mrs. ""A"" [see the links page to learn more about this woman] and asked her if she could get me back to FOB1, and she told me that wouldn't be any problem at all, just watch my mail box. Sometime in September, I received orders assigning me to HHC 5th SFGA, attached to C&C Command, DaNang, RVN for duty with FOB1. However, upon my arrival at C&C, I was informed that FOB1 had too many E8 on hand, and FOB2 didn't have but one, so that was where I was heading. Upon arriving at FOB2, I held various assignments, however, at the peak of the New Year of 1968-69, I was the First Sergeant of the FOB Security Company, and upon notification that Maggie was planning on making an appearance to bring in the New Year with us. Those who had been there the previous year remembered my encounter, with Maggie and I was advised to ""handle it."" Captain Bobby Evens was the Security Company Commander, and we had handled a few items previously, so we was prepared. However, come the time that Maggie was supposed to make her appearance, we received a phone call from the 4th ID, which was ""down the road a piece."" In the conversation, we learned that she was being held hostage by the Legs at the 4th, so............we dispatched a couple jeeps with .50 caliber guns on them, to return with Maggie, and no one else. Upon arrival, the MPs at the gate advised that the camp was under shutdown, due to am impending attack by the VC. The Senior NCO on the gate was asked how he would like to have his gate shot all to shit, and to get the OD down there right away. Fortunately, none of us wore ID, nor rank, and although these guys knew where we came from they didn't know who we were, so we acted accordingly, and after a few threats, and Maggie telling the Senior Officer in her presence, that she was taking off with us, we departed to the FOB, and continued to party with Maggie. Bobby and I had a few other encounters with fate, but all in all, this tour was a piece of cake as far as I was concerned, and the second visit with Maggie, was another highlight of my life. Back in the states, only this time with B Company, 10th SFGA, Fort Devens, MA, sometime in 1971, I think it was, Post HQs and Group HQs learned that Maggie was to make an appearance at Fort Devens, and wanted to have one of the ""Boys from the Tenth"" to be her escort, not some leg from Post HQ. The word was put out to the Company's to find out who knew Maggie........................no one in the Officer Grade, so I expressed my association with Maggie and the Company Sergeant Major said: ""OK Ringland, you are the Colonel's escort."" That told me two things, one that I was the only one in the Group that knew or had met Maggie, and two, that the ""SMage"" had never even seen nor met Maggie. The first thing that I did was hit the Class VI on the way home and pick up two bottles of Smirnoff to add to the ones already in the cabinet. Be it far above the Lords in Heaven, Maggie never made the trip. Shortly prior to her departure from her Team House, in California, Maggie was stricken with one of her several liver/kidney attacks, which, years later led to her demise. Maggie was, to the best of my knowledge, the God Mother of Special Forces, and Mrs. Billye ""Mrs. 'A'"" Alexander [see the links page to learn more about this woman], the Special Forces Patriarch Angel. With one major regret of having never met ""Mrs.A,"" so I'll have to live with the pleasure of having talked with her on the phone. May both these Ladies who took special interest in we, the wearers of the Girl Scout Beanie, AKA: The Green Beret, rest in peace under the outstretched arms of our Lord God, in Heaven, forever. ...Jim Ringland, AKA: Ringo. In 1967 Maggie ran into some soldiers while she was in Saigon. These two photos show Maggie at that time being interviewed by (then) SP4 Dick Ellis at AFVN. Photos by (then) SP5 David Lavender. GeorgeMassey saw her in DucHoa in 1967. He was a Captain then but she was an honoraryLieutenant Colonel. George donated this photo. Don Guzman recently sent me this photo of Maggie in Vietnam partaking of Vietnamese Rice Wine. CPT Richard J ""Griffy"" Griffith, USAR was originally from Detroit, MI but now lives in Free Soil, MI. In December 1967 he piloted Maggie around from Pleiku to Kontum and places in between to visit SF camps. They would go to 2 or 3 camps per day and spend the night at the last one of the day. He even recalled that he flew Maggie to Saigon where she treated his flight crew to dinner at the Myercord Hotel. Griffy was a captain at the time with the 57th Assault Helicopter Co in Kontum. He recalls that Maggie could drink and play cards with the best of them! Griffy can't recall the names of the folks in these photos--maybe you can help him. He does know the LTC was the CO for the SF in II Corps in the Central Highlands. The MAJ was his S-2. If you can help identify any of the folks in these pictures that he took please let me and Griffy know. This photo was taken at A-Team A-412 and shows Maggie with (then) 2LT John W. Carney, Jr. a.k.a. Blackjack. Martha Raye and John Wayne were both scheduled to arrive at Ap Bac at different dates and times according to my father. Martha Raye showed up on this day, shortly after the bar had been dedicated at AP BAC, Martha arrived. She helicoptered into this small landing pad at A-413Alpha. It was somewhere between 10:00AM and 12:00PM. Raye visited for a couple of hours then she had to go, it was the afternoon toward 12:00pm that she departed and that night was a scheduled classified operation with the Chu Hoi, so everyone needed rest. She had come from other camps and left AP BAC for other camps. Dad had a radio man named ""Winfrey"". John Wayne radioed in to ""Winfrey"" who handed the radio over the receiver to my father, being the senior officer in camp and said over the radio, he was sorry that he couldn't come in; Wayne: ""They wouldn't let me come in there because of Enemy Activity at your location."" were the words my Dad could recount. Raye had just been there; however. After that, he said the perception was that Martha Raye had more balls than any John Wayne would ever. Ap Bac was a hot area recording a high enemy KIA rate for the area and time. Some time after the Raye visit, A-413 or BTT (Binh Tinh Tan), General H. K. Johnson, U.S. Army Chief of staff personally came up to see them in Nov 67 for Thanksgiving. He came to AP BAC because Stonecipher recorded high KIA numbers there and thought it would be good for the General to land there. Ap Bac (in BTT) was the first time that a US Army Chief of Staff fired an AK47 and the one of the rare times if not the first that a Lieutenant assumed command of an A-Team (Capt O'Toole was killed in action as the previous A-Team Commander of A411) We have another photo of my father assisting the General in firing this captured weapon. (A-Team: A411 Alpha 2d Lieutenant John W. Thenext picture was taken at VungTau, Viet Nam in 1967 around January or February. Retired COL John ""Jay"" Baker was assigned to the 535th Troop CarrierSquadron and their primary mission was to supply Green Beret outposts withwhatever they needed. The Air Force's C-7A Caribou (formerly the ArmyCV-2 ) was the aircraft used for these missions. They also ferried aroundUSO tour groups including Jonathan Winters, Nancy Sinatra, as well as MarthaRaye to name a few. One of the pilots (AJ Stinson) who was providing Maggie transportationthat day coaxed her into spending a few hours at their contract quarters in VungTau. They had constructed a small Officers Club in the quarters. Jay believesMaggie really enjoyed the peace and quiet associated with their club. There wereonly a few members of the 535th there that day to ask her questions and the guysprovided free drinks. Maggie had brought along her guitarist and she sang a fewsongs. One Jay particularly remembers was ""Satin Doll."" He was a firstlieutenant at the time and felt honored to have had the chance to spend the timehe did with her. In the photo, which was actually taken in the Bong Lai Hotel,L-R are Don Stallard, Maggie, Jay Baker, Bill Hodge, and AJ Stinson. I'd like to thank Jay for allowing me to post his photo here. Late 1966 CW4 Dennis Pisseri USAR (Ret) was a sailor onboard the USS Stormes (DD-780) when Maggie came onto the ship. Dennis even sent some photos of himself--hoping maybe someone recognizes and remembers him. Left to right is Dennis in 1966, near one of the ships in 1966, in his Army uniform in 1991 and more recently in 2008. Next is a picture I recently received from DenisChicoine. He met Maggie in Kontum, Vietnam in December 1966. ByChristmas time 1965 she was singing on stage at the NhaTrang ""Playboy Club""and John Sullivan snapped and donated this photo. Hereisa picture of Maggie with some Marines in ChuLai in June 1965. Gil Woodside donatedthis picture to me--he is kneeling on the bottom right side of the picture. While I have many stories of the things she did in Korea--no onehas yet donated any photos of her there--so come on folks--lets see some! AfterWW II Maggie went to Grafenwohr, Germany where she entertained more troops during the BerlinAirlift. Maggie first went to Frankfort, Germany in July 1948. She entertained troops at the Rhein-Main Air Base who were taking part in""Operation Vittles"" flying in food and medicine to Berlin. HenryCompton took these two photos which appeared in Stars and Stripes. Oneof the last places Maggie went to was North Africa. Sheate what the troops ate, slept where they slept and endured the same things theydid. This photo (donated by the 2nd Armored Division Museum, Fort Hood, TX)shows Maggie in 1942 preparing to get her food in the chow line somewhere in theCork Forest in North Africa with members of the 2AD. In 1942 Maggie went overseas with three other entertainers. Their adventures were written about and made into a movie called ""FourJills in a Jeep."" The photo on the left was taken in England--left to rightis Maggie, an unknown soldier, Kay Francis and Mitzi Mayfair. It was donated bythe Special Forces Association. The photo on the right shows Maggie signing anautograph on the back of MAJ Glen Hubbard while he shakes hands with CaroleLandis in Biskra, North Africa. This picture was donated by Fred Wise. Shewas one of the first to entertain our soldiers. Here she is dancing to the musicof SGT Orlando George of the 198th Coast Artillery from Delaware at Camp Uptonin New York.

""He has obvious dealings with Russia. There’s so many things he’s doing that are unconstitutional. How are we going to get him out?”Hinting she might know more than she is able to let on, Ms Feinstein, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, replied: “We have a lot of people looking into this. I think he’s going to get himself out.”She went on to cite several potential conflicts of interests surrounding the Trump business empire, but she declined to say whether she thought the President had done anything that was worthy of impeachment.“I can’t answer that right now,” she said. Democrat discusses impeaching Donald Trump in House of RepresentativesReferencing recent trips to Dubai by Mr Trump’s sons, Donald Jr and Eric, where they opened a new golf club, she said: “I think sending sons to another country to make a financial deal for his company and then have that covered with Government expenses, I believe those Government expenses should not be allowed.“We’re working on a bill that would do that now ... We’re working on a couple of bills that would deal with conflicts of interest.”Ms Feinstein is not the first to suggest the billionaire tycoon may decide to quit the White House of his own volition.Left-wing film-maker and social commentator Michael Moore – who predicted Mr Trump would win the election, went on to incorrectly suggest he could quit before his inauguration.Devin Nunes: ""Let me be clear. We know there was not a wiretap on Trump Tower""Intelligence boss says one member of Trump administration being probedSeveral commentators have predicted Mr Trump will be impeached at some point, including Allan Litchmann, dubbed the “Prediction Professor” after he correctly called every US election since 1984. Richard Nixon is the only US President in history to have resigned before his certain impeachment over the Watergate scandal.Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were impeached by the House of Representatives but both were acquitted by the Senate."		1

Fountain / NYT via ReduxAmong the heroes of Hurricane Harvey have been hundreds of volunteer boaters, members of the so-called Cajun Navy and other similar groups, who have patrolled the flooded streets of Houston in their own boats, pulling stranded families off of roofs and bringing them to shelter. Along the Gulf Coast, where hurricanes happen every year, the tradition of citizen boat rescue goes back generations, but a more modern form of the practice developed last August, during a spate of catastrophic floods around Baton Rouge, Louisiana, when people in danger began posting messages seeking help on a Cajun Navy Facebook page. A man named Shawn Boudreaux eventually convinced everyone to start using a walkie-talkie app called Zello, which gave the operation some organization and ability to scale. This week, Boudreaux, who works banquets at fancy New Orleans hotels, was in Lake Charles, Louisiana, a hundred and fifty miles east of Houston, helping to prepare local boaters for a wing of Harvey that materialized only after the storm pummelled Texas. He spent much of what spare time he had on Zello, monitoring the volunteer rescue efforts across the state line. The Cajun Navy had expanded, and the size of this spontaneous, self-organizing response, and the sacrifices of the citizen volunteers, he told me by phone, “was pretty amazing to see.”Harvey is now ebbing. The sun is out in Houston. And the stories of the storm are consolidating, much as they did following the floods last year in Baton Rouge, around the failures of the government’s preparations and response to the disaster, and the successes of private individuals’ rescue efforts. The news on Thursday morning is of two large explosions at a chemical plant northeast of Houston. Last year, the Houston Chronicle published a series of articles about the vulnerabilities of the city’s chemical industry and the ways in which the industry’s lobbyists had defeated the Obama Administration’s regulatory efforts. (One part of the investigation was titled “An Industry Left to Police Itself.”) Harvey, like other great Gulf Coast storms of recent years, has also made clear the insufficiency of the National Flood Insurance Program, which is designed to manage building in flood-prone areas but which has wound up encouraging vast development in areas too risky for private insurers to support. The hurricane’s destruction has, as well, underscored the insufficiency of Houston’s city planning (“ Boomtown, Flood Town ” was the title of a prescient report last year by the Texas Tribune and ProPublica) and the inadequacy of the reservoirs built to manage flooding (“ If the Addicks and Barker Dams Fail ” was the headline of a sharp Houston Press report published five years ago). Behind everything, escalating the stakes, is the willful ignorance of climate change that many local and national political leaders still cling to. In contrast to this, the actions of the Cajun Navy and other groups are celebrated. The heroism of the boaters is so vivid and so moving that it obscures the most important question about them: Why are they so needed in the first place?This winter, I spent time in Denham Springs, Louisiana, at the home of a woman named Teressa Bell, who is in her seventies and lives with her daughter Donna. Donna has been a quadriplegic since the age of fifteen, when she was in a car accident. One morning last August, when a historic accumulation of rain caused the nearby Amite River to surge, the ground floor of the Bells’ home filled up with water, nearly to the ceiling, in the course of an hour. Teressa and her son carried Donna up to the second floor and laid her at the top of the stairs, on a sheet, where she laid her head against the floor and watched the water rising, step by step. She heard the floodwaters pull the refrigerator from the wall and throw it around the kitchen. A friend of the Bells contacted a boater named Kevin Lawson, who was out trying to help people, and asked him to check on the Bells. He arrived, and pulled Donna, wrapped in a sheet, off the second-floor landing of the house, just as the flood was on the verge of swallowing it.Of the hundred and fifty thousand Louisiana homes that were washed out by the great rains of 2016, the vast majority–eighty-two per cent—were not insured against floods. The Bells’ home was in this majority. When I met the family this winter, their house was stripped to the studs, moldy and uninhabitable, and their damaged belongings were being held in a little trailer in the driveway. The Bells themselves were living in a white trailer supplied by FEMA (after storms, the agency deposits them on the lawns of the flooded, like condolence boxes), which they were entitled to use for only eighteen months. They did not know what they would do after FEMA took the trailer back. They had exhausted the generosity of family and friends, and their house, which represented much of their savings, was worth much less than it had been—the market was saturated with similarly damaged properties. They had been rescued, but, like many others in the Baton Rouge area, they were, in deeper ways, still stranded.After the floods, the Cajun Navy became heroes in Baton Rouge. Newspapers celebrated them; they were the grand marshals of local parades; the lieutenant governor of Louisiana took a special interest in their project. There were hundreds of families like the Bells, who felt that they owed their safety not to the distant forces of government but to a neighbor who had put himself at risk to help them. There was a social elegance in the idea that working-class families were rescued by working-class heroes in boats, in episodes that not always, but sometimes, cut across racial lines. “Floodwaters don’t discriminate,” was a slogan that circulated after the Baton Rouge floods.At the time, the Baton Rouge floods seemed like they might trigger a greater awakening to the chaos of climate change. Now they seem a prelude to Harvey. In Texas, too, there has been devastation, and then heroism, and there will be, surely, a longer-gestating devastation to come. There is a cyclic pattern to the erosion of faith in government, in which politics saps the state’s capacity to protect people, and so people put their trust in other institutions (churches; self-organizing volunteer navies), and are more inclined to support anti-government politics. The stories of the storm and the navies exist on a libertarian skeleton. Through them, a particular idea of how society might be organized is coming into view.Benjamin Wallace-Wells began contributing to The New Yorker in 2006, and joined the magazine as a staff writer in 2015.

First, after a man from the United Arab Emirates who was in Ohio for medical treatment was falsely accused of being a terrorist because he was speaking Arabic on the phone, the U.A.E. cautioned its citizens to avoid traditional dress abroad ""to ensure their safety."" Now, the U.A.E. has been joined by Bahrain and the Bahamas, both of whom issued travel warnings over the weekend. On Twitter, Bahrain's embassy in Washington, D.C. wrote, ""Please be cautious of protests or crowded areas occurring around the US,"" and listed emergency contact numbers for the embassy. The government of the Bahamas issued a statement as well: ""The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Immigration has taken note of the recent tensions in some American cities over shootings of young black males by police officers. We wish to advise all Bahamians traveling to the US but especially to the affected cities to exercise appropriate caution generally."" Two U.S. states in particular have faced scrutiny. Both Mississippi and North Carolina recently passed anti-LGBT legislation that resulted in a U.K. travel alert warning gay Britons traveling to the United States to exercise caution. ""The U.S. is an extremely diverse society and attitudes towards LGBT people differ hugely across the country,"" the British Foreign Office said in a statement issued in April. ""LGBT travelers may be affected by legislation passed recently in the states of North Carolina and Mississippi. Before traveling please read our general travel advice for the LGBT community."" That general advice included suggestions about keeping physical affection to a minimum in public and being cautious in more rural areas. Meanwhile, the United States has issued 13 travel warnings and alerts in the past month for countries including Yemen, Haiti, Kenya, Laos, and Bangladesh."		1

In the mid-eighties Stewart had submitted her manuscript to an advertisement placed by the Wachowski Brothers, requesting new sci-fi works, which could be later made into a movie.According to court documentation, “an FBI investigation discovered that more than thirty minutes had been edited from the original film, in an attempt to avoid penalties for copyright infringement. The investigation also stated that ‘credible witnesses employed at Warner Brothers came forward, claiming that the executives and lawyers had full knowledge that the work in question did not belong to the Wachowski Brothers.’ These witnesses claimed to have seen Stewart’s original work and that it had been ‘often used during preparation of the motion pictures.’ The defendants tried, on several occasions, to have Stewart’s case dismissed, without success”.Sophia Stewart’s released a press statement which said: ‘The Matrix & Terminator movie franchises have made world history and have ultimately changed the way people view movies and how Hollywood does business, yet the real truth about the creator and creation of these films continue to elude the masses because the hidden secret of the matter is that these films were created and written by a Black woman…a Black woman named Sophia Stewart. But Hollywood does not want you to know this fact simply because it would change history. Also it would encourage our Black children to realize a dream and that is…nothing is impossible for them to achieve!’		1
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/was-donald-trump-accused-of-sexual-assault-prior-to-the-2016-election/	donald trump was not accused of sexual assault until he ran for president in 2016.	False	['donald trump', ' sexual assault', ' sexual harassment']	https://www.washingtonpost.com/	https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html	2017/12/14	Donald Trump bragged in vulgar terms about kissing, groping and trying to have sex with women during a 2005 conversation caught on a hot microphone, saying that “when you’re a star, they let you do it,” according to a video obtained by The Washington Post. The video captures Trump talking with Billy Bush, then of “Access Hollywood,” on a bus with the show’s name written across the side. They were arriving on the set of “Days of Our Lives” to tape a segment about Trump’s cameo on the soap opera. “I’ve never said I’m a perfect person, nor pretended to be someone that I’m not. I’ve said and done things I regret, and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them. Anyone who knows me knows these words don’t reflect who I am,” Trump said. In an apparent response to Republican critics asking him to drop out of the race, he said: “We will discuss this more in the coming days. The tape includes audio of Bush and Trump talking inside the bus, as well as audio and video once they emerge from it to begin shooting the segment. In that audio, Trump discusses a failed attempt to seduce a woman, whose full name is not given in the video. “I moved on her, and I failed. I’ll admit it,” Trump is heard saying. It was unclear when the events he was describing took place. The tape was recorded several months after he married his third wife, Melania. “Whoa,” another voice said. “I did try and f--- her. She was married,” Trump says. Trump continues: “And I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. “I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn’t get there. And she was married,” Trump says. “Then all of a sudden I see her, she’s now got the big phony tits and everything. At that point in the audio, Trump and Bush appear to notice Arianne Zucker, the actress who is waiting to escort them into the soap-opera set. “Your girl’s hot as s---, in the purple,” says Bush, who’s now a co-host of NBC’s “Today” show. “Whoa!” Trump says. “I’ve got to use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her,” Trump says. “You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. “And when you’re a star, they let you do it,” Trump says. “Whatever you want,” says another voice, apparently Bush’s. “Grab them by the p---y,” Trump says. A spokeswoman for NBC Universal, which produces and distributes “Access Hollywood,” declined to comment. “This was locker-room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago. Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course — not even close,” Trump said in a statement. Billy Bush, in a statement released by NBC Universal, said: “Obviously I’m embarrassed and ashamed. It’s no excuse, but this happened eleven years ago — I was younger, less mature, and acted foolishly in playing along. After the video appeared online Friday afternoon, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton wrote on Twitter: “This is horrific. We cannot allow this man to become president.” Her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (Va.), told reporters, “It makes me sick to my stomach,” while campaigning in Las Vegas. Trump was also criticized by members of his own party. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who said he is “sickened” by Trump’s comments, said the Republican presidential candidate will no longer appear with him at a campaign event in Wisconsin on Saturday. “Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified. I hope Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests,” Ryan said in a statement. In a short statement issued moments after Ryan’s, Trump said his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, “will be representing me” at the Wisconsin event. Sen. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who has stood by Trump uncritically through numerous controversies, said in a statement: “No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney, a Trump critic, said in a statement: “Hitting on married women? Condoning assault? Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the comments are “repugnant, and unacceptable in any circumstance” and made clear Trump’s brief statement would not suffice. “As the father of three daughters, I strongly believe that Trump needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere, and take full responsibility for the utter lack of respect for women shown in his comments on that tape,” he said late Friday. Trump’s running mate, Pence, was at a diner in Toledo when the news broke — about to view the diner’s collection of signed cardboard hot-dog buns, which includes one signed by Trump. But the reporters traveling with Pence were quickly ushered out of the diner by campaign staff, before they could ask Trump’s running mate about it, according to Politico. Politico reported that the journalists, traveling in Pence’s “protective pool,” were not permitted to film Pence as he left the diner. The tape appears at a time when Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has sought to make a campaign issue out of his opponent’s marriage. “Hillary Clinton was married to the single greatest abuser of women in the history of politics,” Trump told the New York Times in a recent interview. “Hillary was an enabler, and she attacked the women who Bill Clinton mistreated afterward. Trump carried on a very public affair with Marla Maples — his eventual second wife — while still married to first wife Ivana Trump. Trump has been criticized in this campaign for derogatory and lewd comments about women, including some made on TV and live radio. In an interview Wednesday with KSNV, a Las Vegas television station, Trump said that those comments were made for entertainment. “A lot of that was done for the purpose of entertainment. There’s nobody that has more respect for women than I do,” he told the station. “Are you trying to tone it down now?” asked the interviewer, Jim Snyder. “It’s not a question of trying, it’s very easy,” Trump said. The tape obtained by The Post seems to have captured Trump in a private moment, with no audience beyond Bush and a few others on the bus. It appears to have been shot around Sept. 16, 2005, which was the day media reports said Trump would tape his soap-opera cameo. The video shows the bus carrying Trump and Bush turning down a street on the studio back lot. The two men cannot be seen. “Oh, nice legs, huh?” Trump says. “Oof, get out of the way, honey,” Bush says, apparently referencing somebody else blocking the view of Zucker. The two men then exit the bus and greet Zucker. “We’re ready, let’s go,” Trump says, after the initial greetings. “How about a little hug for the Donald?” Bush says. “Would you like a little hug, darling?” Zucker says. “Absolutely,” Trump says. The video then follows Trump, Bush and Zucker into the studio. Trump did appear on “Days of Our Lives” in late October. In a tape of that cameo posted online, Zucker’s character asks Trump — playing himself — for a job at his business, and tells him suggestively, “I think you’ll find I’m a very willing employee. Trump’s character gives her the brushoff. “That’s an interesting proposition,” Trump says on-screen. A publicist for Zucker did not immediately respond to questions on Friday afternoon. Rosalind S.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/oxford-alabama-transgender-bathrooms/	the city of oxford, alabama reacted to target's transgender bathroom policy by making the described use of restrooms by transgender individuals punishable by jail time. see example( s )	True	['bathroom controversies', ' bathroom ordinances', ' oxford alabama', ' target', ' target transgender bathroom policy']	http://www.charlotteobserver.com/	http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article68401147.html	2016/04/27	"On March 30, 2017, the N.C. General Assembly approved a compromise bill that repealed House Bill 2 but restricts anti-discrimination ordinances in cities and counties. Gov. Roy Cooper signed the measure into law. The story below follows HB2 from its passage. In a one-day specially convened session on March 23, 2016 North Carolina’s legislature passed a sweeping law that reverses a Charlotte ordinance that had extended some rights to people who are gay or transgender. The law passed by the General Assembly and signed that same night by Gov. Pat McCrory goes further than a narrow elimination of Charlotte’s ordinance, which had generated the most controversy by a change that protected transgender people who use public restrooms based on their gender identity. The new law also nullified local ordinances around the state that would have expanded protections for the LGBT community. Help us deliver journalism that makes a difference in our community. Our journalism takes a lot of time, effort, and hard work to produce. If you read and enjoy our journalism, please consider subscribing today. The state has long had laws regulating workplace discrimination, use of public accommodations, minimum wage standards and other business issues. The new law – known as HB2, the Charlotte bathroom bill or, more officially, as the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act – makes it illegal for cities to expand upon those state laws, as more than a dozen cities had done, including Charlotte, Raleigh, Chapel Hill and Durham. North Carolina’s new law sets a statewide definition of classes of people who are protected against discrimination: race, religion, color, national origin, age, handicap or biological sex as designated on a person’s birth certificate. Sexual orientation – people who are gay – was never explicitly protected under state law and is not now, despite recent court decisions that legalized same-sex marriage. Transgender people who have not taken surgical and legal steps to change the gender noted on their birth certificates have no legal right under state law to use public restrooms of the gender with which they identify. Cities and counties no longer can establish a different standard. Critics of the Charlotte ordinance cite privacy concerns and say it was “social engineering” to allow people born as biological males to enter women’s restrooms. McCrory’s office says businesses aren’t limited by the bill, and that private companies and private universities can adopt new or keep existing nondiscrimination policies. Private businesses can establish their own practices concerning LGBT employees and customers. The pushback has been intense. On July 21, the National Basketball Association announced it will move its All-Star Game from Charlotte in 2017, which will cost the city an estimated $100 million. That decision follows cancellations of business expansions and entertainment events by companies and performers protesting HB2. In September, the reprisals against the state have intensified. On Sept. 12, the NCAA removed seven championships scheduled to be held in North Carolina during the 2016-17 academic year, including two rounds on the wildly popular men’s basketball tournament -- all because of HB2. Forty-eight hours later the Atlantic Coast Conference followed suit. It announced it was moving the conference’s football championship game in December from Charlotte, again in protest to the law. HB2 supporters from McCrory on down dug in, setting the stage for November elections in which the law was expected to play a potentially decisive role, even as the courts continue the process of deciding whether HB2 discriminates. McCrory lost his bid for reelection to Attorney General Roy Cooper. Observers of all political stripes agreed that the governor's support of HB2 probably cost him the election. On Dec. 19, 2016, following a surprise move by the Charlotte City Council, Republican Gov. Pat McCrory Monday called for a special session Wednesday, Dec. 21 to consider repeal of House Bill 2. McCrory’s call came hours after the Charlotte City Council voted 10-0 with Mayor Jennifer Roberts’ support to rescind the LGBT ordinance that prompted HB 2. On Dec. 21, the N.C. Senate voted down a repeal of HB2 after a day of increasingly partisan rancor that pitted conservative Republicans against the Charlotte they so distrust. The state House adjourned without voting on repeal of the bill that has cost North Carolina millions of dollars in lost jobs, sports events and boycotts. With that, the hope of compromise between legislators and Charlotte, which enacted the ordinance that gave rise to HB2, dissolved. Yes. The law changes the way people pursue claims of discrimination because of race, religion, color, national origin, biological sex or handicap in state courts. While the legislature amended HB2 to restore the rights of residents to sue on these grounds in state courts, it shortened the window for filing complaints from three years to one. The law also means a city or county cannot set a minimum wage standard for private employers. Are other states taking the same approach? Yes. Some states and local governments are considering or even passed new laws aimed at blocking specific LGBT rights. The national headquarters of the ACLU describes North Carolina’s HB2 as the “most extreme anti-LGBT measure in the country.” Some legal experts say the N.C. bill combines elements of laws in other states that make it more comprehensive. South Dakota’s legislature passed a bill focused specifically on public schools; that bill was vetoed by the governor, the ACLU said. States that recently have proposed similar measures include Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky and West Virginia, experts say. None has the sweep of HB2, UNC Chapel Hill law professor Maxine Eichner said in May. ""Nobody has passed a law like this."" At least five lawsuits have been filed against or in support of the law. On one side: The ACLU, Equality North Carolina and other groups sued within days of HB2 becoming law. The U.S. Justice Department followed on May 9 after first warning the state that the law jeopardizes billions of federal dollars the state receives each year in money for schools, colleges and other issues. Also in early May, McCrory and Republican legislative leaders Phil Berger and Tim Moore filed their own complaints, accusing the federal government of distorting discrimination law to include LGBT protections and asking the federal courts to deem HB2 nondiscriminatory. The cases have been filed in two separate federal courts and have been assigned to three different judges. The ACLU and the U.S. Justice Department has asked a judge to suspend HB2 while its lawsuit is being decided, arguing that damage is done to the LGBT community every day the law is in place. On Aug. 26, 2016, U.S. District Judge Thomas Schroeder gave the HB2 critics a partial victory when he banned the University of North Carolina from enforcing HB2 against the transgender plaintiffs in the lawsuit pending his ruling in the trial. Federal documents indicate the trial on the ACLU's lawsuit could take place as early as October or November. It would not be unreasonable to expect Schroeder's ruling by the summer of 2017, perhaps before. The losing side would almost certainly appeal to a higher court. Meanwhile, 21 states have joined North Carolina in opposing the federal mandate that transgender individuals be allowed to use the public bathrooms that matches their sexual identity or lose federal money. On Aug. 22, 2016, a federal judge in Texas issued a nationwide order blocking the Obama administration order that would give transgender students in public schools access to bathrooms and locker rooms matching their gender identity. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor, who is hearing the lawsuit by the 21 states, dealt a setback to the government’s argument that Title IX anti-discrimination protections apply to transgender students. It also moves the battle over transgender rights one procedural step closer to a showdown in the Supreme Court. There is no federal law that specifically prohibits discrimination against LGBT citizens in their jobs. The Employment Nondiscrimination Act that would do so has been proposed for many years, but has not passed. Yes. North Carolina is an “at will” employment state and offers limited protection for all workers. State law has never included protections for workers who are LGBT. The language in HB2 makes it more clear that the state does not intend to create a new class of protections based on sexual orientation or identity, and also will not allow cities and counties to create such a protected class. Under HB2, North Carolina now requires students to use public school restrooms and locker rooms based on the gender on their birth certificates. The federal government says that violates Title IX of the Civil Rights Act that prohibits discrimination in all school programs. The federal government includes sexual identity and orientation under the broader category of sex discrimination. McCrory and other HB2 supporters accuse the Justice Department, the U.S. Department of Education and other federal officials of ""radically reinterpreting"" discrimination law to include LGBT individuals. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, which has precedence in North Carolina, ruled in a recent Virginia transgender bathroom case that the federal agencies acted within their rights to include LGBT protections. That leaves the state's public colleges, universities and local school districts caught in the middle of a bitter court fight, with potentially billions of federal education dollars at stake. North Carolina's school superintendent said in May that school districts across the state were not complying with HB2. That appeared to be the case in Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, the state's second largest district. The Rowan-Salisbury schools did say it would follow state law while respecting the privacy of all of its students. The University of North Carolina System announced in May it will not enforce HB2. In 2012, a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage passed with more than 60 percent of the vote. A June 2015 poll from the Democrat-leading Public Policy Polling of Raleigh showed that 44 percent of state residents supported same-sex marriage, with 46 percent opposed. Last April, an Elon University poll found that 63 percent of the state’s registered voters disagreed with the state’s magistrate law. The same poll showed that 51 percent of Republicans supported a business’ right to deny service to customers based on religious objections. On HB2, an Elon poll in late April showed that 49 percent of state residents polled supported the bathroom provisions of the law. Conservative religious groups within North Carolina are taking some credit for getting HB2 passed into law, and pro-LGBT rights advocates note there is financial support from national groups with similar interests. Many also believe gay and transgender issues are being used by politicians to motivate voters in a presidential and gubernatorial election year. In North Carolina, both Republicans and Democrats are using HB2 as a rallying point for supporters, with each side believing that the law can win them votes. Nowhere are the battle lines more clearly drawn than in the governor's race between McCrory, an HB2 defender, and Attorney General Roy Cooper, a Democrat who believes the law should be repealed. Predictably, both came out on different sides on the NBA decision to move the All-Star game, using powerful statements to attack each other. Southern Evangelical Seminary president Richard Land says the situation may indicate a growing anger in the country on both the left and right. “I don’t like the form the revolution is taking,” he said. “Donald Trump is coarse and crude and frankly, dangerous, but I understand what is behind it. The vote in the N.C. House was 84-25 after three hours of debate, with all Republicans voting for it and 11 Democrats breaking ranks with their party to support the bill. In the Senate, the vote was 32-0 after the Democrats walked out in protest, saying they had not been allowed to participate in the process. McCrory, a Republican, then signed it into law. It already has. The loss of the sporting events will cost the economy millions, a loss that will trickle down through the hotel and restaurant sectors. After the law passed, PayPal canceled a much-ballyhooed expansion in Charlotte that would have included 400 jobs. In the Triangle, Braeburn Pharmaceuticals said it was reconsidering a research and manufacturing facility in Durham that included 52 jobs and a $20 million investment. Now the NBA decision eliminates an estimated $100 million windfall for the Charlotte area. Major employers in North Carolina – American Airlines, Lowe’s, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, to name a few – all have said they’re disappointed with the measure, though they haven’t threatened to pull out from the state. On the entertainment front, headline acts from Bruce Springsteen to Itzhak Perlman and Pearl Jam have canceled shows in Charlotte, Greensboro and other N.C. venues. On Friday, May 20, Maroon 5 joined the list. On tourism and economic-development fronts, some business leaders say the new law is feeding a perception that North Carolina isn’t inclusive. The British government went so far as to issue a travel advisory to its LGBT citizens who planned to travel to the state. The N.C. Justice Center says that if federal money for education, job training and public safety is withheld -- which most believe is unlikely -- the state could lose 53,000 jobs or $2.4 billion in wages. Conservatives say those numbers are wildly high and being used as a scare tactic. South Carolina was the subject of many boycotts for flying the Confederate flag at the state capitol. The NAACP announced a national boycott of the state in 2000. Tourism officials estimated the state lost $7 million in the first month as groups from the NCAA to the American Bar Association joined the protest. The loss of sporting events alone cost Columbia, Charleston and Greenville-Spartanburg millions of dollars every year, reports say. The flag was removed last year not because of boycotts, but after the mass killings at a Charleston church that appear to have been racially motivated. Charlotte’s ordinance was the first of its kind in North Carolina. Three South Carolina cities have similar ordinances: Columbia, Charleston and Myrtle Beach. They’re written differently, but “conceptually are identical” to what Charlotte did, city attorney Bob Hagemann has said. Those South Carolina cities and more than 200 other cities around the nation where similar ordinances exist have not reported problems with transgender bathroom use.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/neil-degrasse-tyson-twitter/	neil degrasse tyson addressed gender inequality on twitter by tearing apart a joke about women in science.	False	['feminism', ' neil degrasse tyson', ' science porn', ' twitter']	http://www.wired.com/	http://www.wired.com/2015/10/the-year-we-really-started-caring-about-sexism-in-science/	2016/08/29	"A New Twist in the Fight Against Sexism in ScienceStuart C. Wilson/Getty ImagesThe past year has seen a steady drumbeat of stories illustrating, yet again, how science as a field and profession remains unwelcoming to women. A Rosetta space probe scientist appears on TV wearing a shirt covered in pictures of scantily clad women. A Nobel laureate says female scientists in labs are distracting. An advice columnist for a career site run by the prestigious journal Science tells a woman to ""put up"" with her adviser staring down her shirt. And now, a famous Berkeley astronomer has been allegedly sexually harassing students for years.This kind of thing, unfortunately, isn't new. What’s remarkable is what happened after each of these events occurred, when the hashtags trended and the voices clamored: The people responsible were held accountable for their actions. The Rosetta scientist issued a teary apology. The Nobel laureate lost his honorary professorship. The editor of the Science column is no longer there. The Berkeley astronomer resigned in disgrace.In isolation, any one of these events could seem like an outlier: just one person getting his due. But taken together, so many and in succession, they suggest something bigger. A conversation about sexism in science broke open this year. Sharp organizing and social media are sparking real change. What was once whispered privately in laboratories and offices is being discussed publicly, loudly, and clearly.What’s happening in science mirrors larger changes. In a year that saw grassroots activism prompt a national discussion of racial profiling, sexual assault, and transgender rights, marginalized voices have challenged the status quo. And mainstream media cares.BuzzFeed and BerkeleyWhen BuzzFeed broke the story of a Berkeley investigation that found famous exoplanet hunter Geoff Marcy sexually harassed his students, it hit a nerve. Marcy’s behavior had been an open secret among many astronomers—a field where over 70 percent of faculty are male.A few astronomers began circulating a petition in support of his victims the night before the BuzzFeed story published, after Marcy posted an apology on his website. In the minutes after BuzzFeed’s story went live, dozens of names on the petition bloomed into hundreds. The petition now has 3,000 names.https://twitter.com/virginiahughes/status/652706384669245440“The article gave more weight to his voice than to the students he has traumatized, and it is that exact practice that allowed the abuse to occur for as long as it did,” Laura Lopez, the Ohio State University astronomer who wrote the letter, tells WIRED in an email. The Times' public editor agreed . Lopez had circulated the letter on her Facebook page and an astronomer Facebook group. “I expected to get some signatures, but I had no idea the letter would get such broad support across the astronomy and physics communities,” she says. She’s since also received hundreds of emails from people thanking her for the letter.The media’s missteps in reporting on the sexual harassment story show that this kind of coverage is kind of new, especially in science journalism. “I don’t think we saw these kinds of news stories and saw this kind of reaction in the journalism community in earlier generations,” says Deborah Blum, a long-time science journalist and director of the Knight Science Journalism Program at MIT. “We’re all catching up in this kind of cultural awareness.”The community of science writers, bloggers, and journalists had its own major reckoning with sexism in 2013, when several young women spoke out against sexual harassment by Scientific American's blog editor. Blum organized a panel called ""The XX Question"" at the National Association of Science Writers meeting that year—and that conversation continued at this year's meeting just a week ago.But this isn't just journalist navel-gazing. The groundswell of interest comes from readers too, which has—to frame it cynically—also created a cottage industry of outrage mining. For every deeply reported story like BuzzFeed's on Marcy, dozens more blog posts exist seemingly to aggregate angry tweets. Take the deluge of content after Science Careers' controversial column advising a woman to ""put up"" with her leering advisor. Post after post ripped into the column , adding snark but not even attempting to wrestle with the difficult question at its heart and offer alternative advice.These stories exist because an appetite for them exists—and that part, at least, is a good thing. It reflects the changing norms of what's tolerable in science. Here might be a good point to pause and reflect on WIRED’s coverage of sexism in science, which is, well, sporadic . We've been silent on many these stories because we've long hoped to cover the ways science can make the world better, not reflect the world's problems. But that's wrong, of course. Ignoring social inequality doesn't fix it. We cover science and the culture of science, and that has to include the ways that culture goes wrong. Point is, we're trying to figure it out, too.The BacklashCertainly the events of the past year have not eradicated sexism in science—not even close. Look no further than the trolls. Along with two other journalists, Blum broke the news about Nobel laureate Tim Hunt’s comments at a conference of science journalists in South Korea, where he joked to a room full of female scientists that having “girls” in labs caused romantic trouble. His comments were tweeted out, and his comment turned into a meme: #distractinglysexy went global, with women scientists posting distinctly un-magazine-cover-like pictures of themselves at work, in lab coats and hazmat suits, or covered in dirt from archaeological digs.But Hunt’s defenders also joined the fray. “I started getting hammered—all kinds of misogynists and horrible names,” says Blum of her Twitter feed. “People came to me, almost entirely women scientists who had the same thing happen to them, said what I had to do to protect myself.” When I asked Karen James, a biologist at Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory who frequently tweets about sexism in science, about backlash, she answered wearily, ""Everyone gets pushback on social media."" The defenders—and attackers—appear in every case, from the Rosetta shirtgate to Geoff Marcy. But in a way, the backlash only shows how serious the threat to the status quo is. Hashtag activism turned into real action, upsetting the existing balance of power.These few highly publicized cases are only the tip of the iceberg though. “This is atypical. A hundred other cases are probably happening right now that are not being reported,” says James. Julienne Rutherford, a biological anthropologist who published a paper on sexual assault and harassment in scientific fieldwork, agrees. “There are still a lot of people who are afraid to speak up,"" she says.https://twitter.com/AstroKatie/status/610174867820797952On the plus side, Rutherford says, “the conversations are out in the light. That didn’t happen a few years ago.” That's why the advice in Science Careers to not raise a fuss about a leering advisor seems so out of touch. The author of the column is Alice Huang, an eminent virologist whose career dates back to the 1960s. Huang told me she still stands by her advice as practical—even if the advisor's behavior is clearly wrong. She herself is no stranger to sexual harassment.“A lot of us through our careers have thought of suing and then you look around and see the few people who have sued on harassment or bias and they turn out to be the walking wounded among women. And you really don’t want to do that,"" says Huang. ""But if you find people aren’t the walking wounded for life, then you get a little braver the next time.”It'd be nice to say that Huang's word choice of the ""walking wounded"" is melodramatic and also outdated. Certainly the outpouring of support for the women who filed complaints against Marcy and spoke to the press is encouraging. But as one of those women, Sarah Ballard, who is an astronomer at MIT, puts it, the community of scientists still has lot of work to do—and a lot more voices to listen to.

But it is, I think, the correct terminology to capture a political moment so monstrously stupid that even Jerry Springer finds it embarrassing. To shitpost, according to the scholarly journal Urban Dictionary, is to make utterly worthless and inane posts on an internet message board, particularly those involving memes or low-quality visuals.And the presidents latest act of shitpostingtweeting out a video edited to show Trump wrestling, and beating up, the CNN logohas flung the 24-hour news network into a week-long controversy involving death threats, claims of blackmail and a Reddit user who calls himself HanAssholeSolo. Its very hard to imagine having to explain that sentence to a person from 2007. But frankly, its also pretty hard to explain that sentence to a normal person from 2017 who doesnt spend every waking moment following incremental developments in Trumps blustery war with the media. (Which, probably, is healthy.)Related: Trump blocked me on Twitter for telling him hes not as cool as witchesRecommended Slideshows5150 Best-Selling Albums in U.S. History51In Pictures: The 50 Most Powerful Military Forces in the World51Top 50 Highest-grossing Movies of All TimeNow, a week after Trumps tweet, CNN is accused of blackmailing the Reddit user behind the wrestling clip, and the networks journalists (and even some of their families) are being subjected to threats and harassing phone calls from pro-Trump trolls and Redditors. Curiously, the line from the CNN story that was interpreted as blackmail (a stretch) wasnt written even by the reporter. According to Gizmodo, it was added by a CNN executive as a legal safeguard, but the threatening tone proved disastrous. But as the #CNNBlackMail hashtag spread through the alt-right this week, things got ugly. These far-right trolls are really threatening people and coming after people, an anonymous CNN employee told The Daily Beast. Somebodys gonna do something stupid at some point.Again, it's really striking how the CNN Blackmail nonsense is being conducted almost exactly like Gamer Gate was. Katherine Cross (@Quinnae_Moon) July 7, 2017A perceived slight, and an unfortunate editorial choice, is spun into this enormous scandal pitting Ordinary Folks against the Eebil MSM.Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now Katherine Cross (@Quinnae_Moon) July 7, 2017For observers of Gamergate, these tactics are familiaronly now the digital mob is taking inspiration from the highest reaches of government. Trump frequently approaches social media like a message board troll, so its darkly fitting that far-right trolls are adopting the basest instincts of internet forum culture to wage war against the presidents perceived enemy: CNN.Trump cant win a war against CNN in the courts. But he can continue to troll the network (and other media outlets) into chaos and disarray. Consider Trumps 2006 battle with the journalist Tim OBrien, who had published a book alleging that Trumps net worth was far lower than claimed. Trump sued the author for libel, and after a lengthy legal process, the case was eventually dismissed. But Trump was pleased: I spent a couple of bucks on legal fees, he later told The Washington Post, and they spent a whole lot more. I did it to make his life miserable, which Im happy about.Its not farfetched to think that Trump feels similarly pleased with himself for bringing chaos to CNN. (Jeffrey A. Zucker, the president of the network, has described Trumps behavior as bullying.) By casting journalists as villains in his administration, the president makes questions of objectivity even trickier to navigate. As the writer/comedian Sarah Cooper tweeted, Journalists aren't supposed to be the story, so by making them the story, Trump automatically makes them look biased in defending themselves.If youre still confused about the state of the presidents war with CNN, heres an explainer. U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks during a joint news conference with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, D.C., on June 9. The writer is not allowed to see Trump's tweets anymore. Jonathan Ernst/Reuters Q: Why is the president so mad at CNN?Trump has been regularly fuming about CNN, which reports critically on him (and which he calls Fake News), since the campaign days. But this particular wave of hostility seems to have been prompted by a retracted CNN story regarding a Russian investment fund with ties to Trump officials. Three journalists resigned after CNN pulled the story. The president spent days gloating about this, though its worth noting that when he lies, nobody resigns or issues a retraction.Q: What about that video? Did Trump really wrestle a guy from CNN?No. The video is an old clip of Trumps appearance at WrestleMania. The CNN logo was superimposed over another guys head.Q: Where did the doctored video come from?Reddit, of course. CNNs Andrew Kaczynski did some digging and determined that the video originated with a Reddit user named HanAssholeSolo, whos left behind a sizable trail of racist and anti-Semitic posts (including a graphic showing CNN employees with Jewish stars next to their names). Mr. Asshole Solo apologized and deleted his other posts.Q: ""HanAssholeSolo? What kind of name isIts a Reddit username. If you havent spent much time on Reddit, feel free to keep it that way.Q: I heard that CNN is blackmailing the pro-Trump Reddit guy. Is that true?Not exactlythough the outlet definitely botched how the story was handled. CNN tracked down the source of the video, but declined to publish his real name. Its reasonable for news outlets to take an interest in this Reddit user, since hes been involved in a big, newsworthy event; there was a clear public interest in how the violent video traveled from pro-Trump forums to the presidents Twitter feed. But the issue of anonymity is somewhat thorny, since the guy is a private citizen and, by most accounts, didnt give permission for Trump to use his video. He is not a public figure, and if doxed, he could be subject to threats or harassment.Whats weird is that CNN granted HanAssholeSolo a sort of conditional anonymity. This passage from the story was widely interpreted as a threat to dox the Reddit user if he resumes his ugly behavior:CNN is not publishing ""HanA**holeSolo's"" name because he is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology, showed his remorse by saying he has taken down all his offending posts, and because he said he is not going to repeat this ugly behavior on social media again. In addition, he said his statement could serve as an example to others not to do the same. CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change.This is odd language to include in a news story. It makes it seem as though the promise of anonymity is transactional, in exchange for a promise not to misbehave. But it wasnt intended as blackmail. It was just sloppy wording. As Kaczynski noted on Twitter, the line was meant to express that CNN hadnt made any agreement with the man regarding anonymity. (If that paragraph was poorly phrased, it might be because it wasnt constructed by a writer; it was written by a network executive as a defensive measure to explain their sourcing decision, Gizmodo later found.)This line is being misinterpreted. It was intended only to mean we made no agreement w/the man about his identity. https://t.co/9FL6EvTikx andrew kaczynski _ (@KFILE) July 5, 2017I dont think CNN intended this as blackmail, Poynters ethicist concluded, but its easy to see how the unfortunate wording in the story could be easily misinterpreted. Its also easy to see that aggressive pro-Trump trolls might act in bad faith and attack CNNs reporters regardless of the anonymity issue. When Trump characterizes the media as the enemy of the American people, his most vociferous followers might regard it as a patriotic deed to harass journalists.Q: Wait, I thought the wrestling video was made by a 15-year-old kid?No. This false detail spread quickly in early social media posts, stirring up anti-CNN fervor among Trump supporters inclined to believe that the network was threatening a minor. (Donald Trump Jr., for instance, tweeted: So I guess they weren't effective threatening the admin so they go after & bully a 15 y/o?) But it isnt true. Andrew Kaczynski, the CNN reporter who spoke to the Reddit user, has confirmed that he is an adult.Need to point out again HanAssholeSolo is a middle aged man. People claiming he's 15 are wrong. Some are intentionally spreading this. andrew kaczynski _ (@KFILE) July 5, 2017Trump did once retweet a 16-year-old boy bashing CNN, but that was a separate incident.Whats going on at CNN now?Lots of unease, reportedly. Kaczynskis family is receiving dozens of harassing phone calls. So are reporters and executives at the network.Why doesnt Trump just tell his followers not to target journalists with death threats or anti-Semitic memes?Well... . That would require Trump to acknowledge that some of his followers make death threats and post anti-Semitic memes. Plus, Trumps tweet was interpreted as encouraging attacks on journalists. The larger issue isnt that the president dislikes CNN (which has mishandled plenty in recent weeks). Its that the president dislikes the fundamental notion of journalism holding power to account.Are we going to be OK?At press time, we really dont know."		0
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/david-hogg-on-campus-rumor-hoax/	marjory stoneman douglas student david hogg was caught lying about being on campus during a february 2018 school shooting when he told cbs that he had to get on his bicycle and ride to school.

Keep at it. You’re leading us forward.”Protesters in Washington formed a sea of people along Pennsylvania Avenue, while demonstrators also gathered in Parkland, New York City, San Francisco, and in cities around the world.Students from the school newspaper at Marjory Stoneman Douglas, where the February massacre took place, attended the march as special correspondents for the Guardian and have been guest-editing the Guardian US website since yesterday.The rallies are aiming to persuade Congress to tighten the US’s notoriously lax firearm laws, which have made gun massacres a regular part of American life.Emma Gonzalez, one of the best-known Parkland student activists, led the crowd in 6min 20secs of silence to symbolise the amount of time it took the gunman, Nikolas Cruz, to commit the 17 murders.Play Video7:04Emma Gonzalez's powerful March for Our Lives speech in full - video“We are done hiding,” said her fellow student Ryan Deitsch. “We are done being full of fear. This is the beginning of the end. From here, we fight.”Another student, David Hogg, brought up a major theme of the rally when he urged protesters to register to vote. “When politicians send thoughts and prayers we say no more!” he said. “I say to politicians : get your resumes ready!” Chants of “vote them out” punctuated the event.Seventeen-year-old Edna Chavez, from Manual Arts High in Los Angeles entered the stage with a raised fist and spoke powerfully about losing her brother to gun violence when she was a young child. “I have learned to duck from bullets before I learned to read,” she told the crowd.Eleven-year-old Christopher Underwood, who lost his brother age five to a shooting, said: “I would like to not worry about dying. But worry about math and play basketball with my friends.”Martin Luther King Jr’s granddaughter, Yolanda Renee King, said: “I have a dream that enough is enough. And that this should be a gun free world, period.”Play Video1:35Martin Luther King Jr's granddaughter, 9, leads chants at anti-gun rally - video“This is a moment of history that I want to be part of,” pop star Miley Cyrus, who sang onstage earlier, told one of our Parkland special correspondents.In New York City, Paul McCartney joined the marchers. “One of my best friends was killed in gun violence right around here, so it’s important to me,” he said.In Parkland, tens of thousands of marchers passed Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in respectful silence. “Enough really is enough,” Rebecca Price-Taylor told the Guardian. “No more of these weapons of war.”Organizers want the US Congress to ban the sale of assault weapons like the one used in the Florida rampage and to tighten background checks for gun buyers.On Friday, Trump signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill that includes modest improvements to background checks for gun sales and grants to help schools prevent gun violence, and the Justice Department proposed rule changes that would effectively ban “bump stock” devices that let semi-automatic weapons fire like a machine gun.Protesters consider these measures insufficient. “When you give us an inch, that bump stocks ban, we will take a mile,” said student Delaney Tarr. “We are not here for breadcrumbs, we are here to lead.”The Guardian is covering the people, action and ideas driving the protest movement in the US in our series, The Resistance Now.

The cipher is included in the remote controldevice that opens and locks your car and that activates the anti-theftmechanisms. Each device has a unique key that takes 18 billion billion values. With 100 computers, it would take several decades to find such a key. Therefore KeeLoq was widely believed to be secure. In our research wehave found a method to identify the key in less than a day. The attackrequires access for about 1 hour to the remote control (for example,while it is stored in your pocket). Once we have found the key, we candeactivate the alarm and drive away with your car. This research is the joint work between 3 research groups: the computerscience department of the Technion, Israel, the research group COSIC ofthe Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium, and the math department ofthe Hebrew University, Israel. KeeLoq is a lightweight block cipher with a32-bit block size and a 64-bit key. Despite its short key size, itis widely used in remote keyless entry systems and other wirelessauthentication applications. For example, authentication protocolsbased on KeeLoq are supposedly used by various car manufacturers inanti-theft mechanisms. This paper presents a practical key recoveryattack against KeeLoq that requires 216 known plaintextsand has a time complexity of 244.5 KeeLoq encryptions. Itis based on the slide attack and a novel approach to meet-in-the-middleattacks. The fully implemented attack requires 65 minutes to obtain therequired data and 7.8 days of calculations on 64 CPU cores. A variantwhich requires 216 chosen plaintexts needs only 3.4 days on64 CPU cores. Using only 10000 euro, an attacker can purchase a clusterof 50 dual core computers that will find the secret key in about twodays. We investigated the way KeeLoq is intended to be used in practiceand conclude that our attack can be used to subvert the security ofreal systems. An attacker can acquire chosen plaintexts in practice,and one of the two suggested key derivation schemes for KeeLoq allowsto recover the master secret from a single key. Full paper available here:S.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/holocaust-teaching-ban-uk/	schools in the uk no longer teach about the holocaust for fear of offending muslim students.

It found some teachers are reluctant to cover the atrocity for fear of upsetting students whose beliefs include Holocaust denial. There is also resistance to tackling the 11th century Crusades - where Christians fought Muslim armies for control of Jerusalem - because lessons often contradict what is taught in local mosques. The findings have prompted claims that some schools are using history 'as a vehicle for promoting political correctness'. The study, funded by the Department for Education and Skills, looked into 'emotive and controversial' history teaching in primary and secondary schools. It found some teachers are dropping courses covering the Holocaust at the earliest opportunity over fears Muslim pupils might express anti-Semitic and anti-Israel reactions in class. The researchers gave the example of a secondary school in an unnamed northern city, which dropped the Holocaust as a subject for GCSE coursework. The report said teachers feared confronting 'anti-Semitic sentiment and Holocaust denial among some Muslim pupils'. It added: ""In another department, the Holocaust was taught despite anti-Semitic sentiment among some pupils. ""But the same department deliberately avoided teaching the Crusades at Key Stage 3 (11- to 14-year-olds) because their balanced treatment of the topic would have challenged what was taught in some local mosques."" A third school found itself 'strongly challenged by some Christian parents for their treatment of the Arab-Israeli conflict-and the history of the state of Israel that did not accord with the teachings of their denomination'. The report concluded: ""In particular settings, teachers of history are unwilling to challenge highly contentious or charged versions of history in which pupils are steeped at home, in their community or in a place of worship."" But Chris McGovern, history education adviser to the former Tory government, said: ""History is not a vehicle for promoting political correctness. Children must have access to knowledge of these controversial subjects, whether palatable or unpalatable."" The researchers also warned that a lack of subject knowledge among teachers - particularly at primary level - was leading to history being taught in a 'shallow way leading to routine and superficial learning'. Lessons in difficult topics were too often 'bland, simplistic and unproblematic' and bored pupils.

False	['facebook trafficking rumors', ' human trafficking', ' sex trafficking', ' shelby township']	http://people.howstuffworks.com/	http://people.howstuffworks.com/urban-legend2.htm	2017/08/29	 Prev NEXT In the last section, we saw that urban legends are unusual, funny or shocking stories, relayed from person to person as absolute truth. The most remarkable thing about urban legends is that so many people believe them and pass them on. What is it about these stories that makes people want to spread the word?A lot of it has to do with the particular elements of the story. As we saw in the last section, many urban legends are about particularly heinous crimes , contaminated foods or any number of occurrences that could affect a lot of people if they were true. If you hear such a story, and you believe it, you feel compelled to warn your friends and family.A person might pass on non-cautionary information simply because it is funny or interesting. When you first hear the story, you are completely amazed that such a thing has occurred. When told correctly, a good urban legend will have you on the edge of your seat. It's human nature to want to spread this feeling to others, and be the one who's got everyone waiting to hear how the story turns out. Even if you hear it as a made-up joke, you might be tempted to personalize the tale by claiming it happened to a friend. Basically, people love to tell a good story.But why does an audience take this at face value, instead of recognizing it is a tall tale or unsubstantiated rumor ? In most cases, it has to do with how the story is told. If a friend (let's call her Jane) tells you an urban legend, chances are she will say it happened to a friend of somebody she knows. You trust Jane to tell you the truth, and you know she trusts the person who told her the story. It seems pretty close to secondhand information, so you treat it as such. Why would Jane lie?Of course, Jane isn't really lying, and her friend wasn't lying to her -- both of them believe the story. They are, however, probably abbreviating the story somewhat, and you will probably abbreviate it yourself when you pass it on. In this situation, the story happened to a friend of one of your friend's friends, but to simplify things, you'll probably just say it happened to a friend of Jane's, or even to Jane herself. In this way, every person who relays the story gives the impression that he or she is only two people away from one of the characters in the story, when in reality, there are probably hundreds of people between them.Now, we'll take a look at where urban legends come from. 		0

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/clown-masks-banned/	clown masks have been banned in the united states, and wearing one can result in a $50,000 fine. see example( s )	False	['clown masks', ' clown sightings', ' daily finesser', ' huzlers']	https://en.wikipedia.org/	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_clown_sightings	2016/10/07	"A person dressed as an evil clown in 2007. The 2016 clown sightings were reports of people disguised as armed evil clowns in incongruous settings, such as near forests and schools. The incidents were reported in the United States, Canada, and subsequently in other countries and territories from August 2016. The sightings were first reported in South Carolina when a 9-year-old boy told his mother that two suspicious males dressed as clowns tried to lure him into the nearby woods. By mid-October 2016, clown sightings and attacks had been reported in nearly all U.S. states, 9 out of 13 provinces and territories of Canada, and 18 other countries. Prior to the spate of incidents in 2016, numerous sightings of people dressed as clowns in odd or incongruous settings have occurred throughout the world since 2013. The proliferation of videos and images of these precursor sightings spread through social media posts and viral sharing of the content, most notably from DM Pranks, a YouTube user from Perugia, Italy. While most of the 2016 incidents appeared to be wholly unsubstantiated or lacked evidence of criminal activity (with many incidents being deemed practical jokes), a few led to arrests. Some people were cited or arrested for making violent threats to schools, and some incidents involved robberies and assaults on children and adults. By mid-October 2016, in the wake of hundreds of ""clown sightings"" in the United States and Canada, the phenomenon had spread from North America to Europe, Israel, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South America. One possible precursor event was the 2013 sightings of a ""creepy clown"" in Northampton, England. The Northampton clown sightings, which were in the town during September and October 2013, were the work of three local filmmakers Alex Powell, Elliot Simpson, and Luke Ubanski. The clown shared similar looks to Pennywise the Dancing Clown from Stephen King's book It. The trio started a Facebook page for the so-called ""Northampton clown"" and were using the appearances to drive traffic to the page. In March 2014, Matteo Moroni from Perugia, Italy, owner of the YouTube channel DM Pranks, began dressing up as an evil clown and terrifying unsuspecting passersby, with his videos racking up hundreds of millions of views. A rash of sightings appeared in California in October 2014, which centered around the ""Wasco clown"", and primarily occurred in the Wasco, California area with photos appearing on social media. A person in clown attire was spotted in a cemetery in Chicago, Illinois in July 2015. This occurrence involved two residents who spotted the ""creepy clown"" scaling the gate at the Rosehill Cemetery late at night. After the clown entered the cemetery, they turned to face the residents and began waving slowly as they made a video recording. After waving for a few seconds, the clown ran into a dark wooded area and was not seen again. Police investigation of the sighting did not lead to any arrests. The 2016 clown phenomenon began in Greenville, South Carolina in early August, followed by incidents in Canada shortly afterward. It later spread around the U.S. In early October 2016, further incidents were reported in Canada and the first occurrences in the United Kingdom and Australia. British communities have been ""horrified"" and pressure has been placed on police resources. Throughout this time, Internet social media sites received numerous postings related to the phenomenon. The World Clown Association president Randy Christensen took a stance against the current trend of people dressing up as clowns to frighten people.Circuses and other clown-related businesses have been affected. In October 2016, McDonald's decided that Ronald McDonald would keep a lower profile as a result of the incidents. A sociologist has called 2016 ""a bad time to be a professional clown"". The killer clown craze has been linked to a significant increase in sales of clown suits in and near Glasgow, Scotland. Canadian pornographic website Pornhub reported that between mid-September and mid-October, there were 100,000 clown related searches, a 213% increase. Another pornographic website Xhamster reported a 50% increase in clown porn. During Halloween, some Floridians decided to go armed while trick-or-treating. On October 12, the Russian Embassy in London issued a warning for Russian and British citizens because of the clown scare. On October 13, Fijian police warned people against involvement in the events. Several New Zealand shops have withdrawn clown costumes from their shelves. The East Side Union High School District, the West Milford school district, Ohio school district, and Springboro Community Schools, issued a blanket ban on all clown costumes and clown masks in addition to previously existing policies and restrictions. Target has pulled clown masks from its website and stores as a result of the scare, as has Canadian Tire. The village of Memramcook, New Brunswick asked residents not to dress up as clowns on Halloween. Employees of theme parks were instructed to remove any horror costumes and make-up before leaving work. By October 25, 2016, several news outlets reported on an alleged clown-initiated ""purge"" or ""attack"", which supposedly was to take place on Halloween Eve of 2016. Most of these threats were disseminated through social media. Police departments in various locations have insisted that while no credible threats exist, parents and children should use caution when out on Halloween Eve and Halloween. Police departments in regions affected by the ""purge"" threats have cautioned residents not to make fear-based attacks on anyone simply because they are dressed in clown attire, but go on to say that any clowns exhibiting bizarre or threatening behavior should be reported immediately to the proper authorities. While there were no widespread ""purge"" attacks as threatened, in Orange County a man from Florida and his family were attacked on October 31, 2016 by a group of approximately 20 people in clown masks (and masks styled after The Purge movie). The family stopped their car after something hit it and the group attacked them, resulting in the man and his brother needing medical attention. According to the man who was attacked, the group was armed with an array of clubs, knives, hockey sticks, and bats. No arrests have been made in this case. The sightings inspired the upcoming horror film titled Behind the Sightings, directed by Tony Cadwell. This is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by expanding it with reliably sourced entries. On October 7, several of these sightings were reported in Campbelltown, New South Wales. Four images of sightings in the city were uploaded onto the Internet and one showed a clown being knocked to the ground. In Narellan, a person dressed as a clown was pictured sitting on a roadside electrical box. Since October 7, there have been multiple sightings across major Australian cities, which include Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, and Perth. On October 8, at around 9:30 PM, two 12-year-old girls were with one of their fathers buying ice cream when suddenly, they were attacked by a creepy clown in Adelaide's CBD (Central Business District) near the intersection of Pultney Street and Rundle Street. While attacking the girls, the clown tried to steal one of the girls' phone, leaving her ""traumatized and shaking"". In October a picture, supposedly taken in Ghent, Belgium circulated Flemish media showing a ""killer clown"" standing by the side of the road. The picture was later proved to be from the United States.. In October, a sighting was recorded in Curitiba. The incidents in Brazil and worldwide led to professional clowns protesting in Rio Grande do Sul in late October. On October 5, in Edmonton, Harry Ainlay High School was put into lock down due to clown scares on social media. The following day, other incidents in the city were reported at a Catholic school and junior high schools. As well, two incidents of sightings occurred in Fort Saskatchewan, a city direct northeast of Edmonton. Later, a 15-year-old youth admitted dressing up as one of the clowns to RCMP in Fort Saskatchewan. Elsewhere in the province, the Calgary Police Service received messages from several Calgarians regarding images depicting people dressed as clowns in the city. On October 6, two teenaged boys dressed as clowns were placed under arrest, following a threat which made schools in the Prince George area be locked down. The teenagers, aged 16 and 17, were arrested at a high school in the area. In Winnipeg, rumors of sightings were reported at Collège Sturgeon Heights Collegiate. This prompted St. James-Assiniboia School Division to start an investigation about reports, they concluded that the image was just an accidental image taken of a student in a nearby field. Police are investigating several encounters with creepy clowns in New Brunswick communities. A person dressed as a clown was seen trying to jump out in front of cars in Ripples. A complaint about a ""creepy clown"" sighting was received by local authorities, prompting an investigation in Gander, central Newfoundland. In early October, people dressed as clowns were sighted in Halifax, Hammonds Plains, and Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. Police responded to a sighting at Halifax West High School. People dressed as clowns in Glace Bay have also interfered with traffic. Police in Clark's Harbour arrested a 24-year-old man wearing a clown mask. Witnesses reported that he grabbed at the clothing of a young boy. In the first half of October, there were several reports of people dressed as clowns in the hamlet of Rankin Inlet, Nunavut. In early October, people dressed as clowns were spotted chasing children during dismissal at Pope Francis Catholic School, an elementary school in Toronto. Police detained two 15-year-olds in connection with the incident. It is believed they are former students of the school and they were filming their activities for a YouTube video. Police have said that the suspects did not touch the students. In addition, the Toronto Catholic District School Board spokesperson John Yan said that a group named ""Clowns in the 6"" have specifically named different high schools in Toronto as targets for potential clown attacks. On October 6, 2016, a group of people dressed as clowns made a message on an Instagram account saying: ""We are coming to London, Ontario's high schools and surrounding areas. We are going to kidnap students and behead teachers, we're not clowning around."" The account gained attention in the city of London as well as Saint Thomas and surrounding towns and municipalities. A few days later, a student at Mother Teresa Catholic Secondary School in North London was approached by a man wearing a clown costume. The man sprinted at her, coming close to the school itself. Numerous students captured photos on the social media application Snapchat, as the man ran from the property. Clarke Road Secondary School and H.B. Beal Secondary School were both put under lock-downs during the following days. During the height of this ""clown epidemic"", London District Catholic School Board banned students from wearing clown costumes during Halloween celebrations that year. On August 9, people dressed as clowns were reported to have been chasing children in Gatineau, Quebec. On October 2, a video surfaced of a person dressed as a clown in the middle of a dirt road in Quebec, with a chainsaw that chased after a car on foot. On October 14, in Montreal, a teenager was chased by a clown with a baseball bat; he called the police, but the culprit was never found. In October, a male dressed as a clown was filmed walking around with a baseball bat in Rancagua, Cachapoal Province, pursuing the recorder and his group of friends. Sightings in Croatia begun on October 16 in Osijek, then followed in other cities, such as Karlovac and Trilj. Some teenagers allegedly beat a person dressed as a clown in Osijek and on October 21, the first three people dressed as clowns were arrested in Karlovac. On October 22, another person dressed as a clown was arrested in Varaždin. Croatian minister of interior affairs Vlaho Orepić said in an interview for RTL TV that Croatian police would deal with that issue and ensure safety of citizens. Police districts across the country have received 22 reports of sightings in total by October 17, 2016. On October 12, 2016, a man was driving home from a football match when he spotted an axe-wielding male dressed as a clown standing in the middle of the road. The man nearly hit the clown, who was later revealed to be a 13-year-old boy. On October 14, a man in Holbæk was followed by a male dressed as a clown. He managed to punch the clown in the face. Police stated that both parties risked prosecution. On October 18, there were two sightings of people dressed as clowns in Tuusula. First, around 10 people dressed as clowns jumped out of a grey van at the playyard of school. They started to hunt down three kids who escaped to an underpass, where another clown was waiting with a chainsaw. Later, two adults with white overalls and pig masks were running behind at least one child and scared teenagers. On the evening of 22 October in the Kallio district of Helsinki, two clowns jumped in front of a 30-year-old man, who was jogging with his dog. The dog bit one and the man punched another of the clowns. However, the clowns managed to escape. The man made a police report of the incident, and the police did not find the suspects. There were also sightings of people dressed as clowns in Turku, Luvia, Vaasa, Rovaniemi, Porvoo, Espoo, Vantaa, Nurmijärvi, Kotka, Rauma, Riihimäki, Savonlinna, Oulu, Kerimäki, Pieksämäki, Varkaus and Leppävirta. On October 15, at 2:00 AM in Wesel, two men reported a man in a clown mask carrying a knife and gun. On October 21, people dressed as clowns were reported in two northern German towns. One wielding a baseball bat in the city of Rostock attacked a man, leaving him with bruises. Another in the same town threatened a 15-year-old with a knife. In nearby Greifswald, two separate reports involved a clown wielding a chain saw. Two other incidents in Greifswald involved young children being scared by someone dressed as a clown. On October 25, a 16-year-old teenager masked as a clown was stabbed with a knife by a 14-year-old in Berlin. The 16-year-old had to undergo surgery. On October 29, the German Interior Ministry announced a ""zero-tolerance policy"" against creepy clown attire ahead of Halloween. It was reported that over the past several weeks in Germany, there had been 30 reports of incidents involving attacks, robberies, or assaults. There have been many reports of incidents regarding people dressed as clowns, but as of yet, no arrests have been made. In Drimnagh, Dublin, a clown with red balloons was spotted; there have since been numerous sightings of clowns in the capital. On 10 October 2016, organizers of a Halloween haunted house attraction apologised after three people dressed as evil clowns and carrying imitation chainsaws frightened students in the grounds of Newpark Comprehensive School in Blackrock, Dublin. The clowns were said to be publicising the attraction and unaware that the grounds were private property. The attraction's spokesperson said it was ""'in no way linked' to the 'creepy clown' craze sweeping across the UK and US"". After the incident police said they are taking the clown craze seriously and reports will be investigated. After the statement it was reported that a clown with an axe broke into a home in County Kildare, and scared a child. There were reports of clowns jumping out of bushes to scare schoolchildren. In mid October Dundalk police issued a warning saying ""A number of people have been hurt as part of this craze and we are advising people not to take part in it"" and that ""It could be considered a breach of the Public Order Act or the Offences Against the Person Act."" On October 5, residents of Monterrey, Nuevo León made warnings on Facebook that thieves dressing as clowns were present in the area. The Facebook group's alert said that the clowns assaulted a passersby, who were walking home. On the early morning of October 7, several news sources reported that two males dressed as clowns were found dead in Ecatepec, a suburb of Mexico City, possibly due to being beaten to death by a group of people after the clowns were scaring people. This turned out to be false. The news sites reporting the incident used a photo of two clowns murdered in Guatemala in March 2015.

On August 1, 2016, near the beginning of this spate of sightings, Wisconsin residents reported seeing Gags the Green Bay Clown. There has been speculation that this clown is related to an independent horror film due to premiere around Halloween. On October 7, 2016, a Menasha couple dressed up as clowns were arrested for child negligence for leaving their 4-year-old child alone at home while they were outside scaring people. In early October, creepy clowns were reported by citizens to be walking around mazes and taking selfies in Natrona County. In one example, threats of violence and the same image of a clown referred to a minimum of 24 schools in Arizona Valley's Phoenix Union and Glendale school districts. On Monday, September 26, around 1,500 of Marydale High School's students (nearly half of all students) did not attend after the first threats appeared on the Internet. On October 1, schools in Hamburg, Pennsylvania were locked down because of a clown threat on Facebook and Twitter by a group with the name ""Aint Clownin Around."" The message read ""We will be at all High schools this friday to either kidnapp [sic] students or kill teachers going to they cars ...#WeNotClowninAround."" In Philadelphia, threats against students and schools have been posted at social media sites, prompting the FBI and a terrorism task force to help police investigate. Explanations include that some clown sightings were promotional stunts for Rob Zombie's 31 or Andrés Muschietti's 2017 film adaptation of Stephen King's novel It, both of which feature one or more characters dressed as clowns. Author and folklorist Benjamin Radford, who wrote the non-fiction book Bad Clowns, said that the craze could be an example of the ""snowball effect"", where rumor and legitimate concerns mix with the human penchant for a good story. The Verge dismissed the sightings as a case of mass hysteria, stating that a fear of clowns (which is common in children and adults) may be an underlying cause.Vox likewise claimed that ""The Great Clown Panic of 2016 has been perpetuated by pretty much everyone except actual clowns."" The seventh season of au courant anthology horror series American Horror Story: Cult (2017) seems to have capitalised on this craze, where the main protagonists are members of a cult which terrorise/murder their victims whilst disguised as various creepy/scary/killer type clowns.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/did-the-communist-party-of-the-usa-endorse-hillary-clinton/	the communist party of the usa endorsed hillary clinton. see example( s )	False	['2016 election', ' 2016 presidential election', ' communism', ' communist party', ' newsbusters']	http://www.cpusa.org/	http://www.cpusa.org/article/unity-can-defeat-trump-new-dangers-and-new-opportunities/	2016/11/17	> Unity can defeat Trump: new dangers and new opportunities BY: John Bachtell | July 27, 2016One of the things we constantly assess is what is new in politics, what changes are taking place in the political, class and social balance of forces and whether enough things have changed to produce a qualitatively new moment.A number of new factors have arisen in economic, political and social life that are unsettling millions. Taken together they raise the question of whether the country has reached a qualitatively new moment fraught with the danger of far more right-wing extremism and with it the potential for these forces to make further gains.At the same time we must also ask does the political moment contain a great possibility to inflict a ringing defeat on the extreme right and its policies.What direction the country goes in depends in large measure on the fight for unity, the ability to build a broad multi-racial labor led movement working with the Democratic Party that can reach, educate and mobilize millions of voters and turn them out on Election Day.GOP ConventionThe Republican National Convention was without a doubt the most extremist major party convention I have ever seen. It was the most openly hateful, mean spirited and divisive.The Republicans gathered in Cleveland adopted the most right-wing platform ever. Not surprisingly it was also the least diverse ever.Every speech was devoted to scaring the hell out of the American public and conveying the coming apocalypse, of pushing racism and misogyny and demonizing and criminalizing Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.Calls could be heard in reference to Clinton to “lock her up, lock her up” along with the disgraceful t-shirts with misogynistic slogans.The constant appeal to hate and fear was accompanied by a call for “law and order” and the election of the one person who could fix the country – Donald Trump.The GOP convention was replete with an open embrace of the police accompanied by demonizing the Black Lives Matter movement, (especially putting up African American speakers to do the dirty work), a hysteria directed toward undocumented immigrants, and calls to destroy terrorists, etc.This hid the obvious: not one meaningful policy solution for any major problem was advanced the entire convention. It was a recognition that if the American people knew the reality of the right-wing agenda they would reject it.The disorganization and infighting among Republicans during the event belied the much bigger danger of the appeal of the message aimed at vulnerable sectors of the electorate.And of course at the center of it all is Trump. Many political commentators have at each point written him off, claiming his campaign would collapse under the weight of his hate, brutishness and disorganization. And yet each time he seems to gain strength.New factors influencing mass thinkingThere are a number of new factors emerging that are producing for some a great sense of unease, anxiety, insecurity and even fear that the country is fraying at the edges and becoming unrecognizable.After the mass killings in Orlando, the police murders of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile and the shootings of police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge, one couldn’t help but feel a nation on edge.There is a widespread sense of frustration over the unrelenting police murders, especially of African Americans and Latinos, as the horror of it all is carried live on social media. In fact police killings have risen since the beginning of the year.And viewing these videos on social media has engendered its own social trauma.A new element is the shooting of police officers. While this is horrific and is unequivocally condemned by the Black Lives Matter movement and all democratic and anti-racist forces including the CPUSA, it didn’t come as a surprise. Extremist ideology, including anti-government ideas espoused by the Baton Rouge shooter mixed with frustration makes for unpredictable responses.The Dallas and Baton Rouge police killings added to the national anxiety and opened the door for a wholesale right-wing attack on the BLM movement, which was on full display in Cleveland.To these domestic developments, we have to add the fear being created by the more common terrorist attacks across Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. The gruesome attack in Nice came in the middle of our domestic events and added to the unease and fear.But the terror attacks are occurring not just on foreign soil. There is a growth of home-grown terrorists motivated by right-wing extremism in various garbs. The mass killings in Charleston, San Bernardino and Orlando come in addition to the other regular mass killings across the country.This type and frequency of violence is new.The presence of so many weapons – one weapon for every person in the country – has reached a new qualitative point.This is underscored particularly by assault rifles being openly displayed in public as a result of the open carry laws. Weapons were being openly paraded around Cleveland and as we know there were the guns carried at the demonstration in Dallas.A vicious cycle is set in motion: the fear engendered by each mass killing prompts a rush to buy more guns.And this is on top of the guns and drugs which have been flooding communities, particularly African American and Latino communities. These working-class areas for some time have been ravaged by high homicide rates in segregated pockets of high poverty.This state of affairs didn’t come out of nowhere. It has been a process under development for some time.But here again it has reached a qualitatively new level.The framework for all of this is 30 years of right-wing and GOP reactionary ideology including racism, xenophobia, nativism, homophobia and misogyny. It has created a mass base for the right. It gave rise to Trump and the other extremist GOP primary candidates.And one has to underscore here especially the 8 years of right-wing racism and hate directed against President Obama.Let’s recall in this regard that it was Trump who started the birther movement attack on Obama. And it was in particular his campaign that has been directed at Mexican immigrants and Muslims. The politics of open hate have been taken to a new level.Ideas that were once on the fringes are being discussed in the mainstream. In the wink of an eye, he has let slide support for extremist and neo-nazi organizations, often retweeting their tweets.The growth of a right-wing base on the one hand and its backing by a section of the 1%, their entrenchment in Congress, statehouses, the mass media alongside the simultaneous growth and emergence of a more active democratic coalition around a progressive agenda, means deeply polarized politics.Long term economic factorsMeanwhile the long term economic and social crisis facing the working class and people has deepened. Working-class communities have experience over 30 years of wage stagnation and decline, including white working-class communities.Most urban areas have faced deep and constant crisis with hollowed out manufacturing, creating mass joblessness particularly among African Americans and Latinos, deep poverty, segregation, the flood of guns and drugs, gentrification.This is particularly the case in former industrial centers torn apart by loss of manufacturing jobs. Large cities and small towns alike are experiencing growing crises due to neo-liberal policies.Suicide rates have surged to a 30-year high: the highest figures are among white working-class men and women.It is also related to the epidemic in heroin and other drug use and increased deaths. Drug overdoses are the highest on record and surpass death due to guns and auto accidents.This crisis is compounded by the impact of 15-20 years of austerity policies on a federal state and local level, especially where the GOP dominates. Every public service and entity has been impacted: public education, public universities, health care, home care, housing, and Social Security.Another factor to consider is that the long-term demographic shifts have reached a qualitative new point. The prospect of a majority people of color nation is also unsettling to millions of whites, accustomed to majority status.The issues of economic stagnation, wage decline, austerity, demographic shifts, terrorism and political polarization are not short-term. Rather, they are long-term trends that will be growing factors in U.S. political life for the foreseeable future.They are the result of the deeper systemic crises of capitalism, globalization and global geo-political developments. Addressing them requires a shift in the balance of class and social forces in order to find solutions that go in the direction of radical restructuring.The movements that Trump has sparked, the mass right-wing influenced base, the fascist tinged movements, will impact politics going forward even if Trump loses.If he wins in November and if the GOP maintains its domination over Congress, the judiciary and statehouses, they will pose a new danger to workers, civil rights and the environment. And with their ability to appoint multiple Supreme Court justices in the mold of former Justice Scalia the damage will be long term.At the moment many donors are pouring their money into maintaining control of Congress and not openly supporting Trump. But most people will vote straight ticket.We have to recognize that there is a loss in confidence in government authority and its ability to act. The GOP and right wing has done all it can to render government ineffective through obstruction and austerity and attacked it ideologically at every turn.This is also reflected in the rejection of so-called establishment candidates which Trump has exploited even though he is a billionaire.Trump has exploited this anti-establishment mood. Along with itthe sense of insecurity, of fear, of rapid change have all made millions vulnerable to demagogic appeals. This is true of particularly white working people, former small business people and middle-income professionals vulnerable to demagogic appeals to fear and racism.They are attracted to the image of a strong leader that will solve all problems with simple solutions right now.The Trump campaign and GOP have calculated the only way they can win in November is by mobilizing enough white voters in key swing states coupled with voter suppression of African American, Latino and youth voters.They are targeting white working-class communities and in particular white working-class men. These voters are concentrated in key swing states particularly Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, New Hampshire, Virginia, North Carolina and Florida. Polls show very tight races in most of these states.Law and Order candidateTrump is taking a page directly out of Nixon’s Southern Strategy playbook and appeal to white working-class communities based on racism and fear.The use of racism and wedge issues is not new for the GOP. But many of today’s social factors are.With Nixon it was a similar period of high social tension coming at the end of the 1960s. Nixon ran a campaign based on ‘law and order’ which were code words for anti-African American policies. He called for the great Silent Majority to stand up, meaning white voters.The same strategy and appeal was used by Reagan. Reagan made his appeal during the deindustrialization crisis and the so-called Reagan Democrats voted for him in large numbers.In both cases, the appeal to law and order was followed by policies that attacked the gains of the 1960s particularly Civil Rights gains. But it affected the entire working class although they had a specially severe impact on African American and other communities of color.These appeals are having their effect. For example in the Ohio Republican primary, in Mahoning County, home to Youngstown and the former major steel industry, the GOP vote more than doubled with a huge crossover of white Democratic voters. It’s conceivable Mahoning County could go GOP for the first time since 1972.Defeating Trump with unityIn these circumstances it will take a massive outpouring of voters in November to defeat Trump. And there is every reason to believe the American people will not go for the hate and fear he is pedaling.There has been the growth of a broad democratic alliance over the past 25 years on a range of economic, political, social and environmental issues. Today, there are broad majorities in support of progressive ideas like taxing the rich, curbing greenhouse gases, higher minimum wage, criminal justice reform, reproductive rights, immigration reform, marriage equality, etc. This was a driving force behind the Sanders campaign.One can speak of an anti-racist majority, which helped elect the nation’s first African American president twice.Millions of whites have also been deeply influenced by the Black Lives Matter movement and the national exposure to police killing of African Americans.All these organizations are united and clear on the danger Trump poses and are prepared to do everything in their power to see he is not elected.They too will have a long-term impact on shaping U.S. politics. That includes the legacy of the Sanders campaign, which will live on and spur thousands of people to run for public office on a progressive platform.The Democratic Party convention will be a mirror opposite of the RNC. It will be multi-racial, feature the most progressive platform in history, advance thoughtful solutions on terrorism, police violence and criminal justice reform, etc.The Democratic National Convention will shred Trump’s message and image.On-the-ground expressions of multi-racial unity are driving this progressive agenda. Coalitions like Baton Rouge Together and Moral Monday Movement, led by Rev. Barber are examples.These movements are combining unity and action on the economic issues and criminal justice reform with combatting racism and hate. They unite black, white and Latino, civil rights and labor, clergy and community.They reject violence, including violence against law enforcement officers. They denounce the shooting of police officers.Among all organizations probably the AFL-CIO is the best positioned to reach white working-class voters who have been influenced by Trump. Working America carried out a study in white working-class suburbs of Ohio and Western Pa. Intensive discussions of the issues were carried out over time by people they knew.Working America found that about one-third of voters are hard core right-wing and unpersuadable. But the other two-thirds can be moved if approached in the right way, including by helping people understand Trump’s business practices, his failure as a businessman and the real life implications of Trump policies.Working America’s effort reflects a recognition that victory requires unity. It won’t be possible solely by mobilizing the vote of people of color, women and youth. It will take the mobilization and inspiration of the broadest majority of voters who reject Trump.The AFL-CIO will not, nor should the broad anti-ultra right movement, cede white working-class communities to Trump and the right wing.This approach is now being generalized by the entire AFL-CIO in swing states.Our Party and every member and supporter should be deeply involved in the campaigns, organizations, coalitions that are working to reach, educate, and mobilize millions of voters to the polls to defeat Trump and the GOP.We are also encouraging every member and supporter to utilize the People’s World coverage and analysis, and to share it widely with family, friends, neighbors and co-workers.Through our mass communication tools, the newly launched cpusa.org and the People’s World we will also help promote broad based and realistic solutions to the crises the country faces including radical economic restructuring, rapid moves to sustainability, massive jobs creation, with radical restructuring of the criminal justice system and law enforcement, advanced programs to achieve social equality, funding of education and healthcare and wealth redistribution, etc.Yes, it is a dangerous moment. But it is also a moment full of great possibility to defeat the right, create a far more favorable terrain of struggle for the working class, communities of color, women and youth and their allies and advance a progressive agenda. It all depends on the power of unity.		0

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/eu-flag-star-brexit/	the european union flag will lose a star after the brexit vote. see example( s )	False	['brexit', ' eu', ' eu flag', ' european union']	http://www.theguardian.com/	http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/david-cameron-resigns-after-uk-votes-to-leave-european-union	2016/06/24	David Cameron has resigned, bringing an abrupt end to his six-year premiership, after the British public took the momentous decision to reject his entreaties and turn their back on the European Union. The prime minister campaigned hard in the divisive referendum on Britain’s relationship with the EU, appearing at hundreds of public events up and down the country to argue that Brexit would be an act of “economic self-harm”. But a frustrated electorate used the poll to reject the status quo and, as the Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, described it, “stick two fingers up” at Britain’s politicians. “I was absolutely clear about my belief that Britain is stronger, safer and better off inside the EU. I made clear the referendum was about this, and this alone, not the future of any single politician, including myself. “But the British people made a different decision to take a different path. As such I think the country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction,” Cameron said. The prime minister’s team were left shocked and distraught by the narrow win for leave, with 52% of the vote, after polls had suggested a move towards a comfortable margin for remain in the final few days of campaigning. In the statement announcing his intention to step down, Cameron highlighted the key achievements of his premiership, including rebuilding the economy after the financial crisis and legislating to allow gay marriage. The process of choosing his successor will now begin, with Tory MPs selecting a two-person shortlist, which will then be presented to the party’s members in the country to make a final decision. Cameron called the referendum as a calculated gamble, aimed at silencing the Eurosceptics in his own party for a generation. Yet he had underestimated the backing Vote Leave would receive on his own backbenches; and reckoned without the charismatic and popular former mayor of London, Boris Johnson, becoming its figurehead. Johnson, whose support among the Tory membership shot up after he declared himself for out, is now widely seen as the most likely successor to the prime minister. The former mayor of London insisted on Friday there was “no need for haste” in negotiating Britain’s exit. Speaking at Vote Leave’s headquarters, Johnson struck a statesmanlike tone, paying tribute to Cameron’s leadership. “This does not mean that the UK will be in any way less united; nor indeed does it mean that it will be any less European,” he said. Michael Gove, speaking alongside Johnson, said representatives from all parts of Britain, and from different political traditions, should be involved in the negotiations. Cameron said it would be best for his successor to negotiate the terms of Britain’s exit – and to trigger article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, which begins the formal process of withdrawal, adding that he had already discussed his intentions with the Queen. The prime minister promised to stay on until the autumn, to “steady the ship”; but suggested a new leader should be in place by the start of the Conservative party’s conference in October. Other leading Brexiters may fancy their chances against Johnson, including Andrea Leadsom, Liam Fox, Priti Patel and Dominic Raab. Michael Gove, the justice secretary, has always strongly denied he wants the top job but has consistently polled well in surveys of grassroots Conservatives in recent months. Party modernisers are likely to rally around an alternative candidate – perhaps Theresa May, Stephen Crabb or Nicky Morgan – in an effort to stop Johnson and other leave campaigners, who tend to be on the right of the party. George Osborne’s chances of succeeding the prime minister are effectively over after he fought so forcefully alongside Cameron to remain in the EU. The scale of anger about the chancellor’s role in the campaign was laid bare when more than 60 Tory MP said they would refuse to back the “Brexit budget” he said would be necessary if Britain voted to leave. A narrow victory for remain early in the night for Newcastle, which had been expected to reject Brexit by a stronger margin, set the pattern for later results. There was a sharp divide across Britain, with London and other major cities, and Scotland, voting to remain in the EU, while smaller towns and more deprived economic areas backed Brexit. Cameron and Osborne – who were both closely involved in running the campaign – wheeled out an array of global policymakers and experts, including the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, and the US president, Barack Obama, to make the case that leaving the EU would inflict severe economic damage. But Gove caught the public mood when he said the public had had enough of “experts”. The London stock market plunged at the start of trading at 8am on Friday, as a wave of selling swept the City amid fears about the economic consequences of Britain trying to survive outside the EU single market. Boris Johnson is now widely seen as the most likely successor to the prime minister. The FTSE 100 plunged by 550 points at one stage, a fall of 8.6%. But the blue-chip index then stabilised, and is currently down 327 points, or 5.2%, at 6009 after Cameron’s statement. The pound has clawed back from its worst lows, but is still down 7.5% at $1.375 against the US dollar. It has lost 13 cents since the polls closed on Thursday night, when opinion polls suggested a remain victory. A Whitehall source said the first priority for Cameron’s post-Brexit administration was to steady the financial markets by ensuring that there would be a smooth transition to a new prime minister. To that end, there has already been “contact” between Downing Street with both Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, the source said. David Cameron is expected to arrange a meeting with both, which “will be awkward to say the least”, within the next 48 hours. Cameron’s statement was expected to be delivered at 7am but it finally came after 8.15am, a quarter of an hour after the markets opened. Labour will hold a shadow cabinet meeting on Friday morning to calibrate its response.		0
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-military-inaugural-parade/	donald trump requested tanks and missile launchers at his inaugural parade. see example( s )	Unproven	['huffington post', ' inaugural parade', ' military parades', ' trump inauguration']	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-military-equipment-inauguration_us_58811f4ae4b096b4a23091f7?ijatt9	2017/01/20	"Tap here to turn on desktop notifications to get the news sent straight to you.EDITION01/19/2017 04:41 pm ET Updated Jan 20, 2017Trump Sought Military Equipment For Inauguration, Granted 20-Plane Flyover""It's very Red Square,"" said Stephen Kerrigan, who oversaw the past two inaugurations.By Jessica SchulbergWASHINGTON ― Part of being a great president is showing off America’s military strength, according to President-elect Donald Trump .The military “may come marching down Pennsylvania Avenue,” Trump told the Washington Post in an interview published Wednesday. “That military may be flying over New York City and Washington, D.C., for parades. I mean, we’re going to be showing our military.”Trump spoke about his vision of military parades in vague terms, suggesting it was something he might oversee in the future. But according to several sources involved in his inaugural preparations, Trump has endeavored to ensure that his first day as commander-in-chief is marked by an unusual display of heavy military equipment.During the preparation for Friday’s transfer-of-power, a member of Trump’s transition team floated the idea of including tanks and missile launchers in the inaugural parade, a source involved in inaugural planning told The Huffington Post. “They were legit thinking Red Square/North Korea-style parade,” the source said, referring to massive military parades in Moscow and Pyongyang , typically seen as an aggressive display of muscle-flexing.The military, which traditionally works closely with the presidential inaugural committee, shot down the request, the source said. Their reason was twofold. Some were concerned about the optics of having tanks and missile launchers rolling down Pennsylvania Avenue. But they also worried that the tanks, which often weigh over 100,000 pounds, would destroy the roads.“I could absolutely see structural support being a reason [not to use tanks],” a Department of Defense official said. “D.C. is built on a swamp to begin with.”Defense Department spokeswoman Valerie Henderson declined to comment on the request for tanks and missile launchers, referring questions to the Trump transition team. Trump advisor Boris Epshteyn told HuffPost that the presidential inaugural committee worked closely with the military “to render appropriate honors” for Trump’s swearing-in. But he directed questions about “specific aspects” of the military’s support to the Defense Department.The Pentagon didn’t reject all of Trump’s ideas. At the request of the president-elect, there are five military flyovers ― one for each branch of the armed services ― planned for Friday’s inaugural parade, Pentagon spokesman Maj. Jamie Davis told HuffPost.The Air Force plans to fly four fighter jets: an F-35, an F-16, an F-22 and an F-15E. The Navy will fly four F/A-18 combat jets. The Army will fly four UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters. The Marines will fly four V-22 Ospreys. And the Coast Guard, which is still finalizing plans, is looking at flying four MH-65 rescue helicopters, Davis said. The number and type of planes used could change, depending on Friday’s weather, he added. Military flyovers are not typically part of inaugural parades. Outgoing President Barack Obama did not use any military aircraft at either of his inaugurations, the Defense Department official said. There were no flyovers at President George W. Bush’s 2005 inauguration, but he did have a flyover during his 2001 opening ceremony, which occurred two days before the inauguration. President Ronald Reagan considered including flyovers in his second inauguration in 1985, but one never materialized, the official said. Before that, the last president to include military flyovers as part of his inauguration was President Harry Truman in 1949.Stephen Kerrigan, who held top positions in Obama’s first and second presidential inaugural committees, said he was “shocked” to hear about the planned flyovers for Friday. “It seems unnecessary and the optics don’t seem appropriate. … It’s very Red Square,” he said.Airspace over Washington is highly restricted. In the days after the September 11 attacks, planes flying over the city terrified people, Kerrigan said. “If there are fighter jets flying over Washington, people are going to assume something bad is happening.”The flyovers will not add to the cost of the inaugural events, Davis said. Friday’s events will serve as training for the pilots, who are required to fly a set number of hours each month “to maintain proficiency.”Traditionally, the military plays a big role in inaugurations — but not by display of heavy weaponry. The armed forces usually contributes “ musical units, color guards, salute batteries and honor cordons .” Eight-hundred-and-twenty service members were authorized to help coordinate the inaugural events and 5,000 service members will participate on the day of the ceremonies, the Joint Task Force North Capital Region said in September.UPDATE: Jan. 20 ― The military canceled the flyovers due to poor weather conditions on Friday, Davis said. ​ "		1

What do LEGOs teach?LEGOs are one of the most educational and inviting toys available out there for children! The skills kids learn from these small units are incredible and essential! If you’ve never really thought about them as an educational method, here are some benefits of playing with LEGOs.– Communication and teamworkAssigning roles and discussing, sharing your building strategies is an essential part of a LEGO building process. Therefore, it can develop teamwork and communication skills in children, and even help to boost their language development. Many studies have proved that kids who often play with building blocks generally have better verbal skills.– Problem-solvingThinking laterally and creatively to save a LEGO design is only a small part of the thinking process of playing with these little bricks and blocks. By creating strategies and plans to build a model in the quickest time, your kids can develop some essential life skills that can be helpful in later life.– Concentration and focusIt takes time for kids to learn how to concentrate and settle, mainly to do this without feeling pressured or frustrated. For adults and teenagers, playing with LEGO blocks and bricks can help you to forget all the other worries in life in a meditative fashion. In other words, immersing in LEGO game can help with stress management and relaxation, which can make sure that you have a regular fix!2. Are LEGOs good for exceptional motor skills?Pre-school kids with weak exceptional motor skills might be frustrated and worried when they attempt to use some tools such as markers or paint brushes and stay away from them all the time. Thus, it is significant to find some playful activities which do build not only the kid’s confidence but also strengthen these beautiful motor muscles. Enhancing exceptional motor skills by playing with Lego bricks has been proved very successful. It turns out that young kids love building with these small blocks, and yet they also help strengthen those fingers and hands.LEGO bricks often come in a wide variety of sizes and shapes, which require smaller hands to learn how to take apart or assemble. These small turns and twists of their arms, fingers, and hands improve dexterity and coordination which kids need for independent dressing, crafts, and handwriting.Through the manipulation and control of LEGO blocks , children also learn how to apply differential pressure: some units need a great amount of pressure when building, while others need a small one. The advantages of this hands-on trial and error process are much more valuable than any process we can teach as parents.3. A brief history of LEGOs– BeginningsEstablished in 1932, the LEGO company started by a master carpenter named Ole Christiansen , who lived in Billund, Denmark. In the beginning, this small store created ironing boards, stepladders, and wooden toys.Over the next few years, the store grew exponentially to 50 employees in 1948. The product line also developed as well, with the introduction of clothes hangers, LEGO ducks, wooden blocks, and plastic balls for babies.In 1947, the company purchased a plastic injection-molding machine, which was used to produce mass plastic toys. Until 1949, LEGO had produced nearly 200 different forms of toys, including automatic binding bricks – the predecessors of today’s LEGO toys.– The birth of LEGO BricksIn 1953, Christiansen renamed the automatic binding bricks as LEGO bricks. And in the next few years, many advanced and patented technologies were invented to transform these units into the models that we see today.By the early 60s, LEGO products had gone international, with distribution in Lebanon, Germany, Belgium, France, the UK, Switzerland, and Sweden.In 1964, consumers could purchase LEGO sets for the first time, which included all the instructions and parts to build a specific model. Later, LEGO company created and introduced many world-famous themed lines such as castle (1978), town (1978) space (1979), Pirates (1989), Star Wars (1999), Harry Potter (2001).By 2015, the LEGO toys were distributed in more than 130 countries.With more than 80 years of operation, these small plastic blocks have sparked the imagination of kids all over the world, and that is the reason why they are always one of the most popular toys.		0

And a miniskirted New York City flower child avows that ""one of the leading cigarette companies -- I think it's American -- has bought large plots of land in Louisiana, Mexico, and Central America specifically for growing pot."" [...]Such rumors have been growing for the past year or so, and they are obviously disconcerting to tobacco men. Says one executive, who would rather remain anonymous, ""We have enough trouble dealing with the cigarette health scare without selling drugs, too."" Another adds categorically: ""No company in the industry has had anything to do with marijuana, nor does anyone want to."" Others term the rumors ""ridiculous"" and ""blatantly false.""Despite repeated denials, however, the rumors flourish, and not just in the underground press alone. Last year, the New York Knickerbocker, a local tabloid, ran an article stating that American Tobacco Co. had registered the names ""Acapulco Gold"" and ""Morocco Red"" just in case marijuana become legalized. American immediately denied this and branded the story as ""nothing short of irresponsible reporting."" And a check with the U.S. Patent Office, where tobacco men have registered hundreds of never-used names over the years, reveals such exotic potential brands as Luv and Laredo -- but nothing of recent vintage that would directly connote marijuana. [...]Rolling Stone, 4 March 1971, p. 25DOPE NOTESThe following communication came to our offices on January 15th:DEAR MR. WENNER:Your newspaper, as well as many others, have been carrying so many speculative pieces on cigarette smoking and marijuana, we thought you'd like to have this to set the record straight.Sincerely yours,FREDERICK PANZERTHE TOBACCO INSTITUTE, INC.""Rumors about the cigarette industry's involvement with marijuana are as persistent as they are false,"" said a spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, adding: ""Because both tobacco and marijuana are so commonly used in cigarette form, these rumors are plausible lies which appeal to people who have a strong wish to believe them, either because they are pro-marijuana or anti-tobacco, or both.""Following are statements of all six major cigarette companies:""We are unalterably opposed to the legalization of marijuana, and therefore disclaim any activity which would remotely involve marijuana.""E. P. FINCH, PRESIDENTBROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CO.""With respect to marijuana, Reynolds is not now considering -- nor have we ever considered -- the eventual sale of any product containing marijuana any place in the world. The published rumors often include claims that Reynolds has registered trademarks on possible brand names for marijuana cigarettes and that the company has purchased tracts of land for growing marijuana. There is no truth in either claim.""W. S. SMITH, PRESIDENTR. J. REYNOLDS TOBACCO CO.""The simple fact is that marijuana is an illegal product. As a responsible company we have no interest in anything which is illegal here at Phillip Morris and we have held no discussions nor made any plans concerning the marketing of that product.""JOSEPH F. CULLMAN, 3RD, CHAIRMANPHILIP MORRIS, INC.""We have absolutely no intention of breaking any laws or circumventing them in any way. This obviously applies to the production and marketing of marijuana.""KEN MCALLISTER, PRESIDENTLIGGETT & MYERS TOBACCO CO.""We have on numerous occasions categorically denied any interest in or involvement with marijuana. We confirm that denial again.""CURTIS H. JUDGE, PRESIDENTLORILLARD""We are a responsible corporate citizen and, as such, American brands has no interest whatsoever in any illegal products, including marijuana.""ROBERT B. WALKER,Well, that's the record set straight, all right. We say: ""famous last words.""Rolling Stone, 27 January 1977, p. 49The Rolling Paper Revueby Abe Peck[Peck visited the headquarters of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in Arlington, Virginia.]I looked up the trademarks for Acapulco Gold and Panama Red. And I found them! There was an Acapulco gold registered to Heublein Inc., of Hartford, Connecticut, the people behind everything from Kentucky Fried Chicken to premixed drinks. Another Acapulco Gold registry was held by Charmer Industries, a liquor distributor based in Smithtown, New York. And there was the Acapulco Gold trademark held by RD III Ventures of Great Neck, Long Island.Panama Red was registered to Heads and Company of Indianapolis. And when I moved to less predictable color schemes, I found Jamaica Gold registered to Brick-Hanauer of Waltham, Massachusetts, and Tennessee Green held by a Nashville company of the same name.There was only one hitch: the Acapulco Golds were, respectively, a chip dip, a tequila and a suntan oil. The Panama Red, a cologne. The Jamaica Gold, a cigar. The Tennessee Green, anticlimactically, a matchbook.There were no marijuana registrations. And, if we believe C. Morten Wendt, the director of trademark examining operations, there won't be any until legalization, when and if.Wendt's name reminded me of ""C. W. Moss,"" Bonnie and Clyde's sidekick. Seated in his office down the hall from the Trademark Search room, Wendt himself, mid-50s, dapper, his hair neatly trimmed, looked a bit like the bankers the Barrow gang loved to visit. In a high-pitched voice, Wendt explained why it is currently impossible to register any trademark for marijuana.""You see, the owner of a trademark acquires property rights through use of that mark before the public as a means of identifying goods. Now, trademarks for marijuana are not registerable. The mark must be in lawful use in order to be registered. Our government has not legalized the sale of marijuana. Therefore,"" he said with the confidence of a man who lives by the rules, ""marijuana is not a product that moves in commerce. Therefore it cannot have a registerable trademark.""Wendt asserted that nobody would use the name ""Acapulco Gold"" for marijuana even if it became legal. ""It's more or less a generic term for it. And therefore, nobody has the exclusive right to the use of it.""I felt better. I couldn't register it, but neither could anybody else. But I recalled that Amorphia had raised money by selling Acapulco Gold rolling papers. I asked Wendt about it, and he replied that they never actually registered their common-law trademark.""We would not register that,"" he said, ""for the simple reason that we would say it would be deceptive.""""In the sense that it refers to a marijuana product?""""Right,"" he answered.Assassination buffs have ""smoking pistol"" theories to explain their conspiracies. I asked Wendt about what might be called a ""smoking reefer"" conspiracy -- that the cigarette companies have already registered the most commercial names that could be applied to marijuana.""Oh that's all false! That's all false!"" Wendt seemed genuinely angry. ""For one thing, our records are open to the public. There is no such thing as reserving a mark. We have combated this story for the last 15 years, and so it is absolutely false.""There's no protection given to tobacco companies, and they would never -- it would be very poor business if they were to take one of their known brands, their known trademarks, in the event that marijuana does become legal, and use it upon a marijuana cigarette.""""Where do you think this tobacco company rumor came from?""""I don't know -- but honestly, I've been asked it by every one of the news syndicates and the New York Times and I don't know how many others.""I recalled a book called Pot Art, which quoted Ronald Reagan on the tobacco conspiracy. I gave the ""smoking reefer"" theory one last try.""You know that Reagan said in 1972 that there are 14 tobacco companies which have trademarked marijuana.""""What,"" Wendt replied icily, ""does Reagan know about trademarks?""JACK ANDERSON'S column appeared the day after I typed up my notes on Crystal City. A call to his office revealed that the people who wrote and researched the column under Anderson's byline had no evidence that specific tobacco companies were preparing for marijuana cultivation on their land. ""But,"" said Gary Cohn, the reporter on the story, ""they all own land down there which, according to my sources, is perfectly convertible for grass."" And Cohn made a new and interesting point:""The way I understand it is that if the company has a trademark for a smoking product -- say cigars or cigarettes -- you can transfer it to another smoking product. That's what I believe and what some legal experts who've researched the matter have told me."" Cohn agreed with Wendt's contention that liquor companies outside the smoker's article class wouldn't have a head start with their names if marijuana became legal. Companies like Acapulco and Tijuana Smalls cigars, though, might.The image of a smoking reefer pervaded the room. I called Wendt back.Though not an Anderson fan, Wendt admitted that the tobacco companies could potentially transfer their trademarks within the smoker's article class. But he made his own interesting point.""I doubt if any one of them would transfer,"" he said. ""Even if marijuana becomes popular, there's such a thing as the good will of the product. The product has been established as a tobacco product, and not everyone who smokes tobacco would want to smoke marijuana. I think it would be very poor business policy. If it was not labeled that the ingredient had been changed, the purchaser would have cause of action against the owner of the mark.""So there I was, blocked from making a fortune, with only the word of the director of trademark examining operations that the companies would respect the good will of their products as my consolation. It seemed like there was only one thing left to do, and I did it. That night, before going to sleep, I left a flowerpot with a hardy green weed in it on my hotel balcony. The next morning I rendezvoused with a Washington trademark attorney. Call him ""Deep Toke.""""I have never done it for any of my clients,"" Deep Toke said about registering handy names. ""And I'm not sure there's anything unethical about it. If you're talking about actually putting out a product -- Tijuana Smalls is an example. That's a very viable product. Now they picked a name for it that may provide some help if marijuana is ever legalized. But that's a very good product for that particular company, I'm sure, and their main interest is probably in cigars.""""In your opinion,"" I asked Deep Toke, ""have tobacco companies registered names for marijuana?""""My reply would be that they have registered a number of names that may be useful in connection with marijuana cigarettes if they were ever legalized. But I don't think that was their intention in doing it. I really don't.""Needless to say, it wasn't hard to get the tobacco companies to agree. ""Our own company has no plans for the production of marijuana cigarettes,"" said Dan Provost, director of corporate communications for Liggett Group Inc., ""and reliable sources have said that no other company has either."" Harold Edison, trade-relations manager of the General Cigar and Tobacco Company, makers of Tijuana Smalls cigars, said, ""We knew there was a danger with the name, that Tijuana had a reputation. But,"" he added, perhaps a bit too kind to our neighbor to the south, ""we found that the name 'Tijuana' had merit aside from any drug aspect: it's associated with liveliness, youth and fun."" The American Tobacco Company: ""We don't discuss marijuana at all."" [...]Posted by Brian Chapman at"		0
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/last-words/	a photograph shows a girl killed in a drunk-driving accident, with accompanying text recording her last words. see example( s )	False	['accidents', ' drunk driving']	https://web.archive.org/	https://web.archive.org/web/20100329004309/http://www.every15minutes.com/aboutus/	2016/10/17	" Life's lessons are best learned through experience. Unfortunately, when the target audience is teens and the topic is drinking and driving, experience is not the teacher of choice.The Every 15 Minutes Program offers real-life experience without the real-life risks. This emotionally charged program, entitled Every 15 Minutes, is an event designed to dramatically instill teenagers with the potentially dangerous consequences of drinking alcohol. This powerful program will challenge students to think about drinking, personal safety, and the responsibility of making mature decisions when lives are involved.During the first day events the ""Grim Reaper"" calls students who have been selected from a cross-section of the entire student body out of class. One student is removed from class every 15 minutes. A police officer will immediately enter the classroom to read an obituary which has been written by the ""dead"" student's parent(s) - explaining the circumstances of their classmate's demise and the contributions the student has made to the school and the community. A few minutes later, the student will return to class as the ""living dead,"" complete with white face make-up, a coroner's tag, and a black Every 15 Minutes T-shirt. From that point on ""victims"" will not speak or interact with other students for the remainder of the school day. Simultaneously, uniformed officers will make mock death notifications to the parents of these children at their home, place of employment or business.After lunch, a simulated traffic collision will be viewable on the school grounds. Rescue workers will treat injured student participants. These students will experience first hand, the sensations of being involved in a tragic, alcohol-related collision. The coroner will handle fatalities on the scene, while the injured students will be extricated by the jaws-of-life manned by Fire-Fighters and Paramedics. Police Officers will investigate, arrest, and book the student ""drunk driver"". Student participants will continue their experience by an actual trip to the morgue, the hospital emergency room, and to the police department jail for the purpose of being booked for ""drunk driving"".At the end of the day, those students who participated in the staged accident as well as those who were made-up as the ""living dead"" will be transported to a local hotel for an overnight student retreat. The retreat will simulate the separation from friends and family. A support staff of counselors and police officers will facilitate the retreat.During the most powerful program of the retreat, the students will be taken through an audio - visualization of their own death. Then each student will write a letter to his or her parents starting out with . . .""Dear Mom and Dad, every fifteen minutes someone in the United States dies from an alcohol related traffic collision, and today I died. I never had the chance to tell you.......""Parents will also be asked to write similar letters to their children. These letters will be shared the following day when students and parents will be reunited at a school assembly.The students will engage in ""Challenge Day"" exercises and some fun and games. Impaired simulator goggles will be used to allow students to experience firsthand the potentially fatal consequences of alcohol and drug impairment. The goggles will allow students the opportunity to understand the dangers of impaired driving without taking a drop of alcohol or using drugs of any type. Research shows that those who learn from hands-on experience retain two to four times more than those who learn from just listening, or from listening and seeing.On the following morning, a mock funeral service will be held at the High School. The assembly will began with a video of normal school day activities including scenes from the first day of the ""Grim Reaper"" and the staged accident. The assembly will be hosted by an Officer (Project Coordinator), who will guide the audience through the devastating effects of losing a loved one due to a bad choice. Speakers will include students who will read letters to their parents, police officers, and hospital personnel who shared their emotional trauma of dealing with kids killed in accidents. Parents will share their personal reflections of their involvement in this program. We will also have a powerful speaker who actually lost a child to a drunk driver.The focus of the assembly stresses that the decision to consume alcohol can affect many more people than just the one who drinks. This very emotional and heart-wrenching event will illustrate to students, the potentially dangerous consequences of their use of alcohol, regardless of how casual they believe their use may be.This event includes the participation of our Police and Fire Departments, High School Staff, Local Hospital, Video Production Crew, Community Officials, District Attorney's Office and a wide cross-section of the community at-large. It is our goal to utilize the strength, talent and resources of business and industry to prevent drunk driving."		0
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/olympic-rings-tattoo-ban/	athletes will be disqualified from paralympic or olympic events if they sport olympics rings tattoos. see example( s )	Mixture	['olympics', ' paralympics', ' tattoos']	http://olympics.nbcsports.com/	http://olympics.nbcsports.com/2016/05/02/paralympic-swimmer-josef-craig-disqualified-olympic-rings-tattoo/	2016/05/03	PARIS (AP) — If the upcoming French Open showdown between Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova provides any of the sort of animus and back-and-forth they manage to stir up away from the court, look out. During a news conference after both won Saturday to set up the longtime rivals’ fourth-round matchup at Roland Garros, Williams criticized Sharapova’s autobiography as “hearsay” and twice brought up the Russian’s 15-month doping ban. Producing by far the best performance in her return to Grand Slam tennis — 16 months after her last major tournament and nine months after having a baby — Williams played cleanly and powerfully in a 6-3, 6-4 tour de force against 11th-seeded Julia Goerges that lasted a mere 75 minutes and lacked much in the way of theatrics. “There is still a ways to go, but it’s moving in the right direction,” said Williams, who made only three unforced errors in the first set, 12 in all. Sharapova advanced with a similarly lopsided win, 6-2, 6-1 against 2016 U.S. Open runner-up Karolina Pliskova. Now comes the drama: Williams vs. Sharapova on Monday with a quarterfinal spot at stake. They have verbally clashed in the past, such as a 2013 public spat about their private lives. Williams, 36, owns 23 major singles titles. Sharapova, 31, has won five. Williams has won the French Open three times, Sharapova twice. They are the only active women with a career Grand Slam; they are two of six in history to accomplish that. Both have been ranked No. 1. But the head-to-head history is overwhelmingly in Williams’ favor: She has won 19 of 21 meetings, including 18 in a row. “Quite frankly, she’s probably a favorite in this match, for sure,” Williams said with a chuckle. “She’s been playing … for over a year now. I just started. The last time Sharapova beat Williams was in 2004. The last time they played was in the 2016 Australian Open quarterfinals, Sharapova’s final appearance before her 15-month drug suspension. Williams was asked about Sharapova’s book, which was published last year. It contains quite a bit of material about the American, including a reference to Williams crying in the locker room after losing to Sharapova in the Wimbledon final 14 years ago. “As a fan, I wanted to read the book and I was really excited for it to come out and I was really happy for her. And then the book was a lot about me. I was surprised about that, to be honest,” Williams said. There were plenty of other results involving top names at the French Open on Saturday. Other women moving into the fourth round included 2016 champion Garbine Muguruza, two-time runner-up Simona Halep, two-time major title winner Angelique Kerber and reigning U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens. Men’s winners included 10-time champion Rafael Nadal, No. 3 Marin Cilic, No. 5 Juan Martin del Potro, No. 6 Kevin Anderson and No. 9 John Isner. The story of Day 7, though, was what everyone can look forward to on Day 9: Williams vs. Sharapova. This is Williams’ first Grand Slam tournament since January 2017, when she won the Australian Open while pregnant. The American made a brief foray on the tour earlier this season, but she played only four matches. Against Goerges, the careless errors were largely absent. The missing energy was back. In front of a crowd that included former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson, it took 15 minutes for Williams to gain the upper hand, sprinting to reach a drop shot and whip a cross-court forehand passing winner for a 3-1 lead. Williams yelled loudly and raised her fist. It was almost as if she’d never left the scene. “Any time you play against Serena, you know what you’re up against. You know the challenge that is upon you,” Sharapova said. NBC’s broadcast coverage of the French Open continues Sunday from 12-3 p.m. ET, also streaming on NBCSports.com/live and the NBC Sports app.		1
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/paul-ryan-out-speaker-house/	wisconsin republican paul ryan is going to be replaced as speaker of the house.	Unproven	['american conservative herald', ' americanconservativeherald.com', ' breitbart', ' donald trump', ' paul ryan', ' republicans']	http://americanconservativeherald.com/	http://americanconservativeherald.com/paul-ryan-found-out/	2017/04/26	Share On FacebookOver the past few months, we have been really disgusted with Paul Ryan and his treatment, or should I say, disdain for President Trump.As Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan was unable to work with his own House Republican members, and refused to work with the president on repealing Obamacare. This should have been the easiest bill to pass in the House, as Americans are chomping at the bit for better healthcare. Instead, he gave us bad bill that didn’t make it to the floor for a vote. Now, we’re seeing the same issues when it comes to tax reform.Let’s just say that America is fed up with the likes of Paul Ryan, and now there is a poll that should force him to think about resigning as Speaker of the House!From Independent Journal Review:While the Trump team is likely toasting to their growing approval [up to 50 percent], one member of the Republican Party is going to have to put the celebration on hold.According to a Pew Research study, only 29% of Americans approve of Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.The dismal approval ratings for Ryan come after he failed to replace the Affordable Care Act, something that Americans blame Ryan for more than they blame President Trump…As well Americans should. Paul Ryan made a complete spectacle of himself and completely embarrassed the Republican party! Even now, the Freedom Caucus has created a great bill that would repeal and replace Obamacare – most Republicans are on board – but yet Paul Ryan has yet to move the bill into committee to ultimately go to the floor. Why? We can only speculate that his ego is so bruised from his first Obamacare attempt that he couldn’t handle the fact that a better bill without his name on it is more well-received.It’s important to note that Ryan’s low approval ratings aren’t just a Republican versus Democrat phenomenon.Ryan is much more disliked than several of his predecessors.According to Time:“75% of Democrats disapprove of Ryan’s job performance. Less than half of Democrats — 49% — disapproved of Boehner’s, and 61% disapproved of Gingrich’s.”As for those before Ryan, Time notes:“Former House Speaker John Boehner had a 36% approval rating. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, then-House speaker, had a 35% approval rating, and former House speaker Newt Gingrich scored 43%.”Ouch. If your approval rating is lower than Nancy Pelosi’s, it may be time to leave. Do you agree?		1

Draped in her iconic white sari, she traveled the globe condemning abortion even when doing so was inconvenient and unwelcome.While lunching at the White House, First lady Hillary Clinton reportedly asked Mother Teresa why America had not yet elected a woman president. “She has probably been aborted,” Mother Teresa replied.During her acceptance speech of the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize Mother Teresa first popularized her signature condemnation of abortion.“The greatest destroyer of peace today is the cry of the innocent unborn child,” she told the crowd of nobles, politicians, and celebrities. After a moment of deathly silence Mother Teresa continued.“For if a mother can murder her own child, in her own womb, what is left for you and for me? To kill each other.”“Today millions of unborn children are being killed, but we say nothing.”Then she raised her voice with alarm.SUPPORT LIFENEWS!

Give them a chance to be born.”Her plea was not heeded, and she continued to speak for the unborn unabashedly.In 1985 she was a special invitee at the 40th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations during the height of the Cold War.“We all want peace, and yet, and yet we are frightened of nuclears [weapons], we are frightened of this new disease [HIV/AIDS]. But we are not afraid to kill an innocent child, that little unborn child, who has been created for that same purpose: to love God and to love you and me.”At the 1994 National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, she surprised Bill and Hillary Clinton with scathing remarks against abortion as they sat close to her. She called abortion “a war against the child, a direct killing of the innocent child, murder by the mother herself.”“Any country that accepts abortion is not teaching its people to love, but to use any violence to get what they want. This is why the greatest destroyer of love and peace is abortion,” she said. President and First Lady remained quietly seated as the entire room erupted into a standing ovation after her speechShe also challenged those with a narrow view of feminism, such as when she said motherhood was “the gift of God to women” and that abortion destroyed it. “Those who want to make women and men the same are all in favor of abortion,” she stated in a message to the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995.LifeNews.com Note: Stefano Gennarini, J.D. writes for the Center for Family and Human Rights Institute.

LESTER HOLT: Good evening from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. I'm Lester Holt, anchor of ""NBC Nightly News."" I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate. The participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. The commission drafted tonight's format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns. The 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long. We'll explore three topic areas tonight: Achieving prosperity; America's direction; and securing America. At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead-off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond. From that point until the end of the segment, we'll have an open discussion. The questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns. The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying. I will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment, as we welcome the candidates: Democratic nominee for president of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. CLINTON: How are you, Donald? HOLT: Good luck to you. Well, I don't expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled. We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and we're going to press for specifics. I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people. Candidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values. So, let's begin. We're calling this opening segment ""Achieving Prosperity."" And central to that is jobs. There are two economic realities in America today. There's been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation. However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works? CLINTON: Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us. The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together. Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot. First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes. I want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business. We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work. CLINTON: I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing. If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top. And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work. I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under. So let's have paid family leave, earned sick days. Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college. How are we going to do it? We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes. Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you. We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country. You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better. I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th. HOLT: Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, the same question to you. It's about putting money -- more money into the pockets of American workers. You have up to two minutes. TRUMP: Thank you, Lester. Our jobs are fleeing the country. They're going to Mexico. They're going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight. Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing. So we're losing our good jobs, so many of them. When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world. They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much. So Ford is leaving. You see that, their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They're all leaving. And we can't allow it to happen anymore. As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later. But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis. They left -- fired 1,400 people. They're going to Mexico. So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this. TRUMP: We cannot let it happen. Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan. It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch. Companies will come. They will build. They will expand. New companies will start. And I look very, very much forward to doing it. We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs. HOLT: Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond? CLINTON: Well, I think that trade is an important issue. Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent. And we need to have smart, fair trade deals. We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions. And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again. In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had. I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy. We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes. I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives. I understand that. You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. I don't buy that. I have a different experience. My father was a small-businessman. He worked really hard. He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going. And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow. That's the kind of economy I want us to see again. HOLT: Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can. You've talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you've promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans. How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas? How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back? TRUMP: Well, for one thing -- and before we start on that -- my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs. Our country's in deep trouble. We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China. They're the best, the best ever at it. What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing. So we have to do that. We have to renegotiate our trade deals. And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do. Let me give you the example of Mexico. They have a VAT tax. We're on a different system. When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax. When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately. When they sell into us, there's no tax. It's a defective agreement. It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it. Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me. But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently. She's been doing this for 30 years. And why hasn't she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective. Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact... HOLT: Let me interrupt just a moment, but... TRUMP: Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement. They should have been doing this for years. What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion. We cannot do it any longer, Lester. HOLT: Back to the question, though. How do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers? How do you make them bring the jobs back? TRUMP: Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving. I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them. They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever. And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck. But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong. And once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies. So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving. We have to stop them from leaving. And that's a big, big factor. HOLT: Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here. CLINTON: Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago. We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm. In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. He said, back in 2006, ""Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money."" Well, it did collapse. TRUMP: That's called business, by the way. CLINTON: Nine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs. Five million people lost their homes. And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out. Now, we have come back from that abyss. And it has not been easy. So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place. Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession. They've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy. Take clean energy. Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century. Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it's real. TRUMP: I did not. I did not. I do not say that. CLINTON: I think science is real. TRUMP: I do not say that. CLINTON: And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad. And here's what we can do. We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. We can have enough clean energy to power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity. So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place. TRUMP: She talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company, our country. That was a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that one. Now, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work. Our energy policies are a disaster. Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt. You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt. The Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it. He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact. So I will tell you this. We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs. And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they're not doing it. And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone. And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this. You've been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now? For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions. CLINTON: Well, actually... TRUMP: I will bring -- excuse me. I will bring back jobs. You can't bring back jobs. CLINTON: Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit. TRUMP: Yeah, for 30 years. CLINTON: And I have -- well, not quite that long. I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again... TRUMP: Well, he approved NAFTA... CLINTON: ... million new jobs, a balanced budget... TRUMP: He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country. CLINTON: Incomes went up for everybody. Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we're actually going to look at the facts. When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test. Will they create jobs in America? Will they raise incomes in America? And are they good for our national security? Some of them I voted for. The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against. And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals. But let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy. I think it is a part of it, and I've said what I'm going to do. I'm going to have a special prosecutor. We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable. When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent. We increased them to China 50 percent. So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs. HOLT: Very quickly... TRUMP: But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to... CLINTON: Well, I've been a senator, Donald... TRUMP: You haven't done it. You haven't done it. CLINTON: And I have been a secretary of state... CLINTON: And I have done a lot... TRUMP: Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry. CLINTON: Well, that's your opinion. That is your opinion. TRUMP: You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent. NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country. And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it. Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate. But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA. Nothing will ever top NAFTA. CLINTON: Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out. I wrote about that in... TRUMP: You called it the gold standard. TRUMP: You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen. TRUMP: And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it. CLINTON: Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts. The facts are -- I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated... CLINTON: ... which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't. I wrote about that in my book... TRUMP: So is it President Obama's fault? CLINTON: ... before you even announced. TRUMP: Is it President Obama's fault? CLINTON: Look, there are differences... TRUMP: Secretary, is it President Obama's fault? CLINTON: There are... TRUMP: Because he's pushing it. CLINTON: There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world. And I think it's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again. That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt. TRUMP: But you have no plan. CLINTON: But in -- oh, but I do. TRUMP: Secretary, you have no plan. CLINTON: In fact, I have written a book about it. It's called ""Stronger Together."" You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore... TRUMP: That's about all you've... HOLT: Folks, we're going to... CLINTON: ... or at an airport near you. HOLT: We're going to move to... CLINTON: But it's because I see this -- we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth. We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business. So we have a very robust set of plans. And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession. TRUMP: You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history. You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. You are going to drive business out. Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place. And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan. I'm very proud of it. It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs. But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence. When I go around -- Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over. And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing -- the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation. You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business. And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse. I'm going to cut regulations. I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story. HOLT: Let me get you to pause right there, because we're going to move into -- we're going to move into the next segment. We're going to talk taxes... CLINTON: That can't -- that can't be left to stand. HOLT: Please just take 30 seconds and then we're going to go on. CLINTON: I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so... CLINTON: So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact-checker. So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look. Because what I have proposed... TRUMP: And take a look at mine, also, and you'll see. CLINTON: ... would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt. What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses. What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy. And I think it's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country. HOLT: Well, you just opened the next segment. TRUMP: Well, could I just finish -- I think I... HOLT: I'm going to give you a chance right here... TRUMP: I think I should -- you go to her website, and you take a look at her website. HOLT: ... with a new 15-minute segment... TRUMP: She's going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion. HOLT: Mr. Trump, I'm going to... TRUMP: And look at her website. You know what? It's no difference than this. She's telling us how to fight ISIS. Just go to her website. She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website. I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much. HOLT: The next segment, we're continuing... CLINTON: Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS. HOLT: ... achieving prosperity... TRUMP: No, no, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do. CLINTON: No, we're not. No, we're not. TRUMP: See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do. No wonder you've been fighting -- no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life. CLINTON: That's a -- that's -- go to the -- please, fact checkers, get to work. HOLT: OK, you are unpacking a lot here. And we're still on the issue of achieving prosperity. And I want to talk about taxes. The fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy. Secretary Clinton, you're calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans. I'd like you to further defend that. And, Mr. Trump, you're calling for tax cuts for the wealthy. I'd like you to defend that. And this next two-minute answer goes to you, Mr. Trump. TRUMP: Well, I'm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs. They're going to expand their companies. They're going to do a tremendous job. I'm getting rid of the carried interest provision. And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy. It's a great thing for the middle class. It's a great thing for companies to expand. And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can't bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what -- is so bad. So what they're doing is they're leaving our country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country. And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back. Instead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together. Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something. And here's the thing. Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion. I happen to think it's double that. It's probably $5 trillion that we can't bring into our country, Lester. And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful. But we have no leadership. And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton. HOLT: All right. You have two minutes of the same question to defend tax increases on the wealthiest Americans, Secretary Clinton. CLINTON: I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened. CLINTON: Why not? Yeah, why not? You know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case... TRUMP: There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country. HOLT: This is -- this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes, please. CLINTON: Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester. We've looked at your tax proposals. I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas. I happen to support that. TRUMP: Then you didn't read it. CLINTON: I happen to -- I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit. But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do. You've proposed an approach that has a... TRUMP: Who gave it that name? The first I've -- who gave it that name? HOLT: Mr. Trump, this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes. CLINTON: ... $4 billion tax benefit for your family. And when you look at what you are proposing... TRUMP: How much? How much for my family? CLINTON: ... it is... TRUMP: Lester, how much? CLINTON: ... as I said, trumped-up trickle-down. Trickle-down did not work. It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009. Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked. And a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that. And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class. CLINTON: I don't think top-down works in America. I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate. Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy. Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top. HOLT: Mr. Trump, we're... TRUMP: Typical politician. All talk, no action. Sounds good, doesn't work. Never going to happen. Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on. Now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression. And believe me: We're in a bubble right now. And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down. We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble. And we better be awfully careful. And we have a Fed that's doing political things. This Janet Yellen of the Fed. The Fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level. And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job. The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton. HOLT: Mr. Trump, we're talking about the burden that Americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns. And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to -- who he owes it to and any business conflicts. Don't Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest? TRUMP: I don't mind releasing -- I'm under a routine audit. And it'll be released. And -- as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released. But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have. It shows income -- in fact, the income -- I just looked today -- the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million. If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised. But that's the kind of thinking that our country needs. When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year. You know what that is? That means, who's negotiating these trade deals? We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals. HOLT: The IRS says an audit... HOLT: ... of your taxes -- you're perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit. And so the question, does the public's right to know outweigh your personal... TRUMP: Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit. Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years. I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited. I said, do you get audited? I get audited almost every year. And in a way, I should be complaining. I'm not even complaining. I don't mind it. It's almost become a way of life. I get audited by the IRS. But other people don't. I will say this. We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of. I will release my tax returns -- against my lawyer's wishes -- when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted. As soon as she releases them, I will release. I will release my tax returns. And that's against -- my lawyers, they say, ""Don't do it."" I will tell you this. No -- in fact, watching shows, they're reading the papers. Almost every lawyer says, you don't release your returns until the audit's complete. When the audit's complete, I'll do it. But I would go against them if she releases her e-mails. HOLT: So it's negotiable? TRUMP: It's not negotiable, no. Let her release the e-mails. Why did she delete 33,000... HOLT: Well, I'll let her answer that. But let me just admonish the audience one more time. There was an agreement. We did ask you to be silent, so it would be helpful for us. Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns. You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it. We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit. So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns? And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be. CLINTON: Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks. Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax. TRUMP: That makes me smart. CLINTON: So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health. And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide. And the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate. They don't give you all the details that tax returns would. And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see. And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding. And we'll guess. We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding. But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts? Who does he owe money to? Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them. HOLT: He also -- he also raised the issue of your e-mails. Do you want to respond to that? CLINTON: I do. You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail. TRUMP: That's for sure. CLINTON: And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently. But I'm not going to make any excuses. It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that. TRUMP: That was more than a mistake. That was done purposely. OK? That was not a mistake. That was done purposely. When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they're not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it's disgraceful. And believe me, this country thinks it's -- really thinks it's disgraceful, also. As far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns. That I can tell you. You learn a lot from financial disclosure. And you should go down and take a look at that. The other thing, I'm extremely underleveraged. The report that said $650 -- which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money. It's not a lot of money relative to what I had. The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was -- actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion. And the $650 isn't even on that. But it's not $650. It's much less than that. But I could give you a list of banks, I would -- if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks. These are very fine institutions, very fine banks. I could do that very quickly. I am very underleveraged. I have a great company. I have a tremendous income. And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way. It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money. When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country's a mess, you know, it's one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything's in great shape, our airports. Our airports are like from a third world country. You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible -- you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land -- we've become a third world country. So the worst of all things has happened. We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess. We haven't even started. And we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw. Whether it's 6 or 5, but it looks like it's 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice. And it's really a shame. And it's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem. Our country has tremendous problems. We're a debtor nation. We're a serious debtor nation. And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas. HOLT: We'll let you respond and we'll move on to the next segment. CLINTON: And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years. And the other thing I think is important... TRUMP: It would be squandered, too, believe me. CLINTON: ... is if your -- if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that. You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys. And, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald. I've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do. We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses. It's a beautiful facility. It immediately was put to use. And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do... TRUMP: Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work... TRUMP: Which our country should do, too. CLINTON: Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them? I can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you. He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides. And when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times. There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once. You call yourself the King of Debt. You talk about leverage. You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States. CLINTON: Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government. HOLT: Let's let Mr. Trump... CLINTON: And we need to be very clear about that. TRUMP: So, yeah, I think -- I do think it's time. Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites. I built an unbelievable company. Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places. It's an unbelievable company. But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there. And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation. Now, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws. But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company. My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. And that's what I do. But what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me. I'll give you an example. We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another. But we're opening the Old Post Office. Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money. I'm a year ahead of schedule. And that's what this country should be doing. We build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they're supposed to cost. We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don't have people that know what they're doing. When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy. The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule. And we should be able to do that for our country. HOLT: Well, we're well behind schedule, so I want to move to our next segment. We move into our next segment talking about America's direction. And let's start by talking about race. The share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it's been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings of African-Americans by police, as we've seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa. Race has been a big issue in this campaign, and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap. So how do you heal the divide? Secretary Clinton, you get two minutes on this. CLINTON: Well, you're right. Race remains a significant challenge in our country. Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system. We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte. And we've got to do several things at the same time. We have to restore trust between communities and the police. We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary. Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law. CLINTON: Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods. So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform. I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system. But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform. So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal. And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together. So we have to do two things, as I said. We have to restore trust. We have to work with the police. We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them. And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today. HOLT: All right, Mr. Trump, you have two minutes. How do you heal the divide? TRUMP: Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order. And we need law and order. If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country. And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country. I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just -- just came in. We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very -- I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States. We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he'll because it's so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot. In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st. Thousands of shootings. And I'm saying, where is this? Is this a war-torn country? What are we doing? And we have to stop the violence. We have to bring back law and order. In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed. We have to bring back law and order. Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York. It brought the crime rate way down. But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it. We have gangs roaming the street. And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants. And they have guns. And they shoot people. And we have to be very strong. And we have to be very vigilant. We have to be -- we have to know what we're doing. Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything. We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated. HOLT: Your two -- your two minutes expired, but I do want to follow up. Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men. TRUMP: No, you're wrong. It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her. And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed. HOLT: The argument is that it's a form of racial profiling. TRUMP: No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them. These are felons. These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk. You need more police. You need a better community, you know, relation. You don't have good community relations in Chicago. It's terrible. I have property there. It's terrible what's going on in Chicago. But when you look -- and Chicago's not the only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places. You need better relationships. I agree with Secretary Clinton on this. TRUMP: You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good. But you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently. So there's some bad things going on. Some really bad things. HOLT: Secretary Clinton... TRUMP: But we need -- Lester, we need law and order. And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people. And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen. HOLT: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well, I've heard -- I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country. CLINTON: You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids. There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up. But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe. There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective. Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective. It did not do what it needed to do. Now, I believe in community policing. And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991. Property crime is down 40 percent. We just don't want to see it creep back up. We've had 25 years of very good cooperation. But there were some problems, some unintended consequences. Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses. And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated. So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system. We cannot just say law and order. We have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little. We need to have more second chance programs. I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system. You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans. So there are some positive ways we can work on this. And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us. Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets. In a lot of places, our police are outgunned. We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm. And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country. If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun. So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way. HOLT: Secretary Clinton, last week, you said we've got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias. Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people? CLINTON: Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police. I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other. And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way? But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers. I've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago. They admit it's an issue. They've got a lot of concerns. Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street. CLINTON: They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance. And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that. TRUMP: I'd like to respond to that. TRUMP: First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists. I agree with you. When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of. These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment. But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists. And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off. But I tend to agree with that quite strongly. I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth. And that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's been horribly met, as you know. I think you've apologized for it. But I think it was a terrible thing to say. And when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away. Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them. And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth. I think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders. Five hundred murders is a lot of murders. It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good? But we went from 2,200 to 500. And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg. And it was terminated by current mayor. But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact. CLINTON: Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders. So there is... TRUMP: No, you're wrong. You're wrong. CLINTON: No, I'm not. TRUMP: Murders are up. All right. You check it. CLINTON: New York -- New York has done an excellent job. And I give credit -- I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked. And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well. Look, one murder is too many. But it is important that we learn about what has been effective. And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want. Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe? But let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods. And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem. HOLT: This conversation is about race. And so, Mr. Trump, I have to ask you for five... TRUMP: I'd like to just respond, if I might. HOLT: Please -- 20 seconds. TRUMP: I'd just like to respond. HOLT: Please respond, then I've got a quick follow-up for you. TRUMP: I will. Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians. They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years. The African-American community -- because -- look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated. They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that's what it is. They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years. HOLT: Mr. Trump, let me... CLINTON: Well, I -- I do think... TRUMP: And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities -- and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place. You decided to stay home, and that's OK. But I will tell you, I've been all over. And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities. And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done. HOLT: Mr. Trump, I... CLINTON: I think -- I think -- I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing. HOLT: Mr. Trump, for five years, you perpetuated a false claim that the nation's first black president was not a natural-born citizen. You questioned his legitimacy. In the last couple of weeks, you acknowledged what most Americans have accepted for years: The president was born in the United States. Can you tell us what took you so long? TRUMP: I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say. Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of Secretary Clinton. And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard. And you can go look it up, and you can check it out. TRUMP: And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened. Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it. They were pressing it very hard. She failed to get the birth certificate. When I got involved, I didn't fail. I got him to give the birth certificate. So I'm satisfied with it. And I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it. TRUMP: Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country. HOLT: I will let you respond. It's important. But I just want to get the answer here. The birth certificate was produced in 2011. You've continued to tell the story and question the president's legitimacy in 2012, '13, '14, '15... HOLT: .... as recently as January. So the question is, what changed your mind? TRUMP: Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it. I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate. And I think I did a good job. Secretary Clinton also fought it. I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true. Look, it's true. Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager. And she was involved. But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce. HOLT: I'm sorry. I'm just going to follow up -- and I will let you respond to that, because there's a lot there. But we're talking about racial healing in this segment. What do you say to Americans, people of color who... TRUMP: Well, it was very -- I say nothing. I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it. He should have produced it a long time before. I say nothing. But let me just tell you. When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community. I think you can see that. And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion. And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate. HOLT: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well, just listen to what you heard. And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed. But it can't be dismissed that easily. He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen. There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it. But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy. He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department. So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. And the birther lie was a very hurtful one. You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity. And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him. But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high. And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down. HOLT: Mr. Trump, you can respond and we're going to move on to the next segment. TRUMP: I would love to respond. First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama. You treated him with terrible disrespect. And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are. It doesn't work that way. You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures. I don't think you can deny that. But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true. So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work. It really doesn't. Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued. We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do. TRUMP: I notice you bring that up a lot. And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you. Maybe I'm trying to save the money. But, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing? Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things. I'll go one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. And it's a tremendously successful club. And I'm so glad I did it. And I have been given great credit for what I did. And I'm very, very proud of it. And that's the way I feel. That is the true way I feel. HOLT: Our next segment is called ""Securing America."" We want to start with a 21st century war happening every day in this country. Our institutions are under cyber attack, and our secrets are being stolen. So my question is, who's behind it? And how do we fight it? Secretary Clinton, this answer goes to you. CLINTON: Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries. There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money. But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states. The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia. There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this. I know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really... CLINTON: ... tough, long game here. And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee. And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information. We need to make it very clear -- whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else -- the United States has much greater capacity. And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information. And we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have. We don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare. But we will defend the citizens of this country. And the Russians need to understand that. I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do. And that's why I was so -- I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans. That is just unacceptable. It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information -- in administrations... HOLT: Your two minutes have expired. CLINTON: ... have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief. It's comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face. HOLT: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes and the same question. Who's behind it? And how do we fight it? TRUMP: I do want to say that I was just endorsed -- and more are coming next week -- it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here -- admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country. That just happened, and many more are coming. And I'm very proud of it. In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE. They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration. I was just endorsed by ICE. I was just recently endorsed -- 16,500 Border Patrol agents. So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge. OK? Because look at the mess that we're in. Look at the mess that we're in. As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said. We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not. I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't -- maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK? TRUMP: You don't know who broke in to DNC. But what did we learn with DNC? We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Look what happened to her. But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of. That's what we learned. Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over. We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game. ISIS. So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is -- it is a huge problem. I have a son. He's 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it's hardly doable. But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. But that's true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them. HOLT: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing. I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS. It does involve going after them online. I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere. But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate. We're making progress. Our military is assisting in Iraq. And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria. But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority. And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership. I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden. And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles. Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online. HOLT: You mention ISIS, and we think of ISIS certainly as over there, but there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando. I'll ask this to both of you. Tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump? TRUMP: Well, first I have to say one thing, very important. Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS. ""We will take out ISIS."" Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster. And ISIS was formed. So she talks about taking them out. She's been doing it a long time. She's been trying to take them out for a long time. But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that. And then you wouldn't have had them. Or, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income. And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters. HOLT: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard. Donald supported the invasion of Iraq. CLINTON: That is absolutely proved over and over again. CLINTON: He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time. CLINTON: But the larger point -- and he says this constantly -- is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama. And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that. But let's talk about the question you asked, Lester. The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States? That's the most important part of this. How do we prevent attacks? How do we protect our people? And I think we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information. I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey. You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami. And they brought him down. And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit. So we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East. That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of. We're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism. We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations. Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community. They're on the front lines. They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else. They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to. TRUMP: Well, I have to respond. HOLT: Please respond. TRUMP: The secretary said very strongly about working with -- we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen. You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess. Under your direction, to a large extent. But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly. They were choking on the sanctions. And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going. But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO? And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson. I did really well. But I have common sense. And I said, well, I'll tell you. I haven't given lots of thought to NATO. But two things. Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share. Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract. And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest -- but I said, they do not focus on terror. And I was very strong. And I said it numerous times. And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division. And I think that's great. And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO. It's a lot of money to protect other people. But I'm all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also. And they're going to do that. And that was -- believe me -- I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO. I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton. And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops. Not only that, you named the day. They couldn't believe it. They sat back probably and said, I can't believe it. They said... CLINTON: Lester, we've covered... TRUMP: No, wait a minute. CLINTON: We've covered this ground. TRUMP: When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened. It should have never happened. Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS. But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant. Now it's in over 30 countries. And you're going to stop them? I don't think so. HOLT: Mr. Trump, a lot of these are judgment questions. You had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion. What makes your... TRUMP: I did not support the war in Iraq. TRUMP: That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she -- frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media. HOLT: My question is, since you supported it... TRUMP: Just -- would you like to hear... HOLT: ... why is your -- why is your judgment... TRUMP: Wait a minute. I was against the war in Iraq. Just so you put it out. HOLT: The record shows otherwise, but why -- why was... TRUMP: The record does not show that. HOLT: Why was -- is your judgment any... TRUMP: The record shows that I'm right. When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows? Essentially. I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto. We talked about the economy is more important. I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity. I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox. And Sean Hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and I spoke to him about it -- he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war. HOLT: Why is your judgment better than... TRUMP: And when he -- excuse me. And that was before the war started. Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people -- he's willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him. I was against the war. He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war. And I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there. But nobody called Sean Hannity. And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started. I think in '04. But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq. And one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely -- because if you read this article, there's no doubt. But if somebody -- and I'll ask the press -- if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started. He and I used to have arguments about the war. I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing. It's going to destabilize the Middle East. And that's exactly what it's done. It's been a disaster. HOLT: My reference was to what you had said in 2002, and my question was... TRUMP: No, no. You didn't hear what I said. HOLT: Why is your judgment -- why is your judgment any different than Mrs. Clinton's judgment? TRUMP: Well, I have much better judgment than she does. There's no question about that. I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know? I have a much better -- she spent -- let me tell you -- she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising -- you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names -- oh, temperament, let's go after -- I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament. I have a winning temperament. I know how to win. She does not have a... HOLT: Secretary Clinton? TRUMP: Wait. The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control. I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem. HOLT: Secretary Clinton? Let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO. You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all. And you know the only time it's ever been invoked? After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side. With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb. They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration. They had built covert facilities. They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away. And we had sanctioned them. I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough. So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran. And we did drive them to the negotiating table. And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot. That's diplomacy. That's coalition-building. That's working with other nations. The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship. He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I'd blow them out of the water and start another war. That's not good judgment. TRUMP: That would not start a war. CLINTON: That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted. And the worst part... TRUMP: No, they were taunting us. CLINTON: ... of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons. He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons. He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine... CLINTON: ... have a good time, folks. CLINTON: And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling. That is the number-one threat we face in the world. And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material. So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned. TRUMP: That line's getting a little bit old, I must say. I would like to... CLINTON: It's a good one, though. It well describes the problem. TRUMP: It's not an accurate one at all. It's not an accurate one. So I just want to give a lot of things -- and just to respond. I agree with her on one thing. The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks. Nuclear is the single greatest threat. Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries. They do not pay us. But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune. That's why we're losing -- we're losing -- we lose on everything. I say, who makes these -- we lose on everything. All I said, that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we're doing. We can't defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million... HOLT: We need to move on. TRUMP: Well, wait, but it's very important. All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out. We're a country that owes $20 trillion. They have to help us out. TRUMP: As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree. It is the single greatest threat that this country has. HOLT: Which leads to my next question, as we enter our last segment here (inaudible) the subject of securing America. On nuclear weapons, President Obama reportedly considered changing the nation's longstanding policy on first use. Do you support the current policy? Mr. Trump, you have two minutes on that. TRUMP: Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. But Russia has been expanding their -- they have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint. I looked the other night. I was seeing B-52s, they're old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them. We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do first strike. I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over. At the same time, we have to be prepared. I can't take anything off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea. And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal. Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. Iran has power over North Korea. And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea. And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places. And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that? Why didn't you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. Nobody's ever seen that before. That turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages. It certainly looks that way. So you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history. The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems. All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much. HOLT: Your two minutes is expired. TRUMP: And they're going to end up getting nuclear. I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day. Believe me, he's not a happy camper. HOLT: All right. Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes. CLINTON: Well, let me -- let me start by saying, words matter. Words matter when you run for president. And they really matter when you are president. And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them. It is essential that America's word be good. And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe. I've talked with a number of them. But I want to -- on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good. It's also important that we look at the entire global situation. There's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran. But personally, I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that. And Donald never tells you what he would do. Would he have started a war? Would he have bombed Iran? If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be. But it's like his plan to defeat ISIS. He says it's a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan. So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues. People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do. Can they rely on us? Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values? That's what I intend to do. I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home. We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security... HOLT: Your two minutes is... CLINTON: ... to be given any opportunities at all. HOLT: ... is expired. TRUMP: Lester, one thing I'd like to say. HOLT: Very quickly. Twenty seconds. TRUMP: I will go very quickly. But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place. Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations. TRUMP: And it's a big problem. And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars. We cannot be the policemen of the world. We cannot protect countries all over the world... HOLT: We have just... TRUMP: ... where they're not paying us what we need. HOLT: We have just a few final questions... TRUMP: And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability. We need heart. We need a lot of things. But you have to have some basic ability. And sadly, she doesn't have that. All of the things that she's talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let's say, while she had great power. But they weren't taken care of. And if she ever wins this race, they won't be taken care of. HOLT: Mr. Trump, this year Secretary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party. Earlier this month, you said she doesn't have, quote, ""a presidential look."" She's standing here right now. What did you mean by that? TRUMP: She doesn't have the look. She doesn't have the stamina. I said she doesn't have the stamina. And I don't believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina. HOLT: The quote was, ""I just don't think she has the presidential look."" TRUMP: You have -- wait a minute. Wait a minute, Lester. You asked me a question. Did you ask me a question? You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals. You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia. I mean, can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia? And with all of the money they have, we're defending them, and they're not paying? All you have to do is speak to them. Wait. You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don't believe that Hillary has the stamina. HOLT: Let's let her respond. CLINTON: Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina. TRUMP: The world -- let me tell you. Let me tell you. Hillary has experience, but it's bad experience. We have made so many bad deals during the last -- so she's got experience, that I agree. But it's bad, bad experience. Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can -- name -- you almost can't name a good deal. I agree. She's got experience, but it's bad experience. And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience. HOLT: We are at -- we are at the final question. CLINTON: Well, one thing. One thing, Lester. HOLT: Very quickly, because we're at the final question now. CLINTON: You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina. But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said... TRUMP: I never said that. CLINTON: .... women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men. TRUMP: I didn't say that. CLINTON: And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman ""Miss Piggy."" Then he called her ""Miss Housekeeping,"" because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name. TRUMP: Where did you find this? Where did you find this? CLINTON: Her name is Alicia Machado. TRUMP: Where did you find this? CLINTON: And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet... TRUMP: Oh, really? CLINTON: ... she's going to vote this November. TRUMP: OK, good. Let me just tell you... HOLT: Mr. Trump, could we just take 10 seconds and then we ask the final question... TRUMP: You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials. Some of it's said in entertainment. Some of it's said -- somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her. But you want to know the truth? I was going to say something... HOLT: Please very quickly. TRUMP: ... extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, ""I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice."" But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue. They're untrue. And they're misrepresentations. And I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice. And I don't deserve that. But it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done. It's hundreds of millions of ads. And the only gratifying thing is, I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money... HOLT: We have to move on to the final question. TRUMP: ... $200 million is spent, and I'm either winning or tied, and I've spent practically nothing. HOLT: One of you will not win this election. So my final question to you tonight, are you willing to accept the outcome as the will of the voters? Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well, I support our democracy. And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. But I certainly will support the outcome of this election. And I know Donald's trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope the people out there understand: This election's really up to you. It's not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want. So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does. HOLT: Mr. Trump, very quickly, same question. Will you accept the outcome as the will of the voters? TRUMP: I want to make America great again. We are a nation that is seriously troubled. We're losing our jobs. People are pouring into our country. The other day, we were deporting 800 people. And perhaps they passed the wrong button, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption, but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens. Ended up becoming citizens. And it was 800. And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don't even know. HOLT: Will you accept the outcome of the election? TRUMP: Look, here's the story. I want to make America great again. I'm going to be able to do it. I don't believe Hillary will. The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her. HOLT: All right. Well, that is going to do it for us. That concludes our debate for this evening, a spirit one. We covered a lot of ground, not everything as I suspected we would. The next presidential debates are scheduled for October 9th at Washington University in St. Louis and October 19th at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. The conversation will continue. A reminder. The vice presidential debate is scheduled for October 4th at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. My thanks to Hillary Clinton and to Donald Trump and to Hofstra University for hosting us tonight. Good night, everyone. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton face off in the first 2016 presidential debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y. Wait 1 second to continue."		1

Mostly False	['fake photos', ' mutant', ' sharks']	https://news.nationalgeographic.com/	https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/11/sharks-two-headed-oceans-mutations/	2018/05/04	"Two-Headed Sharks Keep Popping Up—No One Knows WhyScientists are discovering more mutated fish, possibly due to genetic abnormalities from overfishing.View ImagesThis two-headed blue shark fetus was discovered inside its mother in 2008 off Australia.Photograph courtesy Christopher JohnstonPUBLISHEDNovember 2, 2016Two-headed sharks may sound like a figment of the big screen, but they exist—and more are turning up worldwide, scientists say.A few years ago off Florida, fishermen hauled in a bull shark whose uterus contained a two-headed fetus . In 2008, another fisherman discovered a two-headed blue shark embryo in the Indian Ocean .And a 2011 study described conjoined twins discovered in blue sharks caught in the Gulf of California and northwestern Mexico. Blue sharks have produced the most recorded two-headed embryos because they carry so many babies—up to 50 at at time, says study leader Felipe Galván-Magaña , of the National Polytechnic Institute in Mexico.Now, Spanish researchers have identified an embryo of an Atlantic sawtail catshark with two heads, according to a new study in the Journal of Fish Biology . While raising sharks for human-health research in the laboratory, a team noticed the unusual embryo in a see-through shark egg.Two-Faced Calf May Be the Oldest With the Mutation to Survive Watch: Meet what may be the oldest two-faced calf in the world.The catshark embyro was not your average two-headed beast—it's the first such specimen known from an oviparous shark species, or a shark that lays eggs.Researchers opened the egg to study the specimen, and study leader Valentín Sans-Coma says it's unknown whether the deformed animal would have survived. Because it's the first such conjoined twin found in egg-laying sharks, its likely that such offspring don't live long enough for people to find them.You Might Also LikePuffin Beaks Glow in Surprising DiscoveryMutation CausesTwo-headed sharks have been few and far between, so it's tough to know what's behind the mutations. ( See more shark pictures .)Sans-Coma and colleagues say a genetic disorder seems to be the most plausible cause for the two-headed catshark, since the embryos were grown in a lab among nearly 800 specimens. To the best of their knowledge, the eggs were not exposed to any infections, chemicals, or radiation.But wild sharks' malformations could come from a variety of factors, including viral infections, metabolic disorders, pollution, or a dwindling gene pool due to overfishing, which leads to inbreeding, and thus genetic abnormalities. (See "" New Diseases, Toxins Harming Marine Life ."")View ImagesTwo-headed blue sharks are more common because the females have a lot of eggs—and thus more opportunity for abnormalities.Photograph courtesy Christopher JohnstonFor another recent study, marine scientist Nicolas Ehemann examined two such specimens: A smalleye smooth-hound shark and a blue shark, found by fishermen off Venezuela's Margarita Island. The animals, which would not have survived, are the first two-headed sharks found in the Caribbean Sea, according to Ehemann's research bulletin .Overfishing to Blame?Ehemann, a master's student at the National Polytechnic Institute in Mexico, believes that if the two-headed fetuses are more prevalent in nature, then overfishing is a strong culprit as it may cause the gene pool to shrink.View ImagesMost two-headed sharks don't survive birth.Photograph courtesy Christopher JohnstonGalván-Magaña, who authored the 2011 study, doesn't think two-headed sharks are more common—but rather that there are more scientific journals around to publish accounts.Galván-Magaña has seen other bizarre sharks, too, including a ""cyclops"" shark, caught off Mexico in 2011, with a single, functioning eye at the front of its head . The dusky shark fetus's single eye is the hallmark of a congenital condition called cyclopia, which occurs in several animal species, including people.Meanwhile, Ehemann says shark deformities are a difficult topic to research because the specimens are so rare.""I would like to study these things, but it's not like you throw out a net and you catch two-headed sharks every so often,"" he says.

The caller provided information about Cruz’s gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behavior, and disturbing social media posts, as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting.Under established protocols, the information provided by the caller should have been assessed as a potential threat to life. The information then should have been forwarded to the FBI Miami Field Office, where appropriate investigative steps would have been taken.We have determined that these protocols were not followed for the information received by the PAL on January 5. The information was not provided to the Miami Field Office, and no further investigation was conducted at that time.FBI Director Christopher Wray said:“We are still investigating the facts. I am committed to getting to the bottom of what happened in this particular matter, as well as reviewing our processes for responding to information that we receive from the public. It’s up to all Americans to be vigilant, and when members of the public contact us with concerns, we must act properly and quickly.“We have spoken with victims and families, and deeply regret the additional pain this causes all those affected by this horrific tragedy.

Esters of 3- and 2-MCPD and glycidol are contaminants of processed vegetable oils; free MCPDs are formed in some processed foods. The Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM Panel) evaluated 7,175 occurrence data. Esters of 3- and 2-MCPD and glycidyl esters were found at the highest levels in palm oil/fat, but most vegetable oil/fats contain substantial quantities. Mean middle bound (MB) dietary exposure values to total 3-MCPD, 2-MCPD and glycidol, respectively, across surveys and age groups in μg/kg body weight (bw) per day were 0.2–1.5, 0.1–0.7 and 0.1–0.9; high exposure (P95) values were 0.3–2.6, 0.2–1.2 and 0.2–2.1. Animal studies show extensive hydrolysis of esterified 3-MCPD and glycidol following oral administration; esterified and free forms were assumed to contribute equally to internal exposures. Nephrotoxicity was consistently observed in rats treated with 3-MCPD. Data on 2-MCPD toxicity were insufficient for dose–response assessments. Chronic treatment with glycidol increased the incidence of tumours in several tissues of rats and mice, likely via a genotoxic mode of action. The Panel selected a BMDL10 value for 3-MCPD of 0.077 mg/kg bw per day for induction of renal tubular hyperplasia in rats and derived a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 0.8 μg/kg bw per day. The mean exposure to 3-MCPD was above the TDI for ‘Infants’, ‘Toddlers’ and ‘Other children’. For glycidol, the Panel selected a T25 value of 10.2 mg/kg bw per day for neoplastic effects in rats. The margins of exposure (MoEs) were 11,300–102,000 and 4,900–51,000 across surveys and age groups at mean and P95 exposures, respectively. An exposure scenario for infants receiving formula only resulted in MoEs of 5,500 (mean) and 2,100 (P95). MoEs of 25,000 or higher were considered of low health concern.© European Food Safety Authority, 2016Panel members at the time of adoption: Jan Alexander, Lars Barregard, Margherita Bignami, Sandra Ceccatelli, Bruce Cottrill, Michael Dinovi, Lutz Edler, Bettina Grasl-Kraupp, Christer Hogstrand, Laurentius (Ron) Hoogenboom, Helle Katrine Knutsen, Carlo Stefano Nebbia, Isabelle Oswald, Annette Petersen, Vera Maria Rogiers, Martin Rose, Alain-Claude Roudot, Tanja Schwerdtle, Christiane Vleminckx, Günter Vollmer and Heather WallacePanel on Contaminants in the Food ChainContact: 		0

Mixture	['american history', ' irish slaves', ' irish slaves myth', ' slavery']	http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/	http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/indentured_servants_in_colonial_virginia	2017/03/17	"Younger)Servitude had a long history in England, dating back to medieval serfdom. The Ordinance of Labourers, passed in June 1349, declared that all men and women under the age of sixty who did not practice a craft must serve anyone requiring their labor. Parliament updated the law in 1495 and 1563, with the latter version, the Statute of Artificers , still being in effect when the English founded Jamestown . Between 1520 and 1630, England's population more than doubled, from 2.3 million to 4.8 million, and Parliament hoped its 1563 statute might ""banishe Idleness[,] advance Husbandrye,"" and so deal with the near-overwhelming number of poor and unemployed citizens. In fact, the founding of Virginia itself was partially in response to this problem. In his Discourse on Western Planting (1584), Richard Hakluyt (the younger) argued to Queen Elizabeth that new American colonies would energize England's ""decayed trades"" and provide work for the country's ""multitudes of loyterers and idle vagabondes.""In England, an indenture, or contract for labor, was known as a ""covenant merely personal,"" and could apply either to farm laborers or apprentices learning a trade. Contracts generally lasted a year, after which terms were renegotiated. As the merchant and adventurer Sir George Peckham noted in 1583, many English men and women willingly became servants ""in hope thereby to amend theyr estates,"" and young children were sometimes bound to service by parents who might not otherwise be able to afford their upbringing. While there was not necessarily a strong stigma attached to indentured servitude, the institution—first in England and then in Virginia—temporarily transformed free men and women into chattel, or property to be bought and sold.Land and LaborVirginiaThe Virginia Company of London always had more land than labor to work it. At first, the company attempted to entice investors by offering them shares in the company that were redeemable for land. But when profits failed to materialize and the colony became infamous for its high mortality rate, the company began shipping servants to Virginia at its own expense and placing them on company-owned land. (An Englishman willing to risk his life in order to work someone else's acreage was not usually someone who could afford transatlantic passage.) Once the servants arrived, the company could rent them out to planters for a year at a time, requiring the planters to take responsibility for the workers' food, shelter, and health.With the introduction of marketable tobacco, however, demand for labor skyrocketed. Private investors who, alongside the company, had shipped servants at their own expense continued to do so while the company rid itself of its role as rental agent. Instead, it sold servants directly to planters at a price based on the cost of passage. Planters, mariners, and merchants then fixed the servants' years of service based on the labor required to recoup their purchase price and subsequent care.Servants, who ranged from convicted criminals to skilled workers, in time came to occupy the lowest rung on the social ladder in Virginia. While tenants kept half of what they earned, servants kept nothing and were almost entirely at the mercy of their masters for the terms of their indentures. Movement up the ladder was limited, even once a term of service had been completed, although servants with marketable skills had a greater chance of success. Few servants were likeRobert TownshendTobacco TamperIn the summer of 1620, the Virginia Company of London announced that it would send to Virginia, at ""publike charge,"" ""eight hundred choise persons,"" half of whom were assigned to be tenants of company land. One hundred ""yong Maides"" were sent to ""make wives for these Tenants,"" and one hundred boys to serve as apprentices. Finally, ""one hundred servants [were] to be disposed amongst the old Planters, which they greatly desire, and have offered to defray their charges with very great thankes.""Soon, however, the company found it unnecessary to continue incurring the ""publike charge"" of transporting servants. Instead, it implemented a system by which it used the prospect of land to entice new colonists, and with them laborers. Headrights, first described in the so-called Great Charter of 1618 , awarded 100 acres of land each to planters who had been in the colony since May 1616, and 50 acres each to anyone who covered the cost of transporting a new immigrant to Virginia. These newcomers, more often than not, were indentured servants, allowing successful planters simultaneous access to land and labor, with no upfront cost to the company. Merchants and mariners reaped a benefit, too, for they recruited prospective servants, bargained their indenture terms with them, and then sold the contracts to planters in Virginia. Merchants also accumulated headrights that could be used to acquire land. In time, these headrights, or land certificates, were bought and sold much like modern-day stock certificates.Early VirginiaColonistsSometimes groups of investors collectively absorbed the cost of outfitting and transporting workers to the colony. Virginia Company of London stockholders were entitled to 100 acres per share, and high-ranking officials were furnished with indentured servants as part of their stipend. In some instances groups of investors promised to give land to their indentured servants after they fulfilled their contracts. TheSociety of Berkeley Hundred's investors offered their skilled servants parcels that ranged from 25 to 50 acres, to be claimed once they had fulfilled their contracts.Various factors fueled the need for new servants. One was demographics. Approximately 50,000 servants—or three-quarters of all new arrivals—immigrated to theChesapeake Baycolonies between 1630 and 1680. The ratio of men to women among servants in the 1630s was six-to-one. Between 1640 and 1680, the ratio dropped to four-to-one, but even then, many men could not find wives to marry and therefore could not establish families. As a result of this and the high mortality rate among new servants, company officials and English merchants were forced to constantly replenish the Virginia colony's servant population.View SlideshowAnother factor creating a need for new servants was the rapidly expanding tobacco market. It created substantial opportunities for would-be planters, but because tobacco was a demanding, labor-intensive crop, it also required a large number of laborers. At the same time, tobacco's acceptance as a medium of exchange prompted planters to enhance their productivity. Between the 1620s and the 1670s, the annual output of tobacco per hand rose from approximately 710 pounds to around 1,600 pounds; during the same period, shipping costs decreased. Although tobacco prices had begun to decline sharply by late in the 1620s and continued to fall, production remained profitable because planters were able to produce larger crops with fewer hands. Yet even as they technically required fewer servants, planters demanded more. That's because tobacco consumption rose in response to lower prices, and planters, eager to meet that demand, increased their production.Contract TermsAs indentured servants poured into Virginia, they came to account for fully half of Virginia's population. Such rapid change caused problems, however, and the General Assembly passed numerous statutes designed to address them. These laws served several broad purposes, including regulation of servants' contract terms, behavior, and treatment.Contract terms were important for several reasons. The assembly wished to protect masters from terms that did not fully recoup their cost of transporting servants from England to Virginia, in addition to their subsequent care. The assembly also faced the problem of servants who arrived without any contracts; the English custom of requiring a single year's service absent any other arrangement would not suffice in America, where the labor market was less stable than in England. Finally, the masters—who included most men who sat in the assembly—had an interest in prolonging terms of indenture because briefer service led to disruptive turnover, labor shortages, and an unstable workforce.For these reasons, terms of service did not shorten even as tobacco production became more efficient and profitable. Instead, lengthy terms of service became customary and dictated by law. As early as 1619, the General Assembly required all servants to register with the secretary of state upon arrival and ""Certifie him upon what termes or conditions they be come hither."" In its 1642–1643 session, the assembly passed a law mandating that any servant arriving without an indenture and who was younger than twelve years old should serve for seven years, servants aged twelve to nineteen should serve for five years, and servants aged twenty and older should serve for four years. Legislation passed in the 1657–1658 session adjusted these ages: anyone under the age of fifteen should serve until he or she turned twenty-one, while anyone sixteen or older should serve for four years. By 1705, the law had been simplified, so that all non-indentured Christian servants older than nineteen should serve until they turned twenty-four. (""Christian servants"" generally referred to non-blacks and non-Indians.) Lawmakers entrusted the county courts with judging the age of each servant. In the meantime, they required slightly different terms for Irish servants.View SlideshowThe assembly declined to dictate standard terms for privately negotiated indentures; as a result, contracts varied in length and specificity. On September 7, 1619, Robert Coopy, whose age went unnoted, signed an indenture for three years' service to the proprietors of Berkeley's Hundred requiring that he be ""obedient"" to his betters and that they ""transport him (with gods assistance)"" to Virginia and there ""maintayne him with convenient diet and apparel."" In a much shorter document , dated March 14, 1664, Lott Richards, a merchant from Bristol, England, sold ""one Sarvant boy by name William [F]reeman being about eleven years old and haveing noe indenture"" to John Barnes for a term of eight years. By 1755, Thomson Mason could simply fill out a form , which he did in order to indenture for four years William Buckland, a twenty-one-year-old carpenter and joiner, to his brother George Mason , who was overseeing the construction of Gunston Hall . Buckland's agreement was somewhat unusual in that, as a skilled worker, he was paid wages of £20 per year in addition to receiving ""all necessary Meat, Drink, Washing, [and] Lodging.""Servants whose contracts had expired typically received ""freedom dues,"" loosely described as a quantity of corn and clothing. The 1705 statute was the first to explicitly mention this ""good and laudable custom,"" and required that male servants, ""upon their freedom,"" be supplied with ten bushels of corn, thirty shillings (or the like value in goods), and a musket worth at least twenty shillings. Women were entitled to fifteen bushels of corn and the equivalent of forty shillings.During the seventeenth century, freedom dues were negotiated as part of the indenture. Robert Coopy's contract, for instance, guaranteed him thirty acres of land at Berkeley's Hundred. John Barnes, who purchased William Freeman, was obliged only to pay the boy ""his full due According to the Custom of this Country."" Depending on the time and place, this might have included corn, clothing, and tools. In 1675, an indentured servant who charged his master with cheating him asked the General Court to free him ""and pay him corne & clothes."" The judges ruled in his favor, granting him ""three Barrels of Corne att the Cropp."" Occasionally the owners of indentured servants refused to release them or give them their freedom dues. At Jamestown, when a male indentured servant who had fulfilled his contract insisted on receiving his ""corn and clothes,"" his master exploded in rage and struck him on the head with his truncheon.Servants' Behavior"		0

Mostly False	['minecraft', ' minecraft sex mods', ' scary mommy']	http://www.parent.co/	http://www.parent.co/everything-changed-the-day-i-learned-minecraft-has-a-sex-mod/	2016/10/25	A modern lifestyle brand redefining motherhoodEverything Changed the Day I Learned Minecraft Has a Sex ModUPDATED 10/31: Learn more about how the author’s daughter was propositioned for sex while playing in a kid-friendly world within Minecraft – as well as her surprise at the backlash caused by this piece.Take a minute to Google “Minecraft + sex mod.” I’ll wait.Did your brain explode? Because when I found out that this was a thing, not only did my brain explode, but my heart did as well. Unfortunately, it was my kid who filled me in.I was going about my business when I suddenly found myself looking into the tearful eyes of one of my babies who was telling me that, not only was this kid playing Minecraft when she saw this, but she was also propositioned in this “creative mode” room by another player.What?!This child was crushed. She opened up, and told me about the things that appear in apps. She shared a lot about how she was feeling as a result of this experience that made me want to weep and weep.The virtual world is so real to our kids. She felt like it had actually happened to her in real life. It could not be shrugged off. She actually wanted me to take away her phone, the portal to this hurt. There were many tears, half of them from me. All I could do was apologize for not protecting her better.Because the truth is, it’s all my fault.I thought I was doing my due diligence in the technology department. We pay attention to how much time they spend online and limit it as well, even detoxing completely from time to time . We keep the apps they used restricted to the 10 and under age range, and Minecraft falls into this category.And still this happened. Because, sadly where the kids are, the creepers will follow. (Minecraft pun intended.) And the creepers found my baby.In that moment, I came face-to-face with the fact that, because I’d not been paying attention, my child had been in harm’s way. Technology allows the world at-large into our homes, there are parts of the world you can’t imagine, and they’ll come in if you let them. Had she been a different kid, this could have been much much worse.After locking down her phone, I did a little research, and here’s what I found. 70 percent of children seven to 18 years old have accidentally encountered online pornography, often through a web search while doing homework.90 percent of children ages 8-16 have seen online pornography.Law enforcement officials estimate that more than 50,000 sexual predators are online at any given moment.1 in 5 youth ages 10 to 17 received a sexual solicitation or were approached online.Only a fraction of all inappropriate Internet episodes are reported to authorities.69 percent of teens regularly receive online communications from strangers and don’t tell a parent or caretaker.My first thought was to head for the hills immediately. Perhaps become Amish. But the fact of the matter is, this is the world we live in. Kids often have devices in their hands during the school day, too, or will come in contact with them through their friends, even if we take theirs away.We cannot live in a bubble, we need to be real about what our kids are exposed to. We need to learn to guide them through, and we need to keep the safe. Monitor kids’ devices. It’s not easy to shut down our kids’ online experience. Safety filters cost money, data, and sometimes lock down the more innocent things our kids want to do, like play Minecraft in a world with their buddies.There’s no one-size-fits-all “set it and forget it” safety app. We have to be all in: frequent checks of all devices in the home, an extra app to see deleted texts, and closing all games that are social.Safety apps can’t do it all, I frequently check the device as well. We set all restrictions to PG or better, eliminating obvious dangers. YouTube offers restriction settings, and we use those. Especially after what happened, closing all public chat rooms just makes sense. The kids have figured out how they can still create interactive play with their friends, without letting in the general public.Never say never.I thought I knew what was going on, this happened to my kiddo when she was at home, during the day, just sitting on her bed.Now that the blinders are off, all Minecraft (and other playtime) happen only in the common areas. It’s much harder for curiosity to get the best of us when sitting in a room with mom or dad.Kids are also more likely to show you on the spot if something questionable pops up. I ask them about what they’re playing, and with whom. Is there chatting happening in games? Who can see what you are doing? Do you know the people you’re playing with?Kids are tech savvy, so we must be, too. Can we really open up a world of temptation to kids and adolescents and expect them to make 100% great choices? Think back to your own childhood. Now answer. Exactly…we cannot.A room full of 13-year-old boys with iPads at a sleepover might just be tempted to venture beyond the walls of their made up Minecraft world, and we need to be ready. All the apps that kids download show up on my phone, and I open and play these apps myself. This has led to me deleting some things I thought “looked safe” and ended my freak-out about apps that I thought no child should have.Our newest (and not super popular) rule is that all iPads and technology get handed in at 9 p.m. at sleepovers. Devices spend the night in my room. There’s no reason for anyone to be online in the dead of night. Tell some ghost stories, kids.I’ve learned that it’s clearly not enough to limit screen time and say, “I’ve done my job.” We must do a deep dive into what our kids are doing, what different apps allow, what it looks like to hang out on YouTube, or Minecraft, or in any online community. We need to check new apps on a review site like Common Sense Media (also great for movies and books). We need to be aware of which apps might be dangerous, and find out who our kids are texting or communicating with through chats in games.Just as we wouldn’t drop our kids off in the middle of a city we’ve never been to, we cannot drop them off online in the middle of a virtual world we’re don’t know much about.I’m now a digital explorer. If my kid wants a Musical.ly account, then I get one too. I spend time figuring it out, and friending or following them. We talk about what they see there. I delete things that I don’t believe are good or safe, and I don’t care if they hate me. My goal is to find a way for us all to navigate this online world safely. It will keep changing and so I’ll need to as well. We cannot, however, just consult a list of good and bad apps, set up their devices, and walk away. The digital world changes way too fast for this approach. It’s up to us to find out what our kids are into, investigate, play along, explore, and talk to our kids about each app and every website.Sound overwhelming? It is. But the consequences of not following through here are too big to ignore. If we’re going to put the world at the literal fingertips of our children, we must join them there. Their young hearts and minds depend on us to see them safely through. Amy Betters-MidtvedtI write along with my friend and former teaching partner Erin over at Hiding in the Closet With Coffee.

Hodgkinson?The 66-year-old from Illinois has been identified by multiple outlets, citing law-enforcement sources, as the gunman who attacked a congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia.Krishnadev CalamurJun 14, 2017In this undated file photo, James Hodgkinson holds a sign during a protest outside of a U.S. Post Office in Belleville, Illinois. Derik Holtmann / Belleville News-Democrat via APUpdated at 4:01 p.m. ETThe FBI identified the gunman who opened fire this morning during a congressional congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia, as James T. Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Illinois. The bureau said Hodgkinson was taken to the hospital, where he died.A Facebook page belonging to a person with that name from the Belleville area contains several posts critical of President Trump. (There is no confirmation that it belongs to the alleged suspect.) In one, Trump is described as a “traitor” who “has destroyed our democracy.” The Facebook account’s banner has an image of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who ran against Hillary Clinton in the Democratic presidential primary. His profile picture has the U.S. flag with the words: “Democratic Socialism explained in 3 words: We the People.” He also appeared to maintain a Twitter account, which wasn’t particularly active. His most recent posts urged Democratic senators to filibuster the nomination of Neil Gorsuch, Trump’s nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court.“I know he wasn’t happy with the way things were going, the election results and stuff,” his brother, Michael Hodgkinson, told The New York Times. He said news of the shooting came “totally out of the blue.” He said his sister had spoken to Hodgkinson’s wife on Tuesday and, in the words of the newspaper, “the wife said that Mr. Hodgkinson had called home to say he was planning to come home because he missed his wife and dogs.”Charles Orear, 50, of St. Louis, told The Washington Post he met Hodgkinson when they worked together in Iowa on the Sanders campaign.“You’ve got to be kidding me,” he said when told by the Post about the shooting. He called Hodgkinson a “quiet guy,” “very mellow, very reserved.” “He was this union tradesman, pretty stocky, and we stayed up talking politics,” he told the newspaper. “He was more on the really progressive side of things.”Former Alexandria Mayor Bill Euille told the Post he spoke to the shooter almost every morning at the local YMCA, which is near the baseball field where the shooting occurred. He said the man had been living out of his gym bag. Euille said they spoke mostly about local restaurants and things to do.“He was a very friendly person,” Euille said, but added: “[H]e sat in the Y’s lobby for hours and hours. Outside of myself, I don’t think he knew anyone else in town.”Here’s more on Hodgkinson from his local newspaper: The Belleville News-Democrat reported :Hodgkinson, 66, owns a home-inspection business. Hodgkinson was a licensed home inspector from 1994 to 1997, when his license expired, according records from the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation. He also held a license from 2003 to 2016, but it was not renewed. …Hodgkinson has a varied arrest record in St. Clair County, for offenses such as failing to obtain electrical permits, damaging a motor vehicle, resisting a peace officer, eluding police, criminal damage to property, driving under the influence and assorted traffic offenses.Read the newspaper’s full profile of Hodgkinson, including details of his background and family life. Separately, NBC News cited court records showing Hodgkinson was arrested in 2006 for assaulting his girlfriend. The Daily Beast adds :In 2006, he was arrested for domestic battery and discharge of a firearm after he punched a man’s girlfriend “in the face with a closed fist,” according to a police report reviewed by The Daily Beast. When the man walked outside of the residence, Hodgkinson aimed a shotgun at him and later fired one round.Hodgkinson was also “observed throwing” an unidentified minor “around the bedroom,” the police report said. Police identified the girl as his daughter. After the girl broke free, Hodgkinson followed and “started hitting her arms, pulling her hair, and started grabbing her off the bed .”When Hodgkinson’s girlfriend tried to leave in a vehicle, he reached inside and “turned off the ignition,” the report said. “James then pulled out a possible pocket knife and cut [her] seatbelt.”The charges were dismissed, according to court records.Hodgkinson also wrote a number of letters to the newspaper, urging higher taxes on the rich:Some letters to the editor James Hodgkinson wrote to the Belleville News-Democrat from 2008-2011 pic.twitter.com/HvOUzKx7cU— Emily Atkin (@emorwee) June 14, 2017Sanders in a statement that did not mentioned Hodgkinson said he “was sickened by this despicable act.”“Let me be as clear as I can be. Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms,” he said. “Real change can only come about through nonviolent action, and anything else runs against our most deeply held American values.”Krishnadev Calamur is a senior editor at The Atlantic, where he oversees news coverage.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-company-for-cruelty/	cosmetic companies avon, mary kay and estée lauder have resumed testing their products on animals after previously abandoning the practice.	Mixture	['animal cruelty', ' avon', ' cosmetics', ' estee lauder', ' estée lauder animal testing', ' mary kay', ' testing']	http://www.thedogfiles.com/	http://www.thedogfiles.com/2012/02/27/animal-testing-resumes-for-avon-mary-kay-and-estee-lauder/	2015/04/01	Posted by Kenn Bell | Feb 27, 2012 | 59 |As of right now I don’t know what kinds of animals they are using.— KennAnimal testing for cosmetics is a hot topic in the beauty industry, with most consumers and many companies deciding to avoid products made with animal testing. After more than two decades following a “no testing on animals” policy, cosmetics giants Avon, Mary Kay, and Estee Lauder have resumed the practice without letting consumers know. In the late 1980s, PETA’s “Avon Killing” campaign eventually led to the company banning animal testing for their products, with Mary Kay and Estée Lauder following suit.According to a press release from Rush PR, the news was broken after animal rights organization PETA removed the companies from their cruelty-free list after discovering that they had returned to using testing on animals for their products. The three companies began the tests again in order to satisfy regulations from the Chinese government so they could sell their products in China. However, PETA contends that there are alternative testing methods that are just as effective and widely used in the US.Kathy Guillermo, the Vice President of PETA’s Laboratory Investigations was saddened by the move: “Avon, Estée Lauder, and Mary Kay have regressed a generation: Their products are once again being dripped into rabbits’ eyes and smeared onto animals’ abraded skin.” She’s urging customers to choose cruelty-free products instead.Avon spokeswoman Reese Witherspoon may be upset to learn about the new animal testing as well. Late last year she was “dismayed” to learn a bag she was spotted with was made from real python skin and agreed to throw it away. But perhaps she can use her star power to influence Avon to go back to their animal-friendly ways.Keep You Up To Date On All Our Doggie News!Join our mailing list to receive the latest news and updates from Dog Files.SUBMIT!Thank you so much for subscribing to Dog Files!Share:		1

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/michael-jordan-sue-grocery-store-10-million/	former nba superstar won a hefty award in 2015 after filing suit against a grocery chain that used his name in an advertisement without his permission.	True	['michael jordan']	http://www.chicagobusiness.com/	http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20131014/OPINION/131019936/why-dominicks-sputtered-out	2017/12/24	Many Chicago-area residents are bemoaning the closing of Dominick's Finer Foods as though a close family friend suddenly and soberly announced he was dying. We all eat regularly as part of the human condition. Shopping for food is necessary, celebratory and deeply personal. Immigrant Dominick DiMatteo opened his first store nearly 100 years ago and grew the chain into an American dream. Between now and the end of the year, his shrinking but steady band of loyalists will file into their local Dominick's to pick up a few items and say goodbye to an icon. So why is this happening? There are many reasons that stores go in and out of business. Markets are in constant motion, margins for grocers are low and tight, and competition for the food dollar is fierce with an increasing number of sharp knives in the game. Dominick's, however, made some missteps that over the long term only served to seal its fate. Communities of the 1950s, '60s, '70s and '80s were dominated by one-style-and-size-fits-all traditional grocery stores, whether Dominick's, Jewel or an independent. Until that time, the consumer price index and producer price index tracked about the same. But by the '90s, they diverged, with consumer prices rising faster. Nonfood retailers — gas stations, dollar stores, pharmacies and big box giants like Wal-Mart and Target — realized that, despite tight margins, they could make money selling food, if not directly, then as a lure enticing customers to buy other things. Mergers and acquisitions meant consolidated banners under one often-distant parent company, such as California-based Safeway, which bought Dominick's in 1998. The recession in the early 2000s accelerated the split between high-end and low-end food stores, which is where industry growth and focus continue today. The traditional grocer of yore must find ways to adapt or perish. And this is where Dominick's made mistakes. It closed stores in middle and underperforming markets and transitioned to an “upscale” model. It sank a heavy investment in real estate, but the quality of goods offered did not warrant the price tag. Shoppers drifted to competitors, sales declined and operating costs spun out of control. Chicago's bloody battles over livable wages and the comparative high cost of doing business here did not help the cause. The new era of grocery shopping will include Dominick's replacement, though, unfortunately, not as many well-paying career jobs. Most closing stores will reopen under an already-strong competitor that can take advantage of the location and instant market share. Opportunities also exist for new entrants. The good-food movement has rekindled the middle market with small, independent options such as co-ops, which will compete with giants like Whole Foods. Never a dull moment, as the grocery game continues.		0

""cnn tonight with don lemon"" starts now. family values. are the trumps the new kennedys? this is ""cnn tonight."" i'm don lemon. president-elect meets with the heads of facebook, apple, amazon and more today. you know who else was in the room?

i'll ask robert f. kennedy jr. meanwhile the president-elect tells the tech titans this today. >> we have no formal chain of command around here. >> no formal chain of command, what will that mean once donald trump takes the oath after office in just 37 days? let's get right to cnn's phil mattingly live for us outside of trump tower where he will be stationed for a while now. and has been. phil, good evening to you. titans of tech were at turn tower today. what else can you tell us? >> reporter: well, what's interesting, don, is this aren't natural allies. if you look over the course of the last 15 months on a number of different policy issues, the tech community and tech campaign split rather sharply and frankly on the support, itself. they also did. if you look at some of the individuals who are in the room, tim cook, sheryl sandberg, eric schmidt, not just opposed to donald trump, supported and in many cases raised money for hillary clinton. today they're willing to try to put that aside.7:02 pmyou talk to sources on both sides, don, they said, look, there's a recognition that both sides need one another, it's a relationship they have to have over the course of the next four years. this was the first stop of this process. there are going to be disagreements and there certainly are on issues like immigration. some issues on taxes. but this was the start of a dialogue that will happen, quarterly from here on out, don. >> phil, there is a lot of discussion about the role of donald trump's children in this meeting. what andcan you tell us about t? >> reporter: jared kushner was in the meeting, ivanka trump in the neat imeeting. they're going to move down to d.c. and have a role there. the big question marks were that eric trump and don jr. were also in this meeting. these are the individuals that the president-elect, himself, tweeted earlier this week would be responsible for running the trump organization. it's not just in this meeting with tech titans, it was also eric trump was involved in the vetting of the secretary of state process. don jr. was involved in the vetting of the interior secretary process. if these two individuals are7:03 pmgoing to be running the trump organization, ethics experts from both sides of the aisle, don, say there needs to be some kind of wall between the business and the policy. what we're seeing right now is that wall simply doesn't exist, don. >> and also it should be of note that twitter ceo jack dorsey wasn't in this meeting today. any reason for that given trump's obsession with twitter? >> reporter: yeah, a politician who has used it like nobody we've seen and really succeeded if large part because of it. look, there is a public explanation and the behind the scenes story. publicly we're told there simply weren't enough seats at that large oak table we were staring at. behind the scenes, this is actually a feud that goes back a couple of months. it starts with trump's digital team. they had an agreement with twitter for a $5 million digital operation. that included custom emojis, emojis that were rejected by twitter and at least according to trump officials rejected explicitly by jack dorsey. because of that, that's one of the reasons i'm told he was not7:04 pminvited today. what trump officials, at least one source said they're not willing to pull punches here, they said part of the reason they weren't invited, twitter wasn't big enough. twitter is a $14 billion company. maybe a little jab there, if you will. >> oh, well. i won't even go there. i've got some new information that i want to ask you about. late tonight, phil, we learned that a judge has ordered president-elect trump to sit for a seven-hour deposition in early january. why is that? >> reporter: well, what's interesting here is this was already arranged in the president-elect's lawyers, his personal lawyers agreed to this deposition. what has changed is those same lawyers requested in the wake of his election that he actually either not have to sit down at all or at least reduce the timetable, reduce the scope of the questions. what happened tonight is a judge rejected that request. so the president-elect just a few days, weeks before he's supposed to be inaugurated, sworn into office will be sitting down subject to lawyers' questions. i can tell you, don, in covering the president-elect throughout the course of this campaign,7:05 pmdepositions of which there are thousands of pages over the course of donald trump's career, have some of the most insightful views and looks into him personally, how he operates business wise. so you know people will be taking a very close look at that deposition, where does this all come from? the trump hotel in washington, d.c., because of his comments at the start of his campaign, celebrity chef jose andres who is contracted to have a restaurant in that hotel, pulled out, trump sued. they've been going back and forth ever since. because of that, he'll be sitting down for seven hours, sworn testimony. >> should be testament why his business interests are so important and keeping conflict of interests apart. thank you so much. appreciate that, phil mattingly. i want to bring in cnn's senior political commentator david axelrod and senior legal analyst, jeffrey toobin. jeffrey, first, if you look at what he just reported about this deposition, thus the concern before we get to these, you know, the folks who are invited to the white house today, these giants of tech, the concern about conflicts of interest here. >> well, i don't know about conflicts of interest, but, you7:06 pmknow, ever since the case of clinton v. jones, the paula jones lawsuit, the supreme court in the late '90s said presidents of the united states can be subject to testimony in a civil case so he -- president-elect, he will be president trump, i think, by this point, he will say -- he will have to testify in this case and there are other cases pending against him as well. so i think this is going to be part of the trump presidency which is giving testimony in civil lawsuits in which he's a defendant. >> all right. thank you for that. let's get back now and talk about the -- what happened today. so the invites to today's tech summit, jeffrey, were signed by trump's son-in-law and adviser jared kushner, chief of staff reince priebus and also billionaire tech investor peter thiel and as we just learned the7:07 pmpresident-elect's three children were there. ""honored to have sat in on this meeting, most impressive group of minds i've seen assembled all looking to fight for america and u.s. jobs."" do you think the separation between the trump business and the white house is ever going to be a clear-cut line, a clear line there? >> no, i don't. i mean, remember, tomorrow was going to be the day that the president-elect held a news conference to explain how he was going to divide his business interests and his presidency. that has been canceled and it will never be rescheduled in my opinion. basically, donald trump's position seems to be i won, deal with it, my family will sort of run this, but my family will also be involved in running -- in my presidency. there is not going to be any legally meaningful division of labor between the presidency and the family business and, you know, the president is going to7:08 pmsimply say, look, if you got a complaint, impeach me which obviously they won't do. this is the way it's going to. >> david, is that the way it's going to be? should the american people have a say in this or do they really? >> as it pertains to the president, little, actually. ethics laws that apply to others in the government don't apply to the president. you know, don, when i went to the white house in 2009, i had two businesses that i had started and developed over a period of decades. and i very quickly sold them on the advice of the ethics lawyers who said they might present a conflict of interest. now, admittedly, those are lunch money for donald trump and his empire is much more complex than my little businesses. but that's generally the rule that applies, and past presidents have liquidated their holdings and put them into blind trusts, so when they made decisions, there was no question that they weren't making them to enrich themselves, but on the7:09 pmbasis of the national interests. people can't have that confidence here because even though donald trump says he's stepping away from his businesses and letting his sons run the businesses, he understands what all of their investments and entanglements are. we don't because he hasn't released his tax returns, by the way, so we don't know where his loans are out and so on. and so this creates a real concern. you said earlier -- earlier that, you know, you asked whether this is the new camelot. i think the fear is that this will be gravelot and the businesses will be a central part of the decision-making in the government so this is unchartered territory. >> yeah. and at the same time, david, that we learned that donald jr. helped vet the -- interview candidates for the interior secretary position and the nominee, congressman ryan zinke of montana, represents a conservationist hunting club, it's called the boone and7:10 pmcrockett club of which don jr. is a member. we also learned eric trump was present for at least one of the meetings between donald trump and mitt romney. can donald jr. and eric be this involved while also managing the business? >> well, apparently they are. whether they should be is another question. look, i don't begrudge mr. trump, the fact that he has great faith in his children and that he wants their counsel, the problem is that if they want to do that, then they should get out of their businesses, sell their businesses, remove themselves from potential areas of conflict. that's what ethics norms would suggest. that's clearly not what's going to happen. >> goreyjeffrey, yes. >> we need to emphasize the point that david made, yes, it is legally true that donald trump does not have to sell his businesses, he does not have to separate himself from his family's business, but it is also true that this is not,7:11 pmlike, the appearance of a conflict of interest. this is an actual conflict of interest here because we have a situation where the trump businesses may owe money to sovereign funds, to banks in russia, to banks in other places, where donald trump as president is going to be negotiating. i mean, it is so egregiously obvious that this is a conflict of interest that under any previous definition of how presidents should behave, these assets should have been liquida liquidated. >> let me -- my previous question, then, what is the recourse here? you said there's nothing illegal about it, correct? >> that's right -- >> how is it not if it's a conflict of interest? >> well, it is a conflict of interest in terms of how lawyers define conflict of interest. it is not illegal under the laws that apply to presidents of the united states. presidents of the united states7:12 pmare exempt from these laws, but just in terms of what it means to have a conflict of interest, this is a conflict of interest because you have a president and his immediate family owning assets, investing assets in countries and in places where american foreign policy has very direct interests. i mean, that's a conflict of interest. >> you should explain the emoluments clause, there is a clause in the constitution that forbids presidents from taking emoluments from foreign interests and that could come into play here for the reason that jeffrey said, although we don't know to whom donald trump owns money because he hasn't -- owes money because he hasn't disclosed that. the question is whether the congress would be rigorous, a congress that's run by the republican party, would be rigorous about pursuing these kinds of conflicts. >> right. what david's referring to a clause of the constitution which7:13 pmsays presidents cannot receive money directly from foreign governments. we don't know exactly what donald trump's financial interests are because he hasn't released his tax returns, he hasn't filed all the forms that are usually to be expected, but certainly at least in terms of his hotel on pennsylvania avenue, it does appear that he is -- he is getting funds of this kind. but, again, because we don't know what the facts are, we don't know if there is a precise violation of the emoluments clause, but the only remedy, the only way to address this is impeachment which obviously is not going to be something under consideration in the house of representatives which is dominated, which is controlled by the republicans. >> okay. is that the only way that he --7:14 pmwho would hold him accountable? is it just congress, david? >> well, under the constitution -- >> is it not the american people as well? >> my question, and jeffrey may have an answer o thto this is, about the kids, what are they subject to under the law? they're not the president of the united states. if they -- if they have conflicts, can they be pursued? not whether they will because obviously the justice department is going to be his justice department, but could they be pursued -- >> that's a very good question. >> as far as i'm aware, because of the 1989 amendments to these disclosure laws, it does not -- none of the trump family can legally be held accountable for any conflicts of interest. that's my understanding. although, you know, we are in unchartered territory here. this has never been tested by a court. but, you know, the check on all of this, by in large, is7:15 pmpolitical, is, you know, is the congress outraged? is the public outraged? certainly, as of now, december 2016, there is not enough outrage to motivate a republican congress to get involved. you know, if things change, perhaps there will be, but i think basically donald trump has said this is the way it's going to be. if you have an objection, impeach me, which obviously they're not going to do so i think this is going to be the status quo. >> or defeat me and that could be another recourse, but where the rubber is going to hit the road, don, is when and if there are decisions made that appear to be motivated or could be motivated by elements of the trump businesses and, you know, those examples, you know, may or may not turn up in the future. i think rigorous reporting will have to be the source of those.7:16 pm>> interesting conversation and one that will continue. probably for at least the next four years. thank you. >> at least. >> at least. thank you, david, thank you, jeffrey. when we come right back, she may be the most feared woman in silicon valley and she says the tech leaders at today's meeting at trump tower should be ashamed of themselves. is she right?

>> a photo op. that's what i think it's about.7:20 pmso that's what it was. it was a very nice photo op and i don't think very much was said. i've talked to a number of people who were there and nothing happened. and words like ""very productive"" came out of it, so that could give you a clue, none of the tech leaders talked about it after they left and they ran out pretty quickly. so i don't think anything happened. it was just a large photo op and good for donald trump for getting them all in a room, peter thiel, really, who is his major tech helper. >> what did they get out of it? what did either side get out of it? any of them? >> donald trump gets a great photo op with all the major leaders of tech who opposed him for the most part, were pretty much hillary clinton supporters and have said various things. each of the people in the room had said something publicly about him. he gets sth s them in there, lo like he's pushing for jobs, looks like he's pushing for them to keep manufacturing in the united states even though most of them make things outside of the country. for them, they have to play nice with a new administration. they thought it was going it be a different administration. this case, they got a lot of major issues, regulation issues,7:21 pmencryption issues, immigration issues. they feel like they have to be at the table even though it's not the table they wanted to be at the first place. they showed up. >> he criticized the industry relentlessly during the campaign. listen to what he said at the outset of today's meeting. here it is. >> i want to add that i'm here to help you folks do well and you're doing well right now and i'm very honored by the bounce, they're all talking about the bounce. right now everybody in this room has -- anything we can do to help this go along and we're going to be there for you and you'll call my people, you'll call me. it doesn't make any difference. we have no formal chain of command around here. >> for people who have been paying attention to this which is most people and the people at that table, they are probably saying right now, where is donald trump, what'd you do with him? that's white a different tone than what he took on the campaign trail. will that soften hard feelings?7:22 pm>> no, i don't think -- there's not going to be hard feelings. they didn't win and their candidate did not win. that's besides the point. the point is, first of all, i don't know what the bounce is, i'm still trying to figure that particular thing out. >> maybe the stephen colbert bounce. i think he means the stock market. >> the fact they're doing well, they've done kind of well, the internet companies, google, the whole company seems to be doing well. the problem is these people have a lot of issues before the government and they obviouslywo administration being hostile to them. he's making nice with certain people. he needs them. they're an important part of the economy. the tech vindustry is the one industry this country has that is number one really around the globe so he's got to have relationships with them and most of them haven't met him, most people in that room had never met him or dealt with them. of course they're going to go.7:23 pmmy issue is they have so many major issues that are opposed to things he's said and none of them spoke out about any of them. these are the most powerful people on earth and didn't feel it was necessary to say anything about immigration which is critical to the growth of tech. they didn't say anything about encryption which is critical. net neutrality. you oucould go on and on and on. there wasn't a peep out of any of them about these issues. >> why not? >> they want to get along. i mean, you know, you make a decision. they have shareholders, these are mostly, i think they're all public companies. they have it be seen as cooperati cooperative. a lot of people in silicon valley don't like that. a lot of engineers -- there was just a petition put out by a lot of engineers here that's saying we don't want to cooperate a lot of these things that the trump administration has been talking about. like registries of muslims and various things. they'll never cooperate. it's going to be an interesting fight in silicon valley because it's supposed to about tolerance, diversity, immigrant immigrants.7:24 pmimmigrants built silicon valley. the question is can they stick with their values, alleged values and the same time cooperate with some things that might rub them the wrong way? we'll see if they have the guts to do that. >> i wonder if they're worried about twitter ceo, jack dorsey, he wasn't invited today because apparently trump's people were angry at dorsey, he allegedly rejected an ad with a custom emoji of his #crookedhillary. they were concerned about not being invited and what are your sources telling you about the story, is it true? >> i don't know if the story is exactly true. look, this is a group of people who have done things like this before. it could be true. they talked about there wasn't room at the table and twitter wasn't big which is kind of ridiculous. twitter is a gift from god to donald trump in this election and he's a tweet savant, like i've never seen anyone use twitter so effectively. so i think that's just -- i think there's probably a lot of bad blood between them, but i don't think they're scared not to be invited. i don't think that's necessarily it. i don't think jack dorsey is7:25 pmweeping here in san francisco that he's not there. i do think they feel there's a lot of issues like repatriation of all mat money. billions and billions of dollars they want back in this country of income. there's all kinds of things they want so they have to cooperate. it's a republican administration, a republican congress, republican governorships everywhere. they have to reach out and cooperate with him. i don't think they had a choice to go. i just feel they could have been more firm given how powerful they are as people, how rich they are, how influential they are that they could have just said a few things, especially around immigration, and some other issues that are near and dear to the hearts of most of the workers of silicon valley. >> you think it was appropriate for the three older children to participate in this meeting? >> no. not at all. i mean, can you imagine, this is tim cook, ceo of apple, ceo of google, elon musk, a real visionary leader. these are serious businesses. sheryl sandberg. the children shouldn't be there. that, to me, said played, this is a photo op.7:26 pmreally, can you imagine if chelsea clinton had shown up? it's just -- i think it's -- it didn't take these people seriously to have the kids there. >> i thought that -- >> they're not kids. they're adults. adult children. >> i thought your article was very biting and entitled as, you said as trump thin skin lets down his hair, shame for silicon valley of climbing a tower in silence. they opted to punt with most of them saying nothing publicly about even attending the summit, nor making it clear beforehand that there are some key issues that are just not negotiable. that's why the leaders of tech should be ashamed of themselves for lining up like sheeple after all the numb skull attacks trump has made on pretty much the united states' most important, innovative and future-forward business sector. i mean, why don't you say how you really feel there? >> well, don, we only go around this world once. you got to say what you think. i tell it like it is. i take my advice from donald trump and, you know, this is a really exciting industry and7:27 pmthey always talk about how bold and disruptive they are except when it comes to things that might disrupt them. they're going to be bold and disruptive, change the world, listen, i are to listen to it all day long about how amazing some photo op is, they should understand the leadership and it's about leadership here and not whether you're for or against trump, because that doesn't matter at this point now, does it? i think the point is that there are lots of issues that are critical to why silicon valley is so great and there's a lot of ways that silicon valley can help this country and create jobs and do all kinds of things and how technology can help us all and i think by beinging inie yes sent and not speaking up, we'll see. there's supposed to be one quarterly. we'll see if they speak out, if there's issues around immigration, for example, or, you know, or encryption, boirks that's going to be some fight if that continues to go forward. there's a lot of things that silicon valley really should be doing to stand up as leaders of one of most critical industries that we have in this country and7:28 pmglobally and that's just -- so that's what i -- i think i'm reflecting a lot of people on silicon valley. >> the point is speaking truth to power and holding our leaders and our business leaders and our government leaders accountable, so i thank you for coming on, i thank you for that article. keep it up. thanks very much. when we come right back, president barack obama vowing to work for the rest of his life on his mentorship program for young men of color. what will his legacy be on race in donald trump's america? we'll discuss. [vo] quickbooks introduces jeanette. and her new business: i do, to go.7:29 pmjeanette was excellent at marrying people. but had trouble getting paid. not a good time, jeanette. even worse. now i'm uncomfortable. but here's the good news, jeanette got quickbooks. send that invoice, jeanette. looks like they viewed it. and, ta-da! paid twice as fast. oh, she's an efficient officiant. way to grow, jeanette. get paid twice as fast. visit quickbooks-dot-com. that's 7,671 moon rises, we created blue moon. 48 eclipses and a refreshing taste that's always stayed the same. creatively inspired. artfully brewed. blue moon.7:30 pm7:31 pmpresident barack obama's preparing to leave the white house in about five weeks and today he announced his lifetime7:32 pmcommitment to my brother's keeper, a mentorship program he created to help young men of clear. here to discuss, charles blow, op-ped columnist for ""the new york times"" and paris denard, director of black outreach for president george w. bush. good evening. thau thanks for coming on. here's what president barack obama said about at his final my brother's keeper summit today. >> it was not about me, it was not about my presidency, it's not even just about malachi and all these amazing young men behind me, it's about all of us working together because ensuring that our young people can go as far as their dreams and hard work will take them is the single most important task that we have as a nation. it is the single most important thing we can do for our country's future. this is something i will be invested in for the rest of my life. and i look forward to continuing to join with you. >> what's your reaction? >> well, you know, don, thanks for having me on tonight.7:33 pmi think it's important that president obama commits the rest of his time as the former president to causes greater than his own self-interest and to commit himself to things that are going to help the black community. you saw many former presidents decide to do things as extensions of what they tried to do or what they did do during their time in the administration or the time at the white house. president george w. bush with his commitment to africa. you saw president william clinton with commitment to international efforts with his global initiative. and president carter with those things that he did with voting and election monitoring. and so i think for president obama, it's important for him as the first african-american president to have his legacy try to be something about uplifting the black community for the rest of his life, especially in chicago where miss library will be. it's going to be important that his work that he's been given is not -- does not go away and that7:34 pmhe continues to do whatever he can do to uplift our community. >> charles, what does this tell us about obama's involvement in public life under a trump presidency, he thought he'd be handing it off to hillary clinton who would continue his policies. now he is, you know, clearly has to keep the flame alive. he needs to do it on his own. >> yeah, but for the very first time i ever heard him talk about this in private, i knew immediately he was going to continue to do it after his presidency and in fact the way it was set up, it was drawing a lot from the private sector, not as much from government so that you could carry it over outside of government. it was very clear to ame that h really was invested in it personally and he wanted to continue to do it. when he said that to me, it wasn't a shock -- >> i was there for the announ announceme announcement. you were as well. i said, this is going to be -- >> that's him. in addition to that, i fundamentally believe that his time in office has fundamentally changed him, you know, the7:35 pmthings that have bubbled up while he was in office, the number of -- the kind of police/community issues, black lives matter, all of this, trayvon martin was one of the first things that kind of kicked him and kind of -- in the that he needed to completely change, but it did alter him fundamentally and make him look at these -- at this group of people and he saw how much of an impact that he was personally having on the black community in terms of image and, like, people being able to look at the white house and say, there's somebody there who looks like me and those little boys would try to rub his hair and make sure that it felt like theirs. he -- he was changed by that. he understands that he has a particular power and potency in the black community and he wants to use that to good and that is a remarkable thing. >> yeah. listen, paris, it's not perfect. there's a lot of work to do in all communities and the black community as well, but since the president took office, the7:36 pmnumber of unemployed black teens, the initiative is about young black men, has dropped by more than half. what did you hope race relations would look like at the end of eight years, his eight years in office? >> you know, i think a lot of people came into president obama's term in office thinking that a lot of things would change for the black community on the positive note. his legacy is going to be a mixed one, to be quite frank with you and a lot of people will have mixed emotions about whether he did enough, whether he was quote/unquote, black enough and whether he used his political capital enough for the community. what i will say is any time the president used the bully pulpit to address issues and directly impact the black community is a positive thing. that's why i was also proud when president-elect trump talked about specific issues with the black community. some may go back and forth on whether or not he used the right tone or the right messaging, but i think it's always important that people in these leadership positions are always talking and trying to find solutions to do7:37 pmsomething about unemployment, to have mentoring programs and to actually uplift our community because we have to be focused on the least of these in our society. >> recently, charles, damn if you do, damn if you don't, when he did things targeting the black community, he's the president of all people, not just the president of black people. that's what some conservatives and some people would say and then, of course, african-americans would say, well, he's not doing enough for the black community. he was walking a tightrope. >> well, i think that the biggest change, the biggest impact that this presidency will have is that it elevated the idea, the notion, the very real impact of structural racism in america. that conversation really took root during this presidency and it's not just what he was saying. it was eric holder was saying, it was what loretta lynch was saying, it was what the secretary of transportation was7:38 pmsaying. it was what -- it felt like the entire government apparatus woke up and said, we have to make a statement, even comey discussed this in terms of the relationship between the police and communities of color. everybody seemed over that eight-year period at some point went out of their way to address the idea that this was not simply about interpersonal relationships and how people felt. it was literally about construct, a structure that had been -- that was designed on purpose. >> yeah. >> to benefit some people and disadvantage others. >> all right. i want you both to stick with me because up next, is donald trump sending a not so subtle message with his picks for a cabinet that looks to be the least diverse in years?7:39 pm♪ for millions of baby boomers there's a virus out there. a virus that's serious, like hiv, but it hasn't been talked about much. a virus that's been almost forgotten. it's hepatitis c. one in 30 boomers has hep c, yet most don't even know it. that's because hep c can hide in your body silently for years, even decades, without symptoms and it's not tested for in routine blood work. if left untreated, hep c can cause liver damage, even liver cancer. but there's important information for us: the cdc recommends all baby boomers get tested for hep c. all it takes is a simple one-time blood test.7:40 pmand if you have hep c, it can be cured. be sure to ask your doctor to get tested for hep c. for us it's time to get tested. it's the only way to know for sure.7:41 pmzero really can be a hero.ds) get zero down, zero deposit, zero due at signing, and zero first month's payment on select volkswagen models. right now at the volkswagen sign then drive event.7:42 pmdonald trump's cabinet so far is overwhelmingly white and overwhelmingly male. what does that say about the next four years? back with me, charles blow and paris dennard. okay, paris, let's take a look at trump's cabinet, so far, we should say. by selecting rex tillerson to serve as secretary of state trump guarantees his four most influential departments will be led entirely by white males. there's the first time since george h.w. bush's cabinet was approved in 1989. obama's first round of appointees included eric holder as attorney general, hillary7:43 pmclinton as secretary of state. if you look at george w. bush cabinet, he chose colin powell as secretary of state. so what's your reaction? >> i mean, i think that when i look at president-elect trump's cabinet selection so far, i see something that americans should be proud about. he has four women that are qualified to be up there on that list. he has an african-american, he has an asian-american, he has an indian-americ indian-american. i think he's going what he always said he was going to do is pick the most qualified people to serve in the cabinet. it's reflective of the type of people he had running his campaign. he had african-americans at trump tower, he had women, his campaign manager was a woman and is reflective of the country so i think it's a good thing we should celebrate. could he have selected more african-americans? sure. could he have selected more women? sure. we should celebrate the fact we have dr. ben carson there, celebrate the fact there are four qualified women that donald trump, the president-elect, has7:44 pmselected. so i don't necessarily see it as a bad thing. i see it as a positive step forward. >> he went through two white males first before choosing kellyanne conway, that was his last of campaign managers. >> sure, but the person who got him across the finish line who was successful electing the president was a woman. >> charles, looking at his cabinet picks, why do you think trump and his team have chosen primarily white ceos and military men as advisers? >> i mean, let's start with this, that is, at that level of government, there's no shortage of people who are qualified to do those particular jobs. it boils down to each president making a personal decision about who they feel most comfortable with, who they feel they can work with, who would advance their policies. if the vast majority of the people you feel comfortable with are people who look like you, who have the same cultural, economic experience as you, a lot of millionaires and billionaires in there, that says something about you. and you have to then do some work, some self-reflective work about what is this saying about me if i feel most comfortable7:45 pmwith people who are the most like me? because that is the exact opposite of what it means to value diversity. you know, if you've ever been a manager of any sort of -- what level, you know, in economics or government, you understand that you can actually -- even if you're in -- you can find diversity if you look for it and value it. this is a question about values. if you value it, you would have more people. that's just the way it is. these are personal choices and more than enough people who are qualified to do these jobs. >> there are four women there, there's an african-american, an asian-american, indian-american. i don't -- that's diversity. it may not be the diversity that you like, but it's diversity. it is a diverse cabinet. we should celebrate it. the idea that it's not is laughable. it is a diverse cabinet and it's a good thing. >> the premise of the question, though -- >> let me laugh. i'm going to laugh. it's laughable. >> all right. i have to go. on that note, i do have to go.7:46 pmthank you, gentlemen. i appreciate it. when we come right back, are the trumps the new kennedys? i'll ask robert f. kennedy jr. about that.7:47 pmi really did save hundreds on my car insurance with geico. i should take a closer look at geico... geico has a long history of great savings and great service. over seventy-five years. wait. seventy-five years? that is great. speaking of great, check out these hot riffs. you like smash mouth? uh, yeah i have an early day tomorrow so... wait. almost there. goodnight, bruce.7:48 pmgotta tune the ""a."" (humming) take a closer look at geico. great savings. and a whole lot more.7:49 pmso mixed signals on the environment from the incoming7:50 pmtrump administration. environmentalists are not exactly cheering some of the president-elect's cabinet picks, but ivanka trump has said she wants to make climate change one of her top issues. let's discuss with robert f. kennedy, jr., president of water keeper alliance, of the water keeper alliance. i want to ask you about a suit that you have against exxon but let me start with this. donald trump's picks for the -- for state, the epa, energy, the department of interior, let's say who they are. this is rex tillerson, he runs exxonmobil, scott pruitt will lead the epa, rick perry who promised to eliminate the energy department the boss there and his choice for interior secretary, ryan zinke has a 3% environmental record from the league of conservation voters. when you look at all these choices, mr. kennedy, what are your thoughts? >> environmentalists are not happy with those choices. you know, it feels like we kind7:51 pmof cut out the middleman and are handing the country right over to the oil industry. when president bush came in, i think 16 of his top 21 officials were from the oil industry and they helped get us into the iraq war and helped sponsor a very bellicose pugnacious foreign policy that was really intended to advance the mercantile interest of american corporations rather than advancing the traditional ideals and the highest ideals of our country and this -- these appointments are people who have throughout their careers have served the oil industry and not particularly served america very well. >> and on that note, your organization, water keeper, pushing the government to end all its contracts with exxonmobil but under rex tillerson exxon acknowledges climate change is real, he supports the paris agreement.7:52 pmdo you think he could actually be an ally in the trump administration because he's not a climate change denier? >> i don't -- you know, rex tillerson is better than his predecessor, rex tillerson came in in 2006 and ended a lot of the connections, the support that exxon was giving to these climate denier groups but they're continuing to pave climate denier groups even today and they've had a 50-year propaganda campaign. exxonmobil has known, we now know since the late 1970s that global warming was going to raise the temperature six degrees celsius by the end of the century. and the last time it was that high, don, there were crocodiles at the north pole. this is the end of the planet and they knew it, they had 16,000 scientists and they knew more about the fate of the carbon atom than any company or any government institution in the world. it was very clear to them and for the first few years they were honest about it.7:53 pmin 1988, they began working with the american petroleum institute, they decided to implement a propaganda campaign, they put hundreds of millions of dollars into persuading the americans -- doing the same thing the tobacco industry did. thayer ey er ttore the pages rif the tobacco industry's book. tobacco knew in 1965 that they were killing people and they used the product as directed and they succeeded in evading regulation for half a century by confusing people about the science. they said -- in their internal documents they said ""we don't have to win the scientific debate, we just have to cloud it. we have to confuse people."" and that's been exxon's strategy, rex tillerson is part of that strategy. it's purposefully -- after the bp oil spill we debarred bp from having contracts with the u.s. government for two years.7:54 pmthat same law applies to exxon. what exxon has done to this country, to this planet, is far worse than anything that bp did by its oil spill, it's purposeful, it's deliberate, it's a deliberate campaign of deception to -- that's leading us literally to an apocalypse. >> this is how donald trump described his position on climate change earlier this week. >> i'm still open minded. nobody really knows. i've -- look. i'm somebody that gets it and nobody really knows. it's not something that's so hard and fast. i do know this -- other countries are eating our lunch. >> so how do you unpack that. is he open minded or is he a climate change skeptic? >> well, you know i think the last statement he made is just -- is a -- it's a -- it's kind of a canard because the7:55 pmbest thing that we can do -- all of the things that we need to do don to avert catastrophic climate change are the same things that we need to do to safeguard our economy, to build prosperity, to create jobs, to democratize our economy, to democratize our energy system. there's now more people employed in the solar industry in this country than there are employed as coal miners. there's more people in the wind industry than in the coal industry. so these industries are exploding. it costs -- to build a coal plant costs $3 billion, to build a gas plant -- $3 billion a gig watt to build a gas plant, $3 billion a gig watt to build a solar plant is $2.1 billion a bigot. the inflection point has been passed, we are beating them in the marketplace. they can not compete against us except by maintaining these huge obscene subsidies that are going to the carbon industry and by maintaining their political domination. if we want to lead the worldquote7:56 pmmorally, economically, and in every other way, we need to start by decarbonizing our society. that's the way the world is going to go one way or another. to preserve these corporations and this industry will take a massive economic intervention and i don't think anybody thinks that's good for our country. >> i have to ask you this bauds i think it's very important and very interesting. we've discussed this on this show during the primary season but bill gates has said today that trump could be a new jfk. some people look how close the trump family is and how connected the children are to the family business and say they could be like the kennedys. to ask you, how do you feel about that? >> well, i think donald trump can be any kind of president he wants. he's actually -- he has this extraordinary opportunity because he's coming into office less burdened by obligation than probably any president in our history with the possible exception of andrew jackson and7:57 pmboth of them, jackson and trump, came in, they were -- people were sickened, they were outraged when jackson came in and they thought it was the end of the world and he became a -- unless you were an american indian, he became a very good president in defending the country against corporate power and really democratizing america in many ways. well, i think trump, you know, because he doesn't have obligations, he doesn't owe anything to anybody, if he's -- i think if he cares about history and he understands that history is his principal audience, that he could be an extraordinary president. president kennedy had an advantage on donald trump. he was interested in politics and history from when he was a little boy. he was curious about it, her wrote a best selling book about history when he was in college. he was a war hero, he came home7:58 pmfrom war and he wanted -- he had a clear vision about establishing a path for peace, about standing up to his generals, standing up to the steel industry, the pow eers of wall street, the power centers of our society and really representing the highest ideals of the american people and america at that time was beloved. i remember going to europe with my father right after president kennedy's death to poland, to germany, to france and england and everywhere we went we met hundreds of thousands of people who came out on the street waving tiny american flags and just wanting to touch a kennedy -- not because of our family but because they loved america and they loved what america represented. they were hungary f they were hungry for our leadership and they wanted our moral authority and they looked to us for that and there are people all over latin america7:59 pmand africa today whose name is kennedy. who named their kids after john kennedy because they loved our country. and this is the kind of leadership that i think americans want today to get rid of this bullying and this bellicose pugnacious foreign policy. >> do you think trump can do that? >> i think he can do that. i think he can do anything he wants because he is not bound by ideology. he is less bound by ideology than any president probably that we've had this century. >> so the new kennedys? >> he said to leonardo dicaprio the other day that he wanted to be the next teddy roosevelt and he can easily do that. he could -- but i think it's important to start by surrounding yourself with advisers who share that idealism and not people who are just working for the oil industry. >> i just haves about 10 seconds here, but do you think the new kennedys, do you think that's a fair comparison. >> like i said i think he can bhquote8:00 pmany kind of president he wants. i think he could be the greatest president in history if he wanted to. >> thank you, robert kennedy. and give my best to your wife. >> thank you. >> thank you very much. it's the top of the hour, thank you for joining us. donald trump is filling his cabinet, but will the most powerful people in the white house be his children? this is ""cnn tonight."" i'm don lemon, donald, jr., ivanka and eric trump all at today's meeting with tech titans at trump tour. donald, jr., helped interview candidates for interior secretary. eric trump was present for at least one miting between his father and mitt romney and ivanka trump will reportedly take on some of the duties normally assigned to the first lady. her husband jared kushner expected to have his own role in the white house. is there a line between the trump family and business and the oval office? i want to begin with cnn's phil mattingly live at trump tower. phil, what can you tell us about this tech summit at trump tower"		0

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/birdwatcher-oregon-militia/	an elderly birdwatcher had a physical altercation with an oregon militant at the malheur national wildlife refuge.	False	['']	http://www.dailykos.com/	http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/01/05/1466254/-Warning-from-the-Birding-Community-to-the-Terrorists-in-Oregon-We-re-Watching-You	2016/01/14	"Birding photographers always vigilant. Just a friendly warning from the birding and wildlife photography community to the Oregon terrorists. We are watching your every move, and we have been watching you for a long time. And yes absolutely you are domestic terrorists of the worst kind, and the truth about your decades of constant poaching of protected wildlife around Malheur and other wildlife refuges, national parks, national forests and BLM lands has been well-documented. For years those of us who are wildlife photographers, birdwatchers and carers of wildlife, have been documenting the activities of you poachers and criminals around many of our nation's wildlife refuges. With our powerful cameras, and ability to move unseen in the wilderness, we have found and documented your illegal hunts, your illegal traps and all sorts of illicit activities, and are constantly feeding that information to law enforcement, and we have finally got many of you poachers on the run and into jails. And I for one am a westerner sick to death of you welfare queens and cheats living off of BLM land, illegally gutting our wilderness and our wildlife. Malheur, Hart Mountain, Klamath Marsh, Yellowstone, Glacier, Yosemite etc etc, they all belong to us, we the American people, and no small group of armed thugs is going to destroy the great wildlife and national park system that our great Republican President Teddy Roosevelt and John Muir put in place over a century ago. Wildlife photographers and wildlife/bird watchers now number some 40 million people in the USA, and feed many rural western economies with our tourism dollars, and we will not stand for your sedition. As Oregon's Congressman Earl Blumenauer just stated, ""Armed insurrection is terrorism. The situation at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge shouldn't be allowed to fester but should be dealt with firmly, swiftly and fairly. The continued disruption to the community of Burns and occupation of a federal facility is unacceptable. Those of us who are international wildlife and nature photographers regularly face charging elephants, attacking lions and grizzlies, hidden crocodiles, massive storms, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, the hottest, coldest and windiest conditions, and all kinds of poisonous snakes and bugs in our work, and we know the outdoors and wilderness from desert to jungle to sea to mountain to tundra from pole to equator better then any poacher or criminal or yeehaw yokel ever will, and we are not afraid to protect it. We have a just fear of nature from experience, but we don't fear you gun-toting thugs in the least. You will never see us, but we and our cameras will always see you. We will #takebackmalheur from you terrorists, and will not rest until every one of you thugs and poachers is behind bars where they belong. You may think that your communities support you, but the majority do not and as many as support you, many more despise you, and your every move is being documented in great detail. The birding networks are ablaze right now about everything going on in Malheur. We know the nearby trailer park, who is supplying you with food, and a tourist boycott of them is already in the works for all birders for this upcoming bird season. We know who everyone is coming in and out, and why, and every shred of information is going straight to law enforcement and across every birding network in America. And for those of us who are also lawyers (I for example just happen to have a law degree of U of Oregon), whether the Feds prosecute you or not (and we will do all in our power to ensure they do), we will put every civil suit against you and God knows you have given us plenty to work with, so you will know once and for all that your odious actions have real consequences. We stand now and forever with wildlife, and you seditionists and terrorists are about to find out that's there is a natural law of karma that vindictive people, who go out and poach innocent animals, will never be able to outrun or hide from. We are watching you and our years of birding photography have made us endlessly patient and determined."		0

Mixture	['']	https://www.nobelprize.org/	https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2007/gore-lecture_en.html	2017/04/17	"Nobel Lecture, Oslo, 10 December 2007.Al Gore delivering his Nobel Lecture in the Oslo City Hall, 10 December 2007.Copyright © The Norwegian Nobel Institute 2007Photo: Ken Opprann Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, Honorable members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen.I have a purpose here today. It is a purpose I have tried to serve for many years. I have prayed that God would show me a way to accomplish it.Sometimes, without warning, the future knocks on our door with a precious and painful vision of what might be. One hundred and nineteen years ago, a wealthy inventor read his own obituary, mistakenly published years before his death. Wrongly believing the inventor had just died, a newspaper printed a harsh judgment of his life's work, unfairly labeling him ""The Merchant of Death"" because of his invention – dynamite. Shaken by this condemnation, t he inventor made a fateful choice to serve the cause of peace.Seven years later, Alfred Nobel created this prize and the others that bear his name.Seven years ago tomorrow, I read my own political obituary in a judgment that seemed to me harsh and mistaken – if not premature. But that unwelcome verdict also brought a precious if painful gift: an opportunity to search for fresh new ways to serve my purpose.Unexpectedly, that quest has brought me here. Even though I fear my words cannot match this moment, I pray what I am feeling in my heart will be communicated clearly enough that those who hear me will say, ""We must act.""The distinguished scientists with whom it is the greatest honor of my life to share this award have laid before us a choice between two different futures – a choice that to my ears echoes the words of an ancient prophet: ""Life or death, blessings or curses. Therefore, choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live.""We, the human species, are confronting a planetary emergency – a threat to the survival of our civilization that is gathering ominous and destructive potential even as we gather here. But there is hopeful news as well: we have the ability to solve this crisis and avoid the worst – though not all – of its consequences, if we act boldly, decisively and quickly.However, despite a growing number of honorable exceptions, too many of the world's leaders are still best described in the words Winston Churchill applied to those who ignored Adolf Hitler's threat: ""They go on in strange paradox, decided only to be undecided, resolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity, all powerful to be impotent.""So today, we dumped another 70 million tons of global-warming pollution into the thin shell of atmosphere surrounding our planet, as if it were an open sewer. And tomorrow, we will dump a slightly larger amount, with the cumulative concentrations now trapping more and more heat from the sun.As a result, the earth has a fever. And the fever is rising. The experts have told us it is not a passing affliction that will heal by itself. We asked for a second opinion. And a third. And a fourth. And the consistent conclusion, restated with increasing alarm, is that something basic is wrong.We are what is wrong, and we must make it right.Last September 21, as the Northern Hemisphere tilted away from the sun, scientists reported with unprecedented distress that the North Polar ice cap is ""falling off a cliff."" One study estimated that it could be completely gone during summer in less than 22 years. Another new study, to be presented by U.S. Navy researchers later this week, warns it could happen in as little as 7 years.Seven years from now.In the last few months, it has been harder and harder to misinterpret the signs that our world is spinning out of kilter. Major cities in North and South America, Asia and Australia are nearly out of water due to massive droughts and melting glaciers. Desperate farmers are losing their livelihoods. Peoples in the frozen Arctic and on low-lying Pacific islands are planning evacuations of places they have long called home. Unprecedented wildfires have forced a half million people from their homes in one country and caused a national emergency that almost brought down the government in another. Climate refugees have migrated into areas already inhabited by people with different cultures, religions, and traditions, increasing the potential for conflict. Stronger storms in the Pacific and Atlantic have threatened whole cities. Millions have been displaced by massive flooding in South Asia, Mexico, and 18 countries in Africa. As temperature extremes have increased, tens of thousands have lost their lives. We are recklessly burning and clearing our forests and driving more and more species into extinction. The very web of life on which we depend is being ripped and frayed.We never intended to cause all this destruction, just as Alfred Nobel never intended that dynamite be used for waging war. He had hoped his invention would promote human progress. We shared that same worthy goal when we began burning massive quantities of coal, then oil and methane.Even in Nobel's time, there were a few warnings of the likely consequences. One of the very first winners of the Prize in chemistry worried that, ""We are evaporating our coal mines into the air."" After performing 10,000 equations by hand, Svante Arrhenius calculated that the earth's average temperature would increase by many degrees if we doubled the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.Seventy years later, my teacher, Roger Revelle, and his colleague, Dave Keeling, began to precisely document the increasing CO2 levels day by day.But unlike most other forms of pollution, CO2 is invisible, tasteless, and odorless – which has helped keep the truth about what it is doing to our climate out of sight and out of mind. Moreover, the catastrophe now threatening us is unprecedented – and we often confuse the unprecedented with the improbable.We also find it hard to imagine making the massive changes that are now necessary to solve the crisis. And when large truths are genuinely inconvenient, whole societies can, at least for a time, ignore them. Yet as George Orwell reminds us: ""Sooner or later a false belief bumps up against solid reality, usually on a battlefield.""In the years since this prize was first awarded, the entire relationship between humankind and the earth has been radically transformed. And still, we have remained largely oblivious to the impact of our cumulative actions.Indeed, without realizing it, we have begun to wage war on the earth itself. Now, we and the earth's climate are locked in a relationship familiar to war planners: ""Mutually assured destruction.""More than two decades ago, scientists calculated that nuclear war could throw so much debris and smoke into the air that it would block life-giving sunlight from our atmosphere, causing a ""nuclear winter."" Their eloquent warnings here in Oslo helped galvanize the world's resolve to halt the nuclear arms race.Now science is warning us that if we do not quickly reduce the global warming pollution that is trapping so much of the heat our planet normally radiates back out of the atmosphere, we are in danger of creating a permanent ""carbon summer.""As the American poet Robert Frost wrote, ""Some say the world will end in fire; some say in ice."" Either, he notes, ""would suffice.""But neither need be our fate. It is time to make peace with the planet.We must quickly mobilize our civilization with the urgency and resolve that has previously been seen only when nations mobilized for war. These prior struggles for survival were won when leaders found words at the 11th hour that released a mighty surge of courage, hope and readiness to sacrifice for a protracted and mortal challenge.These were not comforting and misleading assurances that the threat was not real or imminent; that it would affect others but not ourselves; that ordinary life might be lived even in the presence of extraordinary threat; that Providence could be trusted to do for us what we would not do for ourselves.No, these were calls to come to the defense of the common future. They were calls upon the courage, generosity and strength of entire peoples, citizens of every class and condition who were ready to stand against the threat once asked to do so. Our enemies in those times calculated that free people would not rise to the challenge; they were, of course, catastrophically wrong.Now comes the threat of climate crisis – a threat that is real, rising, imminent, and universal. Once again, it is the 11th hour. The penalties for ignoring this challenge are immense and growing, and at some near point would be unsustainable and unrecoverable. For now we still have the power to choose our fate, and the remaining question is only this: Have we the will to act vigorously and in time, or will we remain imprisoned by a dangerous illusion?Mahatma Gandhi awakened the largest democracy on earth and forged a shared resolve with what he called ""Satyagraha"" – or ""truth force.""In every land, the truth – once known – has the power to set us free.Truth also has the power to unite us and bridge the distance between ""me"" and ""we,"" creating the basis for common effort and shared responsibility.There is an African proverb that says, ""If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."" We need to go far, quickly.We must abandon the conceit that individual, isolated, private actions are the answer. They can and do help. But they will not take us far enough without collective action. At the same time, we must ensure that in mobilizing globally, we do not invite the establishment of ideological conformity and a new lock-step ""ism.""That means adopting principles, values, laws, and treaties that release creativity and initiative at every level of society in multifold responses originating concurrently and spontaneously.This new consciousness requires expanding the possibilities inherent in all humanity. The innovators who will devise a new way to harness the sun's energy for pennies or invent an engine that's carbon negative may live in Lagos or Mumbai or Montevideo. We must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world.When we unite for a moral purpose that is manifestly good and true, the spiritual energy unleashed can transform us. The generation that defeated fascism throughout the world in the 1940s found, in rising to meet their awesome challenge, that they had gained the moral authority and long-term vision to launch the Marshall Plan, the United Nations, and a new level of global cooperation and foresight that unified Europe and facilitated the emergence of democracy and prosperity in Germany, Japan, Italy and much of the world. One of their visionary leaders said, ""It is time we steered by the stars and not by the lights of every passing ship.""In the last year of that war, you gave the Peace Prize to a man from my hometown of 2000 people, Carthage, Tennessee. Cordell Hull was described by Franklin Roosevelt as the ""Father of the United Nations."" He was an inspiration and hero to my own father, who followed Hull in the Congress and the U.S. Senate and in his commitment to world peace and global cooperation.My parents spoke often of Hull, always in tones of reverence and admiration. Eight weeks ago, when you announced this prize, the deepest emotion I felt was when I saw the headline in my hometown paper that simply noted I had won the same prize that Cordell Hull had won. I n that moment, I knew what my father and mother would have felt were they alive.Just as Hull's generation found moral authority in rising to solve the world crisis caused by fascism, so too can we find our greatest opportunity in rising to solve the climate crisis. In the Kanji characters used in both Chinese and Japanese, ""crisis"" is written with two symbols, the first meaning ""danger,"" the second ""opportunity."" By facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis, we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored.We must understand the connections between the climate crisis and the afflictions of poverty, hunger, HIV-Aids and other pandemics. As these problems are linked, so too must be their solutions. We must begin by making the common rescue of the global environment the central organizing principle of the world community.Fifteen years ago, I made that case at the ""Earth Summit"" in Rio de Janeiro. Ten years ago, I presented it in Kyoto. This week, I will urge the delegates in Bali to adopt a bold mandate for a treaty that establishes a universal global cap on emissions and uses the market in emissions trading to efficiently allocate resources to the most effective opportunities for speedy reductions.This treaty should be ratified and brought into effect everywhere in the world by the beginning of 2010 – two years sooner than presently contemplated. The pace of our response must be accelerated to match the accelerating pace of the crisis itself.Heads of state should meet early next year to review what was accomplished in Bali and take personal responsibility for addressing this crisis. It is not unreasonable to ask, given the gravity of our circumstances, that these heads of state meet every three months until the treaty is completed.We also need a moratorium on the construction of any new generating facility that burns coal without the capacity to safely trap and store carbon dioxide.And most important of all, we need to put a price on carbon – with a CO2 tax that is then rebated back to the people, progressively, according to the laws of each nation, in ways that shift the burden of taxation from employment to pollution. This is by far the most effective and simplest way to accelerate solutions to this crisis.The world needs an alliance – especially of those nations that weigh heaviest in the scales where earth is in the balance. I salute Europe and Japan for the steps they've taken in recent years to meet the challenge, and the new government in Australia, which has made solving the climate crisis its first priority.But the outcome will be decisively influenced by two nations that are now failing to do enough: the United States and China. While India is also growing fast in importance, it should be absolutely clear that it is the two largest CO2 emitters – most of all, my own country – that will need to make the boldest moves, or stand accountable before history for their failure to act.Both countries should stop using the other's behavior as an excuse for stalemate and instead develop an agenda for mutual survival in a shared global environment.These are the last few years of decision, but they can be the first years of a bright and hopeful future if we do what we must. No one should believe a solution will be found without effort, without cost, without change. Let us acknowledge that if we wish to redeem squandered time and speak again with moral authority, then these are the hard truths:The way ahead is difficult. The outer boundary of what we currently believe is feasible is still far short of what we actually must do. Moreover, between here and there, across the unknown, falls the shadow.That is just another way of saying that we have to expand the boundaries of what is possible. In the words of the Spanish poet, Antonio Machado, ""Pathwalker, there is no path. You must make the path as you walk.""We are standing at the most fateful fork in that path. So I want to end as I began, with a vision of two futures – each a palpable possibility – and with a prayer that we will see with vivid clarity the necessity of choosing between those two futures, and the urgency of making the right choice now.The great Norwegian playwright, Henrik Ibsen, wrote, ""One of these days, the younger generation will come knocking at my door.""The future is knocking at our door right now. Make no mistake, the next generation will ask us one of two questions. Either they will ask: ""What were you thinking; why didn't you act? ""Or they will ask instead: ""How did you find the moral courage to rise and successfully resolve a crisis that so many said was impossible to solve?""We have everything we need to get started, save perhaps political will, but political will is a renewable resource.So let us renew it, and say together: ""We have a purpose. We are many. For this purpose we will rise, and we will act."" Copyright © The Nobel Foundation 2007Share this:To cite this pageMLA style: ""Al Gore - Nobel Lecture"". Nobelprize.org.

But the situation appears to have worsened since his win.Here are just a few examples of Muslim American reporting instances of harassment and assault this week.A San Diego State University says she was robbed and may have had her car stolen by two men who “made comments about President-elect Donald Trump and the Muslim community,” according to a statement from campus police. Officials are calling the attack a hate crime.Unknown iFrame situationAt New York University, Muslim students reportedly awoke to discover that the door to their prayer room had been defaced with the word “Trump!”Unknown iFrame situationAt San Jose State University, a campus-wide alert sent to students reported that a woman had her hijab forcibly removed by a “fair skinned male” with such force that it “caused the victim to lose her balance and choked her.”https://twitter.com/BookaliciousPam/status/796536937754529792A Muslim woman in Albuquerque, New Mexico claimed on Twitter that a Trump supporter tried to pull off her hijab at her university.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/disney-world-kidney-stones/	taking one or more rides on the big thunder mountain roller coaster at walt disney world can help dislodge kidney stones.	Unproven	['disney parks', ' disney world', ' kidney stones', ' roller coaster', ' walt disney']	http://www.mayoclinic.org/	http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-stones/symptoms-causes/syc-20355755	2017/10/06	CausesKidney stones often have no definite, single cause, although several factors may increase your risk.Kidney stones form when your urine contains more crystal-forming substances — such as calcium, oxalate and uric acid — than the fluid in your urine can dilute. At the same time, your urine may lack substances that prevent crystals from sticking together, creating an ideal environment for kidney stones to form.Types of kidney stonesKnowing the type of kidney stone helps determine the cause and may give clues on how to reduce your risk of getting more kidney stones. If possible, try to save your kidney stone if you pass one so that you can bring it to your doctor for analysis.Types of kidney stones include:Calcium stones. Most kidney stones are calcium stones, usually in the form of calcium oxalate. Oxalate is a naturally occurring substance found in food and is also made daily by your liver. Some fruits and vegetables, as well as nuts and chocolate, have high oxalate content.Dietary factors, high doses of vitamin D, intestinal bypass surgery and several metabolic disorders can increase the concentration of calcium or oxalate in urine.Calcium stones may also occur in the form of calcium phosphate. This type of stone is more common in metabolic conditions, such as renal tubular acidosis. It may also be associated with certain migraine headaches or with taking certain seizure medications, such as topiramate (Topamax).Struvite stones. Struvite stones form in response to an infection, such as a urinary tract infection. These stones can grow quickly and become quite large, sometimes with few symptoms or little warning.Uric acid stones. Uric acid stones can form in people who don't drink enough fluids or who lose too much fluid, those who eat a high-protein diet, and those who have gout. Certain genetic factors also may increase your risk of uric acid stones.Cystine stones. These stones form in people with a hereditary disorder that causes the kidneys to excrete too much of certain amino acids (cystinuria).Risk factorsFactors that increase your risk of developing kidney stones include:Family or personal history. If someone in your family has kidney stones, you're more likely to develop stones, too. And if you've already had one or more kidney stones, you're at increased risk of developing another.Dehydration. Not drinking enough water each day can increase your risk of kidney stones. People who live in warm climates and those who sweat a lot may be at higher risk than others.Certain diets. Eating a diet that's high in protein, sodium (salt) and sugar may increase your risk of some types of kidney stones. This is especially true with a high-sodium diet. Too much salt in your diet increases the amount of calcium your kidneys must filter and significantly increases your risk of kidney stones.Being obese. High body mass index (BMI), large waist size and weight gain have been linked to an increased risk of kidney stones.Digestive diseases and surgery. Gastric bypass surgery, inflammatory bowel disease or chronic diarrhea can cause changes in the digestive process that affect your absorption of calcium and water, increasing the levels of stone-forming substances in your urine.Other medical conditions. Diseases and conditions that may increase your risk of kidney stones include renal tubular acidosis, cystinuria, hyperparathyroidism, certain medications and some urinary tract infections.		0
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/raw-water-provide-probiotic-health-benefits/	"drinking untreated spring water, marketed as ""raw water,"" provides health benefits because they are ""probiotic."""	False	['alternative health', ' bottled water', ' health fad', ' live water', ' mukhande singh', ' natural water', ' probiotic', ' raw water', ' silicon valley', ' spring water', ' water']	https://www.nytimes.com/	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/dining/raw-water-unfiltered.html?_r=1	2018/01/11	Opt out or contact us anytimeThe founder of Live Water, Mukhande Singh, started selling spring water from Opal Springs in Culver, Ore., three years ago, but it was a small local operation until this year. Marketing materials show Mr. Singh (né Christopher Sanborn) sitting naked and cross-legged on a hot spring, his long brown hair flowing over his chest.Continue reading the main storyPhotoMukhande Singh, the founder of Live Water, at Ukumehame Beach Park, near Lahaina, Hawaii, where he lives. Credit Marco Garcia for The New York TimesPure water can be obtained by using a reverse osmosis filter, the gold standard of home water treatment, but for Mr. Singh, the goal is not pristine water, per se. “You’re going to get 99 percent of the bad stuff out,” he said. “But now you have dead water.”He said “real water” should expire after a few months. His does. “It stays most fresh within one lunar cycle of delivery,” he said. “If it sits around too long, it’ll turn green. People don’t even realize that because all their water’s dead, so they never see it turn green.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyMr. Singh believes that public water has been poisoned. “Tap water? You’re drinking toilet water with birth control drugs in them,” he said. “Chloramine, and on top of that they’re putting in fluoride. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but it’s a mind-control drug that has no benefit to our dental health.” (There is no scientific evidence that fluoride is a mind-control drug, but plenty to show that it aids dental health.)Talk like Mr. Singh’s disturbs Dr. Donald Hensrud, the director of the Healthy Living Program at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. What the raw-water partisans see as dangers, he says, are important safety measures.PhotoUntreated water, like this bottle with a “use by” date from Live Water, should be discarded after a few months, Mr. Singh said: “If it sits around too long, it’ll turn green.” Credit Leah Nash for The New York Times“Without water treatment, there’s acute and then chronic risks,” Dr. Hensrud said, including E. coli bacteria, viruses, parasites and carcinogenic compounds that can be present in untreated water. “There’s evidence all over the world of this, and the reason we don’t have those conditions is because of our very efficient water treatment.”Dr. Hensrud said he has noticed more interest in alternative water sources; a patient recently asked questions about a raw water he had been drinking. “There are people, just like with immunizations, that don’t accept the status quo,” Dr. Hensrud said.The rules for selling bottled water are imposed by states and the Food and Drug Administration, which does not specify how water be treated but sets acceptable amounts of chemicals and bacteria at a low level. State and federal inspectors make unannounced visits to bottling plants to test for harmful contaminants.Seth Pruzansky, the chief executive of Tourmaline Spring (whose website touts its “sacred living” water), got an exemption from the State of Maine in 2009 to sell his water untreated. “The natural food industry has been in the dark ages when it comes to water,” he said. “Now there is a renaissance.”The movement against tap water, like the movement against vaccines, has brought together unlikely allies from the far left and the far right. Conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones, founder of the right-wing website Infowars , have long argued that fluoride was added to water to make people more docile. Similar claims can be heard in the largely liberal enclaves where Live Water is seeing interest spike.“Fluoride? It’s a deathly toxic chemical,” said Vanessa Kuemmerle of Emeryville, Calif., who does landscape design for large tech companies. She said she was an early adopter of raw water, and has noticed many of her clients following suit.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“They’re health-conscious people that understand the bigger picture of what’s going on,” she said. “Everyone’s looking for an edge: nootropics , Bulletproof c offee , better water.”The health benefits she reported include better skin and the need to drink less water. “My skin’s plumper,” she said. “And I feel like I’m getting better nutrition from the food I eat.”PhotoAt Opal Springs Water Company in Oregon, raw water is prepared for shipping to the company Live Water. Credit Leah Nash for The New York TimesIn the community of tap-water skeptics, many talk about water the way others might about fine wine.“My friends who drink spring water, when they come over now they’re like, ‘Oh yeah, give me the good stuff,’” said Amanda Thompson, a writer in San Francisco. “The consciousness around water is changing.”Not everyone has been receptive. Many San Franciscans are proud of their tap water, which comes from Hetch Hetchy, a reservoir in Yosemite National Park.“My landlord lives across the street and thinks I’m crazy,” Ms. Thompson said. “He gave me a big rant around Hetch Hetchy water and how the water’s so good. I always hope he’s not around when there’s a delivery.”Raw water is such a nascent business that there’s debate over what exactly to call the liquid. Daniel Vitalis hosts a podcast, “Re Wild Yourself,” that promotes hunting for food and gathering water; he started the site called FindASpring.com to help people locate springs. He prefers the term “unprocessed water,” which echoes the idea of processed versus unprocessed food.“I don’t like ‘raw water’ because it sort of makes people think of raw sewage,” Mr. Vitalis said. “When you say ‘live water,’ that’s going to trigger a lot of people who are into physics and biology.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/home-depot-cofounder-endorses-donald-trump/	home depot founder and ceo bernie marcus has endorsed donald trump for president.	Mixture	['bernie marcus', ' donald trump', ' home depot']	http://www.realclearpolitics.com/	http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2016/06/01/why_i_stand_with_donald_trump_130727.html	2016/06/06	Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...As a backer of former Republican presidential candidates, I now stand in support of Donald J. Trump because the fate of this nation depends upon sending him, and not Hillary Clinton, to the White House.I know Donald Trump, but we’re not close friends. However, I believe he will begin on Day One undoing the damage done by President Barack Obama. I stand ready to help him at every turn.Like many, I am deeply concerned about the US Supreme Court. When Trump recently released his list of potential appointees, I grew confident in his resolve to keep our court balanced. Even more important: Clinton will push the court leftward for generations. She must be stopped.But I draw even more from lessons learned when we founded The Home Depot in 1978 rather than from the contentious GOP primary of 2016. I genuinely believe that if we to started The Home Depot today, we would fail because of the hurdles government, especially the current administration, places in front of small business owners. I never forget The Home Depot’s small business roots – we started as a small business with four stores in Atlanta, Georgia. I think of the banker who nearly lost his job by taking a risk and giving us a line of credit when we started. He didn’t just look at our balance sheet; he believed in our character and determination. Government regulators don’t allow this under Dodd-Frank – a law Hillary Clinton wants to make far worse.And going public under Sarbanes-Oxley, a Clinton favorite? Not the company we built, nor thousands of other businesses like ours the nation will never know because they died at birth, strangled by faceless bureaucrats and politicians who erroneously believe that government “can do it better.” Yet the risks we took in the 1970s have resulted in millions of jobs – not just at The Home Depot, but at our suppliers, our vendors, and even our customers’ businesses. Investors believed in us, and the government did not stop us.We could not do this today, for the same reason why so many Americans have dropped out of the workforce, why their wages have been stagnant, why their health care is a mess, and why our economy has stalled. It’s Obama/Clinton-style government that’s getting in the way.I have never seen our government as hostile to free enterprise, especially small business, as it is today. It is driving over-regulation, over-taxation, over-litigation, and over-spending. These “overs” are killing small businesses, which create the majority of new jobs in America.Politicians like Obama and Clinton, aided by the media and academia, have peddled a dangerous sentiment that government can provide for Americans better than the private sector. That’s not just false, it’s likely the nexus of Trump’s massively popular slogan, “Make America Great Again.” We saw it first hand.The vast majority of early Home Depot associates did not have a college education. But they worked hard and were paid with salaries and stock options. Those options made many people wealthy, and fueled our robust growth.One young man started with us at 17 years of age, bringing carts in from the parking lot. Ultimately, he became a regional president. Imagine Americans vilifying this young man, who became a millionaire and earned every penny of it.What makes America great? Risk, preparation, hard work, and a young man’s willingness to shag carts from a parking lot because he has faith that he and his family can be great.Donald Trump is right: To inspire more of these men and women, we must make America great again. Record-breaking numbers of Republican primary voters agree. They overwhelmingly want Donald Trump to lead this sea change, and we believe he can. But he needs to stand on our shoulders; he cannot do it alone.One of the greatest lessons we took away from The Home Depot is to always listen to your customers. Without their input, we surely would have failed. Republican leaders must listen to their customers, too – their voters – and they have spoken clearly.As Americans, the choice is abundantly clear: If you want four more years of President Obama, vote for Hillary Clinton; if you want to take the country in a new direction, vote for Donald Trump.Make no mistake, Republicans who refuse to stand behind their party’s nominee are electing Clinton, whether they cast their ballots for her or not. I have a message for the #NeverTrump crowd: Enough already. Donald Trump is our presumptive nominee and it is time to get over wishing it were not so. If you don’t, change your social media hashtag to #HillaryGOP.As a GOP donor who stood steadfastly behind Jeb Bush – and who has contributed to candidates for a generation – I urge all Republicans to stand up and be counted in support for Donald Trump.Bernie Marcus is co-founder of The Home Depot and chairman of The Marcus Foundation.		1

True	['immigrants', ' theodore roosevelt']	https://history.state.gov/	https://history.state.gov/milestones/1899-1913/portsmouth-treaty	2010/02/14	Milestones: 1899–1913NOTE TO READERS“Milestones in the History of U.S. Foreign Relations” has been retired and is no longer maintained. For more information, please see the full notice .The Treaty of Portsmouth and the Russo-Japanese War, 1904–1905The Treaty of Portsmouth formally ended the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05. The negotiations took place in August in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and were brokered in part by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt. The final agreement was signed in September of 1905, and it affirmed the Japanese presence in south Manchuria and Korea and ceded the southern half of the island of Sakhalin to Japan.Photograph from the Russo-Japanese WarBy 1904, Russia and Japan had endured several years of disputes over control of Manchuria. The Russians had entered the region during the Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95 and, along with Germany and France, was a part of the “Triple Intervention” that forced Japan to give up its demands for ports in South Manchuria and the Liaodong Peninsula in the wake of its victory in China. Instead, Russia moved into the area and took control of Port Arthur, a warm water port with strategic and commercial significance. A Japanese attempt to stage a coup in adjacent Korea was thwarted in part by the Russian presence in the region, and the two nations’ divergent interests appeared more and more likely to clash.In 1904, the Japanese attacked the Russian fleet at Port Arthur before the formal declaration of war was received in Moscow, surprising the Russian navy and earning an early victory. Over the course of the next year, the two forces clashed in Korea and the Sea of Japan, with the Japanese scoring significant, but costly, victories. War casualties were high on both sides. At the battle over Mukden, the Russians lost 60,000 soldiers and the Japanese lost 41,000 soldiers. The military costs were high as well. A Russian fleet made the long trip from the Baltic Sea around Africa and India, only to be half destroyed by the Japanese upon its arrival in Northeast Asia. By 1905, the combination of these losses and the economic cost of financing the war led both countries to seek an end to the war.Photograph of Attack on Port ArthurThe Japanese asked U.S. President Roosevelt to negotiate a peace agreement, and representatives of the two nations met in Portsmouth, New Hampshire in 1905. For the sake of maintaining the balance of power and equal economic opportunity in the region, Roosevelt preferred that the war end on terms that left both Russia and Japan a role to play in Northeast China. Though excited by the Japanese military victories, Roosevelt worried about the consequences to American interests if Japan managed to drive Russia out entirely.The negotiations centered on access to ports and territories in Manchuria and Korea, control of Sakhalin Island, and the question of who was responsible for paying war costs. The chief aims of the Japanese negotiator included first control in Korea and South Manchuria, then the negotiation of an indemnity and control of Sakhalin Island. The Russians wanted to maintain Sakhalin Island, refused to pay a war costs indemnity to the Japanese, and hoped to maintain their fleet in the Pacific. The indemnity issue, along with the dispensation of Sakhalin Island, were the major sticking points in the negotiation, although given its financial straits in 1905, Russia was likely unable to pay an indemnity even if required by a treaty to do so.When negotiations reached an impasse, Roosevelt stepped in with the proposal that Russia “buy back” the northern part of Sakhalin from Japanese control. The Russians were adamant that they would not pay any amount of money, which would act as a disguised indemnity, when the territory ought to be theirs. After long internal debate, Japan eventually agreed to take only the southern half of the island, without any kind of payment. Theirs had not been a decisive enough victory to force the point.The Treaty ultimately gave Japan control of Korea and much of South Manchuria, including Port Arthur and the railway that connected it with the rest of the region, along with the southern half of Sakhalin Island; Russian power was curtailed in the region, but it was not required to pay Japan’s war costs. Because neither nation was in a strong financial position to continue the war easily, both were forced to compromise in the terms of the peace. Still, the Japanese public felt they had won the war, and they considered the lack of an indemnity to be an affront. There was a brief outbreak of protests and rioting in Tokyo when the terms of the agreement were made public. Similarly, the Russian people were also dissatisfied, angry about giving up half of Sakhalin.Individuals gathered to work out what became the Treaty of PortsmouthThroughout the war and the peace talks, American public opinion largely sided with Japan. Believing that the Japanese were fighting a “just war” against Russian aggression, and that the island nation was equally committed to the Open Door and the territorial integrity of China, the American people were anxious to support it. This sense did not really change over the course of the negotiations, in spite of the best efforts of the Russian negotiator to improve the press coverage of his nation’s position. The final decision of the Japanese to forgo an indemnity only served to strengthen U.S. approval of Japan’s actions throughout the conflict. The anti-treaty and, at times, anti-American demonstrations in Tokyo that followed the ratification of the treaty caught many Americans off-guard.The Treaty of Portsmouth marked the last real event in an era of U.S.-Japanese cooperation that began with the Meiji Restoration in 1868. Instead, competition between the two nations in the Pacific grew over the years that followed. Conversely, Japanese relations with Russia improved in the wake of the treaty. Although the actual importance of Roosevelt’s mediation and personal pressure on the leadership in Moscow and Tokyo to the final agreement is unclear, he won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in moderating the talks and pushing toward peace.Table of Contents		0
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/isis-fort-mcmurray-fire/	isis claimed responsibility for the may 2016 fort mcmurray wildfire. see example( s )	Unproven	['conservative fans', ' fort mcmurray', ' isis', ' wildfire']	http://www.nytimes.com/	http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/09/world/americas/fort-mcmurray-fire-canada-oil-boom.html	2016/05/09	Fort McMurray, a Canadian Oil Boom Town, Is Left in AshesVideoAfter losing everything in wildfires that have consumed parts of Alberta, Canada, many evacuees are saddened by what they have lost, but thankful for their survival.Published OnMay 9, 2016By Dan Levin and Ian AustenMay 8, 2016LAC LA BICHE, Alberta — Fort McMurray, or Fort Make Money, as some Canadians nicknamed it during its recent boom years, was the kind of place where second chances and fat paychecks beckoned.Those who settled there were trained engineers, refugees from war-torn countries and strivers from across Canada and beyond, drawn to a dot on the map in northern Alberta, a city carved out of boreal forest in a region gushing with oil riches.Even after the price of crude began to collapse in late 2014, erasing thousands of jobs, many residents managed to hang on, tightening their belts while waiting for the good times to return.Then, early last week, smoke and ash filled the sky, the first harbingers of a catastrophic wildfire sweeping toward the city. The entire population of about 88,000 was forced to evacuate, most in a frantic rush.ImageA checkpoint about 15 miles south of fire-ravaged Fort McMurray, Alberta, monitoring traffic headed north on Sunday.CreditTyler Hicks/The New York TimesSince then, the blaze has consumed whole swaths of Fort McMurray, ranking it as one of the most devastating fires in Canada’s history. The fast-moving flames turned many of the city’s homes — and the baby photos and wedding albums and other treasures that could not be packed in time — into little more than charcoal.But even as displaced residents file insurance claims and pick through piles of donated clothing, many are adamant about rebuilding the city that gave them a financial lifeline as rare as the source of its prosperity, the largest oil sands reserve in the world.Fort McMurray “is the only place you can go, sink 10 years of your life and bank enough money to retire,” said Kevin Lewis, 55, the owner of a transportation company. He fled to an evacuation center here in Lac La Biche, 137 miles south, in his pickup with only his wallet and the clothes on his back.For the moment, lower temperatures have allowed firefighters to gain some control over the blaze , which has turned away from the city. But it is still raging in a nearby forest, and the danger of its returning to the city remains.Until environmentalists challenged the Keystone XL oil pipeline this decade, the city and the Alberta oil sands reserve were little known outside of Canada and the world’s oil companies. But attempts to convert its deposits of tarlike bitumen into fuel go back decades, and Fort McMurray’s fortunes have risen and fallen with them.Its first modern boom was in the 1970s, when the government decided to place its bets on the costly-to-produce oil sands and billions of dollars flowed into the area. That ended with a thud as oil prices sank in the 1980s, and the sands suddenly seemed like a dying curiosity.The latest, and much bigger, boom was unleashed in the last 15 years as oil prices soared, along with China’s demand for crude, and as technology to extract oil from the sands improved.Fort McMurray, which got its start as a fur trading post in the 1800s, was never as pretty as the forest that surround it; the downtown, which has escaped the wildfire so far, is an architectural time capsule of the 1970s, filled with low-rise buildings thrown up in a hurry. And even at its best, the city has a kind-of “town and gown” feel, with most of the jobs with big oil companies becoming what locals called “fly in, fly out.”Those employees came from across Canada and were immediately bused by their employers to camps closer to the remote oil sands projects, where they worked two-week shifts before returning home.Still, with so many jobs in welding and construction and transportation, the population ballooned to more than 90,000 at its peak from 38,000 in 2000. Land that cost 27,000 Canadian dollars an acre at the turn of the millennium had reached 1 million Canadian dollars (about $775,000), while new housing developments ate ever deeper into the surrounding woods of black spruce.ImageThe blaze in Fort McMurray has destroyed hundreds of homes and vehicles.CreditTyler Hicks/The New York Times“Doctors and lawyers don’t make the money we make,” said Chad Abbott, 50, a scaffolding company supervisor.Mr. Abbott moved to Fort McMurray in 1998 with his family and worked at an oil sands plant site, earning about 250,000 Canadian dollars a year. He was part of a tightknit community in the city composed largely of oil services employees, trades workers and engineers, many of whom have lost all they own.Initially during the most recent boom, Fort McMurray had welcomed keeping much of the fast-growing work force in the remote work camps. But those workers’ lack of connection to Fort McMurray — as well as the lack of their dollars being spent there — eventually stirred resentment.“In the early days, they didn’t want the camp workers in town because they would bring with them all you would imagine in the Wild West: come into town, shoot up the town and head back out,” said Stephen Ross, the president of Devonian Properties, which began buying local land in 2000.The city could not hold all of the seediness at bay; for a time a raft of strip clubs did good business. But over the years, Fort McMurray smoothed its rougher edges. Its neighborhoods filled with a melange of accents and nationalities, from Newfoundlanders to Filipinos employed at hotels and gas stations and heavy-equipment movers from Fiji.ImageDorian McCready, who was dropping off supplies to a command post, searched for a friend’s home in an evacuated neighborhood of Fort McMurray on Saturday to try to rescue some sentimental items for the friend.CreditIan Willms for The New York TimesBefore the fire, the number of strip clubs had dwindled to just one, Showgirls, near the end of the town’s main drag, Franklin Avenue. Several blocks away, the green-domed Markaz ul Islam mosque had become too small for Friday prayers, forcing the overflow crowds to use the gymnasium of a nearby Catholic school.Samya Hassan, 51, a hijab-wearing refugee from Yemen, came to Canada in 1990 and settled in Fort McMurray four years ago with her family. They prospered. Her husband got a job as a truck driver, she as a cashier — enough to put their three children through school.That all ended Tuesday when she and her family fled. Fire roared next to the highway as they crept along in bumper-to-bumper traffic; she used her headscarf to breathe through the heavy black smoke that blotted out the sun.Ms. Hassan was able to grab her passport, but no family photos. “I’ll have to start life over again like 25 years ago,” she said.For countless displaced residents, it is the lost things money cannot replace that will haunt them. Ariana Caissie, 22, took her two cats, but said her late father’s recipe cards were lost when her mother had no time to save them. “They’re just memories now,” she said.ImageA convoy of evacuees headed south from Fort McMurray on Saturday.CreditIan Willms for The New York TimesResidents, including local politicians, are committed to rebuilding, but questions remain about what Fort McMurray will be. “Depending on what we’re able to dream up — and actually do and deliver — it’s a whole new world,” Melissa Blake, the mayor, said in an interview.Adam Rairdon, a former chef, has invested too much in Fort McMurray to walk away. After spending about $20,000 to study industrial radiography, he left Halifax, Nova Scotia, with his wife, Laura, four years ago and found a job in the boom town. About a month before oil prices started to decline, they bought a house and began renovations.Mr. Rairdon, who took leave from his job to rebuild the house, recalls listening to news of oil prices tumbling on the radio as he tore down walls. Around the same time, Ms. Rairdon became pregnant.By January 2015, his employer started cutting back. Unlike some co-workers, Mr. Rairdon kept his job but lost about a quarter of his pay, he said outside the hall on a fairground in Edmonton, now a temporary home for him, his wife and their 10-month-old baby.Mr. Rairdon has seen video confirming that their home is largely destroyed. Soon, he will drive his wife and child to his in-laws’ home in New Brunswick. After that, Mr. Rairdon said, he will buy a secondhand trailer and return to Fort McMurray to help rebuild.“As soon as they open the gates, I’m going with a shovel and work boots and we’re going to clean up our town,” he said. “There are many that probably can’t, many that can’t afford to and many who are just so brokenhearted that they probably won’t. I can only speak for myself when I say I’m not done.”A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A4 of the New York edition with the headline: A Canadian Boom Town, Left Smoldering in Ashes.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/school-shooting-military-deaths/	so far in 2018, the number of u.s. students killed in school shootings is greater than the number of u.s. military personnel who have been killed on active duty.	Mixture	['school shootings']	https://www.washingtonpost.com/	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/05/18/2018-has-been-deadlier-for-schoolchildren-than-service-members/	2018/05/22	This article has been corrected. The school shooting near Houston on Friday bolstered a stunning statistic: More people have been killed at schools this year than have been killed while deployed as members of the military. Data for military casualties are difficult to ascertain. An original version of this article tallied solely reports of casualties released by the Department of Defense, which indicated that 13 members of the military had been killed while deployed, compared to 27 schoolchildren who’d died in five shooting incidents this year involving fatalities. Put another way: Twice as many students have been killed in school shootings as have members of the military who were on deployment. An additional four adults were killed in school shootings in 2018 — but an additional 29 members of the military have died in training accidents. After our original article ran, Jared Keller, a senior editor at the site Task & Purpose, noted that the Department of Defense releases offered an incomplete picture of service member fatalities. Separate data compiled by the Navy, including the Marines, adds additional casualties to the total. In May, an Air National Guard plane crashed in Georgia killing another nine — an incident not included in the Department of Defense’s reports. “The DoD doesn’t always present a clear picture of accidental mishap-related deaths due to worries about operational security, hence the trouble with [Public Affairs Office] releases,” Keller wrote in an email. On Monday, researcher Zachary Austin sent a more complete set of data about military casualties. Having realized that the Defense Department numbers were incomplete, he began tracking military fatalities separately, tallying 42 this year — including casualties in combat, while deployed and during training exercises. That Air National Guard crash, for example, was during a training exercise. Comparing all fatalities in school shootings with all military deaths, the latter is higher, contrary to the original headline of this article. In both cases, those totals have been boosted by mass casualty events. In the case of the military, 20 of the fatalities occurred in just three aircraft crashes. In the case of schoolchildren, most of the deaths were in Santa Fe, Tex., last week and the mass shooting in Parkland, Fla. in February. Austin explained in an email why he started tracking this data. “Last year I helped with research that showed more American troops had died from peacetime causes than wartime incidents since 2014,” he wrote. “There’s no centralized public database like the DCAS (Defense Casualty Analysis System) for training fatalities, and it was often maddening to track down accurate historical data. So I decided that in 2018, I would follow along day-by-day and identify every American service member killed in uniform throughout the year. What the Defense Department reports is those casualties that don’t occur during training incidents. Being a member of the military is still far more dangerous than being a student, of course. There are more than 50 million students in public elementary and high schools and only about 1.3 million members of the armed forces. So far in 2018, a member of the military, deployed or in training, has been more than 50 times as likely to be killed as someone is to die in a school shooting. That said, 2018 is abnormal. Comparing shootings tallied by The Post with Defense-Department-reported casualties in 2017 — that is to say, non-training deaths — at no point were the number of military fatalities higher than the number of people killed in school shootings. 2018 has been more deadly than 2017 for both groups. In fact, 2018 is shaping up to be unusually deadly at schools. Comparing the number of deaths and the number of shooting incidents this year directly with those through May 18 of 2017, that difference is stark. The number of deaths and school shooting incidents through May 18 are each higher this year than at any point since 2000. There have been three times as many deaths in school shootings so far this year than in the second-most deadly year through May 18, 2005. In fact, there were 36 fatalities in school shootings in total through May 18 of each year from 2000 to 2017 — only slightly more than there have been in 2018 alone. Without the shootings in Florida and Texas, the figure is substantially lower. In 2000 through 2017, there were an average of two deaths in five or six school shootings through this point in each year. Without Marjory Stoneman Douglas and Santa Fe, the totals in 2018 would be four deaths in 14 shooting incidents. With them, it is 31 deaths in 16 incidents.		1

We’ve all been taught that water freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit, 0 degrees Celsius, 273.15 Kelvin. That’s not always the case, though. Scientists have found liquid water as cold as -40 degrees F in clouds and even cooled water down to -42 degrees F in the lab. How low could they go?That turns out to be a tricky problem to answer. When liquid water is cooled below -42 degrees F, it crystallizes into ice too quickly for scientists to measure the temperature of the liquid. So Emily Moore and Valeria Molinero of the University of Utah developed a sophisticated computer simulation of 32,768 water molecules (fewer molecules than can be found in a raindrop) that let them see what happened to the water’s heat capacity, density and compressibility as it supercooled and determine what happened as 4,000 of those molecules froze. Their results appear in the journal Nature .As the temperature of the water approaches -55 degrees F, the water molecules form tetrahedrons, with each molecule loosely bonding to four other molecules. The density of the water decreases, its heat capacity increases and its compressibility increases. “The change in structure of water controls the rate at which ice forms,” Molinero says . “We show both the thermodynamics of water and the crystallization rate are controlled by the change in structure of liquid water that approaches the structure of ice.” Below -55 degrees F, tiny bits of liquid water may still exist, but it would do so only for an incredibly short time, Molinero says.This supercooling of water is possible because water needs a small nucleus or seed of ice for the molecules to form crystals and in very pure water “the only way you can form a nucleus is by spontaneously changing the structure of the liquid,” Molinero says. Those nuclei won’t form or grow large enough until the structure of the liquid water molecules approaches that of solid ice, which doesn’t happen until the water gets so incredibly cold.		0

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/letter-from-an-airline-pilot/	letter from airline pilot describes a flight on which the remains of a fallen u.s. soldier were carried.	True	['airplanes', ' pilots', ' veterans']	http://acaptainslog.blogspot.com/	http://acaptainslog.blogspot.com/2008/07/fallen-soldier_04.html	2016/06/28	Friday, July 04, 2008Fallen SoldierAnother 4th of July is here and all across the nation, millions of us will celebrate in thousands of different ways. Our military members around the world will miss out on hometown celebrations, instead, performing the duties assigned to them. This story is in honor of them. As a commercial pilot, I too see the effects of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Last month I showed up to start a trip and was approached by a gate agent. “Captain, good morning, I wanted to inform you that we have H.R. on this flight”, she said. H.R. stands for human remains. “Are they military?”, I asked. “Yes”, she said. “Is there and escort?”, I asked. “Yes, I already assigned him a seat”, she said. “Would you please tell him to come to the flight deck, you can board him early”, I said. A short while later, a young army sergeant entered the flight deck. He was the image of the perfectly dressed soldier. He introduced himself and I asked him about his soldier. The escorts of these fallen soldiers talk about them as if they are still alive and with us. “My soldier is on his way back to Virginia”, he said. He proceeded to answer my questions, but offered no words on his own. I asked him if there was anything I could do for him and he said no. I told him that he has the toughest job in the military and that I appreciated the work that he does for the families of our fallen soldiers. The first officer and I got up out of our seats to shake his hand. He left the flight deck to find his seat. We completed our preflight checks, pushed back and performed an uneventful departure. About 30 minutes into our flight I received a call from the lead flight attendant in the cabin. “I just found out the family of the soldier we are carrying, is onboard”, he said. He then proceeded to tell me that the father, mother, wife and 2-year-old daughter were escorting their son, husband, and father home. The family was upset because they were unable to see the container that the soldier was in before we left. We were on our way to a major hub at which the family was going to wait 4 hours for the connecting flight home to Virginia. The father of the soldier told the flight attendant that knowing his son was below him in the cargo compartment and being unable to see him was too much for him and the family to bare. He had asked the flight attendant if there was anything that could be done to allow them to see him upon our arrival. The family wanted to be outside by the cargo door to watch the soldier being taken off the airplane. I could hear the desperation in the flight attendants voice when he asked me if there was anything I could do. “I’m on it”, I said. I told him that I would get back to him. Airborne communication with my company normally occurs in the form of email like messages. I decided to bypass this system and contact my flight dispatcher directly on a secondary radio. There is a radio operator in the operations control center who connects you to the telephone of the dispatcher. I was in direct contact with the dispatcher. I explained the situation I had onboard with the family and what it was the family wanted. He said he understood and that he would get back to me. Two hours went by and I had not heard from the dispatcher. We were going to get busy soon and I needed to know what to tell the family. I sent a text message asking for an update. I saved the return message from the dispatcher and this following is the text.“Captain, sorry it has taken so long to get back to you. There is policy on this now and I had to check on a few things. Upon your arrival a dedicated escort team will meet the aircraft. The team will escort the family to the ramp and planeside. A van will be used to load the remains with a secondary van for the family. The family will be taken to their departure area and escorted into the terminal where the remains can be seen on the ramp. It is a private area for the family only. When the connecting aircraft arrives, the family will be escorted onto the ramp and planeside to watch the remains being loaded for the final leg home. Captain, most of us here in flight control are veterans. Please pass our condolences on to the family, thanks.” I sent a message back telling flight control thanks for a good job. I printed out the message and gave it to the lead flight attendant to pass on to the father. The lead flight attendant was very thankful and told me, “You have no idea how much this will mean to them.” Things started getting busy for the descent, approach and landing. After landing, we cleared the runway and taxied to the ramp area. The ramp is huge with 15 gates on either side of the alleyway. It is always a busy area with aircraft maneuvering every which way to enter and exit. When we entered the ramp and checked in with the ramp controller, we were told that all traffic was being held for us. “There is a team in place to meet the aircraft”, we were told. It looked like it was all coming together, then I realized that once we turned the seat belt sign off, everyone would stand up at once and delay the family from getting off the airplane. As we approached our gate, I asked the copilot to tell the ramp controller we were going to stop short of the gate to make an announcement to the passengers. He did that and the ramp controller said, “Take your time.” I stopped the aircraft and set the parking brake. I pushed the public address button and said, “Ladies and gentleman, this is your captain speaking. I have stopped short of our gate to make a special announcement. We have a passenger on board who deserves our honor and respect. His name is private XXXXXX, a soldier who recently lost his life. Private XXXXXX is under your feet in the cargo hold. Escorting him today is army sergeant XXXXXXX. Also onboard are his father, mother, wife, and daughter. Your entire flight crew is asking for all passengers to remain in their seats to allow the family to exit the aircraft first. Thank you.” We continued the turn to the gate, came to a stop and started our shutdown procedures. A couple of minutes later I opened the cockpit door. I found the two forward flight attendants crying, something you just do not see. I was told that after we came to a stop, every passenger on the aircraft stayed in their seats, waiting for the family to exit the aircraft. When the family got up and gathered their things, a passenger slowly started to clap their hands. Moments later more passengers joined in and soon the entire aircraft was clapping. Words of “God Bless You, I’m sorry, Thank you, Be proud, and other kind words were uttered to the family as they made their way down the aisle and out of the airplane. They were escorted down to the ramp to finally be with the loved one lost. I never did see the family. Another soldier died, another family grieved and we did what we could. That is the way it works sometimes. I get a call from the cabin and we work as a team to do what we can. That day everybody from the flight crew, to the operations center, to the 184 passengers onboard, we did what we could. Many of the passengers disembarking thanked me for the announcement I made. They were just words, I could say them over and over again, but nothing I say will bring that soldier back. I respectfully ask that all of you reflect on this day and the sacrifices that millions of men and women have made to ensure our freedom, safety, and the right to live a good life. 		1
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bitter-almond-tree-banned/	the bitter almond tree was banned in america in 1995 because it treats and prevents cancer. see example( s )	False	['bitter almond', ' bitter almond tree', ' cancer', ' cancer conspiracy', ' fake bans', ' fda', ' home cures', ' laetrile']	http://articles.latimes.com/	http://articles.latimes.com/2002/feb/20/food/fo-almond20	2016/06/30	"YOU ARE HERE: LAT Home → CollectionsThe Case of the Tasty But Poisonous NutFebruary 20, 2002 |DAVID KARP | SPECIAL TO THE TIMESTo meet Paul Schrade, a tall, white-haired 77-year-old with a gently bemused smile, you'd never suspect that he's obsessed with a poisonous nut. Mention the bitter almond, however, and the retired union organizer won't stop talking about how--on a culinary tour of Sicily in 1990--he fell in love with its powerful, unique flavor, which gives marzipan and almond milk their characteristic taste. Even after he was told that raw bitter almonds contained a form of cyanide and were illegal in the Unites States, Schrade was fascinated.""I thought, 'European chefs make good use of bitter almonds for cooking and baking--why shouldn't we?'"" he says.Through his second career as a bakery consultant and forager for Campanile restaurant, Schrade sought to spur a revival of the ancient Mediterranean flavoring in California. Undeterred, or perhaps intrigued, by the nut's sinister reputation--spread by mystery tales in which the detective sniffed the odor of bitter almonds on a cyanide victim's breath--he sleuthed relentlessly for sources and information.He learned that most of the original wild species of almonds were bitter, but that, as the nuts came into cultivation thousands of years ago, farmers began concentrating their crops toward sweet types, the kind grown today in California.A recessive gene causes bitter almond trees to produce in their shoots, leaves and kernels a toxic compound called amygdalin, which serves as a chemical defense against being eaten. When amygdalin is moistened, it splits into edible benzaldehyde, which provides an intense almond aroma and flavor, and deadly hydrocyanic acid, a fast-acting inhibitor of the respiratory system.The lethal dose of raw bitter almonds depends on the size of the nuts, their concentration of amygdalin and the consumer's sensitivity. But scientists estimate that a 150-pound adult might die from eating between 10 and 70 raw nuts, and a child from ingesting just a few.In any case, although it may be safe for most adults to nibble a raw bitter almond to experience its intense flavor, that would be unpleasant to most people. The nuts are not meant to be eaten as a snack food like regular almonds: They're used as a spice, like nutmeg or cinnamon.Schrade, who studied organic chemistry at Yale, learned that because hydrocyanic acid vanishes into the air when heated, cooking destroys the poison in bitter almonds and allows them to lend their flavor to a wide range of dishes, both traditional and modern.In the course of his explorations, Schrade found several California chefs eager to cook with bitter almonds. At the center of this informal network is Tim Woods of Echo restaurant in Fresno, famed for his zealous use of local ingredients.Since bitter almonds are usually not available commercially, he harvests his nuts from nearby wild and backyard trees, and uses them to add a pleasing bite to the richness of bread pudding with caramel and to stone-fruit cobblers. He also shares his supplies with Sean Lippert, formerly chef of Across the Street in New York, for her bitter almond granita, and with Judy Rodgers of Zuni Cafe in Berkeley and Kim Boyce, pastry chef of Campanile, who both use the nuts to flavor panna cotta and ice cream.Until recent decades, most Mediterranean almond orchards were grown from seed, and the shuffling of genes resulted in a mix of bitter almond trees among the sweet. Growers liked to keep a few bitter trees around because they helped to pollinize the sweet varieties. The inclusion of bitter nuts gave snackers occasional unpleasant surprises, but they deepened the flavor of marzipan, almond milk and glazes for cakes. In Italy, bitter almond paste was traditionally used to make crisp amaretti cookies, and bitter almond extract flavored amaretto liqueur. In Greece, bitter almonds are used in soumada, a sweet syrup.There's little large-scale cultivation of bitter almonds left in Spain and Italy, mostly just scattered trees remain, but it is still possible to buy raw bitter almonds at European specialty markets. Morocco and Iran now lead in commercial production of bitter almonds.In the United States, the lack of clear information about bitter almonds' legal status has squelched their cultivation, trade and use. No stores regularly stock bitter almonds, so cooks seeking them have had to rely, like Woods, on seedling trees growing wild along streams, roads and railroad tracks.""I don't know if I should sell them or not,"" says Bill Fujimoto, owner of Monterey Market in Berkeley, which carries bitter almonds occasionally. ""I don't leave them out on the counter. I sell them only when people who know bitter almonds ask me for some."""		0

M.A.R. told police that Limon had performed one instance of oral sex on him. M.A.R. further told the police that Limon performed oral sex on him until he asked Limon to stop.Limon also had two previous convictions:Because of Limon's prior two adjudications for aggravated criminal sodomy, the trial court sentenced Limon to 206 months' imprisonment.9.22.2005 2:05pmEugene Volokh ( www ):Arbitrary Aardvark: The Ginsburg report's proposal related precisely to sex crimes on federal territories, the maritime jurisdiction, in Indian country, and the like. There was no federal criminal statute then or now that generally banned rape in state territory. The recommendation, if adopted, would have set the federal age of consent at 12 in many places where there was no state law that could step in to fill the gap -- it would have genuinely legalized sex between adults and 12-year-olds.9.22.2005 2:43pmalkali ( mail ) ( www ):The full text of that footnote reads:""While a teenager’s constitutional rights may be more limited than an adult’s in some circumstances, and while the state is more likely to have a compelling state interest that justifies intruding upon a teenager’s rights, it is well established that teenagers - like adults - have a due process liberty interest in being free from state compulsion in making these types of personal decisions. See, e.g., Carey v. Population Services Int’l, 431 U.S. 678, 684, 693 (1977) (plurality). Laws that burden a minor’s liberty interest must be narrowly tailored to advance a compelling governmental interest unless they advance a 'significant state interest that is not present in the case of an adult.' Id. (rejecting State’s interest in regulating morality of minors by discouraging promiscuous sexual intercourse as justification for prohibiting distribution of contraception to teenagers). That minors are protected by the fundamental liberty interest discussed in Lawrence and Casey does not undermine neutral age of consent laws, which advance the State’s compelling interest in protecting children from sexual abuse. But the existence of that right does require the State to satisfy heightened scrutiny to justify unequal age of consent laws.""That footnote unambiguously states that states can constitutionally enact ""neutral age of consent laws, which advance the State’s compelling interest in protecting children from sexual abuse.""

The homosexual community is remarkable in having a loud advocacy group for this position (NAMBLA), while heterosexual pedophiles haven't managed to get such a high visibility organization backing their goals. </i>What a ridiculous interpretation of history. NAMBLA are by in large reviled by the homosexual community and tried to get their foot in the door by riding the coat-tails of gay rights. Some gay groups in charge of the pride parades were dumb enough to let them march and we see the political hay that the antigay right has made of this.Every single mainstream gay rights organization, as far as I know, has cut their ties to NAMBLA and most never had any ties to begin with.And maybe there aren't any heterosexual advocacy groups for pedophiles because they don't need one. After all, heterosexual ephebophilia has been so normalized in this culture that adult males in the most socially conservative of times and places were allowed to marry girls as young as 12.9.22.2005 4:10pmClayton E. Cramer ( mail ) ( www ):alkali writes:Laws that burden a minor’s liberty interest must be narrowly tailored to advance a compelling governmental interest unless they advance a 'significant state interest that is not present in the case of an adult.'And what is the compelling state interest? There are plenty of people (at least here, although not in the real world) prepared to argue that age of consent laws are set too high--that 12 years old is enough to make these sort of decisions.Jonathan Rowe writes:Some gay groups in charge of the pride parades were dumb enough to let them march and we see the political hay that the antigay right has made of this.Were there any pride parades that rejected NAMBLA before they became a political liability? (If so, it would suggest that homosexual organizations were prepared to distance themselves from pedophiles for reasons of principle, not convenience.) More importantly, as Volokh has pointed out, complete repeal (not revision downward) of age of consent laws was part of the gay agenda in 1972. Many of the leaders of the gay liberation movement back in the late 1970s were explicit that pedophilia was a core part of what they were doing .Every single mainstream gay rights organization, as far as I know, has cut their ties to NAMBLA and most never had any ties to begin with.The International Lesbian & Gay Association cut ties with NAMBLA--but only because their UN observer status was threatened unless they did so--and even then, there was a big internal fight for ILGA about whether to expel NAMBLA and a European equivalent. Having voted to expel them, the ILGA then became moribund because its big financial backers were upset about NAMBLA being kicked out .I'm sure that most homosexuals are not looking forward to the day when they can hang around school yards with boxes of candy to entice little boys into their cars. Still, the ""radical homosexual"" groups support for NAMBLA; the emails that I still get from homosexuals drawing a distinction between ""pedophiles"" (those that want to have sex with prepubescent boys) and ""ephebophiles"" (those that want to have sex with boys who are 12, 13, 14); the ACLU's arguments in the Limon case: all of these tell me that there's a bit more of a problem than Rowe wants to admit.And maybe there aren't any heterosexual advocacy groups for pedophiles because they don't need one. After all, heterosexual ephebophilia has been so normalized in this culture that adult males in the most socially conservative of times and places were allowed to marry girls as young as 12.I'm not sure what culture he's talking about. Marriage age in Puritan New England was typically late teens for girls and 20-21 to boys. Some parts of the South have traditionally allowed much younger marriages--and I think the culture is moving away from that, recognizing that this wasn't wise. In the medieval period, marriages (especially royal marriages) were often held much younger, but these were often for political purposes--and such marriages were not sexualized until later.9.22.2005 4:53pmClayton E. Cramer ( mail ) ( www ):A question for alkali: Since the footnote in question is attached to a list of decisions in which the ACLU (through its wholly owned subsidiary, the U.S. Supreme Court) effectively abolished all regulation--why should we assume that the ACLU recognizes any ""compelling governmental interest"" in keeping minors from having sex with adults?9.22.2005 4:58pmLong Gone ( mail ):No, the issue is that a lot of adult men want to have sex with children. The homosexual community is remarkable in having a loud advocacy group for this position (NAMBLA),In which case you should whole-heartedly support Ginzburg. One aspect of the proposed law that is clearly commented on and commended by the report is that it would have created a male/male version of a federal statutory rape crime. The statute as it existed did not apply in such instances. And because the bill did not pass, the acts remained legal for several more years. So here's an interpretation question: those people who opposed or did not support the bill, which did not pass: did they support the legalization of sex between men and boys under 12 in federal jurisdiction? I submit it cannot be said whether they supported keeping such acts legal simply from having opposed the bill. In the same manner, I do not think it fair to say that Ginzburg supported lowering the age of consent to 12, simply because she recommended substituting the bills' language for other purposes. She may have supported such a move, but this is insufficient evidence thereof.Eugene: I agree with the main point of your last post, that there are jurisdictions for which the law would have legalized consentual sex with a girl aged 12-15. But I think Indian country was not included - age of consent in Indian country was covered in a different provision discussed in the report, and for which no age change was mentioned -- one reason to think perhaps no overarching agenda of change of age-consent was in the minds of the reports' authors.9.22.2005 5:00pmClayton E.

I remember at one point in the early 1980s that Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX, but he used to come to Libertarian Party conventions as an honored guest) received a pile of crap from the holier-than-thou crowd with the LP because he had voted against a bill that would have legalized homosexuality in the District of Columbia. What he told me in a letter was that there was enough other stuff in the bill--including making statutory rape a misdemeanor--that he couldn't vote for it--regardless of the provisions that he liked.If Ginsburg's goal was simply equality of the sexes, why not just make the existing laws apply to both sexes, instead of setting the age of consent at 12?9.22.2005 5:13pmrandal ( mail ):That's a weak defense Eugene. Why not just admit you were called out and defeated? Quoting something simply doesn't imply full endorsement. Sorry, no dice, and no amount of dissembling is going to get you there.I like this sentence for getting three nouns in a row: ""Eugene wants a sex change operation.""

There are plenty of people (at least here, although not in the real world) prepared to argue that age of consent laws are set too high--that 12 years old is enough to make these sort of decisions.The ""compelling state interest"" the ACLU attorney refers to is the interest in preventing adults from having sexual contact with children. The point the ACLU attorney was making is that it cannot be a compelling state interest to prevent 19-year-old men from having sexual contact with 14-year-old boys if the state thinks it's perfectly fine for 19-year-old men to have sexual contact with 14-year-old girls. You can disagree with that argument if you like, but clearly the ACLU attorney was not disputing whether preventing adult/child sexual contact could ever be a compelling state interest.Since the footnote in question is attached to a list of decisions in which the ACLU (through its wholly owned subsidiary, the U.S. Supreme Court) effectively abolished all regulation--why should we assume that the ACLU recognizes any ""compelling governmental interest"" in keeping minors from having sex with adults?I don't have any idea what the ACLU might hypothetically think.

Cramer ( mail ) ( www ):I don't have any idea what the ACLU might hypothetically think. The question was whether the ACLU actually argued in Limon that minors have a constitutional right to have sex with adults; clearly, the ACLU didn't argue that.They argued that a minor has a liberty interest in not being subject to governmental compulsion on whether to have sex or not. Yeah, there's a possibility that the government could come up with a rationale that would make the ACLU happy, but claiming a liberty interest is asserting a right of minors to have sex.You will also notice that it wasn't the minor who they were defending here--it was the adult who had sex with a minor. They were using the right of a minor to defend an adult from criminal charges. This is completely irrelevant to their claim of equal protection, because the minor wasn't the one being charged.9.22.2005 6:40pmrandal ( mail ):It's not a fair inference Eugene.The report explicitly stated the aspect of the quoted language that it was endorsing. As per the rule of construction I mentioned, it's not fair to infer that the endorsement extends to the whole content of the quoted language.Beyond the fact that a specific endorsement can't be implicitly upgraded to a general endorsement, I'd also argue that a general endorsement can't be narrowed to a specific endorsement of every subclause. I'm sure you've explicitly endorsed a number of pieces of legislation. Would it be fair for me to pull individual clauses out of those bills and say you endorse them? I bet I could find quite a few you'd repudiate.Finally, all THAT aside, the best you can achieve is a statement that the report is substantially ambiguous - it never delves into age issues. You think it's fair to turn that ambiguity into the factual statement, ""Ginsburg endorsed sex with twelve-year-olds?""You're arguing that it's fair to take someone's specific endorsement of an aspect of legislation, infer that it encompasses a holistic endorsement of the entire legislation, infer further that the implied holistic endorsement extends to every individual clause, and without seeking clarification from the source, go around announcing the alleged endorsement in a negative light. Oh my god that's ridiculous.9.22.2005 6:42pmClayton E. Cramer ( mail ) ( www ):The more I look at this, the more monstrous it gets.If the ACLU was defending a minor against a criminal charge, this would be at least plausibly related to the question in Limon--but in this case, they were defending an adult against a criminal charge.There might well be an equal protection argument based an adult's ""liberty interest"", but the ACLU was defending the adult--not the minor. The minor's ""liberty interest"" is completely irrelevant to the adult's actions here--especially because the minor apparently said, ""No."" Perhaps the ACLU's attorney didn't think this through very well--but this is effectively a defense of an adult's right to have sex with a minor that didn't want to have sex.9.22.2005 6:49pmThorley Winston ( mail ) ( www ):When someone puts their name on a report and the report contains recomendations, then it is fair game to ascribe those views to the signer.

Suppose the report focused on the perceived unfairness of harshly penalizing, say, a 17 year old for having sex with a 15 year old (rather than on any distinctions between gay and straight sex), and concluded that a law providing lesser penalties for sex between teens under the age-related circumstances set forth in the Kansas “Romeo and Juliet” law (the younger teen is between 14 and 16, the older less than 19, the age difference is less than 4 years) was the recommended approach. Suppose that the Roberts report then quoted and recommended Kansas’ Romeo and Juliet law -- including not only the above age-related criteria but the additional statutory criteria “but no gay sex” and “no threesomes, either” -- as an example of the type of law that should be instituted.Would a charge that Roberts’ recommendation proved he supported discrimination against gays be:1. A “smear”;2. An unfair criticism not rising to the level of “smear” (assuming there’s a distinction – I think there is); or3. A legitimate criticism of Roberts?It seems to me that the pro-Ginsburg (or perhaps, anti-Volokh) argument is that it’s unfair to bind a person to every word of a statute they use in support of issue “A” – that whatever the statute may say on issue “B” is a different matter entirely. Reasonable enough. The pro-EV forces respond that it is not unfair to expect a skilled lawyer to actually read statutes they cite as examples to be followed and, if the exemplar contains egregious or controversial language (even if not directly on point) to indicate disagreement. Not a loony position either, assuming the statute cited is of a reasonable length.Let's assume that a statute that says, crudely paraphrased, “rape laws should be gender neutral and it’s OK to f**k 12 year olds” and one which says, also crudely paraphrased, “teenagers should be able to have sex with each other, unless they’re gay, in which case it’s prison for the older one” would appear equally egregious/controversial to the eye of a skilled lawyer.Under these circumstances is my hypothetical John Roberts a homophobe?

Failure to repudiate doesn't equal endorsement.It might equal something less than endorsement, like indifference. But endorsement means intentionally, publicly supporting an idea. You can just ask someone if they endorse something and their answer, by definition, is the end of the matter. Whether or not a person endorses a position can never be controversial - if it is, you can be pretty sure that the ""endorsement"" was made up by adversaries (or that the person is an opportunist whose waffling has caught up with them).9.22.2005 9:34pmJon Rowe ( mail ) ( www ):I'm not sure what culture he's talking about.

Witnesses say at first they thought it was part of the show.“I’ve been to this haunted house before, actually last year,” said one eyewitness. They had people throughout the haunted house with fake chainsaws. So when I saw it, I got scared, but never thought it was real until he attacked the first victim.”Police say Ortega sawed through 7 attendees inside the haunted house, before fleeing the scene. The video shows him entering, but it also shows him exiting. In the end, you see a crowd of people overtake him and tackle him to the ground. Fortunately, none of the people that stopped him were injured.This is just one of a series of events that happened over the weekend that shocked several communities across the U.S. There were 5 other attacks at opening night haunted houses very similar to this one in the cities of Stockton, California, Las Vegas, Nevada, Atlanta, Georgia, Phoenix, Arizona and Houston, Texas.Authorities say they are concerned that this may be gang-related. Possibly gang initiation type activity. However, it is still too early for them to confirm this theory.They have asked workers and owners of these haunted houses, to be on high alert in the month of October.Warning: The video below may be disturbing to some viewers:Share and Enjoy		1
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/pacu-testicle-biting-fish/	the red-bellied pacu, an invasive species related to the piranha but with human-like teeth, is known to have bitten off men's testicles, killing at least two victims. see example( s )	Mostly False	['lethal lurkers', ' pacu', ' piranha']	http://www.seriouslyfish.com/	http://www.seriouslyfish.com/species/piaractus-brachypomus/	2016/08/15	Characidae. Subfamily: SerrasalminaeDistributionNative to the Rio Orinoco and Amazon basins in Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil. Introduced populations are thriving in various parts of the world, mainly in Far Eastern countries such as China and Taiwan where it’s farmed for eating.HabitatInhabits main river channels and flood plains, moving into flooded forests during the rainy season. It tends to prefer shallow, slow-moving areas with overhanging or floating vegetation. Juveniles spend the first few months of life in the flood plains, where food is plentiful and predation is less of a danger.Maximum Standard LengthThe biggest wild fish recorded measured 35.2″ (88cm). Captive specimens tend to be a bit smaller than this, but expect it to reach at least 24″ (60cm).Aquarium Size Top ↑Sadly adults are all too often seen living in cramped conditions. If you want to house one of these for life you’re going to need an enormous tank measuring at least 120″ x 36″ x 36 (300cm x 90cm x 90cm) – 2550 litres, preferably larger. Youngsters can be grown on in smaller tanks but will grow quickly when well-fed.MaintenanceThe size of the tank and filtration used are much more important than the choice of decor. Strictly speaking, decor isn’t necessary for a tank containing an adult as it’s a very active species . At any rate try not to clutter up the tank space too much. There’s also little point adding plants as they’ll be eaten immediately. Opt for a few water-worn boulders and perhaps some large chunks of driftwood or beech branches. Ensure that any such furnishings are too heavy to be moved around or secured to the tank in some way.A large and efficient biological filter is needed to cope with the amounts of waste produced by a fish of this size. If possible choose a sump – type arrangement, as this allows most of the equipment to be located outside the tank . A large specimen can easily destroy glass heaterstats, thermometers etc. as it charges around. Otherwise, buy the biggest filter you can afford (pond filters are worth considering) and perform regular large water changes.Water ConditionsTemperature: 73 to 82°F (23 to 28°C)pH: It's an adaptable species provided extremes are avoided. Somewhere within the range 4.8 to 7.5 is ok.Hardness: 0 to 15°HDietStomach analyses of wild specimens show it to be primarily a herbivorous species , feeding on fruits, nuts and seeds. It is an opportunist, though, and also takes insects, zooplankton and small fish. In the aquarium offer it a varied diet consisting of quality dried pellets or floating sticks, along with plenty of fruit and vegetables. Spinach, lettuce leaves, and fruit and vegetables such as apple, banana, peach, grapes, courgette, peas, cabbage and carrot all work well.Behaviour and Compatibility Top ↑Small fish will likely be eaten but in general it’s quite peaceful with bigger species . It can bother sedentary or shy companions with its constant activity, though. Obviously a truly enormous tank is needed to incorporate it into a community . If this kind of space is available suitable tankmates include Arowana, other similarly-sized characins, big cichlids, and large catfish from the Pimelodid, Doradid and Loricariid groups.It’s a shoaling species when juvenile , becoming more solitary as it matures. It can be kept in a group in the aquarium , but again, this is largely dependant on the amount of space available. In smaller quarters adults can become a bit of a nuisance, chasing and nipping the fins of both its own kind and other species .Sexual DimorphismMature females are a little rounder-bellied than males.ReproductionNot achieved in the hobby, although it’s being bred in some numbers for food in both South America and various Far Eastern countries. The fish are often induced to spawn via the use of hormones.Notes Top ↑Know as the pirapitinga in its native countries, this is the one of the largest species of scaled fish found in the Amazon basin . This alone should tell you much of what you need to know about its suitability as an aquarium inhabitant. In reality it’s debatable as to whether the species should be considered an aquarium subject at all. While pacu rarely reach their maximum size in captivity, they’re still easily capable of growing to a couple of feet in length. The myth that fish will only grow to match the size of the tank they’re kept in is just that – a myth.Unfortunately it’s regularly offered for sale as a cute 2-3″ fish, often labeled with enticing names such as “vegetarian piranha” or even “red-bellied piranha” (pacu are included in the same subfamily as piranha and resemble them superficially). Juveniles of P. brachypomus are in fact patterned to mimic the real red-bellied piranha, Pygocentrus nattereri as a deterrent to potential predators.As a result many public aquaria have large displays of adult specimens that have been “donated” by fishkeepers, often to the extent where they refuse to accept any more. A more depressing, but equally common scenario is that the fish are dumped into rivers and ponds when they outgrow their tank . In colder climates they will obviously not survive, but populations exist in various states of the USA and several other countries as a result of releases by irresponsible aquarists. The species has subsequently been banned from sale by many wildlife authorities in the US.Pacu have developed amazing dentition to allow them to crush fruit, nuts and seeds. Their teeth are cusped and resemble human molars, and they also have very powerful jaws. Although they are rarely aggressive they can inflict a really nasty bite, so take care when performing tank maintenance.The species is widely used in aquaculture projects in South America. It’s ideally suited for the purpose, being tolerant of a wide range of water chemistry and possessing the ability to survive in oxygen-depleted conditions. Much research is being undertaken to find the most ecologically sound way of farming it, as it’s suffering from gross overfishing in many of its native waters. If wild stocks become further depleted, there could be serious implications not only for the species itself, but also entire ecosystems. The seeds of many of the fruits eaten by pacu are indigestible, and are excreted intact. Some experts believe the fish play a significant role in seed dispersal of plants from areas of flooded forest. Sustainable commercial farming of pacu is therefore considered a priority. Not only will this prevent further depletion of wild stocks, but it will provide an alternative source of income for farmers. The hope is that it may also encourage them to take up aquaculture instead of agriculture, which is having a devastating effect on many parts of the Amazon rainforest.As a food fish pacu is apparently very tasty. Its natural diet of fruit and nuts is said to enhance the flavour of the flesh. As the fish is so large cuts are often sold on the bone in a similar way to pork ribs. One further commercial use of the species is as a sport fish , both in its natural environment and artificially-stocked lakes. It’s been introduced into several Far Eastern countries for this purpose, including Thailand and Malaysia.No Responses to “Piaractus brachypomus (Red-bellied Pacu)”Leave a Reply		0
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/man-spit-marine/	a man spat at a young marine holding the door open for him because the american people no longer support the military.	Unproven	['ezekiel dingle', ' melissa butz uhl dingle', ' shunned serviceman', ' war on police']	http://www.military.com/	http://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/marine-corps-boot-camp-schedule.html	2015/10/07	"Marine Corps Boot Camp Timeline At a GlanceMilitary.comMarine boot camp is extremely challenging – both physically and mentally – considered to be tougher than the basic training programs of any of the other military services. All recruits go to one of two locations for basic training; Recruit Training Depot at Parris Island, South Carolina, or Recruit Training Depot at San Diego, California. Where recruits go depends largely upon where they enlist. Those who enlist west of the Mississippi will likely go through boot camp in San Diego, while those in the East will attend at Parris Island. There is only one boot camp to turn women into Marines -- Parris Island. USMC Recruit Training All Marine recruits start their training at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot (MCRD). This is where America's young men and women are transformed into Marines. Some believe that Marines are forged in a furnace of shared hardship and tough training. Shared, intense experience creates a bond so strong between Marines that nothing can stop them from accomplishing their mission. Marine Corps recruits are trained not only physically and mentally, but morally as well. Forming the bedrock of any Marine's character are the Core Values -- Honor, Courage and Commitment . By incorporating these values into recruit training, a Marine is not just a basically trained, morally conscious Marine, but also a better American citizen who will return to society following his or her service to this country.Taking Up The Challenge Marines, both active and veterans, say that recruit training was the most difficult thing they ever had to do in their entire lives. It has to be that way to prepare young men and women to be part the world's most elite fighting force, . Upon arrival at MCRD, a new recruit begins a three phase training program - a virtually non-stop journey - that results in the transformation from recruit to United States Marine.Phase One - Week One Through Four The first phase is the transition of civilian to recruit and it takes place at the MCRD, where recruits undergo strenuous physical training , martial arts and classes on such areas as Marine Corps history and first aid.A recruit's first stop is called “Recruit Receiving”. This is where recruits spend the first few days of their recruit training experience. This is where they receive their first haircut and initial gear issue, which includes items such as uniforms, toiletries and letter writing supplies. During this time they are also given full medical and dental screenings, and take the Initial Strength Test. This test consists of a one and a half mile run, sit-ups and pull-ups to test recruits to see if they're in shape to begin training. Recruits will also learn the Marine Corps values of honor, courage, and commitment. The rest of this phase is spent learning weapons handling from trained experts and completing the Confidence Course .Phase Two – Week Five Through Nine The second phase starts when recruits move up north to Edson Range, Weapons Field Training Battalion. hone their close combat skills and master Marksmanship Training . Every Marine is a rifleman first and foremost. It is during this time they will develop proficiency and confidence with their weapon. During this phase, they spend most of their time conducting field training and rifle qualifications. Recruits undergo gas chamber training, Field Firing Range and the Crucible event.Phase Three – Week Ten Through Thirteen For the third phase, recruits move back to the Depot where they undergo swim qualifications , a defensive driving course , testing of Marine Corps history, first aid, physical training , drill , and inspections and finally Family Day/Graduation .Special note: During basic training trainees can receive mail but nothing else — so please ask friends and family to not send gifts or supplies. Also make sure your mail is not addressed to “Marine” or “Private”. This is a title recruits earn after successfully completion of training. The following are descriptions and details about some of the events listed above. The U.S. Marine Corps Core Values The Corps' Core Values are Honor, Courage and Commitment. These values make up the bedrock of a Marine's character. During your training, you are taught these Core Values and the numerous others attached to them, such as integrity, discipline, teamwork, duty and esprit de Corps. Drill instructors, recruit training officers and Navy chaplains teach specific Core Values classes, but drill instructors also will talk one-on-one with you after other training events to see what values were learned and how you are affected. For example, a drill instructor might talk about overcoming fears after rappelling or not giving up after a long march.Confidence Course The Confidence Course is an 11-station obstacle course, which helps you build confidence as well as upper-body strength. You will tackle this course twice during your 13 weeks of training.Physical Training Physical Training, or ""PT"" as it is often called, comes in many forms. Recruit training uses a progressive physical training program, which builds up recruits to Marine Corps standards. Recruits will experience Table PT, a period of training in which a drill instructor leads several platoons through a series of demanding exercises while he demonstrates on a table. Recruits will also run, either individually or as a platoon or squad. Other PT consists of obstacle courses, circuit courses, or 3-, 5- or 10-mile conditioning marches.Marksmanship Training Marksmanship training teaches you the fundamentals of marksmanship with the M-16A2 service rifle. This training takes place over two weeks, the first of which is called ""Snap-In Week"". During this week, recruits are introduced to the four shooting positions (standing, kneeling, sitting and prone) and a Primary Marksmanship Instructor shows how to fire, how to adjust rifle sights, how to take into account the effects of the weather, etc. Recruits also have the opportunity to fire on the Indoor Simulated Marksmanship Training machine. During the second week of marksmanship training, recruits fire a known-distance course with ranges of 200, 300 and 500 yards. Be prepared, rifle qualification will be on Friday.Field Training Field Training introduces you to field living and conditions. During the 3-day field training evolution, you will learn basic field skills from setting up a tent to field sanitation and camouflage. Also during the Field Training you get the opportunity to go through the gas chamber.Field Firing Range (FFR) FFR is a portion of training devoted to firing weapons in a field condition. During marksmanship training, you learn how to fire at a single target while in a stationary position. During FFR you learn how to fire at moving and multiple targets, while under low-light conditions and wearing your field protective (gas) mask.Combat Water Survival Combat Water Survival training develops your confidence in the water. All recruits must pass the minimum requirement level of Combat Water Survival-4 (CWS-4), which requires recruits to perform a variety of water survival and swimming techniques. If recruits meet the CWS-4 requirements, you may upgrade to a higher level. All recruits train in the camouflage utility uniform, but if upgraded you may be required to train in full combat gear, which includes a rifle, helmet, flak jacket and pack.Drill Drill is the basic way in which platoons march and move from place to place. At first, you will practice by just staying in step with the rest of the platoon and the drill instructor. During drill training, platoons will also compete in two drill competitions. Drill is mainly used to instill discipline, team pride and unit cohesion.Family Day/Graduation Family Day and Graduation take place on the last two days while on MCRD. Family Day occurs on Thursday and gives new Marines a chance to see their family and friends for the first time during on-base liberty. Graduation is conducted on Friday at the completion of the Transition Phase. It is a formal ceremony and parade, attended by family and friends and executed on the parade field.The Crucible The following is a description of the Marine Corps Crucible as told by the Marine Corps:""We have two missions in the Marine Corps -- to win battles and make Marines,"" said Col. Bob Hayes, assistant deputy chief of staff for operations and training at the recruit depot here. ""The Crucible is one piece of that effort.""The Crucible emphasizes trainee teamwork under stress. ""Recruits get eight hours of sleep during the entire 54 hour exercise,"" said Sgt. Roger Summers, a Delta Company drill instructor in the 1st Recruit Training Battalion at Parris Island. ""They get two-and-a-half Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) and they are responsible for rationing out the food to themselves. Then we put them through tough physical activities like road marches and night infiltration courses. They march about 40 miles in those 54 hours.""It isn't long before the recruits are tired and hungry, Summers said, but as they keep going they realize they can call on reserves they never knew they had. ""Some of these recruits do things they never thought they could do,"" he said. ""Some of them come from middle-class homes where everything has been handed to them. Others come from poorer homes where nothing was ever expected of them. If they finish the Crucible, they have accomplished something.""One recruit put it best. ""I am going to finish this,"" he said. ""And when I do, it will be the most positive thing I have done in my life.""Delta Company begins the Crucible at 3 a.m. with a six-mile road march from their barracks to Page Airfield, the Crucible site. Once there, recruits -- and that's the only thing the drill instructors call the trainees -- place their gear in huts and prepare for the first of four four-hour events.Each event has a number of ""warrior stations"" each team of recruits must work together to overcome or solve. Each station is named for a Marine hero and the drill instructor has a recruit read a brief explanation of how the hero's actions exemplify the Corps and its values.""I choose a different leader for each station. That way, all the recruits understand what it's like to be the leader and what they have to do to be a follower,"" Summers said. ""For some of them, they want to run everything. They can't admit that a recruit who may not have been the sharpest in previous training has a good idea. Sometimes it's the quiet one who has the idea and no one will listen.""You see the team learn as they go along,"" he continued. ""At the beginning, they just charge ahead without a plan and without asking if anyone has an idea. By the end of the Crucible you see them working together better, getting advice from all team members and solving more of the problems.""One warrior station, for example, is built around an enemy-mined rope bridge that the recruits must cross with their gear and ammunition boxes. They have only a couple of short ropes and their personal gear to solve the problem. At another event, recruits run into firing positions and engage pop-up targets with 10 rounds in two magazines. Recruit teams battle each other with pugil sticks in yet another event.The recruits grab food and water when they can. After the first two events comes a five-mile night march. ""The night march was the toughest thing we've done here,"" said 18-year-old Pfc. Josh Lunceford of Charleston, W.Va. ""The whole company went on it and whoever led it set a real fast pace. You couldn't see very well and people were tripping over stuff, and everyone was tired.""The recruits hit the rack for four hours of sleep, then begin another day and finish the final two events. ""On the second day they are tired and hungry and it really starts to show,"" said Capt. John H. Rochford, Delta Company commander. ""They start getting short with one another, but they realize after the first day they have to work together to finish. No one gets through the Crucible alone.""At the end of the second day, the recruits go through a night infiltration course and then hit the rack for another four hours. When they get up, they face a nine-mile march and the end of the Crucible.The march begins at 4 a.m. and, at first, is done quietly. Recruits limp along, because no one wants to drop out this close to the end, Summers said.As the sun rises, the recruits cross DI Bridge. Once across, the drill instructors start Jody calls and the recruits join in. As they get closer to the main base, the Jody calls get louder until they reach the Parade Deck. The recruits form up around a half-size replica of the Marine Corps Memorial -- also known as the Iwo Jima Memorial. There, a significant transformation takes place.""We're not just giving them basic training, we're turning them into Marines,"" Rochford said. ""There's more to being a Marine than knowing how to fire a weapon. There's a whole tradition behind it, and we want these recruits to measure up to the men and women who went before them.""A color guard raises the flag on the memorial. The chaplain reads a prayer specifically written for the finish of the Crucible, and the company first sergeant addresses the recruits. Then the drill instructors present each of their recruits with the Marine Corps insignia -- the eagle, globe and anchor. He shakes their hands and calls them ""Marine"" for the first time. Many accept the honor with tears streaming down their faces.© Copyright 2018 Military.com. All rights reserved.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-fake-time-covers/	"fake ""time"" magazine covers featuring donald trump were found at several of his golf resorts."	True	['president donald trump', ' time magazine', ' trump administration', ' washington post']	https://www.washingtonpost.com/	https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-time-magazine-with-trump-on-the-cover-hangs-in-his-golf-clubs-its-fake/2017/06/27/0adf96de-5850-11e7-ba90-f5875b7d1876_story.html?utm_term=.c29330a35178	2017/06/27	The framed copy of Time magazine was hung up in at least five of President Trump’s clubs, from South Florida to Scotland. Filling the entire cover was a photo of Donald Trump. “Donald Trump: The ‘Apprentice’ is a television smash!” the big headline said. Above the Time nameplate, there was another headline in all caps: “TRUMP IS HITTING ON ALL FRONTS . . . This cover — dated March 1, 2009 — looks like an impressive memento from Trump’s pre-presidential career. To club members eating lunch, or golfers waiting for a pro-shop purchase, it seemed to be a signal that Trump had always been a man who mattered. Even when he was just a reality TV star, Trump was the kind of star who got a cover story in Time. But that wasn’t true. The Time cover is a fake. There was no March 1, 2009, issue of Time magazine. And there was no issue at all in 2009 that had Trump on the cover. In fact, the cover on display at Trump’s clubs, observed recently by a reporter visiting one of the properties, contains several small but telling mistakes. Its red border is skinnier than that of a genuine Time cover, and, unlike the real thing, there is no thin white border next to the red. The Trump cover’s secondary headlines are stacked on the right side — on a real Time cover, they would go across the top. And it has two exclamation points. Time headlines don’t yell. “I can confirm that this is not a real TIME cover,” Kerri Chyka, a spokeswoman for Time Inc., wrote in an email to The Washington Post. At 5 p.m. Tuesday, a spokeswoman for Time said that the magazine had asked the Trump Organization to remove the phony cover from the walls where it was on display. So how did Trump — who spent an entire campaign and much of his presidency accusing the mainstream media of producing “fake news” — wind up decorating his properties with a literal piece of phony journalism? The Trump Organization did not respond to questions this week about who made the cover and why it was displayed at Trump clubs. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders declined to say whether Trump had known that the cover wasn’t real. “We couldn’t comment on the decor at Trump Golf clubs one way or another,” Sanders wrote in an email. The cover seems to fit a broader pattern for Trump, who has often boasted of his appearances on Time’s cover and adorned his Trump Tower office with images of himself from magazines and newspapers. Trump has made claims about himself — about his charitable giving, his business success, even the size of the crowd at his inauguration — that are not supported by the facts. In this case, Trump’s golf clubs might seem like places where he wouldn’t need to stretch the truth. Reality is flattering enough. The clubs are monuments to Trump’s success — they bear his name and are filled with his images. But, still, his staff added an extra trophy that was phony. It is not clear who created this fake Time cover — or why. Its date might be a clue: March 1, 2009, was the season debut of Trump’s show “The Celebrity Apprentice.” But a transcript of that show offers no answers. In that episode, various B-list celebrities competed to sell cupcakes, and Trump fired comedian Andrew Dice Clay for poor performance. Nobody mentioned Time magazine. While it’s not difficult to mock up a fake cover using graphic-design software, whoever made this one sought out real Time headlines, to add to the fake. There are secondary headlines on the Trump cover that tout stories on President Barack Obama, climate change and the financial crisis. Two of those are taken from a real March 2, 2009, issue of Time, which featured actress Kate Winslet on the cover. But the issue makes no mention of Trump. Another possible clue to the fake cover’s origins: The fake bar code on the bottom right. An identical bar code shows up online in a graphic-design tutorial posted in 2010, in which a Peruvian designer laid out how to make a fake Time cover — complete with this bar code, for extra realism. The graphic designer did not immediately respond to questions from The Post. The Post found that the fake cover had been hung in at least four of Trump’s 17 golf clubs. At Trump’s resort in Doral, Fla., outside Miami, the fake image hangs in two prominent spots. In the pro shop, it shares a wall with 11 other framed magazine pages — all of them highlighting Trump, another member of the Trump family or a Trump golf course. Among the covers with Trump’s face on them, the Time cover looks like one of the most impressive. The others are old — such as a 1984 cover of GQ — or from less-prominent titles, such as Fairways + Greens magazine and TV Guide Canada. Those two publications are out of print. A copy of the fake cover also hangs in Champions, the Doral resort’s sports bar. It faces a framed cover of Fortune magazine from 2004, showing Trump’s face with the headline “Trumped.” That one is real. In Virginia, the phony Time cover hangs on the wall of the members’ dining room at the Trump golf course in suburban Loudoun County, near Washington. Trump has visited that club more frequently since moving into the White House. In early June, the president ate lunch in that dining room with football star Peyton Manning and Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.). A photo taken during their lunch shows that Trump’s chair faced the fake Time cover. At the same club, Trump’s staff put up a historical marker declaring that there had been a Civil War battle on the site — and that the adjacent Potomac River became a “River of Blood.” Historians say this battle never happened. The marker was first reported by the New York Times. In addition, the fake cover was hung up near the entrance of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., according to a photo taken in July 2016 by Scott Keeler, a photographer at the Tampa Bay Times. Keeler posted it Tuesday on Twitter. The Time cover also appears to have been hung up at Trump’s golf resort in Doonbeg, in western Ireland. Trump bought the club in 2014. Photos posted on TripAdvisor show it on the wall of a dining room. But when a reporter visited the club this past weekend, it was gone. A bartender later found it in the manager’s office. Officials at the club could not explain why it had been moved. And at Trump’s Turnberry club in Scotland, employees said they recognized the cover. It had been added after Trump bought the course in 2014, said the employees, who spoke to The Post on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment to the media. One employee said the fake cover had previously hung in the resort’s pub, called the Duel in the Sun after a famous golf match played at Turnberry in 1977. But, she said, the cover was taken down a few weeks ago. “We used to have a Time magazine cover up — aye, it was there for ages and ages, as long as I’ve been here. I know the one you’re on about,” the employee said. In its place, the club had hung up an old-timey photo of the course. Club officials did not respond to queries about why it was taken down. The employee said it was part of a general reduction in photos of Trump. “We certainly have been hearing more grumbling about all the stuff like that up on the walls since his election,” the employee said. “From Americans, mostly, funny enough. “But it was just a guess. The Post also looked for the fake cover at two Trump courses in the United States that are open to the public, in the Bronx and in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif. It was not on display at either. The rest of Trump’s courses are members-only, making it difficult to get inside to look at the decor. The image does not appear to be among the many framed magazine covers that adorn Trump’s old office in Trump Tower, based on photos of the office. One thing that is clear, from the president’s past statements, is that he views the cover of Time as a significant honor. Trump has bragged that he’s been on more Time covers than anyone. “I think we have the all-time record in the history of Time magazine,” he said during a January speech at CIA headquarters. That is wrong. Richard Nixon has appeared on far more than Trump. In a 2016 interview, when Trump was a candidate, he offered a mental tally of how many times he had appeared on the magazine’s cover. “I think I was on the cover of Time magazine twice in my life and like six times in the last number of months. So you tell me, which is more important, real estate or politics, okay?” Trump said. But that count was wrong. According to Time magazine’s tally, Trump had been on the cover only once before he got into politics. That was in January 1989. Francisco Alvarado in Doral, Nash Riggins in Turnberry, Yvonne Gordon in Doonbeg, Philip Bump in New York, Rob Kuznia in Rancho Palos Verdes and Alice Crites in Washington contributed to this report.		1

Not funny, cast is terrible, always a complete hit job. Really bad television!”The “hit job” in question this time came the night before, when Alec Baldwin performed a relatively accurate version of Trump’s first press conference as president-elect on SNL’s first sketch of 2017 . Like in real life, Baldwin’s Trump addressed directly the unverified accusations that he engaged in “golden showers” parties in Russia, but in SNL’s version he was actually more polite to CNN’s Jim Acosta .Trump has tweeted against SNL and Baldwin after nearly every single episode in which the actor has appeared, but as the inauguration approaches, it has become increasingly more unnerving and desperate. While he has previously tweeted during the show in the post-midnight hour, this time he waited until late afternoon on Sunday, leading some to imagine that he had perhaps come to realize how silly his outbursts seemed. Nope!It is also notable that Trump continues to tweet against NBC properties while he remains an executive producer of NBC’s The New Celebrity Apprentice. Following that show’s premiere this month , he tweeted that new host Arnold Schwarzenegger could never measure up to “ratings machine, DJT.”As for Baldwin, he did not take Trump’s bait directly, but did follow his latest SNL tweet with one of his own about the president-elect’s other big Twitter battle of the weekend with Congressman John Lewis. After Lewis said he does not view Trump as a “legitimate president,” Trump fired back in a series of tweets that accused the Civil Rights icon of being “All talk, talk, talk - no action or results.”“When African Americans felt abused/neglected, they turned to ppl like John Lewis, Julian Bond and MLK for leadership,” Baldwin tweeted. “MCW’s chose Trump…” he added, in an apparent reference to “middle-class whites.”Speaking to Katie Couric in an interview earlier this week , Baldwin warned against simply “whining” and “lampooning” Trump and instead called on those who oppose him to take real action. Those comments, in response to Meryl Streep’s Golden Globes speech , had more than a hint of irony coming from a man who parodies Trump on a weekly basis.While Baldwin said he believes it’s time for people to “move on” and accept reality, that’s not so easy to do when the man who’s about to be president can’t stop “whining” about you on Twitter. With his latest comments, Baldwin is signaling that he might not think Trump is all that “legitimate” either.READ THIS LIST		0

If pot use becomes legal, the dogs would likely either have to be retrained — which some handlers say is impossible or impractical — or retired.“The biggest thing for law enforcement is, you're going to have to replace all of your dogs,” said Macon County Sheriff Howard Buffett, whose private foundation paid $2.2 million in 2016 to support K-9 units in 33 counties across Illinois. “So to me, it’s a giant step forward for drug dealers, and it’s a giant step backwards for law enforcements and the residents of the community.""The concerns come as lawmakers weigh whether to make Illinois the 10th state to legalize marijuana for recreational use. The state decriminalized possession of a small amount in 2016: having up to 10 grams of marijuana is a civil offense punishable by a fine between $100 and $200. In 2015, Illinois implemented a medical marijuana pilot program, with a limited list of qualifying conditions, that is set to expire in 2020.Supporters say legalization would bring in much-needed revenue, while opponents say they worry about cannabis acting as a gateway to other, harder drugs for some users, noting that federal law prohibits marijuana use and classifies it as a schedule 1 drug, the same category as heroin and LSD.+4 Buy NowDouglas County Sheriff's deputy Kaitlin Washburn does an exercise with K-9 officer Kuno.For states that have legalized marijuana, police have taken different approaches to the K-9 issue. Officers in parts of Washington state have either attempted to retrain their animals to ignore pot or, for new police dogs, taught them to smell all narcotics other than cannabis. In other states, agencies have kept their pot-sniffing dogs and continued to search for large amounts of the drug not allowed under the law, although a recent legal challenge could soon change that.Chad Larner, training director of the K-9 Training Academy in Macon County, dismissed the idea of retraining dogs, saying it would amount to “extreme abuse” to change their mindset. K-9s are rewarded for successfully alerting to the presence of narcotics, and they continue to train regularly with their handlers for a suggested minimum of 16 hours a month.In addition, there is no guarantee the dogs could be broken of their original training, contradicting the main priority for K-9 handlers.“We do not want to subject innocent citizens or motorists who travel through Illinois ... to unlawful search and seizures. That is our main priority,” Larner said. +4 Chad Larner, training director of the K-9 Training Academy, left, and Macon County Sheriff Howard Buffett have expressed concerns about what will happen to police dogs if Illinois lawmakers legalize recreational marijuana. Extensive trainingThere are about 275 certified narcotic detection K-9s in Illinois, Larner said. Most of the dogs are dual-purpose, meaning they are trained to find drugs and to track and apprehend suspects and missing persons.Assistant Police Chief Steve Petrilli of the Normal Police Department said it would be impossible to teach the dogs to ignore odors they have been trained to recognize since they were young.“At this point, they’re trained on five different odors. Once they’re programmed with that, you can’t just deprogram them,” said Petrilli, who was a K-9 handler for eight years. “I think the implications of that would be huge.“Normal’s current K-9s, Barrett and Thor, are both dual-service dogs. “They’d still have some versatility,” but “their most common use is vehicle searches out on the street.” Buying and training the department's most recent dog cost $20,000. Training a K-9 can take anywhere from eight to 16 weeks and cost between $3,000 to $5,000, not including the time commitment, overtime costs or advanced training. Depending on the dog’s breed, training and purpose, the price of an animal can range anywhere from $8,000 to $16,000 each.Bloomington has two K-9s: Roscoe and Ryker, the latter of which is still in training and will replace the retired K-9 Lex, said Public Affairs Officer Elias Mendiola. He said the department takes direction from the Illinois Law Enforcement Training and Standards Board as to how the animals are trained, and would look to it for guidance if recreational marijuana is legalized. IT'S LEGALWhere in the United States where recreational marijuana use is legal: Alaska"		1
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/anne-frank-refugee/	the family of anne frank sought (and was denied) refugee status in the united states.	True	['anne frank', ' refugees', ' syrian refugee crisis']	http://www.nytimes.com/	http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/15/world/europe/15iht-frank.4597896.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0	2015/11/19	"The file, originally in the hands of the National Refugee Service, was turned over to the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research in New York in 1974 along with tens of thousands of other files from private Jewish refugee agencies. It was not until 2005 that YIVO got a grant to organize and index the 350 file cabinets of material it had stored in an off-site facility. In the summer of that year, Estelle Guzick, a part-time volunteer, was sorting through papers when she saw a file jacket was missing the owner's date of birth, said Carl Rheins, YIVO's executive director. He said she opened it and saw that the children's names were Anne and Margot Frank. YIVO kept the find under wraps until Wednesday to straighten out the complicated legal questions of confidentiality and copyright, Rheins said. The Anne Frank Foundation in Basel, Switzerland, controls most of the Franks' estate. The papers are now available to scholars at YIVO's library on West 16th Street. If there is one face that evokes the immeasurable loss from the Holocaust, it is Anne Frank's. Her daily account of hiding in an Amsterdam building before her imprisonment and death in Bergen-Belsen, Germany, in 1945, at 15, has become a worldwide literary and historical landmark. Given the extraordinary efforts to preserve Anne's legacy by her father, the only member of the family to survive the concentration camps, the discovery of the neglected file is particularly surprising. The documents show how Otto Frank, his brothers-in-law, his friends and refugee agencies tried to navigate the bewildering maze of regulations that included gathering sponsors, large sums of money and proof of how their entry would benefit America. Even the assistant secretary of state at the time, Adolf Berle, despaired of the confusion. He wrote in a letter in January 1941 that some consulates ask ""for a trust fund. Others ask for affidavits. One particularly shocking case stated that nothing would be accepted save from a relative in the United States under a legal obligation to support the applicant.

""It does seem to me that this department could pull itself together sufficiently to get out a general instruction which would be complete enough and simple enough so that the procedure could be standardized."" Richard Breitman, a historian at American University, explained that after France fell to the Germans in the summer of 1940, fears grew in America that a fifth column of spies and saboteurs would be dispatched from Europe. As a State Department. memorandum dated May 2, 1941, declared: ""At a time like this, when the safety of the country is imperiled, it seems fully justifiable to resolve any possible doubts in favor of the country, rather than in favor of the aliens concerned."" By June 1941, no one with close relatives still in Germany was allowed into the United States because of suspicions that the Nazis could use them to blackmail refugees into clandestine cooperation. That development ended the possibility of getting the Frank girls out through a children's rescue agency. Soon after, Germany closed American consulates throughout its territories. As the exchange of letters show, Otto Frank would have had to get an exit permit out of the Netherlands, and transit visas for a series of Nazi-occupied countries to one of the four neutral areas where America still had consular offices. By the end of the summer, they realized it was hopeless. ""I am afraid, however, the news is not good news,"" Straus wrote to Otto Frank on July 1, 1941. Frank then tried to get to Cuba, a risky, expensive and often corrupt process. ""The only way to get to a neutral country are visas or others States such as Cuba,"" he said in a letter to Straus on Sept. 8. On Oct. 12, 1941, he wrote, ""It is all much more difficult as one can imagine and is getting more complicated every day."" Because of the uncertainty, Otto Frank decided to try for a single visa for himself. It was granted and forwarded to him on Dec. 1. No one knows if it arrived. Ten days later, Germany and Italy declared war on the United States and Havana canceled the visa. The last few papers in the file date from June 1945 to 1946. They include letters from Otto's brother-in-law, Julius Hollander, who was trying to locate the Franks and arrange for them to emigrate to the United States. There is a brief notification that Hollander's sister, Edith Frank, died and her daughters, Margot and Anne, are missing. What follows is a letter from Hollander saying that Otto Frank was staying in Amsterdam and no longer wanted to come to the United States. A version of this article appears in print on February 14, 2007, in The International Herald Tribune."		1

I’m Lester Holt, anchor of “NBC Nightly News.” I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate.The participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. The commission drafted tonight’s format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns.The 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long. We’ll explore three topic areas tonight: Achieving prosperity; America’s direction; and securing America. At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead-off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond. From that point until the end of the segment, we’ll have an open discussion.The questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns. The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying.I will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment, as we welcome the candidates: Democratic nominee for president of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: How are you, Donald?(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Good luck to you.(APPLAUSE)Well, I don’t expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled. We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and we’re going to press for specifics. I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people.Candidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values. So, let’s begin.We’re calling this opening segment “Achieving Prosperity.” And central to that is jobs. There are two economic realities in America today. There’s been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation. However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works?CLINTON: Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we’ll build together. Today is my granddaughter’s second birthday, so I think about this a lot. First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.I want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business. We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women’s work.CLINTON: I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing. If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work. I’ve heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you’re under. So let’s have paid family leave, earned sick days. Let’s be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.How are we going to do it? We’re going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it’s good to be with you. We’re going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country. You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better. I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.HOLT: Secretary Clinton, thank you.Mr. Trump, the same question to you. It’s about putting money — more money into the pockets of American workers. You have up to two minutes.TRUMP: Thank you, Lester. Our jobs are fleeing the country. They’re going to Mexico. They’re going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. They’re devaluing their currency, and there’s nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight. Because they’re using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.So we’re losing our good jobs, so many of them. When you look at what’s happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it’s the eighth wonder of the world. They’re building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much.So Ford is leaving. You see that, their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They’re all leaving. And we can’t allow it to happen anymore. As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we’re going to do, but perhaps we’ll be talking about that later.But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis. They left — fired 1,400 people. They’re going to Mexico. So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.TRUMP: We cannot let it happen. Under my plan, I’ll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. That’s going to be a job creator like we haven’t seen since Ronald Reagan. It’s going to be a beautiful thing to watch.Companies will come. They will build. They will expand. New companies will start. And I look very, very much forward to doing it. We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.HOLT: Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?CLINTON: Well, I think that trade is an important issue. Of course, we are 5 percent of the world’s population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent. And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions. And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again. In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we’ve ever had.I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that’s exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy.We just have a different view about what’s best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives. I understand that. You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that’s all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we’ll be and that everything will work out from there.I don’t buy that. I have a different experience. My father was a small-businessman. He worked really hard. He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going.And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we’ll grow. That’s the kind of economy I want us to see again.HOLT: Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can. You’ve talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you’ve promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans. How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas? How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?TRUMP: Well, for one thing — and before we start on that — my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that’s worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that’s the kind of thinking that our country needs.Our country’s in deep trouble. We don’t know what we’re doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China. They’re the best, the best ever at it. What they’re doing to us is a very, very sad thing.So we have to do that. We have to renegotiate our trade deals. And, Lester, they’re taking our jobs, they’re giving incentives, they’re doing things that, frankly, we don’t do.Let me give you the example of Mexico. They have a VAT tax. We’re on a different system. When we sell into Mexico, there’s a tax. When they sell in — automatic, 16 percent, approximately. When they sell into us, there’s no tax. It’s a defective agreement. It’s been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven’t done anything about it.Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton — yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It’s very important to me.But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently. She’s been doing this for 30 years. And why hasn’t she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective. Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact...HOLT: Let me interrupt just a moment, but...TRUMP: Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we’ve created a movement. They should have been doing this for years. What’s happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is — look, we owe $20 trillion. We cannot do it any longer, Lester.HOLT: Back to the question, though. How do you bring back — specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers? How do you make them bring the jobs back?TRUMP: Well, the first thing you do is don’t let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving. I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them. They’re leaving, and they’re leaving in bigger numbers than ever.And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck. But if you think you’re going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you’re wrong.And once you say you’re going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies. So what I’m saying is, we can stop them from leaving. We have to stop them from leaving. And that’s a big, big factor.HOLT: Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here.CLINTON: Well, let’s stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago. We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. He said, back in 2006, “Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money.” Well, it did collapse.TRUMP: That’s called business, by the way.CLINTON: Nine million people — nine million people lost their jobs. Five million people lost their homes. And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.Now, we have come back from that abyss. And it has not been easy. So we’re now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.Independent experts have looked at what I’ve proposed and looked at what Donald’s proposed, and basically they’ve said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.They’ve looked at my plans and they’ve said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy. Take clean energy. Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century. Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it’s real.TRUMP: I did not. I did not. I do not say that.CLINTON: I think science is real.TRUMP: I do not say that.CLINTON: And I think it’s important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad. And here’s what we can do. We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. We can have enough clean energy to power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. That’s a lot of jobs; that’s a lot of new economic activity.So I’ve tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we’re going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we’ve made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.HOLT: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: She talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company, our country. That was a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that one.Now, look, I’m a great believer in all forms of energy, but we’re putting a lot of people out of work. Our energy policies are a disaster. Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt. You can’t do what you’re looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.The Obama administration, from the time they’ve come in, is over 230 years’ worth of debt, and he’s topped it. He’s doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.So I will tell you this. We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs. And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they’re not doing it.And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they’re gone.And, Hillary, I’d just ask you this. You’ve been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now? For 30 years, you’ve been doing it, and now you’re just starting to think of solutions.CLINTON: Well, actually...TRUMP: I will bring — excuse me. I will bring back jobs. You can’t bring back jobs.CLINTON: Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.TRUMP: Yeah, for 30 years.CLINTON: And I have — well, not quite that long. I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again...TRUMP: Well, he approved NAFTA...(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: ... million new jobs, a balanced budget...TRUMP: He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.CLINTON: Incomes went up for everybody. Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we’re actually going to look at the facts.When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test. Will they create jobs in America? Will they raise incomes in America? And are they good for our national security? Some of them I voted for. The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against. And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.But let’s not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy. I think it is a part of it, and I’ve said what I’m going to do. I’m going to have a special prosecutor. We’re going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we’re going to hold people accountable.When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent. We increased them to China 50 percent. So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.HOLT: Very quickly...TRUMP: But you haven’t done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...CLINTON: Well, I’ve been a senator, Donald...TRUMP: You haven’t done it. You haven’t done it.CLINTON: And I have been a secretary of state...TRUMP: Excuse me.CLINTON: And I have done a lot...TRUMP: Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.CLINTON: Well, that’s your opinion. That is your opinion.TRUMP: You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent. NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it. Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can’t win that debate. But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA. Nothing will ever top NAFTA.CLINTON: Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out. I wrote about that in...TRUMP: You called it the gold standard.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it’s the finest deal you’ve ever seen.CLINTON: No.TRUMP: And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.CLINTON: Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts. The facts are — I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated...TRUMP: Not.CLINTON: ... which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn’t. I wrote about that in my book...TRUMP: So is it President Obama’s fault?CLINTON: ... before you even announced.TRUMP: Is it President Obama’s fault?CLINTON: Look, there are differences...TRUMP: Secretary, is it President Obama’s fault?CLINTON: There are...TRUMP: Because he’s pushing it.CLINTON: There are different views about what’s good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world. And I think it’s important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again. That’s why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt.TRUMP: But you have no plan.CLINTON: But in — oh, but I do.TRUMP: Secretary, you have no plan.CLINTON: In fact, I have written a book about it. It’s called “Stronger Together.” You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore...TRUMP: That’s about all you’ve...(CROSSTALK)HOLT: Folks, we’re going to...CLINTON: ... or at an airport near you.HOLT: We’re going to move to...CLINTON: But it’s because I see this — we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth. We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.So we have a very robust set of plans. And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.TRUMP: You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history. You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. You are going to drive business out. Your regulations are a disaster, and you’re going to increase regulations all over the place.And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan. I’m very proud of it. It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs. But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.When I go around — Lester, I tell you this, I’ve been all over. And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing — the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I’m cutting regulation. You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business. And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.I’m going to cut regulations. I’m going to cut taxes big league, and you’re going to raise taxes big league, end of story.HOLT: Let me get you to pause right there, because we’re going to move into — we’re going to move into the next segment. We’re going to talk taxes...CLINTON: That can’t — that can’t be left to stand.HOLT: Please just take 30 seconds and then we’re going to go on.CLINTON: I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so...TRUMP: Facts.CLINTON: So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we’ve turned it into a fact-checker. So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look. Because what I have proposed...TRUMP: And take a look at mine, also, and you’ll see.CLINTON: ... would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt. What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses. What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy. And I think it’s time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.VideoDonald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton clashed on taxes, crime and race during their presidential debate on Monday at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y. The Times reporter Michael D. Shear weighs in on the night of pointed attacks.Published OnSept. 26, 2016CreditImage by Doug Mills/The New York TimesHOLT: Well, you just opened the next segment.TRUMP: Well, could I just finish — I think I...(CROSSTALK)HOLT: I’m going to give you a chance right here...TRUMP: I think I should — you go to her website, and you take a look at her website.HOLT: ... with a new 15-minute segment...TRUMP: She’s going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion.HOLT: Mr. Trump, I’m going to...TRUMP: And look at her website. You know what? It’s no difference than this. She’s telling us how to fight ISIS. Just go to her website. She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website. I don’t think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.HOLT: The next segment, we’re continuing...CLINTON: Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS.HOLT: ... achieving prosperity...TRUMP: No, no, you’re telling the enemy everything you want to do.CLINTON: No, we’re not. No, we’re not.TRUMP: See, you’re telling the enemy everything you want to do. No wonder you’ve been fighting — no wonder you’ve been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.CLINTON: That’s a — that’s — go to the — please, fact checkers, get to work.HOLT: OK, you are unpacking a lot here. And we’re still on the issue of achieving prosperity. And I want to talk about taxes. The fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy.Secretary Clinton, you’re calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans. I’d like you to further defend that. And, Mr. Trump, you’re calling for tax cuts for the wealthy. I’d like you to defend that. And this next two-minute answer goes to you, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Well, I’m really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs. They’re going to expand their companies. They’re going to do a tremendous job.I’m getting rid of the carried interest provision. And if you really look, it’s not a tax — it’s really not a great thing for the wealthy. It’s a great thing for the middle class. It’s a great thing for companies to expand.And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they’re going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can’t bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won’t allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what — is so bad.So what they’re doing is they’re leaving our country, and they’re, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country. And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can’t work out a deal to — and everybody agrees it should be brought back.Instead of that, they’re leaving our country to get their money, because they can’t bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can’t get together. Because we have — we have a president that can’t sit them around a table and get them to approve something.And here’s the thing. Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion. I happen to think it’s double that. It’s probably $5 trillion that we can’t bring into our country, Lester. And with a little leadership, you’d get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful.But we have no leadership. And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.HOLT: All right. You have two minutes of the same question to defend tax increases on the wealthiest Americans, Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I’m going to be blamed for everything that’s ever happened.TRUMP: Why not?CLINTON: Why not? Yeah, why not?(LAUGHTER)You know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case...TRUMP: There’s nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country.HOLT: This is — this is Secretary Clinton’s two minutes, please.TRUMP: Yes.CLINTON: Yeah, well, let’s start the clock again, Lester. We’ve looked at your tax proposals. I don’t see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you’re referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that’s stranded overseas. I happen to support that.TRUMP: Then you didn’t read it.CLINTON: I happen to — I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit. But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do. You’ve proposed an approach that has a...TRUMP: Who gave it that name? The first I’ve — who gave it that name?(CROSSTALK)HOLT: Mr. Trump, this is Secretary Clinton’s two minutes.CLINTON: ... $4 billion tax benefit for your family. And when you look at what you are proposing...TRUMP: How much? How much for my family? CLINTON: ... it is...TRUMP: Lester, how much?CLINTON: ... as I said, trumped-up trickle-down. Trickle-down did not work. It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009. Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn’t worked.And a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that. And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.CLINTON: I don’t think top-down works in America. I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their — their debt from college at a lower rate. Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy. Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top.HOLT: Mr. Trump, we’re...TRUMP: Typical politician. All talk, no action. Sounds good, doesn’t work. Never going to happen. Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what’s going on.Now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression. And believe me: We’re in a bubble right now. And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that’s going to come crashing down.We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble. And we better be awfully careful. And we have a Fed that’s doing political things. This Janet Yellen of the Fed. The Fed is doing political — by keeping the interest rates at this level. And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you’re going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job. The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.HOLT: Mr. Trump, we’re talking about the burden that Americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns. And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to — who he owes it to and any business conflicts. Don’t Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest?TRUMP: I don’t mind releasing — I’m under a routine audit. And it’ll be released. And — as soon as the audit’s finished, it will be released.But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have. It shows income — in fact, the income — I just looked today — the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million. If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised.But that’s the kind of thinking that our country needs. When we have a country that’s doing so badly, that’s being ripped off by every single country in the world, it’s the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody — Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year. You know what that is? That means, who’s negotiating these trade deals?We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.HOLT: The IRS says an audit...TRUMP: Excuse me.HOLT: ... of your taxes — you’re perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit. And so the question, does the public’s right to know outweigh your personal...TRUMP: Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit. Look, I’ve been under audit almost for 15 years. I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited. I said, do you get audited? I get audited almost every year.And in a way, I should be complaining. I’m not even complaining. I don’t mind it. It’s almost become a way of life. I get audited by the IRS. But other people don’t.I will say this. We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of. I will release my tax returns — against my lawyer’s wishes — when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted. As soon as she releases them, I will release.(APPLAUSE)I will release my tax returns. And that’s against — my lawyers, they say, “Don’t do it.” I will tell you this. No — in fact, watching shows, they’re reading the papers. Almost every lawyer says, you don’t release your returns until the audit’s complete. When the audit’s complete, I’ll do it. But I would go against them if she releases her e-mails.HOLT: So it’s negotiable?TRUMP: It’s not negotiable, no. Let her release the e-mails. Why did she delete 33,000...HOLT: Well, I’ll let her answer that. But let me just admonish the audience one more time. There was an agreement. We did ask you to be silent, so it would be helpful for us. Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I think you’ve seen another example of bait-and- switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns. You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it. We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you’re under audit.So you’ve got to ask yourself, why won’t he release his tax returns? And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe he’s not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe he’s not as charitable as he claims to be.CLINTON: Third, we don’t know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks. Or maybe he doesn’t want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he’s paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody’s ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn’t pay any federal income tax.TRUMP: That makes me smart.CLINTON: So if he’s paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health. And I think probably he’s not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he’s trying to hide.And the financial disclosure statements, they don’t give you the tax rate. They don’t give you all the details that tax returns would. And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see. And I have no reason to believe that he’s ever going to release his tax returns, because there’s something he’s hiding.And we’ll guess. We’ll keep guessing at what it might be that he’s hiding. But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts? Who does he owe money to? Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.HOLT: He also — he also raised the issue of your e-mails. Do you want to respond to that?CLINTON: I do. You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail. TRUMP: That’s for sure.CLINTON: And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently. But I’m not going to make any excuses. It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.HOLT: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: That was more than a mistake. That was done purposely. OK? That was not a mistake. That was done purposely. When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they’re not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it’s disgraceful. And believe me, this country thinks it’s — really thinks it’s disgraceful, also.As far as my tax returns, you don’t learn that much from tax returns. That I can tell you. You learn a lot from financial disclosure. And you should go down and take a look at that.The other thing, I’m extremely underleveraged. The report that said $650 — which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that’s really not a lot of money. It’s not a lot of money relative to what I had.The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was — actually, it wasn’t even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion. And the $650 isn’t even on that. But it’s not $650. It’s much less than that.But I could give you a list of banks, I would — if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks. These are very fine institutions, very fine banks. I could do that very quickly.I am very underleveraged. I have a great company. I have a tremendous income. And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way. It’s because it’s about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country’s a mess, you know, it’s one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything’s in great shape, our airports. Our airports are like from a third world country.You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible — you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land — we’ve become a third world country.So the worst of all things has happened. We owe $20 trillion, and we’re a mess. We haven’t even started. And we’ve spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw. Whether it’s 6 or 5, but it looks like it’s 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice.And it’s really a shame. And it’s politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem. Our country has tremendous problems. We’re a debtor nation. We’re a serious debtor nation. And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And we don’t have the money, because it’s been squandered on so many of your ideas.HOLT: We’ll let you respond and we’ll move on to the next segment.CLINTON: And maybe because you haven’t paid any federal income tax for a lot of years. (APPLAUSE)And the other thing I think is important...TRUMP: It would be squandered, too, believe me.CLINTON: ... is if your — if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that. You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.And, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald. I’ve met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do.We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses. It’s a beautiful facility. It immediately was put to use. And you wouldn’t pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do...TRUMP: Maybe he didn’t do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work...CLINTON: Well, to...TRUMP: Which our country should do, too.CLINTON: Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them?I can only say that I’m certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you. He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.And when we talk about your business, you’ve taken business bankruptcy six times. There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once. You call yourself the King of Debt. You talk about leverage. You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.TRUMP: Wrong. Wrong.CLINTON: Well, sometimes there’s not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.HOLT: Let’s let Mr. Trump...CLINTON: And we need to be very clear about that.TRUMP: So, yeah, I think — I do think it’s time. Look, it’s all words, it’s all sound bites. I built an unbelievable company. Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places. It’s an unbelievable company.But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there. And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn’t get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.Now, if you want to change the laws, you’ve been there a long time, change the laws. But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I’m running a company. My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. And that’s what I do.But what she doesn’t say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me. I’ll give you an example. We’re just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don’t get there one way, I’m going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.But we’re opening the Old Post Office. Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money. I’m a year ahead of schedule. And that’s what this country should be doing.We build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they’re supposed to cost. We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don’t have people that know what they’re doing.When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy. The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule. And we should be able to do that for our country.HOLT: Well, we’re well behind schedule, so I want to move to our next segment. We move into our next segment talking about America’s direction. And let’s start by talking about race.The share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it’s been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings of African-Americans by police, as we’ve seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa. Race has been a big issue in this campaign, and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap.So how do you heal the divide? Secretary Clinton, you get two minutes on this.CLINTON: Well, you’re right. Race remains a significant challenge in our country. Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they’re treated in the criminal justice system. We’ve just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.And we’ve got to do several things at the same time. We have to restore trust between communities and the police. We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they’re well prepared to use force only when necessary. Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.CLINTON: Right now, that’s not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods. So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform. I’ve laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform. So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal. And we’ve got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together. So we have to do two things, as I said. We have to restore trust. We have to work with the police. We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them. And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we’re seeing today.HOLT: All right, Mr. Trump, you have two minutes. How do you heal the divide?TRUMP: Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn’t want to use a couple of words, and that’s law and order. And we need law and order. If we don’t have it, we’re not going to have a country.And when I look at what’s going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what’s going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it’s — I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long — we need law and order in our country.I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just — just came in. We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very — I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he’ll because it’s so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot.In Chicago, they’ve had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st. Thousands of shootings. And I’m saying, where is this? Is this a war-torn country? What are we doing? And we have to stop the violence. We have to bring back law and order. In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over — almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed. We have to bring back law and order.Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York. It brought the crime rate way down. But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn’t be having it.We have gangs roaming the street. And in many cases, they’re illegally here, illegal immigrants. And they have guns. And they shoot people. And we have to be very strong. And we have to be very vigilant.Sept. 26, 2016We have to be — we have to know what we’re doing. Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything. We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.HOLT: Your two — your two minutes expired, but I do want to follow up. Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men.TRUMP: No, you’re wrong. It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her. And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it’s allowed.HOLT: The argument is that it’s a form of racial profiling.TRUMP: No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn’t have them.These are felons. These are people that are bad people that shouldn’t be — when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.You need more police. You need a better community, you know, relation. You don’t have good community relations in Chicago. It’s terrible. I have property there. It’s terrible what’s going on in Chicago.But when you look — and Chicago’s not the only — you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places. You need better relationships. I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.TRUMP: You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it’s not good.But you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently. So there’s some bad things going on. Some really bad things.HOLT: Secretary Clinton...TRUMP: But we need — Lester, we need law and order. And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what’s happening are African-American and Hispanic people. And it’s very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.HOLT: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I’ve heard — I’ve heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it’s really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country.TRUMP: Ugh.CLINTON: You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids. There’s a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe. There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective. Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective. It did not do what it needed to do.Now, I believe in community policing. And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991. Property crime is down 40 percent. We just don’t want to see it creep back up. We’ve had 25 years of very good cooperation.But there were some problems, some unintended consequences. Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses. And it’s just a fact that if you’re a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated. So we’ve got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system. We cannot just say law and order. We have to say — we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.We need to have more second chance programs. I’m glad that we’re ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system. You shouldn’t have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans. So there are some positive ways we can work on this.And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us. Right now — and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby — right now, we’ve got too many military- style weapons on the streets. In a lot of places, our police are outgunned. We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who’s on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country. If you’re too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun. So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.HOLT: Secretary Clinton, last week, you said we’ve got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias. Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people?CLINTON: Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police. I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other. And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.I’ve met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago. They admit it’s an issue. They’ve got a lot of concerns. Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.CLINTON: They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance. And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.HOLT: Mr. Trump...TRUMP: I’d like to respond to that.HOLT: Please.TRUMP: First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists. I agree with you. When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I’m very proud of. These are very, very good people, and they’re protecting the Second Amendment.But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists. And when people are on there, even if they shouldn’t be on there, we’ll help them, we’ll help them legally, we’ll help them get off. But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth. And that’s a term that I think was a — it’s — it’s been horribly met, as you know. I think you’ve apologized for it. But I think it was a terrible thing to say.And when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you’re talking about takes guns away. Well, I’m talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them. And I don’t think — I really don’t think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.I think maybe there’s a political reason why you can’t say it, but I really don’t believe — in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders. Five hundred murders is a lot of murders. It’s hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?But we went from 2,200 to 500. And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg. And it was terminated by current mayor. But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact.CLINTON: Well, it’s also fair to say, if we’re going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders. So there is...TRUMP: No, you’re wrong. You’re wrong.CLINTON: No, I’m not.TRUMP: Murders are up. All right. You check it.CLINTON: New York — New York has done an excellent job. And I give credit — I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked. And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well.Look, one murder is too many. But it is important that we learn about what has been effective. And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want. Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?But let’s also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods. And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.HOLT: This conversation is about race. And so, Mr. Trump, I have to ask you for five...TRUMP: I’d like to just respond, if I might.HOLT: Please — 20 seconds.TRUMP: I’d just like to respond.HOLT: Please respond, then I’ve got a quick follow-up for you.TRUMP: I will. Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians. They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I’ll see you in four years.The African-American community — because — look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated. They’ve been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that’s what it is. They’ve controlled these communities for up to 100 years.HOLT: Mr. Trump, let me...(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: Well, I — I do think...TRUMP: And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities — and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just — you know, you’ve seen me, I’ve been all over the place. You decided to stay home, and that’s OK. But I will tell you, I’ve been all over. And I’ve met some of the greatest people I’ll ever meet within these communities. And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.HOLT: Mr. Trump, I...CLINTON: I think — I think — I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that’s a good thing.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Mr. Trump, for five years, you perpetuated a false claim that the nation’s first black president was not a natural-born citizen. You questioned his legitimacy. In the last couple of weeks, you acknowledged what most Americans have accepted for years: The president was born in the United States. Can you tell us what took you so long?TRUMP: I’ll tell you very — well, just very simple to say. Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close — very close friend of Secretary Clinton. And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to — during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard. And you can go look it up, and you can check it out.TRUMP: And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened. Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it. They were pressing it very hard. She failed to get the birth certificate.When I got involved, I didn’t fail. I got him to give the birth certificate. So I’m satisfied with it. And I’ll tell you why I’m satisfied with it.HOLT: That was...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.HOLT: I will let you respond. It’s important. But I just want to get the answer here. The birth certificate was produced in 2011. You’ve continued to tell the story and question the president’s legitimacy in 2012, ’13, ’14, ’15...TRUMP: Yeah.HOLT: .... as recently as January. So the question is, what changed your mind?TRUMP: Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it. I figured you’d ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate. And I think I did a good job.Secretary Clinton also fought it. I mean, you know — now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that’s not true. Look, it’s true. Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter — you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager. And she was involved. But just like she can’t bring back jobs, she can’t produce.HOLT: I’m sorry. I’m just going to follow up — and I will let you respond to that, because there’s a lot there. But we’re talking about racial healing in this segment. What do you say to Americans, people of color who...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Well, it was very — I say nothing. I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it. He should have produced it a long time before. I say nothing.But let me just tell you. When you talk about healing, I think that I’ve developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community. I think you can see that.And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion. And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.HOLT: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, just listen to what you heard.(LAUGHTER)And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.But it can’t be dismissed that easily. He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen. There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy. He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. And the birther lie was a very hurtful one. You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity. And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high. And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump’s best efforts to bring him down.HOLT: Mr. Trump, you can respond and we’re going to move on to the next segment.TRUMP: I would love to respond. First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama. You treated him with terrible disrespect. And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are. It doesn’t work that way. You were after him, you were trying to — you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures. I don’t think you can deny that.But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true. So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn’t work. It really doesn’t.Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father’s company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country — it was a federal lawsuit — were sued. We settled the suit with zero — with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do.TRUMP: I notice you bring that up a lot. And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don’t do on you. Maybe I’m trying to save the money.But, frankly, I look — I look at that, and I say, isn’t that amazing? Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it’s just one of those things.I’ll go one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. And it’s a tremendously successful club. And I’m so glad I did it. And I have been given great credit for what I did. And I’m very, very proud of it. And that’s the way I feel. That is the true way I feel.HOLT: Our next segment is called “Securing America.” We want to start with a 21st century war happening every day in this country. Our institutions are under cyber attack, and our secrets are being stolen. So my question is, who’s behind it? And how do we fight it?Secretary Clinton, this answer goes to you.CLINTON: Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we’re facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries. There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money.But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states. The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia. There’s no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this. I know Donald’s very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really...(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: ... tough, long game here. And one of the things he’s done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee. And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information. We need to make it very clear — whether it’s Russia, China, Iran or anybody else — the United States has much greater capacity. And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information.And we’re going to have to make it clear that we don’t want to use the kinds of tools that we have. We don’t want to engage in a different kind of warfare. But we will defend the citizens of this country.And the Russians need to understand that. I think they’ve been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do. And that’s why I was so — I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans. That is just unacceptable. It’s one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information — in administrations...HOLT: Your two minutes have expired.CLINTON: ... have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief. It’s comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.HOLT: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes and the same question. Who’s behind it? And how do we fight it?TRUMP: I do want to say that I was just endorsed — and more are coming next week — it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here — admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country. That just happened, and many more are coming. And I’m very proud of it.In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE. They’ve never endorsed anybody before on immigration. I was just endorsed by ICE. I was just recently endorsed — 16,500 Border Patrol agents.So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I’ll take the admirals and I’ll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge. OK? Because look at the mess that we’re in. Look at the mess that we’re in.As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said. We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we’re not. I don’t think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. She’s saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don’t — maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?TRUMP: You don’t know who broke in to DNC.But what did we learn with DNC? We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Look what happened to her. But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of. That’s what we learned.Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don’t know, because the truth is, under President Obama we’ve lost control of things that we used to have control over.We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they’re beating us at our own game. ISIS.So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is — it is a huge problem. I have a son. He’s 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it’s unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it’s hardly doable.But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. But that’s true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.HOLT: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing. I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS. It does involve going after them online. I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere.But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate.We’re making progress. Our military is assisting in Iraq. And we’re hoping that within the year we’ll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they’ve had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership. I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden. And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles. Because we’ve got to defeat ISIS, and we’ve got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.HOLT: You mention ISIS, and we think of ISIS certainly as over there, but there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando. I’ll ask this to both of you. Tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump?TRUMP: Well, first I have to say one thing, very important. Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS. “We will take out ISIS.” Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out — what, they shouldn’t have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster. And ISIS was formed.So she talks about taking them out. She’s been doing it a long time. She’s been trying to take them out for a long time. But they wouldn’t have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that. And then you wouldn’t have had them.Or, as I’ve been saying for a long time, and I think you’ll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil — and we should have taken the oil — ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income. And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil — a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.HOLT: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard. Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.TRUMP: Wrong.CLINTON: That is absolutely proved over and over again.TRUMP: Wrong. Wrong.CLINTON: He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.CLINTON: But the larger point — and he says this constantly — is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama.And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.But let’s talk about the question you asked, Lester. The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States? That’s the most important part of this. How do we prevent attacks? How do we protect our people?And I think we’ve got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information. I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey. You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami. And they brought him down. And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.So we’ve got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East. That means we’ve got to work more closely with our allies, and that’s something that Donald has been very dismissive of.We’re working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism. We’re working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations. Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community.They’re on the front lines. They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else. They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald’s rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.HOLT: Mr. Trump...TRUMP: Well, I have to respond.HOLT: Please respond. TRUMP: The secretary said very strongly about working with — we’ve been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone’s ever seen. You look at the Middle East, it’s a total mess. Under your direction, to a large extent.But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that’s another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly. They were choking on the sanctions. And now they’re going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they’re going.But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO? And you have to understand, I’m a businessperson. I did really well. But I have common sense. And I said, well, I’ll tell you. I haven’t given lots of thought to NATO. But two things.Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren’t paying their fair share. Number two — and that bothers me, because we should be asking — we’re defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they’re supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because — and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest — but I said, they do not focus on terror. And I was very strong. And I said it numerous times.And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division. And I think that’s great. And I think we should get — because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO. It’s a lot of money to protect other people. But I’m all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also.And they’re going to do that. And that was — believe me — I’m sure I’m not going to get credit for it — but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton. And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops. Not only that, you named the day. They couldn’t believe it. They sat back probably and said, I can’t believe it. They said...CLINTON: Lester, we’ve covered...TRUMP: No, wait a minute.CLINTON: We’ve covered this ground.TRUMP: When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened. It should have never happened. Now, you’re talking about taking out ISIS. But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant. Now it’s in over 30 countries. And you’re going to stop them? I don’t think so.HOLT: Mr. Trump, a lot of these are judgment questions. You had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion. What makes your...TRUMP: I did not support the war in Iraq.HOLT: In 2002...TRUMP: That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she — frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.HOLT: My question is, since you supported it...TRUMP: Just — would you like to hear...HOLT: ... why is your — why is your judgment...TRUMP: Wait a minute. I was against the war in Iraq. Just so you put it out.HOLT: The record shows otherwise, but why — why was...TRUMP: The record does not show that.HOLT: Why was — is your judgment any...TRUMP: The record shows that I’m right. When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone’s asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don’t know, maybe, who knows? Essentially. I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto. We talked about the economy is more important. I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity. I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox. And Sean Hannity said — and he called me the other day — and I spoke to him about it — he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war.HOLT: Why is your judgment better than...TRUMP: And when he — excuse me. And that was before the war started. Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people — he’s willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him. I was against the war. He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war.And I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there. But nobody called Sean Hannity. And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started. I think in ’04. But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq.And one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely — because if you read this article, there’s no doubt. But if somebody — and I’ll ask the press — if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started. He and I used to have arguments about the war. I said, it’s a terrible and a stupid thing. It’s going to destabilize the Middle East. And that’s exactly what it’s done. It’s been a disaster.HOLT: My reference was to what you had said in 2002, and my question was...TRUMP: No, no. You didn’t hear what I said.HOLT: Why is your judgment — why is your judgment any different than Mrs. Clinton’s judgment?TRUMP: Well, I have much better judgment than she does. There’s no question about that. I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?(LAUGHTER)I have a much better — she spent — let me tell you — she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising — you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names — oh, temperament, let’s go after — I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament. I have a winning temperament. I know how to win. She does not have a...HOLT: Secretary Clinton?TRUMP: Wait. The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don’t know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control. I said, there’s a person with a temperament that’s got a problem.HOLT: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Whew, OK.(LAUGHTER)Let’s talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO. You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all. And you know the only time it’s ever been invoked? After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb. They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration. They had built covert facilities. They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away.And we had sanctioned them. I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn’t enough. So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran.And we did drive them to the negotiating table. And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran’s nuclear program without firing a single shot. That’s diplomacy. That’s coalition-building. That’s working with other nations.The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship. He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I’d blow them out of the water and start another war. That’s not good judgment.TRUMP: That would not start a war.CLINTON: That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted. And the worst part...TRUMP: No, they were taunting us.CLINTON: ... of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons. He has said repeatedly that he didn’t care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons. He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that’s fine...TRUMP: Wrong.CLINTON: ... have a good time, folks.TRUMP: It’s lies.CLINTON: And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling. That is the number-one threat we face in the world. And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material. So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.TRUMP: That line’s getting a little bit old, I must say. I would like to...CLINTON: It’s a good one, though. It well describes the problem.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: It’s not an accurate one at all. It’s not an accurate one. So I just want to give a lot of things — and just to respond. I agree with her on one thing. The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your — your president thinks.Nuclear is the single greatest threat. Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries. They do not pay us. But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we’re losing a fortune. That’s why we’re losing — we’re losing — we lose on everything. I say, who makes these — we lose on everything. All I said, that it’s very possible that if they don’t pay a fair share, because this isn’t 40 years ago where we could do what we’re doing. We can’t defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million...HOLT: We need to move on.TRUMP: Well, wait, but it’s very important. All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out. We’re a country that owes $20 trillion. They have to help us out.HOLT: Our last...TRUMP: As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree. It is the single greatest threat that this country has.HOLT: Which leads to my next question, as we enter our last segment here (inaudible) the subject of securing America. On nuclear weapons, President Obama reportedly considered changing the nation’s longstanding policy on first use. Do you support the current policy? Mr. Trump, you have two minutes on that.TRUMP: Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she’s very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. But Russia has been expanding their — they have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint.I looked the other night. I was seeing B-52s, they’re old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them. We are not — we are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do first strike.I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it’s over. At the same time, we have to be prepared. I can’t take anything off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we’re doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I’ve ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal. Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. Iran has power over North Korea.And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea. And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn’t you do that? Why didn’t you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. Nobody’s ever seen that before. That turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages. It certainly looks that way.So you say to yourself, why didn’t they make the right deal? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history. The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems. All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don’t have to do much.HOLT: Your two minutes is expired.TRUMP: And they’re going to end up getting nuclear. I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day. Believe me, he’s not a happy camper.HOLT: All right. Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.CLINTON: Well, let me — let me start by saying, words matter. Words matter when you run for president. And they really matter when you are president. And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them.It is essential that America’s word be good. And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe. I’ve talked with a number of them. But I want to — on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good.It’s also important that we look at the entire global situation. There’s no doubt that we have other problems with Iran. But personally, I’d rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that.And Donald never tells you what he would do. Would he have started a war? Would he have bombed Iran? If he’s going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be. But it’s like his plan to defeat ISIS. He says it’s a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan.So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues. People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do. Can they rely on us? Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values? That’s what I intend to do. I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they’re abroad or at home.We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...HOLT: Your two minutes is...CLINTON: ... to be given any opportunities at all.HOLT: ... is expired.TRUMP: Lester, one thing I’d like to say.HOLT: Very quickly. Twenty seconds.TRUMP: I will go very quickly. But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place. Right now, it’s getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they’re in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.HOLT: Mr. Trump...TRUMP: And it’s a big problem. And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars. We cannot be the policemen of the world. We cannot protect countries all over the world...HOLT: We have just...TRUMP: ... where they’re not paying us what we need.HOLT: We have just a few final questions...TRUMP: And she doesn’t say that, because she’s got no business ability. We need heart. We need a lot of things. But you have to have some basic ability. And sadly, she doesn’t have that. All of the things that she’s talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let’s say, while she had great power. But they weren’t taken care of. And if she ever wins this race, they won’t be taken care of.HOLT: Mr. Trump, this year Secretary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party. Earlier this month, you said she doesn’t have, quote, “a presidential look.” She’s standing here right now. What did you mean by that?TRUMP: She doesn’t have the look. She doesn’t have the stamina. I said she doesn’t have the stamina. And I don’t believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.HOLT: The quote was, “I just don’t think she has the presidential look.”TRUMP: You have — wait a minute. Wait a minute, Lester. You asked me a question. Did you ask me a question?You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals. You have to be able to negotiate, that’s right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia. I mean, can you imagine, we’re defending Saudi Arabia? And with all of the money they have, we’re defending them, and they’re not paying? All you have to do is speak to them. Wait. You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don’t believe that Hillary has the stamina.HOLT: Let’s let her respond. CLINTON: Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: The world — let me tell you. Let me tell you. Hillary has experience, but it’s bad experience. We have made so many bad deals during the last — so she’s got experience, that I agree.(APPLAUSE)But it’s bad, bad experience. Whether it’s the Iran deal that you’re so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it’s the Iran deal, whether it’s anything you can — name — you almost can’t name a good deal. I agree. She’s got experience, but it’s bad experience. And this country can’t afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.HOLT: We are at — we are at the final question.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well, one thing. One thing, Lester.HOLT: Very quickly, because we’re at the final question now.CLINTON: You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina. But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said...TRUMP: I never said that.CLINTON: .... women don’t deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.TRUMP: I didn’t say that.CLINTON: And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman “Miss Piggy.” Then he called her “Miss Housekeeping,” because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name.TRUMP: Where did you find this? Where did you find this?CLINTON: Her name is Alicia Machado.TRUMP: Where did you find this?CLINTON: And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet...TRUMP: Oh, really? CLINTON: ... she’s going to vote this November.TRUMP: OK, good. Let me just tell you...(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Mr. Trump, could we just take 10 seconds and then we ask the final question...TRUMP: You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials. Some of it’s said in entertainment. Some of it’s said — somebody who’s been very vicious to me, Rosie O’Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.But you want to know the truth? I was going to say something...HOLT: Please very quickly.TRUMP: ... extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, “I can’t do it. I just can’t do it. It’s inappropriate. It’s not nice.” But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue. They’re untrue. And they’re misrepresentations.And I will tell you this, Lester: It’s not nice. And I don’t deserve that.But it’s certainly not a nice thing that she’s done. It’s hundreds of millions of ads. And the only gratifying thing is, I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money...HOLT: We have to move on to the final question.TRUMP: ... $200 million is spent, and I’m either winning or tied, and I’ve spent practically nothing.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: One of you will not win this election. So my final question to you tonight, are you willing to accept the outcome as the will of the voters? Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I support our democracy. And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. But I certainly will support the outcome of this election.And I know Donald’s trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope the people out there understand: This election’s really up to you. It’s not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want. So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does.HOLT: Mr. Trump, very quickly, same question. Will you accept the outcome as the will of the voters? TRUMP: I want to make America great again. We are a nation that is seriously troubled. We’re losing our jobs. People are pouring into our country.The other day, we were deporting 800 people. And perhaps they passed the wrong button, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption, but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens. Ended up becoming citizens. And it was 800. And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don’t even know.HOLT: Will you accept the outcome of the election?TRUMP: Look, here’s the story. I want to make America great again. I’m going to be able to do it. I don’t believe Hillary will. The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: All right. Well, that is going to do it for us. That concludes our debate for this evening, a spirit one. We covered a lot of ground, not everything as I suspected we would.The next presidential debates are scheduled for October 9th at Washington University in St. Louis and October 19th at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. The conversation will continue.A reminder. The vice presidential debate is scheduled for October 4th at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. My thanks to Hillary Clinton and to Donald Trump and to Hofstra University for hosting us tonight.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/woman-gives-birth-to-puppies/	a south african woman gave birth to puppies after having sex with the family dog.	False	['bestiality', ' empire news', ' fake news', ' now8news']	http://now8news.com/	http://now8news.com/woman-gives-birth-puppies-western-cape-sex-family-dog/	2017/04/18	Posted By: Now8NewsDoctors at a Western Cape private hospital were surprised to see Kedder go into labor, as she didn’t know she was pregnant.“It was even more of a shock when three tiny puppies came out instead of a baby,” said Dr. Brown of the Medical Center where Kedder gave birth to her ‘puppies’. “To be honest, we didn’t know this was possible. It’s both a marvel of modern medicine and extremely disturbing at the same time.”Kedder admits that while she was recently living at home, she would often have sex with the family dog, Jonsey, because she couldn’t find a date.It all started when my parents moved to a new place while we were still based in Germany. I lost my job, and my boyfriend dumped me too,” said Kedder. “I didn’t have time to meet any new guys while I was applying for jobs, so I would sometimes have sex with Jonsey our dog, just to relieve myself of too much stress. I don’t think it was wrong. He’s a big dog, and he wasn’t hurt by it. In fact, he really seemed to like it. I know I did. And besides, back in our country having sex with an animal is not a crime, and I don’t giving birth to an animal would either be a crime here provided the act wasn’t committed in this country,” she said.According to Dr. Brown, Kedder’s birth is the first on record for an inter-species relationship. “This opens up a lot of doors in science and medicine that we thought were closed,” said Dr. Brown. “The fact that her eggs were able to be implanted by canine sperm, it’s just, well it’s just amazing. Still really, really gross, but definitely amazing.”While it a crime to have sex with an animal in South Africa, however in Germany it is not a crime at all. A 2013 report from the Daily Mail News warned that bestiality brothels are spreading throughout Germany. The sam way you hire a prostitute here, is the same way you hire any animal for sex in German.People are calling it a “lifestyle choice” when wanting to commit to having relations with animals. The bestiality brothels are referred to as “erotic zoos.”Bestiality brothels are raging through Germany because of a law that makes animal x-rated films illegal, but sex with animals is still okay.In one case, a German farmer noticed that his flock of sheep started to shy away from human contact. So he added cameras and found that during the evenings, men were sneaking onto his land to have sex with his animals.		1

True	['freakish fatalities']	http://www.csmonitor.com/	http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2016/1129/Scientists-finally-decode-the-Great-Molasses-Flood-of-1919	2008/12/27	"First LookScientists finally decode the Great Molasses Flood of 1919Nearly 100 years later, scientists have determined what exactly made Boston's 1919 molasses flood so deadly: the cold. By Gretel Kauffman, StaffNovember 29, 2016The ruins of tanks containing 2 1/2 million gallons of molasses lie in a heap after the dramatic collapse that hurled trucks against buildings and crumpled houses in the North End of Boston on Jan. 15, 1919.AP/FileView CaptionofAfter nearly one hundred years, scientists have come up with an explanation for one of history's strangest disasters: the Great Molasses Flood of 1919. The deadly 25-foot wave of molasses that flowed through Boston's North End, flattening buildings in its wake, may sound like a scenario in a science fiction movie – but for the 21 people killed and 150 injured in the flood, the nightmarish scene was very real. ""Molasses, waist deep, covered the street and swirled and bubbled about the wreckage ... Here and there struggled a form‍ – whether it was animal or human being was impossible to tell,"" the Boston Post reported at the time. ""Only an upheaval, a thrashing about in the sticky mass, showed where any life was ... Horses died like so many flies on sticky fly-paper. The more they struggled, the deeper in the mess they were ensnared. Human beings‍ – men and women‍ – suffered likewise."" Recommended: Opinion 4 ways to prevent natural disasters from becoming human tragediesBut how, exactly, did the sticky, sweet substance commonly found in cookies turn so deadly? That's the question researchers set out to answer in a new study presented last week at the annual meeting of the American Physical Society's Division of Fluid Dynamics in Portland, Ore. Photos of the Day Photos of the day 05/05The flood began shortly after 12:40 pm local time on Jan. 15, 1919, when a giant storage tank – 50 feet tall and 90 feet wide – collapsed on Boston's waterfront at the Purity Distilling Co., releasing more than 2.3 million gallons of molasses into Boston's North End. The wave moved through the neighborhood at more than 50 feet per second. To explore the physics behind the flood – how it moved so quickly and caused so much damage – researchers combed hundreds of pages of historical accounts and contemporary newspaper articles, studied century-old maps of buildings in the area, and requested historic data from the National Weather Service. The scientists also studied the properties of blackstrap molasses, particularly how its rate of flow is affected by temperature. They found that the substance's viscosity, or the degree to which it resists flowing, depends largely on temperature. ""Temperatures dipped just below freezing the night following the accident,"" aerospace engineer and fluid dynamicist Nicole Sharp, lead author of the study, told Live Science. ""Based on our data, it's possible the viscosity of the molasses increased by a factor of four or more due to that drop in temperature. That does not sound like such a big difference, but the high viscosity of the molasses was a major factor for rescue work."" If the tank had collapsed in warmer weather, the molasses would have been more like honey than tar, and would have "" flowed farther, but also thinner ,"" reducing the number of people who became fatally stuck, said Shmuel M. Rubinstein, a Harvard University professor whose students investigated the disaster, according to The New York Times.About half of the victims of the flood, he added, ""died basically because they were stuck."" The original cause of the deadly disaster, which has remained a mystery for the past century, was explored in another study published last year. Ronald Mayville, a senior structural and metallurgical engineer with Simpson, Gumpertz & Heger in Waltham, Mass., concluded that several design flaws had contributed to the tank's collapse.The walls of the tank, Mr. Mayville argued, were too thin to hold 2.3 million gallons of molasses and made from a low-manganese steel susceptible to fracture – the same type of steel, coincidentally, used on the Titanic. ""The steel conformed to the standards of the time,"" Mayville told the Boston Globe. ""But now it’s known you need to have a higher ratio."" Next up"		1

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/health-concerns/	statement reproduces president obama's response regarding opposition to his veterans' health insurance plan. see example( s )	False	['barack obama', ' health insurance', ' veterans']	http://web.archive.org/	http://web.archive.org/web/20100417053314/http://www.azconservative.org/Semmens188.htm	2012/04/09	"JOHN SEMMENS: Semi-News -- A Satirical Look at Recent News Obama Scraps Idea of Billing Vets for Service-Related InjuriesMarch 21, 2009Bad press, including major mockery of the plan by comedian Jon Stewart, led to President Obama abandoning his proposal to require veterans’ private health insurance to cover the estimated $540 million annual cost to the federal government of treatment for injuries to military personnel received during their tours on active duty.The President admitted that he was puzzled by the magnitude of the opposition to his proposal. “Look, it’s an all volunteer force,” Obama complained. “Nobody made these guys go to war. They had to have known and accepted the risks. Now they whine about bearing the costs of their choice? It doesn’t compute.”“I thought these were people who were proud to sacrifice for their country,” Obama continued. “I wasn’t asking for blood—just money. With the country facing the worst financial crisis in its history, I’d have thought that the patriotic thing to do would be to try to help reduce the nation’s deficit. I guess I underestimated the selfishness of some of my fellow Americans.”President Urges Citizenship for Illegal ImmigrantsIn a meeting with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, President Barack Obama called on congress to enact legislation that would lead to citizenship status for heretofore illegal immigrants, calling it “simple common sense.”“They won’t be illegals if we make them citizens,” Obama argued. “The problem of substandard wages would be ended. Employers wouldn’t be able to abuse these undocumented workers like they do now. Human rights would be protected.”The President also cited other benefits as an unappreciated gain. “Many of these migrants perish in difficult treks under harsh climatic conditions,” Obama said. “If we open the borders, those wanting to enter this country won’t have to endure this risk. In addition, immigrants will provide a robust augmentation of our population, strengthening American democracy.”In related news, Obama advised out-of-work Americans to “take a page out of the hard-working Latinos’ book. These undocumented workers always seem to find jobs. You know, an off-the-books job might not be so bad. You get paid in cash. You don’t have to file an income tax. You get to keep every dollar you earn.”Many Gitmo Prisoners to Be Released in the USAttorney General Eric Holder said that Gitmo detainees requesting to be released into the United States will likely have their request honored.“Many of these men have lost years of their lives rotting in prison,” Holder said. “The Bush Administration has committed a grave injustice against them. We owe it to them to try to set things right. A number of them said that they were on their way to the United States on important and confidential business when their journeys were interrupted. Assisting them in completing their interrupted business seems only fair.”Holder said that in addition to airline tickets to their destinations of choice, the releasees would “potentially be eligible for a share of ‘stimulus money,’ as compensation for income foregone during their incarceration and to help ensure they won’t become ‘public charges.’”In related news, in an effort to divert America from the “politics of fear practiced by the Bush Administration,” Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Nipplitaliano has banned her staff from describing bombings, shootings, and beheadings carried out by Islamic extremists as “acts of terror.” Henceforth, these attacks are to be known as “man-caused disasters.”Legislation Cracking Down on Unauthorized Food Sales ProposedRepresentative Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn) has introduced the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2009. Her bill calls for the creation of a Food Safety Administration that would regulate food production and distribution at all levels.DeLauro characterized the bill as “a necessary codicil to a comprehensive national health policy. If the government is going to bear the expense of insuring that everyone has health care, then we need to deal with all the potential sources of illness.”The congresswoman cautioned against “assuming that you can ‘fly under the radar’ just because you are operating outside the normal channels of commerce. Roadside fruit vendors, church bake sales and kids’ lemonade stands won’t be exempt. No one has the right to inflict salmonella and e-coli on their neighbors.”If the legislation passes, those wishing to sell food would be required to purchase government licenses and submit to regular inspections. Those failing to comply with the new regulations could be penalized by having their property seized, be fined up to $1 million per offense and/or be sentenced to spend time in jail.FBI Adds “Constitution Defenders” to Terrorist Watch ListThe Federal Bureau of Investigation has added “Constitution defenders” to its list of dangers that require monitoring and surveillance. Examples of other dangerous elements according to the FBI include the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis, and tax protestors.“We can’t afford to wait until something bad happens before we take notice of people who may pose a danger,” declared Attorney General Eric Holder. “We have to consider the subtle indicators of potential enemies of the state.”“‘Constitution defenders’ includes a broad category of persons deemed apt to present a danger,” Holder contended. “I mean, no normal person pays so much attention to the Constitution. The repeated mention of the Constitution in letters, conversations, blogs and such is, in my opinion, a marker of a potentially unbalanced mind. Keeping an eye on these people is a warranted precaution.”Press Secretary Explains President’s “Apparent” Special Olympics GaffeIn his history-making appearance on the Tonight Show, President Barack Obama stunned the nation with his offhand crack “I bowl like one of those retards in the Special Olympics.”During last Fall’s presidential race, Obama inspired titters by scoring a 37 in a bowling match in Pennsylvania. He says, though, that he’s been practicing in the White House alley and has recently scored as high as 129 in a single game.Press Secretary Robert Gibbs asked that Americans “show some class by not mocking the President’s lack of skills or his choice of words in describing them. The President has had to overcome some serious handicaps and adversities to rise as high as he has in the world. No Special Olympian has achieved as much as he has.”Gibbs said that the challenge to a “bowl-off” that Obama has received from the cognitively impaired Kolan McConiughey “vindicates the President’s humility about his bowling abilities. That a Special Olympian like Mr. McConiughey would offer to bowl with the President validates the President’s perception of where he stands vis à vis the competition.”McConiughey, is said to have an IQ of around 50 and a bowling average of 212 a game.President Seeks Authority to Seize Troublesome CompaniesSmarting from public criticism over how his administration handled the AIG bailout and bonus scandal, President Obama is requesting that congress empower him to seize control of firms in order to protect the public interest. The proposed legislation would establish a new “Resolution Authority” with powers similar to those possessed by the FDIC, but not restricted to just banks.“If embarrassments like those presented by AIG are to be avoided in the future, the government needs broad authority to take preemptive action before things get out of hand,” Obama told reporters. “The credibility of my administration, indeed, the entire government itself, is at stake. The confidence the American people have my message of hope and change must not be allowed to waver due to a lack of sufficient tools at my disposal.”“We need to ensure that the appropriate use of the country’s resources is attained,” Obama declared. “Are the right people receiving the appropriate compensation? Are the assets being used in the best interests of the people? The answers to these questions cannot be left to an unconstrained free market. The government has an obligation to see to it that businesses exercise an adequate measure of social responsibility.”Under the legislation, a finding of “public necessity” by the governing board of the Resolution Authority would trigger federal seizure of any businesses or assets deemed essential to protect the public interest.John Semmens got his start writing about politics for his college newspaper. Since then, he has written more than 600 articles that have been published. In addition to ""Semi-News,"" John's opinion pieces have appeared in many newspapers around the country--including the Wall Street Journal, Washington Times, and many others."		1

The Democratic Party and their convention have been roiled by an email controversy. Hacked emails published by Wikileaks appeared to show some in the Democratic National Committee favoring Hillary Clinton, a charge leveled throughout the presidential primaries but which party leader Debbie Wasserman Schultz had denied. But the email scandal led to her ouster on Monday — she had been supposed to gavel in the convention on Monday, but did not do so. Even Sanders was booed at an event Monday, when he told supporters it was in the country's best interest to elect Clinton president."		1

The announcement will take place at an event at HHS headquarters from 10:30 a.m. to noon. It will be livestreamed here . Speakers will include Acting Secretary Eric D. Hargan, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Representative Vicky Hartzler, Senator James Lankford, OCR Director Roger Severino, and special guests.The Conscience and Religious Freedom Division has been established to restore federal enforcement of our nation’s laws that protect the fundamental and unalienable rights of conscience and religious freedom. OCR is the law enforcement agency within HHS that enforces federal laws protecting civil rights and conscience in health and human services, and the security and privacy of people’s health information. The creation of the new division will provide HHS with the focus it needs to more vigorously and effectively enforce existing laws protecting the rights of conscience and religious freedom, the first freedom protected in the Bill of Rights.OCR already has enforcement authority over federal conscience protection statutes, such as the Church, Coats-Snowe, and Weldon Amendments; Section 1553 of the Affordable Care Act (on assisted suicide); and certain federal nondiscrimination laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of religion in a variety of HHS programs. OCR Director Severino said, “Laws protecting religious freedom and conscience rights are just empty words on paper if they aren’t enforced. No one should be forced to choose between helping sick people and living by one’s deepest moral or religious convictions, and the new division will help guarantee that victims of unlawful discrimination find justice. For too long, governments big and small have treated conscience claims with hostility instead of protection, but change is coming and it begins here and now.”Acting HHS Secretary Hargan said, “President Trump promised the American people that his administration would vigorously uphold the rights of conscience and religious freedom. That promise is being kept today. The Founding Fathers knew that a nation that respects conscience rights is more diverse and more free, and OCR’s new division will help make that vision a reality.”To learn more about the new Conscience and Religious Freedom Division, visit us at www.hhs.gov/conscience .To file a complaint with OCR based on a violation of civil rights, conscience or religious freedom, or health information privacy, visit us at https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/complaints .OCR Announces New Conscience and Religious Freedom Division.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/megalodon-the-monster-shark-lives/	a megalodon capsized a south african charter vessel in april 2013.	False	['sharks']	http://dinosaurs.about.com/	http://dinosaurs.about.com/od/otherprehistoriclife/a/megalodon-facts.htm	2014/08/19	"10 Interesting Facts About MegalodonSearch the siteby Bob StraussUpdated October 13, 2017Not only was Megalodon the biggest prehistoric shark that ever lived; it was the largest marine predator in the history of the planet, vastly outweighing both the modern Great White Shark and ancient reptiles like Liopleurodon and Kronosaurus. Below you'll find 10 fascinating facts about Megalodon. 01Megalodon Grew Up to 60 Feet LongRICHARD BIZLEY/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY/Getty ImagesSince Megalodon is known by thousands of fossilized teeth but only a few scattered bones, its exact size has been a matter of contentious debate. Over the past century, paleontologists have come up with estimates (based mainly on tooth size and analogy with modern Great White Sharks) ranging from 40 to 100 feet from head to tail, but the consensus today is that adults were 55 to 60 feet long and weighed as much as 50 to 75 tons--and some superannuated individuals may have been even bigger. (See 10 Things Megalodon Could Swallow Whole .) 02Megalodon Liked to Munch on Giant WhalesCorey Ford/Stocktrek Images/Getty ImagesMegalodon had a diet befitting an apex predator, feasting on the prehistoric whales that swam the earth's oceans during the Pliocene and Miocene epochs, but also chowing down on dolphins, squids, fish, and even giant turtles (whose equally giant shells, as tough as they were, couldn't hold up against 10 tons of biting force; see the next slide). Megalodon may even have crossed paths with the giant prehistoric whale Leviathan ; see Megalodon vs. Leviathan - Who Wins? for an analysis of this epic battle. 03Megalodon Had the Most Powerful Bite of Any Creature That Ever LivedNobu Tamura/Wikimedia Commons/CC BY-SA 3.0In 2008, a joint research team from Australia and the U.S. used computer simulations to calculate Megalodon's biting power. The results can only be described as terrifying: whereas a modern Great White Shark clamps its jaws shut with about 1.8 tons of force per square inch (and an African lion with a wimpy 600 pounds or so), Megalodon chomped down on its prey with a force of between 10.8 and 18.2 tons—enough to crush the skull of a prehistoric whale as easily as a grape, and far outclassing the bite force generated by Tyrannosaurus Rex . 04Megalodon's Teeth Were Over Seven Inches LongJeff Rotman/Getty ImagesMegalodon didn't earn its name (""giant tooth"") for nothing. The teeth of this prehistoric shark were serrated, heart-shaped, and over half a foot long (by comparison, the largest teeth of a Great White Shark only measure about three inches long). You have to go back 65 million years--to none other, once again, than Tyrannosaurus Rex —to find a creature that possessed bigger choppers, though the protruding canines of some saber-toothed cats were also in the same ballpark. 05Megalodon Liked to Bite the Fins Off Its PreyDangerboy3DAccording to at least one computer simulation, Megalodon's hunting style differed from that of modern Great White Sharks. Whereas Great Whites dive straight toward their prey's soft tissues (say, a carelessly exposed underbelly or the legs of a wading swimmer), Megalodon's teeth were especially suited to biting through tough cartilage, and there's some evidence that this giant shark may have first sheared off its victim's fins (rendering it unable to swim away) before lunging in for the final kill. 06Megalodon's Closest Living Relative Is the Great White SharkTerry Goss/Wikimedia Commons/CC BY 2.5Technically, Megalodon is known as Carcharodon megalodon--meaning it's a species (Megalodon) of a larger shark genus (Carcharodon). Also technically, the modern Great White Shark is known as Carcharodon carcharias, meaning it belongs to the same genus as Megalodon. However, not all paleontologists agree with this classification, claiming that Megalodon and the Great White arrived at their striking similarities via the process of convergent evolution. 07Megalodon Was Much Bigger Than the Biggest Marine ReptilesRobyn Hanson/Wikimedia Commons/CC BY 2.0The ocean's natural buoyancy allows ""apex predators"" to grow to massive sizes, but none were more massive than Megalodon. Some of the giant marine reptiles of the Mesozoic Era, like Liopleurodon and Kronosaurus , weighed 30 or 40 tons, max, and a modern Great White Shark can only aspire to a relatively puny three tons. The only marine animal that outclasses the 50- to 75-ton Megalodon is the plankton-eating Blue Whale, individuals of which have been known to weigh well over 100 tons.08Megalodon's Teeth Were Once Known As ""Tongue Stones""Ethan Miller/Getty ImagesBecause sharks are constantly shedding their teeth—thousands and thousands of discarded choppers over the course of a lifetime—and because Megalodon had a global distribution (see next slide), Megalodon teeth have been discovered all over the world, from antiquity to modern times. It was only in the 17th century that a European court physician named Nicholas Steno identified peasants' prized ""tongue stones"" as shark teeth; for this reason, some historians describe Steno as the world's first paleontologist.09Megalodon Had Worldwide DistributionSerge Illaryonov/Wikimedia Commons/CC BY 3.0Unlike some sharks and marine reptiles of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic Eras—which were restricted to the coastlines or inland rivers and lakes of certain continents—Megalodon enjoyed a truly global distribution, terrorizing whales in warm-water oceans all over the world. Apparently, the only thing keeping adult Megalodons from venturing too far toward solid land was their enormous size, which would have ​beached them as helplessly as 16th-century Spanish galleons.10No One Knows Why Megalodon Went ExtinctWikimedia CommonsSo Megalodon was huge, relentless, and the apex predator of the Pliocene and Miocene epochs. What went wrong? Well, this giant shark may have been doomed by global cooling (which culminated in the last Ice Age), or by the gradual disappearance of the giant whales that constituted the bulk of its diet. (By the way, some people believe Megalodons still lurk in the ocean's depths, as popularized in the Discovery Channel show Megalodon: The Monster Shark Lives , but there's absolutely no reputable evidence to support this theory.)cite"		0

(Source: Facebook)Pizza Hut issued this response to the customer incident. (Source: Facebook)HUNTSVILLE, AL (WAFF) -A Huntsville Pizza Hut is reeling after they say a man made up a negative story, posted it to Facebook, and got thousands of shares. Pizza Hut managers are reacting and hoping to clear the air about the “fabricated incident.”Pizza Hut customer Caleb Lee made a Facebook post claiming he asked for a military discount. When he didn’t see it on his receipt, he asked to speak to a store manager, according to his Facebook post. The post went on to say that the “corporate manager” cursed at him and told him to leave his store.Store managers at the 4802 University Dr. NW location said the military man’s story was made up.According to a statement the franchise released, they tried to reach out to Lee on social media, but he removed himself from Facebook.Pizza Hut’s statement says that managers conducted a thorough investigation. The store reviewed surveillance footage and confirmed the individual was a customer that day and did ask for a military discount. Pizza Hut states the rest of Lee’s story doesn’t check out: They said he wasn't approached by anybody else and he left the establishment.The restaurant’s statement goes on to say the establishment has the utmost respect for all customers. That includes military, law enforcement, firefighters and responders.Here is Pizza Hut’s statement in full:We want to thank everyone for your concerns with the situation that has been made up on Facebook. We have had a thorough investigation about the matter and have reviewed all video surveillance footage of the day the individual claims it occurred. Caleb Lee is in fact a customer of ours and did come in and have buffet with us on Jan 12th between 1-2pm. When Mr Lee finished enjoying his meal he paid for his meal, at which time, he did ask if we gave a military discount. His server and the store manager explained we did not offer a discount. Mr Lee paid for his meal and exited the facility. Mr Lee was never approached by any other person during his visit with us. It is very unfortunate that he felt the need to fabricate a story and post it to social media. We have tried to contact Mr. Lee, but we are unable to as he has removed himself from all social media. As anyone could guess, this has had a very negative impact on our business and reputation. As a Pizza Hut Franchise, we have been serving our communities, here in Huntsville, AL, since 1967. We have always had the utmost respect for all customers, including all uniformed professions, be it Military, Law Enforcement, Firefighters or Responders. Any actions like what was stated would have resulted in immediate termination of any employee no matter the position they hold. We will continue as always to serve our guests with the utmost respect today and in the future.WAFF 48 News reached out to that particular store to confirm that their statement was authentic. Managers confirmed it was released by that franchise location at 4802 University Dr.As a franchise, managers have never had a need to create a Facebook page specific to that location. On Sunday, they created a page just to release their response and clear the air. That Facebook page is no longer available.WAFF 48 has asked for an interview with the franchise and the surveillance video. However, they say because of corporate rules, they have to get explicit permission from their headquarters to be interviewed by local media. That process is underway.According to that statement, Pizza Hut managers this situation has had a very negative impact on their reputation and their business.The restaurant promises that if this incident, or anything like it, ever occurs now or in the future, they will fire that employee immediately.Copyright 2017 WAFF .

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-presidential-seal/	tee markers emblazoned with the u.s. presidential seal were manufactured for and installed at a golf course owned by the trump organization.	True	['donald trump', ' golf course', ' mar-a-lago']	https://www.propublica.org/	https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-extra-the-trump-organization-ordered-golf-course-markers-with-the-presidential-seal-that-may-be-illegal	2018/03/09	Subscribe to “Trump, Inc.” here or wherever you get your podcasts.President Donald Trump loves putting his name on everything from ties to steaks to water — and, of course, his buildings. But now the Trump Organization appears to be borrowing a brand even more powerful than the gilded Trump moniker: the presidential seal.In recent weeks, the Trump Organization has ordered the manufacture of new tee markers for golf courses that are emblazoned with the seal of the president of the United States. Under federal law, the seal’s use is permitted only for official government business. Misuse can be a crime.Past administrations have policed usage vigilantly. In 2005 the Bush administration ordered the satirical news website The Onion to remove a replica of the seal. Grant M. Dixton, associate White House counsel, wrote in a letter to The Onion that the seal “is not to be used in connection with commercial ventures or products in any way that suggests presidential support or endorsement.”Listen to the PodcastAfter listening to the new ProPublica/WNYC podcast “Trump, Inc.,” a listener brought the signs to our attention.Eagle Sign and Design, a metalworking and sign company with offices in New Albany, Indiana, and Louisville, Kentucky, said it had received an order to manufacture dozens of round, 12-inch replicas of the presidential seal to be placed next to the tee boxes at Trump golf course holes. Two tee markers are placed on the ground at the start of a hole on golf courses to indicate where golfers should stand to take their first swing.“We made the design, and the client confirmed the design,” said Joseph E. Bates, who owns Eagle Sign, declining to say who the client was.A table of presidential seal tee markers at Eagle Sign. This photo was provided to ProPublica by a source.An order form for the tee markers reviewed by ProPublica and WNYC says the customer was “Trump International.” The Facebook page for Eagle Sign and Design shows a photo of the markers in an album with the caption “Trump International Golf Course.”It is unclear how many Trump International golf courses will feature the markers. The Trump Organization owns four courses with the “International” name in the U.S. and abroad, with a fifth course in Bali, Indonesia, in the works.Eagle Sign makes a wide array of tee markers out of bronze and aluminum, and has made other signs for Trump’s courses, according to its website. At some of Trump’s golf courses, tee markers have sported the Trump family crest, which he took from the family that originally owned Mar-a-Lago without permission and then altered by adding his own name.Ethics experts have long been on the lookout for signs that the Trump Organization would exploit the office of the presidency for commercial gain. Several said that using the presidential seal on the company’s golf courses would fall into this category.A law governs the manufacture or use of the seal, its likeness, “or any facsimile thereof” for anything other than official U.S. government business. It can be a criminal offense punishable by up to six months in prison.The Six Stages of Trump’s ResistanceWhen state regulators tried to get the future president to address a few environmental problems on two golf courses some years ago, little did they know they’d be treated to a multi-year lesson in how he handles regulatory challenges.The “law is an expression of the idea that the government and government authority should not be used for private purpose,” said Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University specializing in government and legal ethics said. “It would be a misuse of government authority.”The Department of Justice declined to comment on whether it was aware the seal had been used by entities outside the government. The White House and the Trump Organization did not respond to request for comment.The presidential seal was first sketched out by President Millard Fillmore in 1850 and the current design — which shows a bald eagle with an olive branch in its right talon, a bundle of 13 arrows in the left, and a scroll bearing the words “E pluribus unum” in its beak — was chosen by President Truman and made official in a 1945 executive order. The seal that adorns the president’s speaking lecterns is handmade by the Institute of Heraldry , a department of the Army located at Fort Belvoir in Virginia that designs and provides guidance related to military and governmental symbols.Versions of the seal have occasionally been put to personal use by past presidents. George W. Bush and Barack Obama had custom sets of golf balls made with the seal. Ronald and Nancy Reagan had a set of presidential china bearing the seal, and there have even been M&M’s and jelly beans that featured the seal.In this case, the difference is that a private company is using the seal, said Richard Painter, vice chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government accountability group. Painter also served as an associate White House counsel during the George W. Bush administration.“If we had heard of a private company using it for commercial purposes, we would have sent them a nasty letter,” he said.“Trump, Inc.” is a production of WNYC Studios and ProPublica .

But in parts of California, Arizona, and Texas, a wall already exists.The pedestrian border in Nogales, Arizona. | Nov. 7, 2016 | (REUTERS/Mike Blake)The barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border, some of which date back to 1994 , are discontinuous. But put together, they would cover about 580 miles of the nearly 2,000-mile border that stretches from San Diego, California, to Brownsville, Texas.The structures vary as much as the landscapes on which they are built. They can be imposing — cement, steel mesh, corrugated metal — or more of a suggestion — a low fence, signs, security cameras. In some places the wall literally severs towns in half; in other places the divide is more personal , splitting communities, business, and families that once lived and worked together.A woman In Tijuana talks to her relatives across a fence. | Nov. 13, 2016 | (REUTERS/Jorge Duenes)Trump's proposed wall — a series of fences and walls — is projected to cost as much as $21.6 billion and take more than three years to build, according to a U.S. Department of Homeland Security report . And it isn't yet clear who will pay for it. But U.S. residents along the border are ideologically divided. ""It's just a waste of money,"" Basilisa Valdez, a Mexican-born Texas resident, told the Texas Tribune . ""That's not going to stop the people from coming over. There's always a way to come in.""A resident in Brownsville, Texas, points out that the wall they already have isn't doing its job securing the border. ""What makes them think a new one will [work]?,"" asked farmer Bonnie Elbert .An Arizona cattle rancher disagrees. ""We need a wall,"" Jim Chilton told The Associated Press , adding that it should be part of a larger plan. ""We need Border Patrol to be down there all the time.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/daith-piercing-migraines/	"a ""daith piercing"" can cure migraine headaches."	Unproven	['acupuncture', ' alternative medicine', ' daith piercings', ' migraine']	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25600719	2016/10/22	"Graham Headache Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.Erratum inAbstractBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:The US National Center for Health Statistics, which is part of the Centers for Disease Control, conducts ongoing public health surveillance activities. The US Armed Forces also maintains a comprehensive database of medical information. We aimed to identify the most current prevalence estimates of migraine and severe headache in the United States adult civilian and active duty service populations from these national government surveys, to assess stability of prevalence estimates over time, and to identify additional information pertinent to the burden and treatment of migraine and other severe headache conditions.METHODS:We searched for the most current publicly available summary statistics from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). Summary data from the Defense Medical Surveillance System were also obtained, and PubMed was also searched for publications reporting summary statistics based on these studies. Data were abstracted, double-checked for accuracy, and summarized over time periods and as a function of demographic variables.RESULTS:14.2% of US adults 18 or older reported having migraine or severe headache in the previous 3 months in the 2012 NHIS. The overall age-adjusted 3-month prevalence of migraine in females was 19.1% and in males 9.0%, but varied substantially depending on age. The prevalence of migraine was highest in females 18-44, where the 3-month prevalence of migraine or severe headache was 23.5%. The 3-month prevalence of migraine or severe headache has remained relatively stable over the period of2005-2012, with an average prevalence of 20.2% in females, 9.4% in males, and 14.9% overall [corrected]. During this time, the average female to male sex ratio for migraine or severe headache was 2.17. The unadjusted 1-year prevalence of migraine in active duty US military service members varied from 1% to 1.9% between 1998 and 2010, ranging from 0.7% to 1.2% in males and 3.5% to 6% in females. The 1-year prevalence of ""other headache"" in this military population ranged from a low of 1.9% in 2003 to a high of 3% in 2010. Headache or pain in the head was the fourth leading cause of visits to the emergency department (ED) in 2009-2010, accounting for 3.1% of all ED visits. Across all ambulatory care settings, migraine accounted for 0.5% of all visits and other headache presentations for 0.4% of all ambulatory care visits. 52.8% of all visits for migraine occurred in primary care settings, 23.2% in specialty outpatient settings, and 16.7% in EDs. In 2010, opioids were administered at 35% of ED visits for headache, while triptans were administered in only 1.5% of visits.CONCLUSIONS:This report summarizes the most recent government statistics on the prevalence and burden of migraine and severe headache in the US civilian and active duty military populations. The prevalence of migraine headaches is high, affecting roughly 1 out of every 7 Americans annually, and has remained relatively stable over the last 8 years. Migraine and headache are leading causes of outpatient and ED visits and remain an important public health problem, particularly among women during their reproductive years.© 2015 American Headache Society.epidemiology; headache; migraine; military; prevalencePMID:"		0
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/false-giant-hawaiian-cane-spider/	photograph shows a giant hawaiian cane spider on the side of a house.	False	['spiders']	http://animals.mom.me/	http://animals.mom.me/cane-spider-4478.html	2017/07/07	By Karen MihayloAblestock.com/AbleStock.com/Getty ImagesThe cane spider is known by different names in different regions, including brown huntsman, large brown spider, banana spider and giant crab spider. They're found in subtropical climates, and may have came to the U.S. as stowaways in banana shipments from Central America. They don't weave webs, instead stalking their prey, capturing and holding it with their large, powerful fangs.Physical DescriptionCane spiders are large, flat-bodied arachnids with two rows of eyes and long, hairy legs. Their bodies are about an inch long, with a leg span that reaches up to 5 inches wide. Cane spiders are brown, with a cream-colored band encircling the top of their backs, and black bands or spots on their legs. Male cane spiders have pale patches behind their eyes and longer legs than females, while females have larger abdomens.HabitatCane spiders are found in Hawaii, Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, California, Southeast Asia, Australia and the Caribbean. They frequent sugar cane fields, avocado and banana groves and forests, hiding in tree holes and under bark. Cane spiders can't tolerate cold temperatures. Their flat bodies fit in tiny cracks, enabling them to find their way into homes, heated garages, outbuildings and greenhouses to keep warm.ReproductionCane spiders breed year-round. After mating, the female spins a white egg sac surrounding approximately 200 eggs. She carries her egg sac under her body, causing her to be mostly immobile. In about three weeks, the mother tears open the egg sac and pale baby spiders emerge. The mother spider stays with the babies for several weeks after they hatch. The babies will molt several times during this period. Cane spiders live for more than 2 years.Cane Spiders and HumansCane spiders are nocturnal, entering homes and hiding behind wall hangings and under furniture, coming out at night to hunt. They are found in cars, often behind sun visors, frightening humans with their large size. Cane spiders are reluctant biters, biting only if provoked. Their bites are small but painful. They do not produce enough venom to be dangerous to humans, but a headache may result. Some cultures welcome the cockroach-eating cane spiders into their homes.		0
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-cab-ride/	account describes a cab driver taking an elderly woman to a hospice on the last ride of her life. see example( s )	Legend	['']	http://kentnerburn.com/	http://kentnerburn.com/about	2016/03/27	Kent NerburnAboutNormally, a background section gives an historical narrative of an author’s personal and professional life. But I like this interview, done years ago by a web magazine in Washington D.C. I’ve edited it for relevance and updated it a bit to reflect changes in my life. I find it more informative and full of life than a standard bio. I hope you agree.Can you tell us a little about your background?I was born and raised near Minneapolis. Perhaps the most formative experience of my childhood was going out with my father, who worked for the Red Cross, when he went to help victims of fires and floods who had lost their homes, their possessions, and, sometimes, their families. He would get the same calls as the fire department, and we would often arrive simultaneously, often in the deepest night, and confront the same tragedies the police and firemen confronted, only our responsibility was to provide aid and comfort. These experiences gave me a profound understanding of human suffering and hope, and left me with an indelible belief in a life of service. They also taught me how fragile our good fortune is, and how lucky and blessed I have been to live the life I’ve lived.After high school I went to the University of Minnesota in American Studies, then to Stanford University in Religious Studies and Humanities, then to Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, where I received a Ph.D. in conjunction with the University of California at Berkeley. My doctorate was in Religious Studies and Art. For many years I devoted my life to creating over-life sized sculptures from tree trunks. My heroes and mentors were Michelangelo, Donatello, and Rodin, all of whose works I had the good fortune to study in person while living for a time in Europe.After returning to Minnesota, I moved north to the pine and lake country near the Canadian border, where my wife and I got married and have lived ever since. For several years I worked on the Red Lake Ojibwe reservation helping students collect the memories of the tribal elders. This changed my life and introduced me to the native spiritual traditions that have become so central to the message in my writings.I switched to writing from sculpture about 30 years ago when I realized that I could reach more people as a writer and that I had skills in that area.My work has been a constant search, from various perspectives, for an authentic American spirituality, integrating our western Judeo-Christian tradition with the other traditions of the world, and especially the indigenous spirituality of the people who first inhabited this continent. Someone once called me a “guerilla theologian,” and I think that is fairly accurate. I am deeply concerned with the human condition and our responsibility to the earth, the people on it, and the generations to come. I believe that we are, at heart, spiritual beings seeking spiritual meaning, and I try to honor this search wherever I discover it in the course of my daily life.My wife and I currently live just outside of Portland, Oregon, where we moved after her retirement from Bemidji State University, partly to be near some of our grandchildren and partly because I figured that continuing to climb on roofs to pull down snow in our northern Minnesota winters was going to bring me to a bad end. Nonetheless, we do miss our lives amid the great powerful forces of the Minnesota north, where the winter winds blew unstopped from the vast Manitoba prairies, and on beautiful summer nights we were serenaded to sleep by the songs of loons and the lapping of waters on the lake outside our window. But times change and the seasons of life turn. The Pacific Northwest with its lush beauty and proximity to the monumental presences of oceans and mountains has been a wonderful revelation and has allowed us to see life through new eyes. It has been a move we don’t regret.I have four children – three who came in the “package deal” with my wife, each wonderful and interesting in his or her own right, and each now well into adulthood and building careers and family. The fourth, my biological son, is a fascinating documentarian photographer and filmmaker. We are fortunate that he got the best parts of each of his parents. As you know, it doesn’t always work that way.We have three grandchildren, and find that all the clichés about grandparenting are real. What a joy and gift they are.Your writing seems very poetic in style. Is this something you do consciously, or is this just the way the words flow out?I take the music of language very seriously. Like a heartbeat, it exists right below consciousness, but it animates and infuses your language with life. As both a reader and a writer, I tend to subvocalize, thus making my pacing and thoughts more auditory than conceptual. I want the sentences to aspirate and pulsate with cadence and internal music. A good sentence should sound good and feel good and roll comfortably off your tongue, not simply serve as a conveyor for ideas.Who inspires you?Donatello, Rilke, Nelson Mandela, Black Elk, Bach, Mahler, Lao Tzu, good elementary school teachers, caring nursing home workers, and anyone who spends time with people who can offer them no benefit.You quote the Sioux writer Ohiyesa in “Small Graces: The Quiet Gifts of Everyday Life.” Do you have a favorite quote or thought of his?I constantly hark back in my own life to his comment about spirituality: “Whenever, in the course of our day, we might come upon a scene that is strikingly beautiful or sublime – the black thundercloud with the rainbow’s glowing arch above the mountain; a white waterfall in the heart of a green gorge; a vast prairie tinged with the blood-red of sunset – we pause for an instant in an attitude of worship.” This, it seems to me, is the key to a humble appreciation of the gift of life we have been given and a proper way of honoring the Great Mystery we have come to call God.What makes you hopeful about the future?I am hopeful for human beings because I believe that, at heart, we all seek the same thing – a chance to love and be loved, to raise good children, and to live in peace with our neighbors and families. That we so consistently fail to do so is troubling. And I admit to being deeply upset by the selfishness that is abroad in our own land – believing that we must look out first and foremost for ourselves (though perhaps that may be changing) – and the tendency, both here and abroad, to use religious belief to justify cruelty toward others.Do you have a favorite writer or book?I love Graham Greene, Jim Harrison, Annie Dillard, Barry Lopez, and Rainer Maria Rilke.When you write, do you ever feel that something greater than yourself is providing the words or ideas?Alas, no. I wish I did. But I do believe that we are all God’s hands here on earth, and that in and through my writing I must endeavor to do God’s work, however one chooses to define or give a shape to God. I do know that there are moments when writing feels like a walk in a beautiful garden, and the joy of discovery is everywhere around me. At those times I feel myself in the presence of something close to Grace, though it seems more like a gift that I must honor than a channeling of some outside force.You write about experiences you’ve had that suggest you’ve studied with various spiritual traditions. What’s been particularly helpful or pivotal in your path?I love the Beatitudes from the Christian tradition, the use of natural forces as analogy in the Taoist tradition, and the spiritual commitment to the power of the earth in the Native American traditions. I believe we are our brothers’ and sisters’ keepers, that the ways of force and acquiescence shown in nature must govern an integrated and balanced life, and that each person must, indeed, find his or her own spiritual path and live each day with an attitude of prayerful awareness.Do you recommend spending time in nature?Let me quote Ohiyesa again. “All who have lived much out of doors, whether Indian or otherwise, know that there is a magnetic and powerful force that accumulates in solitude but is quickly dissipated by life in a crowd.” We should all seek the healing and clarifying power of nature so that our spiritual focus and power is not allowed to dissipate.You talk about the importance of ritual in “Small Graces”. Are there any rituals or practices you’d recommend to someone seeking a more spiritually focused life?Prayer – not as petition, but as reflection and contemplation. Mentoring. Service with no thought of recognition. I know these are not specific. But each person must find his or her specific expression of these general principles. Helping a child or an elder or someone in need will do more for one’s spiritual focus than closing any deal or building any building or achieving any position of fame or celebrity. Ignatius Loyola said it simply and best: “Anything we turn toward God is a prayer.”You have a lot of wonderful quotes at the beginning of each chapter of “Small Graces”. Is there one that’s particularly special to you?I believe in them all. But I would think that the essence of my philosophy about life is in the quote, “We are not all called to be great. But we are all called to reach out our hands to our brothers and sisters, and to care for the earth in the time we are given.”Do you have any final thoughts you’d like to share?Seek the unseen in life. Celebrate the ordinary. Serve the weak rather than currying the favor of the powerful. Find a way to direct your life towards God. And live for the seventh generation rather than for yourself. Most of all, follow the invitation of the Lakota chief, Sitting Bull, “Come, let us put our minds together to see what kind of life we can create for our children.” And remember that we do not all live holy lives, but we all live in a world alive with holy moments.Thank you so much for your time.68 thoughts on About		0

Here's how to know when to harvest.The Sweetness FactorThe prime harvest time for sweet corn passes quickly for most varieties except the supersweets, so gardeners need to know how to judge when to harvest to get the most from their crop.Corn is ready to be picked as soon as the ears have completely filled out. This goes for sweet corn and roasting ears.You can tell when this happens by feeling the end of an ear. If it's rounded or blunt rather than pointed, the ears are ready. The silks also dry up when the ears are almost ready to be picked.If you don't trust your judgment, you can pull back a bit of the husk and check to see if the ear looks well filled and the kernels are creamy yellow or white. Many gardening guides tell you to pierce a kernel with your thumb nail to test for ripeness. If the liquid inside is watery, that ear isn't quite ready. If the liquid is white or ""milky,"" you're in business.Although opening the husk is a fairly sure test, try not to do this. Once you open an immature ear, it's susceptible to insect and bird attacks as it continues to ripen. It usually takes only a little practice to become a good judge by feeling the ends of the ears.Sweetness is the key, so it helps to understand what makes corn sweet and why timing is so important in your harvest. The plant manufactures natural sugars when the kernels are filling out. These kernels are seeds that each contain a natural food-storage compartment as well as the corn embryo. A seed can't store sugars, but it can live on stored starches throughout the winter months and in its early stages of growth the following season. As soon as the kernels are full of sugar, the plant begins to convert it into starch. For best flavor, harvest the corn before this change can take place.The sweetness of corn depends on the variety, temperature and amount of sunlight during the day when the ears are forming. The plant makes the most sugar on cool, sunny days. If the temperature is too hot, the sugar-making process is slowed. That's why the long, crisp, sunny days of early fall produce the sweetest corn.Time It RightIf you have a choice, it's a good idea to harvest corn as close to the time you're going to eat or use it as possible. In fact, you might want to have the water boiling for corn on the cob before you head out to harvest. To harvest sweet corn, grab an ear and twist it down and off the stalk.If you want the sweetest corn possible, try to harvest each ear at its peak. Keep in mind that the natural conversion of sugar into starch is sped up when you harvest. The moment you pick an ear of sweet corn, its sugars start to change into starches because the natural goal is to nourish seed for reproduction. In 24 hours, most varieties convert more than half their sugar content to starch. However, the new super sweet varieties stay sweet much longer after harvest than the old standards.The loss of sugar is much slower at lower temperatures, so refrigerate corn if you're not going to be able to eat it right away. If you're not near a refrigerator and you have some harvested corn, keep the freshly picked ears in single layers, rather than stacking them. Corn tends to overheat inside its tight husks, so give each ear as much breathing room as possible. It also helps to cover the ears with a damp cloth.Super sweet varieties have been developed to slow down the conversion of the natural sugars into starch, which makes these varieties last longer on the stalk, and helps them retain their flavor for a few days once harvested. Many seed catalogs claim that super sweet types are twice as sweet at harvest time as ordinary hybrids, and four times as sweet after 48 hours.Some people prefer corn that's less sweet, with more texture in each kernel. They take advantage of the natural conversion process and don't harvest corn until it's somewhat doughy from the increased starch content. They may also wait a day or two to serve it after picking.If you want to store corn over the winter or grind your own cornmeal, give it time to harden completely. This means it has passed through its entire carbohydrate production cycle. It will then contain such heavy starch that it will be too hard to bite and it will keep for many months in storage.Popcorn PointersThe only way that growing popcorn differs from growing sweet corn is at harvest time, and popcorn is actually easier to harvest because you don't have to catch it at the peak of sweetness. Leave popcorn in the garden until the stalks and husks are brown and dry, then twist and snap each ear from the stalk. Do this before the frost hits. To prepare popcorn for indoor curing, carefully strip away the dried husk from each ear. The kernels will be partially dried or ""cured,"" a necessity for long-term storage.Besides drying on the stalks, popcorn requires another four to six weeks of thorough drying in a warm, well-ventilated place. Corn can't pop unless there's the right amount of moisture inside the kernel. When it's heated, the moisture turns to steam, which causes the kernel to burst.Place the ears in mesh bags or spread them out in an area where they'll have warm air circulating around them. You can also hang mesh bags full of popcorn ears in your garage for about four weeks. After curing, hang the bags of corn from the rafters of your root cellar. The corn can keep for years in the cool, dry, dark conditions there.After a month of curing, the kernels can be taken off the ears and stored in airtight jars. Whether you're removing the kernels before storage or just before popping, there's no real trick to it. Simply grasp the ear firmly in both hands and twist until the kernels drop out. Once started, the kernels drop off with very little pressure. However, beware of the sharply pointed kernels if you're using your bare hands. After two or three ears, you may have a few nicks and scratches. If you want to remove the kernels from a lot of ears, it might be a good idea to wear gloves.Popcorn doesn't take much garden space for a sizable harvest. Each ear is loaded with tiny kernels come harvest time, and three or four five-foot-long rows should be plenty. Many popcorn varieties produce one or two ears per plant, so you may have enough by growing just five or six plants.Pop homegrown popcorn just as you would store-bought. Heat a few tablespoons of oil in a deep pot. Sprinkle in enough kernels to coat the bottom and cover the pot. If not, as soon as you hear the first kernel pop, shake the covered pot vigorously while the rest pop. Shaking prevents the kernels from burning, and the unpopped kernels stay on the bottom nearest the heat. If you're using a popcorn popper, follow the manufacturer's instructions.When the popping stops, remove the pot from the heat and take off the lid to let the steam escape. The popcorn is ready. Enjoy it plain, or add your favorite topping.Other articles in this series: 1. Harvesting Corn ← you're on this article right now2.

Place the ears in mesh bags or spread them out in an area where they'll have warm air circulating around them. You can also hang mesh bags full of popcorn ears in your garage for about four weeks. After curing, hang the bags of corn from the rafters of your root cellar. The corn can keep for years in the cool, dry, dark conditions there. After a month of curing, the kernels can be taken off the ears and stored in airtight jars. Whether you're removing the kernels before storage or just before popping, there's no real trick to it. Simply grasp the ear firmly in both hands and twist until the kernels drop out. Once started, the kernels drop off with very little pressure. However, beware of the sharply pointed kernels if you're using your bare hands. After two or three ears, you may have a few nicks and scratches. If you want to remove the kernels from a lot of ears, it might be a good idea to wear gloves. Popcorn doesn't take much garden space for a sizable harvest. Each ear is loaded with tiny kernels come harvest time, and three or four five-foot-long rows should be plenty. Many popcorn varieties produce one or two ears per plant, so you may have enough by growing just five or six plants. Pop homegrown popcorn just as you would store-bought. Heat a few tablespoons of oil in a deep pot. Sprinkle in enough kernels to coat the bottom and cover the pot. If not, as soon as you hear the first kernel pop, shake the covered pot vigorously while the rest pop. Shaking prevents the kernels from burning, and the unpopped kernels stay on the bottom nearest the heat. If you're using a popcorn popper, follow the manufacturer's instructions. When the popping stops, remove the pot from the heat and take off the lid to let the steam escape. The popcorn is ready. Enjoy it plain, or add your favorite topping. 1.

Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary increased significantly over the past two years to nearly $700,000, according to a financial statement the Democratic presidential candidate released yesterday. An 84 percent increase in the value of their investment portfolio and including the couples' $180,200 in retirement plans in their assets accounted for most of the change, campaign aide Betsey Wright said. Their net worth at the end of 1989 was $418,692. The statement shows the Clintons' personal wealth, though more than that of most Americans, is far less than that of his likely rivals in the presidential race, Texas businessman Ross Perot and President Bush. Perot's fortune has been estimated at more than $2 billion. Bush released a detailed financial statement recently indicating his net worth is about $3.7 million, including $1.3 million in a blind trust and the $2.2 million value of his home in Kennebunkport, Maine. Bush listed no liabilities. The Clinton statement said that as of Dec. 31, 1991, the couple had assets of $862,980 and liabilities of $165,603. The assets were listed as $158,056 in cash, $387,077 in investments, including stocks and partnerships, the $180,200 in the retirement plans, an $80,000 interest in a condominium and $57,647 in personal property. The debts were a $64,848 mortgage for half-interest in a Little Rock condominium they own with Hillary's parents and a $100,755 bank loan from the 1990 governor's race. The campaign committee will pay back the gubernatorial loan, Wright said. Two years ago, the Clintons released a net worth statement listing assets of $489,692 and a single liability, the then-$71,000 mortgage. Listed separately at the time were retirement accounts totaling about $124,000. According to federal tax returns they made public, the Clintons' total income for 1991 was $234,428, up 19 percent from 1989.		0

Simpson: Buried Knife Found at O.J.'s EstateEXCLUSIVEA construction worker found a knife buried on the perimeter of the former O.J. Simpson estate ... and it's currently being tested by the LAPD in a top secret investigation ... law enforcement sources tell TMZ.The story is incredible. We're told a construction worker found the knife years ago -- we have heard several different stories, ranging from ""several years ago"" to 1998, when the house was demolished.The weapon is a folding buck knife.Our law enforcement sources say the construction worker took the knife to the street, where he saw an LAPD cop. He told the officer where he found the knife and the cop took it.Turns out the cop -- who worked in the traffic division -- was off duty at the time, working security for a movie shoot at a house across the street on Rockingham. Our sources say the officer took the knife home and kept it ... kept it for years. In late January of this year, after the cop retired from the LAPD, he contacted a friend who worked in LAPD's Robbery Homicide Division (RHD). The cop told the friend about the knife and said he was getting it framed to put on his wall. He wanted his friend to get the DR (Departmental Record) number for the Nicole Brown Simpson/Ronald Goldman murder case, which he planned on engraving in the frame.We're told the friend was indignant, and told his superiors. The brass was outraged and demanded that the retired cop turn the knife over, which he did.Our sources say the knife is currently being tested for hair and fingerprints. It will be moved to the Serology Unit next week, where it will be tested for DNA and other biological evidence. One source familiar with the investigation tells us, cops who eyeballed the knife think it could have blood residue on it, but it's hard to know without testing because it's extremely rusted and stained.The investigation is top secret. It's been logged into the LAPD's computer system outside the official case file to maintain security. Our sources say, since O.J. was found not guilty, it's still an open case. That means cops can continue investigating, but O.J. cannot be prosecuted again -- double jeopardy."		1

(Courtesy of Wikicommons/Cefaclor )smithsonian.comJune 3, 2013In recent weeks, photos of lobsters have been floating around social media with captions calling the crustaceans “biologically immortal.” Anyone with an Internet connection can even create a meme juxtaposing this fact with a joke of his or her own. But is this fun fact actually, well, fact?Related ContentTo Make Lobster Fisheries More Sustainable, Scientists Attempt to Decode Crustacean DNAThe viral scientific tidbit can be traced back to a brief 2007 news story that reports that lobsters don’t show typical signs of a phenomenon known as senescence . In plain terms, the report says that lobsters don’t age the way other living creatures do—they don’t lower their reproductive ability, slow their metabolism or decrease in strength. This led to extrapolations that lobsters, if left undisturbed, can’t die. Other websites write that lobsters’ incredible longevity is courtesy of their DNA, with credit specifically due to telomerase , an enzyme used in cell division that protects the ends of chromosomes.The popular graphic and its different textual iterations caught the eye of Zen Faulkes , an invertebrate neuroethologist at the University of Texas-Pan American, who sussed out the situation on his blog and came to this conclusion: “If there is evidence supporting that claim,” he wrote in an email, “I have not found it yet.”It’s true that lobsters continue eating, reproducing and growing until the end. And there is an end—they’re not immortal. But like most decapod crustaceans , which also include crayfish and shrimp, they have indeterminate growth . That means they don’t reach a set size limit in their lifetimes, continuing to grow until they die of natural causes or are killed.Lobsters grow by molting their hard exoskeleton, and they do so a lot: the average lobster can molt 44 times before it’s a year old. By the time lobsters reach the age of seven, they molt once a year, and after that, once every two to three years, growing larger with each successive shedding of its exoskeleton. The largest lobster on record, caught in Nova Scotia in 1977, weighed 44 pounds, six ounces and measured 3.5 feet in length. Last year, fishermen caught a 27-pound lobster , roughly the size of a toddler–the largest in Maine’s history. For lobsters, bigger bodies translate into more reproductive success: females can carry more eggs as their body volume increases, and they keep producing them until they die.Molting is a stressful process. Losing an exoskeleton leaves the critter, now without a hard shell and strong pincers, temporarily vulnerable to predators. But predation isn’t senescence. So what would be a natural death for lobsters?According to Carl Wilson , lead lobster biologist with the Maine Department of Marine Resources, between 10 and 15 percent of lobsters die naturally each year as they shed their exoskeletons because the exertion proves to be too much. Each molting process requires more and more energy than the one before it as lobsters grow in size.Finally, older crustaceans stop shedding their exoskeletons altogether—a clue that they’re near the end of their lifespans. They run out of metabolic energy to molt, and their worn-and-torn shells contract bacterial infections that weaken them. Shell disease , in which bacteria seeps into lobster shells and forms scar tissue, adheres the crustaceans’ bodies to their shells. The lobster, attempting to molt, gets stuck and dies. The disease also makes lobsters susceptible to other ailments , and in extreme cases, the entire shell can rot, killing the animal inside.“Is that senescence? Maybe not in how we think about it,” says Jeffrey D. Shields , a marine science professor in the Virginia Institute of Marine Science of the College of William & Mary. “But it is senescence in the way that older people die of pneumonia.”But one question about lobsters’ lifespans still remains. Scientists do not yet have a truly validated way of determining the age of lobsters. “The problem with lobsters is when they molt, they molt their entire exoskeleton, including their digestive tract and gastric mill and the like, so there are no hard parts that are left,” Wilson says. These hard parts, if a trace of them were left after every molt, would help determine a creature’s age—without them, approximating lobsters’ birth years is difficult.Previous research has suggested that the biggest European lobster males in the wild live an average of 31 years, and the females an average of 54 years. The work is based off assumed accumulation rates of fat residues found in the creature’s eyestalk . Other scientists are approximating the age of lobsters by measuring a pigment called neurolipofuscin that builds up in the crustaceans’ brains over time. Still more are studying discarded exoskeletons and counting growth bands deposited in the calcified body structures ( PDF ) to determine an average rate of growth for a given lobster, allowing scientists to estimate its age.Scientists, however, are not looking for the secret of lobster immortality—it doesn’t exist.Like this article?SIGN UP for our newsletterAbout Marina KorenMarina Koren is a staff correspondent at National Journal.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hepatitis-c-drug-prices/	a treatment for a serious disease that costs $900 in india is sold for $84,000 in the united states because of corporate greed. see example( s )	Mixture	['american health care system', ' big pharma', ' corporate greed', ' drugs', ' hepatitis c']	http://www.pbs.org/	http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/health-costs-how-the-us-compares-with-other-countries/	2016/05/02	HealthOct 22, 2012 10:30 AM EDTHow much is good health care worth to you? $8,233 per year? That’s how much the U.S. spends per person.Worth it?That figure is more than two-and-a-half times more than most developed nations in the world, including relatively rich European countries like France, Sweden and the United Kingdom. On a more global scale, it means U.S. health care costs now eat up 17.6 percent of GDP.A sizable slice of Americans — including some top-ranking politicians — say the cost may be unfortunate but the U.S. has “the best health care in the world.”But let’s consider what 17 cents of every U.S. dollar is purchasing. According to the most recent report from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) — an international economic group comprised of 34 member nations — it’s not as much as many Americans expect.In the United States:There are fewer physicians per person than in most other OECD countries. In 2010, for instance, the U.S. had 2.4 practicing physicians per 1,000 people — well below below the OECD average of 3.1.The number of hospital beds in the U.S. was 2.6 per 1,000 population in 2009, lower than the OECD average of 3.4 beds.Life expectancy at birth increased by almost nine years between 1960 and 2010, but that’s less than the increase of over 15 years in Japan and over 11 years on average in OECD countries. The average American now lives 78.7 years in 2010, more than one year below the average of 79.8 years.There’s a bright side, to be sure. The U.S. leads the world in health care research and cancer treatment, for instance. The five-year survival rate for breast cancer is higher in the U.S. than in other OECD countries and survival from colorectal cancer is also among the best, according to the group.This week on the PBS NewsHour broadcast, health correspondent Betty Ann Bowser will explore one hospital system’s unusual approach to improving performance while reducing costs — one based on Toyota’s assembly line model for manufacturing cars. The concept is pretty simple: If waste is rooted out of the “assembly line process,” the result will be better cars (or health outcomes, in this case) and lowered costs. At Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle, top officials decided that hospital “waste” can look like anything from unnecessary tests to elaborate waiting rooms to poorly designed floor plans. Tune in for the full report.In the meantime, for a more detailed update on where the U.S. stands apart from its global peers, we spoke to Mark Pearson, head of Division on Health Policy at OECD.NewsHour: Let’s start broadly. Where does the U.S. health care spending stand relative to other OECD countries?Pearson: Whether measured relative to its population or its economy, the United States spends by far the most in the world on health care.The U.S. spent $8,233 on health per person in 2010. Norway, the Netherlands and Switzerland are the next highest spenders, but in the same year, they all spent at least $3,000 less per person. The average spending on health care among the other 33 developed OECD countries was $3,268 per person.The U.S. is a very rich country, but even so, it devotes far more of its economy — 17.6 percent of GDP in 2010 — to health than any other country. The Netherlands is the next highest, at 12 percent of GDP, and the average among OECD countries was almost half that of the U.S., at 9.5 percent of GDP.NewsHour: What are Japan and France doing, for instance, to keep down their costs?Pearson: France and Japan demonstrate that it is possible to have cost-containment at the same time as paying physicians using similar tools to those used in the U.S. There are three key things that stand out when you compare these countries to the U.S.:They use a common fee schedule so that hospitals, doctors and health services are paid similar rates for most of the patients they see. In the U.S., how much a health care service gets paid depends on the kind of insurance a patient has. This means that health care services can choose patients who have an insurance policy that pays them more generously than other patients who have lower-paying insurers, such as Medicaid.They are flexible in responding if they think certain costs are exceeding what they budgeted for. In Japan, if spending in a specific area seems to be growing faster than projected, they lower fees for that area. Similarly, in France an organization called CNMATS closely monitors spending across all kinds of services and if they see a particular area is growing faster than they expected (or deem it in the public interest), they can intervene by lowering the price for that service. These countries also supplement lowering fees with other tools. For example, they monitor how many generic drugs a physician is prescribing and can send someone from the insurance fund to visit physicians’ offices to encourage them to use cheaper generic drugs where appropriate. In comparison, U.S. payment rates are much less flexible. They are often statutory and Medicare cannot change the rates without approval by Congress. This makes the system very inflexible for cost containment.There are few methods for controlling rising costs in private insurance in the U.S. In running their business, private health insurers continually face a choice between asking health care providers to contain their costs or passing on higher costs to patients in higher premiums. Many of them find it hard to do the former.NewsHour: Are there particular areas of care where the U.S. spends more? What are some successful models other countries are employing to keep costs down in those areas?Pearson: Spending on almost every area of health care is higher in the United States than in other countries. For example, nearly $900 per person per year goes on administrative costs. This is far higher than in, say, France, which spends $300 per person, but which also has a system in which health care services are reimbursed in a similar way to the U.S.In part, higher costs are also because the U.S. has been slow to embrace the advantages of information and communications technology in improving the administration of its system and in cutting down on waste. In Sweden, for example, all drug prescribing is done electronically — a message is sent directly from the doctor’s office to the pharmacy. Not only does this cut down on medical errors, it is also thought to save 1-2 hours of work by the pharmacists per day.NewsHour: For hospital care in particular, how much more does the U.S. spend? Do we know why it’s more? What might the U.S. learn from other OECD nations in this area?Pearson: A large amount of higher overall hospital spending in the U.S. can be explained by services costing more in U.S. hospitals rather than because U.S. hospitals are delivering more services. When we look across a broad range of hospital services (both medical and surgical), the average price in the United States is 85 percent higher than the average in other OECD countries. To put this in perspective, a hospital stay in the United States costs over $18,000 on average. The countries that come closest to spending as much — Canada, the Netherlands, Japan — spend between $4,000 and $6,000 less per stay. Across OECD countries, the average cost of a hospital stay is about one-third that of the U.S., at $6,200.As we have previously said, many OECD countries use strong regulation to set prices that hospitals can charge for different services, and some of them even set budgets for how much hospitals can spend. The quality of care delivered in hospitals in these countries are comparable to that in the U.S., and universities are still able to attract the best students to medicine.If strict price control is not a path that the U.S. wishes to follow, an interesting example that the U.S. could learn from is Switzerland, where the national government provides a ranking of hospital services from most expensive to least expensive. Groups of insurers and hospitals across different regions then use the national government’s ranking to negotiate what prices they ought to pay across the board.Such an approach still leaves room for differences in prices across regions and states, but it could help smooth out some of the huge differences you see in prices paid for the same services delivered in the same hospital, depending on whether a patient is on Medicare, Medicaid or their own health insurer.NewsHour: What about specific procedures? Why is the cost of a hip replacement in the U.S. double what it costs in Germany, for instance?Pearson: The table below gives some examples of the prices of some common procedures in the United States compared with some of the countries with the best quality health systems in the world. It shows that:A coronary bypasses costs between nearly 50 percent more than in Canada, Australia and France, and are double the price in Germany.Hip and knee replacements are generally cheaper in other countries than the U.S.PTCAs (coronary angioplasty) are much more expensive in the United States than elsewhere.It is difficult to untangle precisely why prices are higher in the U.S., but two things are apparent: U.S. physicians get higher incomes than in other countries and the U.S. uses more expensive diagnostic procedures. More generally, with so many different kinds of insurance, no one organization has a strong incentive to cut out wasteful practices and ensure that all Americans get value for the very high levels of expenditure incurred when they are sick.NewsHour: The U.S. system is known for over-testing and over-treating, everything from CT scans and MRIs, knee replacements to coronary bypasses. How severe is the over-testing and why is it occurring? Are there mechanisms in place to prevent this in other OECD countries?Our data suggests that the U.S. does do more tests than other OECD countries. The U.S. did 100 MRI tests and 265 CT tests for every 1000 people in 2010 — more than twice the average in other OECD countries. It does more tonsillectomies and more knee replacements than any other OECD country. It also has more Caesarean sections and coronary bypass procedures than in most other countries.These procedures and the use of expensive diagnostic tests are all subject to physician opinion on whether they are desirable or not. The fact that U.S. physicians decide that more procedures and tests are desirable compared to their peers in other countries could be due to a few different things, such as:A fear of litigation that sees physicians test for everything so that they cannot be blamed for not having covered all basesPayments that mean that physicians get paid more if they do more interventions, regardless of medical necessity.Because patients ask for more tests and services. It is often comforting to feel that medical problems are being diagnosed or treated, regardless of whether they are medically necessary. As these services are often paid for by insurance policies, the immediate cost of extra treatment for a patient is often zero or very low.It is often argued that differences in testing could reflect differences in patients’ needs between and within countries. However, research at the Dartmouth Institute has documented that there are large variations in medical practice across different regions in the United States which cannot be explained by differences in population structure or differences in illness. They found that the rate of coronary bypass was five times greater in certain hospital referral regions in the United States than others between 2003 and 2007. Similarly, regional variations in hip and knee replacement are substantial, with the rates four to five times higher in some regions compared with others in 2005-06.Some OECD countries have seen their medical profession and health policy makers develop ‘clinical guidelines’ to promote a more rational use of MRI and CT exams. In the United Kingdom, since the creation of the Diagnostic Advisory Committee by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), a number of guidelines have been issued on the appropriate use of MRI and CT exams for different purposesNewsHour: Is the U.S. doing less than other countries in some instances?Pearson: It is likely that this is happening in some instances. The U.S. has fewer physicians and fewer physician consultations relative to its population. The U.S. also has fewer hospital beds for its population size and shorter average stays in hospital relative to other countries. Indeed, the lower numbers of physicians could help explain why they cost more; there is less competition for patients.Having fewer hospital beds and shorter hospital stays can also be a good thing — a sign that wasteful overuse of hospitals is being avoided in the U.S. system. Medicare in the U.S. has long pioneered how hospitals are paid, by providing a fixed amount for a patient with a particular condition. This means that hospitals have an incentive to treat patients as quickly as possible and it also demonstrates how broader reform in the U.S. could potentially have large effects on costs.NewsHour: Where is the U.S. getting value for its health care dollar?Pearson: If insured, waiting times for U.S. patients are among the lowest in OECD countries. Relatively fewer patients (just 20 percent) wait more than four weeks for a specialist appointment or more than four months for elective surgery (7 percent).U.S. patients also benefit from better cancer outcomes. OECD Health Data shows that the five-year survival rate for breast cancer is higher in the U.S. than in other OECD countries (89.3 percent compared to an OECD average of 83.5 between 2004 and 2009); survival from colorectal cancer is also among the best (64.5 percent compared to an OECD average of 59.9 percent, 2004-09).Most obviously, the U.S. leads the world in health care research. Along with the FDA’s comparatively shorter drug approval processes, this means that cutting-edge drugs and treatments are available more quickly to American patients than elsewhere. The average time from first (worldwide) launch of a new drug to use is 1.3 years in the U.S., the lowest of all OECD countries. The U.S. is also trialing more new procedures and treatments, with the National Institutes of Health currently registering 119,469 clinical trials underway in the U.S., vastly more than any other OECD country.The U.S. has also led the way on safer hospitals and health care quality, with programs such as the Institute of Healthcare Improvement’s 100,000 Lives campaign triggering far-reaching cultural shifts in the several thousand hospitals and clinical facilities that signed. Innovative centers such as the Mayo Clinic and Johns Hopkins that bring laboratory research and clinical practice together have also benefited patients enormously.The size and diversity of the U.S. system has also provided room for more experimentation to try and find better ways to deliver health care. Examples that the world is watching at the moment include Accountable Care Organisations, which seek to better manage risk-sharing by giving providers flexibility to coordinate and deliver health care while holding them accountable for costs and outcomes and the Medical Home model, which seeks to coordinate care and better engage patients and families, using health coaches, care transition pathways and other interventions to reduce expensive re-hospitalizations. Unfortunately, while the U.S. is better at trying out such innovations on a relatively small scale, it then struggles to roll out successful innovations nationally.NewsHour: Are there particular areas the U.S. is doing poorly compared to other OECD countries?Overall, the life expectancy of a U.S. citizen, at 78.2 years, is shorter than the average among OECD countries of 79.5 years and there are a number of specific areas where U.S. health care is weak when compared with other countries.The U.S. needs stronger policies in tackling lifestyles that lead to poor health. While many states are making efforts to reduce smoking, there are fewer policies to tackle the harmful use of alcohol in the U.S. than you would find in other OECD countries, such as higher taxes on alcohol or minimum prices.The U.S. could certainly do a lot more on obesity. It’s a big risk factor for poor health in the U.S., more so than you find in other OECD countries. Adult overweight and obesity rates are the highest in the OECD, and have kept growing even in the last couple of years, while they have nearly stabilised in some other OECD countries, such as England, France and Italy. Child overweight and obesity rates are also very high, but they have been relatively stable over the past 10 years. The slides below show that the U.S. does poorly both in terms of diet and physical activity, even in comparison with other high-obesity countries, across all age groups.The first lady’s “Let’s move” campaign is great, but it cannot achieve a lot if it isn’t supported by other measures. Support for physician counseling and programs to help encourage healthier lifestyles vary widely with different insurance arrangements. The U.S. has a national program to cover breast and cervical cancer screening for low-income women, why not have one to cover lifestyle counseling for low-income people? Advertising regulation is left to the food and beverage industry (e.g. the IFBA “Pledges”) and this is not likely to have a major impact.In terms of health care services, the biggest areas of concern are the quality of primary care services and coordination of care for long-term conditions. Asthma, a condition readily managed by general practitioners in the community, should require hospital admission on very few occasions. In the U.S. however, hospital admission rates for asthma are more than double the OECD average (120.6 per 100,000 population compared to an OECD average of 51.8, 2009).A similar picture emerges for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (230 admissions per 100,000 population compared to an OECD average of 198, 2009). These outcomes can be improved through better health care. In a Commonwealth Fund survey of seven nations (Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States), 16 percent of American patients reported delays in being notified about an abnormal test result (the highest proportion reported) and only 75 percent of primary care physicians reported often or always receiving correspondence from specialists after referral suggesting systemic problems with care coordination.Editor’s Note: Tune in to the PBS NewsHour on Wednesday for health correspondent Betty Ann Bowser’s full report on Virginia Mason Medical Center’s Toyota-inspired approach to improving care and bringing down costs .

PaxVax has proposed a number of control measures they say will restrict the spread and persistence of the GM vaccine and its introduced genetic material, however there is always a possiblity of these restrictions failing and infecting wildlife and ecosystems.Aerial vaccines have used in the United States directed towards animals by the use of plastic packets dropped by planes or helicopters.Sanofi (who is one of the largest vaccine manufacturers in the world) has subsidiary companies such as Merial Limited who manufacture Raboral, an oral live-virus poisonous to humans yet distributed wildlife in the masses.WEST NILE VIRUS SPRAYINGIn 2006 Michael Greenwood wrote an article for the Yale School of Public Health entitled, “Aerial Spraying Effectively Reduces Incidence of West Nile Virus (WNV) in Humans.” The article stated that the incidence of human West Nile virus cases can be significantly reduced through large scale aerial spraying that targets adult mosquitoes, according to research by the Yale School of Public Health and the California Department of Public Health.Under the mandate for aerial spraying for specific vectors that pose a threat to human health, aerial vaccines known as DNA Vaccine Enhancements and Recombinant Vaccine against WNV may be tested or used to “protect” the people from vector infection exposures. DNA vaccine enhancements specifically use Epstein-Barr viral capside’s with multi human complement class II activators to neutralize antibodies. The recombinant vaccines against WNV use Rabbit Beta-globulin or the poly (A) signal of the SV40 virus. In early studies of DNA vaccines it was found that the negative result studies would go into the category of future developmental research projects in gene therapy. During the studies of poly (A) signaling of the SV40 for WNV vaccines, it was observed that WNV will lie dormant in individuals who were exposed to chicken pox, thus upon exposure to WNV aerial vaccines the potential for the release of chicken pox virus would cause a greater risk to having adult onset Shingles.CALIFORNIA AERIAL SPRAYING for WNV and SV40In February 2009 to present date, aerial spraying for the WNV occurred in major cities within the State of California. During spraying of Anaheim, CA a Caucasian female (age 50) was exposed to heavy spraying, while doing her daily exercise of walking several miles. Heavy helicopter activity occurred for several days in this area. After spraying, she experienced light headedness, nausea, muscle aches and increased low back pain. She was evaluated for toxicological mechanisms that were associated with pesticide exposure due to aerial spraying utilizing advanced biological monitoring testing. The test results which included protein band testing utilizing Protein Coupled Response (PCR) methods were positive for KD-45. KD-45 is the protein band for SV-40 Simian Green Monkey virus. Additional tests were performed for Epstein-Barr virus capside and Cytomeglia virus which are used in bioengineering for gene delivery systems through viral protein envelope and adenoviral protein envelope technology. The individual was positive for both; indicating a highly probable exposure to a DNA vaccination delivery system through nasal inhalation.Pentagon Document Revealed Aerial Vaccination PlansIn the Quarterly FunVax Review in June, 2007, the report lists the objective of a project listed as ID: 149AZ2 as a preparation of a viral vector that will inhibit/decrease the expression of a specific disruption gene (VMAT2) within a human population. It further indicates in the abstract that six method of virus dispersal were tested including high altitude release, water supply release, insect transmission, and various methods of diffusion.This article was originally published in 2016 and is updated regularly		1

The STATE OF Texas, Appellee. No. 470-84. Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas, En Banc. May 22, 1985. *261 Michael A. Maness, Houston, for appellant. John B. Holmes, Jr., Dist. Atty. & Timothy G. Taft, & Vance Christopher, Asst. Dist. Attys., Houston, Robert Huttash, State's Atty., Austin, for the State. Before the court en banc. OPINION ON APPELLANT'S PETITION FOR DISCRETIONARY REVIEWTHOMAS G. DAVIS, Judge. Appellant pled not guilty to a misdemeanor information charging possession with intent to sell an obscene device, namely a dildo. The trial court found appellant guilty and assessed three days in jail and a fine of $750.00. The Fourteenth Court of Appeals (Houston) affirmed the conviction, holding that Sections 43.21(a)(7) and 43.23(c)(1) of the Penal Code do not violate the right of privacy guaranteed by the United States Constitution or deprive citizens of substantive due process under the Texas Constitution. Yorko v. State, 681 S.W.2d 633 (Tex.App.1984). We granted appellant's petition for discretionary review to examine the holdings. The statutes at issue read as follows:""43.21. Definitions""... ""`Obscene device' means a device including a dildo or artificial vagina, designed or marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs."" ""43.23. Obscenity""... ""(c) A person commits an offense if, knowing its content and character, he:""(1) promotes or possesses with intent to promote any ... obscene device; ..."" Appellant contends that these provisions, ""on their face and as applied in the circumstances of this case, are unconstitutional under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States because they violate the individual right of privacy."" We are unable to review the constitutionality of the statutes ""as applied in the circumstances of this case"" because the record contains no evidence of what those circumstances were. The record contains neither a statement of facts nor a written stipulation of evidence. Nor does appellant's *262 brief analyze the application of the statutes to the facts of the case. The state of the record thus permits review of the facial constitutionality only. Appellant takes care to deny that his challenge rests on the ground of vagueness or overbreadth. He does not dispute the holding of Sewell v. State, 238 Ga. 495, 233 S.E.2d 187 (1977), appeal dismissed for want of a substantial federal question, sub. nom. Sewell v. Georgia, 435 U.S. 982, 98 S. Ct. 1635, 56 L. Ed. 2d 76 (1978), which rejected a vagueness and overbreadth challenge to a Georgia statute virtually the same as the statute at issue here. Nor does appellant claim that the statutes deny him equal protection of the law. Appellant claims, rather, that the statutes violate the fundamental right of privacy announced in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1965) and elaborated in subsequent cases, notably Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S. Ct. 705, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147 (1973). In Roe v. Wade, supra, the Court wrote:""The Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy. In a line of decisions, however, going back perhaps as far as Union Pacific R. Co. v. Botsford, 141 U.S. 250, 251 [11 S. Ct. 1000, 1001, 35 L. Ed. 734] (1891), the Court has recognized that a right of personal privacy, or a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy, does exist under the Constitution. In varying contexts, the Court or individual Justices have, indeed, found at least the roots of that right in the First Amendment, Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, 564 [89 S. Ct. 1243, 1247, 22 L. Ed. 2d 542] (1969); in the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 8-9 [88 S. Ct. 1868, 1872-1873, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889] (1968), Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 350 [88 S. Ct. 507, 510, 19 L. Ed. 2d 576] (1967), Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616 [6 S. Ct. 524, 29 L. Ed. 746] (1886), see Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 478 [48 S. Ct. 564, 572, 72 L. Ed. 944] (1928) (Brandeis, J., dissenting); in the penumbras of the Bill of Rights, Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. at 484-485 [85 S.Ct. at 1681-1682]; in the Ninth Amendment, id., at 486 [85 S. Ct. at 1682] (Goldberg, J., concurring); or in the concept of liberty guaranteed by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment, see Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399 [43 S. Ct. 625, 626, 67 L. Ed. 1042] (1923). These decision make it clear that only personal rights that can be deemed `fundamental' or `implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,' Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325 [58 S. Ct. 149, 152, 82 L. Ed. 288] (1937), are included in this guarantee of personal privacy. They also make it clear that the right has some extension to activities relating to marriage, Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 12 [87 S. Ct. 1817, 1823, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1010] (1967); procreation, Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 541-542 [62 S. Ct. 1110, 1113-1114, 86 L. Ed. 1655] (1942); contraception, Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. at 453-454 [92 S.Ct. at 1038-1039] [31 L. Ed. 2d 349]; id., at 460, 463-465 [92 S. Ct. at 1041, 1043-1044] (White, J., concurring in result); family relationships, Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166 [64 S. Ct. 438, 442, 88 L. Ed. 645] (1944); and child rearing and education, Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 535 [45 S. Ct. 571, 573, 69 L. Ed. 1070] (1925), Meyer v. Nebraska, supra. ""This right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy...."" 410 U.S. at 152-53, 93 S. Ct. at 726-27. Appellant argues that:""Clearly one significant element of the constitutional right of privacy is the individual's interest in making certain kinds of important decision."" Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 599-600 [, 97 S. Ct. 869, 876-877, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64, 73 (1977)]. *263 ""... [I]t is clear that the personal decisions recognized as within the right of privacy must meet at least two criteria. First, such decisions must be essentially personal in nature involving matters of primary concern either to the individual involved or to his immediate family. See, e.g., Eisenstadt v. Baird, [405 U.S. 438, at 453, 92 S. Ct. at 1038] (decision must be one `fundamentally affecting a person'). Secondly, the decision must profoundly affect the individual's personal life and have little, if any, impact upon others or society in general."" [citation omitted]. Appellant concludes that:""Under the foregoing principles, it is clear beyond argument that the use, and by necessary implication the commercial distribution, of certain types of `sexual devices' are constitutionally protected activities."" Thus the question is: Does the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee a citizen the right to stimulate his, her or another's genitals with an object designed or marketed as useful primarily for that purpose? Put another way, is there a right to stimulate human genital organs with an object designed or marketed as useful primarily for that purpose, such that the right is a ""fundamental"" one ""implicit in the concept of ordered liberty""? Roe v. Wade, supra, quoting Palko v. Connecticut. The statute does not criminalize the use of obscene devices, or the mere possession of such devices without the intent to promote them. Nevertheless, appellant argues that by inhibiting the citizen's ability to acquire obscene devices, the statute unconstitutionally burdens the citizen's fundamental right to possess and use them. Appellant relies on the line of cases holding that the right to decide whether to bear or beget a child is a fundamental right under the Fourteenth Amendment. The line began with the dissent in Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 457, 81 S. Ct. 1752, 6 L. Ed. 2d 989 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting) and continued through Griswold v. Connecticut, supra, and Eisenstadt v. Baird, supra, to Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U.S. 678, 97 S. Ct. 2010, 52 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1977). In Carey the Court announced the full import of the earlier cases in the line, as follows:""Appellants argue that this Court has not accorded a `right of access to contraceptives' the status of a fundamental aspect of personal liberty. They emphasize that Griswold v. Connecticut, struck down a state prohibition of the use of contraceptives, and so had no occasion to discuss laws `regulating their manufacture of sale.' 381 U.S. at 485, 85 S. Ct. at 1682. Eisenstadt v. Baird, was decided under the Equal Protection Clause, holding that `whatever the rights of the individual to access to contraceptives may be, the rights must be the same for the unmarried and the married alike.' 405 U.S., at 453, 92 S.Ct., at 1038. Thus appellants argue that neither case should be treated as reflecting upon the State's power to limit or prohibit distribution of contraceptives to any persons, married or unmarried. But see id., at 463-464, 92 S.Ct., at 1043-1044 (White, J., concurring in result). ""The fatal fallacy in this argument is that it overlooks the underlying premise of those decisions that the Constitution protects `the right of the individual ... to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into ... the decision whether to bear or beget a child.' Id., at 453, 92 S.Ct., at 1038. Griswold did state that by `forbidding the use of contraceptives rather than regulating their manufacture or sale,' the Connecticut statute there had a `maximum destructive impact' on privacy rights. 381 U.S., at 485, 85 S.Ct., at 1682. This intrusion into `the sacred precincts of marital bedrooms' made that statute particularly `repulsive.' Id., at 485-486, 85 S. Ct. at 1682. But subsequent decisions have made clear that the constitutional protection of individual autonomy in matters of childbearing is not dependent on that element. Eisenstadt v. Baird, holding that the protection is not limited to *264 married couples, characterized the protected right as the `decision whether to bear or beget a child.' 405 U.S., at 453, 92 S. Ct. at 1038 (emphasis added). Similarly, Roe v. Wade, held that the Constitution protects `a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.' 410 U.S., at 153, 93 S.Ct., at 727 (emphasis added). See also Whalen v. Roe, supra, 429 U.S., at 599-600, 97 S.Ct., at 876-877, and n. 26. These decisions put Griswold in proper perspective. Griswold may no longer be read as holding only that a State may not prohibit a married couple's use of contraceptives. Read in light of its progeny, the teaching of Griswold is that the Constitution protects individual decisions in matters of childbearing from unjustified intrusion by the State. ""Restrictions on the distribution of contraceptives clearly burden the freedom to make such decision...."" Appellant analogizes from the contraception cases as follows:""... [A]ny attempt by the State to criminalize the use or sale of condoms, diaphragms or similar birth control aids would clearly violate the constitutional right of privacy recognized in Griswold, [supra] and Carey, [supra]. Unless there is some exotic and heretofore unarticulated distinction to be drawn between sexual devices that stimulate and gratify and sexual devices that do not, the same principle of freedom of choice operable in Griswold and Carey with respect to a matter of peculiarly private concern likewise invalidates any attempt by the State to control an individual's private modes of sexual stimulation or gratification."" A similar argumentthat a right to use or possess implies a right of access or acquisitionwas repeatedly urged on the Supreme Court after its decision in Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, 89 S. Ct. 1243, 22 L. Ed. 2d 542 (1969). In that case police, authorized by warrant, searched Stanley's home for evidence of bookmaking. They found instead an obscene film. Georgia prosecuted Stanley for ""knowingly hav[ing] possession of ... obscene matter."" The Supreme Court invalidated the conviction, holding that ""the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit making mere private possession of obscene material a crime."" The holding rests on both the First Amendment right of free speech and also ""the [fundamental] right to be free, except in very limited circumstances, from unwanted governmental intrusions into one's privacy."" Stanley v. Georgia, supra. A theory developed that, because Stanley established the right to possess obscene material in the privacy of the home, there must be a correlative right to receive it, transport it, and distribute it. The Court has consistently rejected this reasoning. See United States v. 12 200-Ft. Reels of Super 8mm. Film, 413 U.S. 123, 93 S. Ct. 2665, 37 L. Ed. 2d 500 (1973); United States v. Orito, 413 U.S. 139, 93 S. Ct. 2674, 37 L. Ed. 2d 513 (1973); United States v. Reidel, 402 U.S. 351, 91 S. Ct. 1410, 28 L. Ed. 2d 813 (1971); United States v. Thirty-Seven Photographs, 402 U.S. 363, 91 S. Ct. 1400, 28 L. Ed. 2d 822 (1971). These cases held that, despite Stanley v. Georgia, the government may constitutionally proscribe the mailing (Reidel, supra), importation (12 200-Ft. Reels, supra; Thirty-Seven Photographs, supra), and transportation on interstate carrier (Orito, supra) of obscene material. The holdings in Reidel, Thirty-Seven Photographs, and Orito ""negate the idea that some zone of constitutionally protected privacy follows [obscene] material when it is moved outside the home area protected by Stanley."" Orito, supra; accord, Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 93 S. Ct. 2628, 37 L. Ed. 2d 446 (1973). Moreover, the states may constitutionally proscribe the sale or commercial exhibition of obscene material. Kaplan v. California, 413 U.S. 115, 93 S. Ct. 2680, 37 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1973); Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, supra. Thus the Court held in Stanley that there is a fundamental privacy right to *265 possession of obscene material in the home which the State may not infringe. In subsequent cases, however, the Court made it clear that this homebound privacy right does not carry with it a right of access to obscene material. By contrast, the Court ultimately held in Carey that the right to decide whether to bear or beget a child may not be unnecessarily burdened by restrictions on access to contraceptives. The question in the instant case then comes down to this: Are obscene devices like obscene materialwhich the State may deny access toor like contraceptives which citizens must be free to obtain? The answer lies in the difference between the uses of obscene material and contraceptives. Contraceptives are used to implement the decision not to beget a child. Because the right to make this decision is protected by the Constitution, access to the means to implement it may not be unnecessarily burdened by the State. Obscene material, by contrast, is used for sexual stimulation and gratification. ""Obscene material is material which deals with sex in a manner appealing to prurient interest ... I.e., material having a tendency to excite lustful thoughts."" Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 77 S. Ct. 1304, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1498 (1957); accord, Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S. Ct. 2607, 37 L. Ed. 2d 419 (1973). Yet ""In an unbroken series of cases extending over a long stretch of [the Supreme] Court's history, it has been accepted as a postulate that `the primary requirements of decency may be enforced against obscene publications.'"" Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, supra, quoting Kingsley Books, Inc. v. Brown, 354 U.S. 436, 77 S. Ct. 1325, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1469 (1975), quoting Near v. Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697, 51 S. Ct. 625, 75 L. Ed. 2d 1357 (1931). Accordingly, legislatures may act on this postulate and restrain obscenity to protect ""the social interest in order and morality."" Roth v. United States, supra, quoting Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 62 S. Ct. 766, 86 L. Ed. 1031 (1942) (emphasis in Roth); see also, Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, supra. Appellant maintains that ""[obscene] devices are designed, purchased and used consensually only for the purpose of sexual stimulation and gratification."" Thus obscene material and obscene devices are used for the same purpose. Appellant does not claim that obscene devices serve, like contraceptives, to implement the constitutionally protected decision not to beget a child. The Penal Code sets out its objectives as follows:""The general purposes of this code are to establish a system of prohibitions, penalties, and correctional measures to deal with conduct that unjustifiedly and inexcusably causes or threatens harm to those individual or public interests for which state protection is appropriate."" Section 1.02, supra (emphasis added). The Penal Code's prohibitions against obscene devices are found in Title 9. ""Offenses Against Public Order and Decency."" In the face of the Constitution's explicit protection of speech by the First Amendment, the states and the federal government may suppress traffic in obscene expression. We hold it is also appropriate for the State to act to protect the ""social interest in order and morality"" (Roth, supra) or ""decency"" (Paris Adult Theatre I, supra) by restraining traffic in non-communicative objects designed or marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs. Moreover, we do not discern in the language of the Constitution or in the principles of the Supreme Court cases discussed above any fundamental right to use obscene devices. If there is such a right, however, we find that the exercise of that right is protected by the rule of Stanley v. Georgia, supra. By analogy with the cases *266 limiting Stanley and upholding the denial of access to obscene material outside the home, we hold that the State may criminalize promotion of and possession with intent to promote obscene devices. Thus we distinguish between contraceptives and obscene devices. This distinction strikes us as no more ""exotic,"" in appellant's words, than the distinction between protected and obscene expression. See United States v. Gentile, 211 F. Supp. 383 (D.Md.1962) (distinguishing dildoes from condoms in federal obscenity prosecution). Appellant's second contention invokes Art. I, Sec. 19 of the Texas Constitution, which provides as follows:""No citizen of this State shall be deprived of life, liberty, property, privileges or immunities, or in any manner disfranchised, except by the due course of the law of the land."" Appellant claims that the prohibition of obscene devices arbitrarily deprives him of a substantive economic right, the right to use and dispose of his property as he pleases, in violation of Art. I, Sec. 19. Appellant claims:""There is simply no justification, hypothetical or otherwise, for the legislation... If the possession or use of the enumerated devices to stimulate or gratify sexual desire is not a crime (and is, indeed, a constitutionally protected right), by what muddled logic can the transfer of the device to the ultimate consumer be deemed a criminal offense? There is simply no articulable interest advanced by these laws other than to ineffectually assuage some purported community outrage directed against an intrinsically innocous [sic] piece of latex."" [emphasis by appellant]. Appellant concludes that the statutes exceed the State's police power. This Court's many decisions affirming obscenity convictions implicitly recognize and uphold the State's authority to ban obscenity under the police power. See also Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, supra: ""[The Supreme] Court has consistently held that obscene material is not protected by the First Amendment as a limitation on the state police power by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment."" We hold that the rationale justifying the State's exercise of the police power against obscene expressionthat is, the protection of the social interest in order and moralityalso justifies the State in criminalizing the promotion of objects designed or marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs. The statute does not violate Art. I, Sec. 19 of the Texas Constitution. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. CLINTON, Judge, dissenting. Whether an answer is correct may well depend on how the question is framed. From its perception of the issues, the majority's question is:""Put another way, is there a right to stimulate human genital organs with an object designed or marketed as useful primarily for that purpose, such that the right is a `fundamental' one `implicit in the concept of ordered liberty'? Roe v. Wade, supra, quoting Palko v. Connecticut."" In Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 58 S. Ct. 149, 82 L. Ed. 288 (1937), the Supreme Court was deciding whether a statute permitting appeals in criminal cases to be taken by the State infringed the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Id., U.S. at 320, S.Ct. at 149. In the course of coming to its conclusions that execution of the sentence against him ""will not deprive appellant of his life without due process of law assured to him by the Fourteenth Amendment,"" id., U.S. at 322, S.Ct. at 150, and that his conviction ""is not in derogation of any privileges or immunities that belong to him as a citizen of the United States,"" id., U.S. at *267 328, S.Ct. at 153, the Supreme Court pointed to instances in which certain protections afforded by particular provisions of the Bill of Rights had been ""incorporated"" into the Fourteenth Amendment, and stated:""In these and other situations immunities that are valid as against the federal government by force of the specific pledges of particular amendments have been found to be implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, and thus, through the Fourteenth Amendment, become valid as against the states."" Id., U.S. at 324-325, S.Ct. at 151-152. Then in the next paragraph of the opinion there is mention of rights such as trial by jury and immunity from prosecution except upon indictment that ""may have value and importance [but] are not of the very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty. To abolish them is not to violate a `principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.' [Citations omitted.]""So when Justice Blackmun came to write the opinion of the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S. Ct. 705, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147 (1973), he sought to sustain a constitutional ""right of personal privacy"" by identifying decisions which had found one source or another of that right""decisions mak[ing] it clear that only personal rights that can be deemed `fundamental' or `implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,' Palko v. Connecticut, [supra] are included in this guarantee of personal privacy."" He then catalogued several decisions showing activities to which the right of privacy had been extended, and concluded:""This right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's general reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy."" Id., 410 U.S. at 152, 93 S. Ct. at 727. Thus if one must be posed, the question is more properly framed as follows:Whether the constitutional right of personal privacy is broad enough to encompass a person's decision to engage in private consensual sexual activity that includes stimulating human genital organs with an object designed to be primarily useful for that purpose? If the answer is in the affirmative, then it follows from what the majority itself says is the ""full import"" of the ""contraception cases"" that ""[r]estrictions of the distribution of [such objects] clearly burden the freedom to make such decisions."" The answer given by the majority to its own question is derived from bits and pieces of opinions deciding First Amendment law pertaining to obscenity. Particularly favored is Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 77 S. Ct. 1304, 37 L. Ed. 2d 419 (1973). But Roth takes care to explain that ""sex and obscenity are not synonymous,"" id., U.S. at 487, S.Ct. at 1310. *268 Obscene material is condemned because of its ""tendency to excite lustful thoughts,"" Roth ibid, n. 20. Sex is sexually motivated behavior or phenomena""a great and mysterious motive force in human life [that] has indisputably been a subject of absorbing interest to mankind through the ages,"" Roth, supra, U.S. at 487, S.Ct. at 1310. An unwritten but necessary premise in both abortion and contraception cases is that the constitutional personal right of privacy in such matters of personal liberty encompasses the threshold decision of whether to engage in sexual activity at all. When the first decision is to indulge in one of ""the most intimate of human activities and relationships,"" Carey, supra, U.S. at 685, S.Ct. at 2016, naturally involving ""the stimulation of human genital organs,"" whether to use contraceptives in order to prevent conception or, as the majority phrases it, ""to implement the decision not to beget a child"" is a secondary decision. That the Constitution provides the freedom to make the second decision necessarily means that the right to make the first one is protected. ""If the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child."" Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 453, 92 S. Ct. 1029, 1038, 31 L. Ed. 2d 349 (1974). If such decisions are ""among the most private and sensitive,"" Carey, supra, U.S. at 685, S.Ct. at 2016, the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to engage in private consensual sexual activity in the first instances must be practically invulnerable. The majority need not look for Supreme Court decisions to find ""any fundamental right to use ... devices"" that are said to be obscene. It is sufficient that there is a constitutional right to personal privacy broad enough to encompass a person's decision to engage in private consensual sexual activity in any manner or means not proscribed by law. ""The makers of our Constitution undertook to secure conditions favorable to the pursuit of happiness. * * * They sought to protect Americans in their beliefs, their thoughts, their emotions and their sensations. They conferred, as against the Government, the right to be let alonethe most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized man."" Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 478, 48 S. Ct. 564, 572, 72 L. Ed. 944, 956 (1928) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). They did not contemplate that exercise of the right could be infringed by notions of ""the social interest in order and morality,"" that the Supreme Court found in Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 62 S. Ct. 766, 86 L. Ed. 1031 (1942), justified a State in proscribing and punishing uttering ""`fighting' words"" to a City Marshall on a public sidewalk near the entrance to City Hall. I respectfully dissent. TEAGUE, Judge, dissenting. After a bench trial, Kenneth Alan Yorko, appellant, was convicted of ""possess[ing] with intent to sell an obscene device, namely, a dildo, knowing the content and character of the device."" Punishment was assessed at three days' confinement in the Harris County jail and a $750 fine. This offense is circumscribed by the provisions of V.T.C.A., Penal Code, Sections 43.21(a)(7) and 43.23(c)(1). The latter provides in part that a person commits an offense if, knowing its content and character, he possesses any obscene device with intent to promote it. The word ""promote"" is statutorily defined to mean ""to manufacture, *269 issue, sell, give, provide, lend, mail, deliver, transfer, transmit, publish, distribute, circulate, disseminate, present, exhibit, or advertise, or to offer or agree to do same."" ""Obscene device"" is statutorily defined to mean ""a device, including a dildo or artificial vagina, designed or marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs."" Sec. 43.21(a)(7), supra. A ""dildo"" is not defined in the Penal Code. However, its common definition is that it is an inanimate object or device, designed in the form of an erect penis, which, in its manufactured state, can only be seen or touched. See Hall v. State, 661 S.W.2d 101 (Tex.Cr.App.1983) (Teague, J., Concurring Opinion). A dildo may be used to stimulate human genital organs, but it need not be so used. There are no exceptions provided in the statute. Any person who, knowing its content and character, possesses with intent to ""promote"" a dildo is guilty of violating the statute. A physician, a psychiatrist, or a psychologist may be guilty of committing such crime. Whether the promotion of the object occurs in the privacy of one's bedroom or out in the general public makes no difference. A husband who provides his wife with a commercially available vibrator in the form of a dildo in the privacy of their bedroom may be just as guilty as a psychologist who provides the wife such in the privacy of his office. In the trial court, appellant filed a motion to quash the information, asserting therein that V.T.C.A., Penal Code Sections 43.21(a)(7) and 43.23(c)(1) were both unconstitutional, ""under the due process ... [clause] of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and the equivalent provision of the Constitution of Texas."" The motion was denied by the trial court. On appeal, appellant further argued that the statutes violated his right to privacy guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution. He lastly argued that the statutes are an excessive use of the State's police power under the Texas Constitution. The Fourteenth Court of Appeals, in a unanimous opinion by its Chief Justice, Hon. J. Curtiss Brown, affirmed, see Yorko v. State, 681 S.W.2d 633 (Tex.App.1984) and held that the above statutes are not unconstitutional under either the United States or Texas' Constitutions. In rejecting appellant's assertion that the statutes are unconstitutional, the Court of Appeals started with the premise that a dildo is an ""obscene device"" and that one has no right of privacy to an obscene device. It held: ""The United States Supreme Court has stated that there is no privacy right implicit in obscene displays in public places. Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 2628, 2640 (1973). The right to privately possess obscene material [or an obscene device] is simply not at issue when such material is offered for sale to the public. Goodwin v. State, 514 S.W.2d 942, 944 (Tex.Cr.App.1974)."" In Red Bluff Drive-In, Inc. v. Vance, 648 F.2d 1020 (5th Cir.1981), cert. denied 455 U.S. 913, 102 S. Ct. 1264, 71 L. Ed. 2d 453 (1982), the Fifth Circuit had occasion to address the validity of Sec. 43.21(a)(7), supra. That Court pointed out that the language of the Texas statute is patterned on the Georgia obscenity statute, Ga.Code Sec. 26-2101(c), and also pointed out that the Georgia Supreme Court, see Sewell v. State, 238 Ga. 495, 233 S.E.2d 187 (1977), had rejected the defendant's assertion that the statute was vague and overbroad and found no constitutional problem with Georgia's prohibition on the sale of such devices. The Fifth Circuit next pointed out that the United States Supreme Court had dismissed Sewell's appeal for want of a substantial federal question. Sewell v. Georgia, 435 U.S. 982, 98 S. Ct. 1635, 56 L. Ed. 2d 76 (1978). It then concluded: ""Thus, the constitutional propriety of the Texas counterpart to this Georgia obscenity provision is clear."" (1028). This Court's majority opinion in this cause correctly points out that we do not have a transcription of the statement of the facts, or a stipulation of evidence, before us. We do not even have the dildo that *270 appellant was convicted of possessing. Thus, in making the determination whether the above statutes are constitutionally valid, we are dealing with an extremely sparse record on appeal. I find that the gist of what appellant asserts before us is that he claims that he has a constitutional right to privacy that authorizes him to sell dildos in public to those persons who desire them. Appellant, however, does not claim that what he wants to sell is protected by the First Amendment. This is easily understandable when one considers that there is no case authority that stands for the proposition that the sale of an object or device such as a dildo is protected by the First Amendment provisions of either the Federal or State Constitutions. E.g., Hall v. State, 661 S.W.2d 101 (Tex.Cr.App.1983) (Teague, J., Concurring Opinion). Appellant claims, however, that prosecution for sale of a dildo ""is nonsensical; that the State cannot articulate any reason, compelling or otherwise, why public sale of a dildo should be outlawed."" I believe what Justice Stewart stated in the dissenting opinion he filed in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1965), which case held that a Connecticut law which prohibited the distribution of contraceptive devices unconstitutionally intruded upon the right of marital privacy, is responsive to appellant's statement: ""I think this is an uncommonly silly law. As a practical matter, the law is obviously unenforceable, except in the oblique context of the present case. As a philosophical matter, I believe the use of contraceptives in the relationship of marriage should be left to personal and private choice, based upon each individual's moral, ethical, and religious beliefs. As a matter of social policy, I think professional counsel about methods of birth control should be available to all, so that each individual's choice can be meaningfully made. But we are not asked in this case to say whether we think this law is unwise, or even asinine. We are asked to hold that it violates the United States Constitution."" Except for the fact that we are dealing with a sexual device, I adopt and approve all of what Justice Stewart has stated as far as it may be applied to this cause. It is not now open to question that each State has the right, under its police power, to safeguard the health, comfort, safety, morals, and general welfare of its citizens by such laws as are reasonable and necessary for that purpose. Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, 53, 25 S. Ct. 539, 49 L. Ed. 937 (1905). The exercise of this power is a legitimate legislative function, and this Court does not sit as a superlegislative body to determine the desirability or propriety of statutes enacted by the Legislature. Griswold v. Connecticut, supra, 381 U.S., at 482, 85 S. Ct. at 1680. If a law is legislatively enacted under the police power of the State to protect the health, comfort, safety, morals, and general welfare of its citizens, and such has a real, substantial relation to that object, the courts will not strike it down upon grounds merely of public policy or expediency. Lombardo v. Dallas, 124 Tex. 1, 73 S.W.2d 475 (1934). Courts favor the constitutionality of statutes and the cardinal principle of statutory construction is to save, not to destroy. Our courts are obligated to uphold such laws and avoid doubts as to the constitutionality whenever possible. The courts should be reluctant to strike down a statute as unconstitutional unless and only when it is absolutely necessary on the facts or circumstances presented by the particular case. In the field of constitutional law, no stronger presumption exists than that which favors the validity of a statute. A legislative act must be sustained unless it is clearly invalid beyond a reasonable doubt. The strength of this presumption is nurtured by an appreciation of the needs of the people and by a recognition that laws are directed to problems manifested by experience. The courts will not exert ingenuity to find reasons for holding a statute invalid; rather, they will sustain its validity even if it is valid by the narrowest of margins. This is particularly true when *271 the statute pertains to governmental policies established in the interest of public health, safety, morals, and welfare, Vernon v. San Antonio, 406 S.W.2d 236 (Tex. Civ.App.Corpus Christi 1966), and the statute does not involve proscribing that which is constitutionally protected. Thus, where there is a challenge to the constitutionality of a statute, it is vested with a presumption of validity and this Court must construe it so as to uphold its constitutionality when possible. V.T.C.A., Penal Code, Section 1.05(b); Art. 5429b-2, Sec. 3.01(1), V.A.C.S.; Ely v. State, 582 S.W.2d 416 (Tex.Cr.App.1979). I agree that the issue before us does not implicate the doctrine of vagueness, because the terms of the statute clearly put one on notice that which is proscribed. Conally v. General Construction Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S. Ct. 126, 127, 70 L. Ed. 322 (1926). But, the doctrine of overbreadth, a legal concept parallel to the doctrine of vagueness, does not speak to the issue of notice and adequate standards, but, instead, speaks to the issue of whether the language of the statute is so broad that it criminalizes conduct protected under the Constitutions. Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 93 S. Ct. 2908, 37 L. Ed. 2d 830 (1973); Dombrowski, et al. v. Eastland, et al., 387 U.S. 82, 87 S. Ct. 1425, 18 L.E.2d 577 (1966). Before Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S. Ct. 2607, 37 L.E.2d 419 (1973), which held that printed material was not protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution if the material, when viewed as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest in sex, and the material portrays ""Sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, in which, taken as a whole [does] not have serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value,"" was decided, this Court had stated the following: ""The legislature [of Texas] has made certain activities in obscenity the subject of criminal liability, and, with the exception of private possession for personal use, Stanley v. Georgia, the federal constitution does not immunize those properly convicted from the sanctions imposed."" Bryers v. State, 480 S.W.2d 712, 716 (Tex.Cr.App.1972). In light of what the majority opinion states and holds, it is obvious to me that it fails to appreciate the importance that human sexual devices play in our present society, opting instead to put all human sexual devices under the umbrella labeled ""obscene devices."" A ""dildo,"" however, is not a human sexual device that is covered by a first amendment protected expression right, for the simple reason that it expresses nothing. See Andrews v. State, 652 S.W.2d 370 (Tex. Cr.App.1983); Hall v. State, supra; also see Gitlow v. New York, 268 U.S. 652, 45 S. Ct. 625, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1138 (1925). However, the majority appears to hold that because this inanimate object has been declared by the Legislature to be an ""obscene device"" there is no way that one might have a constitutionally protected right to privacy in such an object. An ""Obscene device"" is legislatively defined to be a device, including a dildo or artificial vagina, designed or marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs. Sec. 43.21(a)(7). However, therein lies the problem. Nowhere does the statute prescribe any guidelines or standards by which one might make the factual determination whether what is called ""a dildo"" is an ""obscene device."" Facial overbreadth will not be invoked, however, when a limiting construction can be placed on the challenged statute. Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 85 S. Ct. 1116, 14 L. Ed. 2d 22 (1965). It is not now open to debate that the above statutes include far reaching prohibitions that the State cannot legitimately control. Red Bluff Drive-In, Inc. v. Vance, supra. Also see the dissenting opinion that Judge Clinton has filed in this cause. Appellant does not refer us to any legal authority, and my research has yet to reveal *272 any, that expressly states or holds that knowing possession of a dildo in public, however such object or device might be defined, with intent to sale, is either a Federal or State constitutionally protected right. Thus, this appears to be a case of first impression. It is obvious that appellant's attack upon the statutes rests in his claim that they infringe upon his constitutional right to privacy, i.e., the constitutional right to privacy is without a zone of privacy which might otherwise surround a seller or giver of an object such as a dildo. E.g., Goodwin v. State, 514 S.W.2d 942 (Tex.Cr.App. 1974). What is the real legal distinction between a seller or giver of rubbers or contraceptive devices and a seller or giver of dildos? The Supreme Court has seen fit to give the seller or giver of rubbers or contraceptive devices a constitutional right to privacy but has not yet seen fit to give the seller or giver of a human sexual device, such as a dildo, such a right. Should, however, in resolving this issue, it not be true that, as Judge Clinton points out in the dissenting opinion he has filed in this cause: ""It is sufficient that there is a constitutional right to personal privacy broad enough to encompass a person's decision to engage in private consensual sexual activity in any manner or means not proscribed by law?"" In this regard, I am aware of the constitutional attacks that have been made against the Georgia statute, which is in all things like our own statute. See Sewell v. State, 238 Ga. 495, 233 S.E.2d 187 (1977), appeal dism'd sub nom. Sewell v. Georgia, supra; Teal v. State, 143 Ga.App. 47, 238 S.E.2d 128 (1977), appeal dism'd sub nom. Teal v. Georgia, 435 U.S. 989, 98 S. Ct. 1639, 56 L. Ed. 2d 79 (1978); and Simpson v. State, 144 Ga.App. 657, 242 S.E.2d 265 (1978), appeal dism'd sub nom. Simpson v. Georgia, 439 U.S. 887, 99 S. Ct. 241, 58 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1978). On each occasion, the United States Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal for want of a substantial federal question. In light of Hicks v. Miranda, 422 U.S. 332, 95 S. Ct. 2281, 45 L. Ed. 2d 223 (1975), the dismissals by the Supreme Court may constitute adverse decisions on the merits of the Federal constitutional claim appellant attempts to assert in this cause. Nevertheless, a careful reading of what the members of the Supreme Court have said in the above cases easily leads one to conclude that they have not yet answered the question that is before this Court. The majority opinion makes a valiant, but unsuccessful, effort to draw a distinction between the sale or receipt of a sexual behavioral device, such as a dildo, and the sale and use of contraceptive devices. However, but because of what the Supreme Court stated and held in Griswold v. Connecticut, supra, Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S. Ct. 705, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147 (1973), and Carey v. Population Services International, et al. 431 U.S. 678, 97 S. Ct. 2010, 52 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1977), its efforts are actually without merit. I would hold that appellant had the constitutional right to sell or give away the dildo he was prosecuted and convicted for possessing. The above challenged statutes are overboard, as applied to the cause, because they reach a constitutionally protected right. Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 92 S. Ct. 2294, 33 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1972). If the State may not deny access to contraceptive devices, how can it deny access to human sexual devices that, as a matter of common knowledge, have much therapeutic value, and are harmless in themselves. We have come too far in the study of human sexual behavior of the human male and female since the day Kinsey, Pomeroy, and Martin wrote their work Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948), and their sequel, Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953), and have learned too much from the scientific research compiled by such persons as Kaplan, Caplan, Silvergalp, Lapichio, Green, Masters, Johnson, McCarthy, McCary, Ryan, Lee, Ellis, Pomeroy, and others to turn the clock back to more unenlightened times, and to approve the distinction the majority attempts *273 to make. The majority's efforts should not be applauded. It is common knowledge today that a person who has problems dealing with sexual behavior can suffer from depression and anxiety reaction, to such an extent that such a problem can cause an identity problem as far as self-image and self-confidence is concerned. It is also common knowledge today that trained experts in the field of human sexual behavior use sexual aids, such as a dildo, in their endeavors to cure their male and female patients' sexual problems. In fact, a Dr. William Simon of Houston, who is an eminently qualified expert in the field of human sexual behavior, has testified that it should be lawful for persons who are not licensed and certified psychologists to distribute, disseminate, give away, or lend such a sexual device as a dildo to others. As to harmful effects, Dr. Simon has testified that ""Insofar as I can see no significant chance of harm or risk to the individual exists. This kind of self-prescribing doesn't strike me as being at all untoward and indeed may well serve many people who have neither the money nor the sophistication to seek more professional help."" Hall v. State, supra, at p. 307 of the transcription of the statement of facts. It is axiomatic that a regulation valid for one sort of enterprise, or in a given set of circumstances, may be invalid for another sort, or for the same enterprise under other circumstances, because the reasonableness of each regulation depends upon the relevant facts. Nebbia v. New York, 291 U.S. 502, 524, 54 S. Ct. 505, 78 L. Ed. 940 (1934). Under the State's police power, as long as the law is reasonable, as applied, and that the means selected have a real and substantial relation to the object sought to be attained, provided that it does not infringe upon or burden a constitutionally protected right, it will be upheld. ""If the laws passed are seen to have a reasonable relation to a proper legislative purpose, and are neither arbitrary nor discriminatory, the requirements of due process are satisfied, and judicial determination to that effect renders a court functus officio ..."" Nebbia v. New York, supra. In this cause, it is not disputed that appellant was squarely on notice that his possession for sale of an unconstitutionally protected device or object, a dildo, was penally prohibited. Without more, the above principles of law would control the disposition that must be made of appellant's contention. However, in this instance, appellant had the right to privacy in the dildo he possessed with intent to sell. Thus, such falls without the prohibited zone of the police power of the State. Cf. Smith v. State, 478 S.W.2d 518 (Tex.Cr.App.1972); Deeds v. State, 474 S.W.2d 718 (Tex.Cr.App.1971). In this instance, the statutes as applied to appellant's act of knowingly possessing in public what has been labeled by the Legislature an obscene device are overbroad, and violate a constitutionally protected right. Cf. McMorris v. State, 516 S.W.2d 927 (Tex.Cr.App.1974). However, but as the Supreme Court pointed out in Carey, supra, such a business as manufacturing and selling such sexual devices as dildos may be regulated in ways that do not infringe protected individual choices. Notwithstanding this principle of law, regulations imposing a burden on such must be narrowly drawn to express only those interests, such as safeguarding health, maintaining medical standards, etc. It should be obvious to anyone that from the little information that the Legislature had before it when it enacted the above statutes, governing the prohibition of knowing public possession, with intent to sell, of a dildo, it did not have before it sufficient evidence to justify what it did on the basis of the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the public. The statutes, encompassing dildos, are unconstitutional. For the above reasons, I must respectfully dissent to the majority opinion sustaining the statutes. *274 MILLER, Judge, dissenting. Perhaps Mr. Justice Brennan has already said it all:""Although there is a remote possibility that a given state court will be the first to discover a latent constitutional issue and to order redress if the issue is properly raised, it is far more likely that the court will fail to appreciate the claim and reject it out of hand."" Mr. Justice Brennan in Reed v. Ross, ___ U.S. ___, 104 S. Ct. 2901, 2910, 82 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1984). I dissent. NOTES ""Promote"" means to manufacture, issue, sell, give, provide, lend, mail, deliver, transfer, transmit, publish, distribute, circulate, disseminate, present, exhibit, or advertise, or to offer or agree to do the same. Sec. 43.21(a)(5), supra. But see Whalen v. Roe, supra, 429 U.S. at 609, 97 S. Ct. at 881, restricting Stanley solely to its First Amendment rationale (Stewart, J., concurring). All emphasis is mine unless otherwise indicated. As to right to trial by jury at least, the dictate was overruled in Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 89 S. Ct. 2056, 23 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1969). Though Justice Blackmun utilized some terminology from Palko, his opinion of the Supreme Court makes plain that a right of privacy flows from the personal ""liberty"" interest that is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Unlike Palko, Roe v. Wade is not concerned with privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States. The majority excerpts a portion from part III of the opinion in Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U.S. 684, 97 S. Ct. 2010, 52 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1977); the issue being addressed is validity of statutory restrictions on ""distribution of nonprescription contraceptives."" Immediately following what the majority quotes the opinion continues:""A total prohibition against sales of contraceptives, for example, would intrude upon individual decisions in matters of procreation and contraception as harshly as a direct ban on their use. Indeed, in practice, a prohibition against all sales, since more easily and less offensively enforced, might have an even more devastating effect upon the freedom to choose contraception. Cf. Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 81 S. Ct. 1752, 6 L. Ed. 2d 989 (1961)."" Id., U.S. at 688-689, S.Ct. at 2017. In saying that ""obscene material and obscene devices are used for the same purpose,"" surely the majority does not mean to equate lustful thoughts with private sexual activity. If it does, some supporting authority would aid one in comprehending the equation. 394 U.S. 557, 89 S. Ct. 1243, 22 L. Ed. 2d 542 (1969). Kenneth Alan YORKO, Appellant,v. The STATE OF Texas, Appellee. *261 Michael A. Maness, Houston, for appellant. John B. Holmes, Jr., Dist. Atty. & Timothy G. Taft, & Vance Christopher, Asst. Dist. Attys., Houston, Robert Huttash, State's Atty., Austin, for the State. Before the court en banc. THOMAS G. DAVIS, Judge. Appellant pled not guilty to a misdemeanor information charging possession with intent to sell an obscene device, namely a dildo. The trial court found appellant guilty and assessed three days in jail and a fine of $750.00. The Fourteenth Court of Appeals (Houston) affirmed the conviction, holding that Sections 43.21(a)(7) and 43.23(c)(1) of the Penal Code do not violate the right of privacy guaranteed by the United States Constitution or deprive citizens of substantive due process under the Texas Constitution. Yorko v. State, 681 S.W.2d 633 (Tex.App.1984). We granted appellant's petition for discretionary review to examine the holdings. Appellant contends that these provisions, ""on their face and as applied in the circumstances of this case, are unconstitutional under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States because they violate the individual right of privacy."" We are unable to review the constitutionality of the statutes ""as applied in the circumstances of this case"" because the record contains no evidence of what those circumstances were. The record contains neither a statement of facts nor a written stipulation of evidence. Nor does appellant's *262 brief analyze the application of the statutes to the facts of the case. The state of the record thus permits review of the facial constitutionality only. Appellant takes care to deny that his challenge rests on the ground of vagueness or overbreadth. He does not dispute the holding of Sewell v. State, 238 Ga. 495, 233 S.E.2d 187 (1977), appeal dismissed for want of a substantial federal question, sub. nom. Sewell v. Georgia, 435 U.S. 982, 98 S. Ct. 1635, 56 L. Ed. 2d 76 (1978), which rejected a vagueness and overbreadth challenge to a Georgia statute virtually the same as the statute at issue here. Nor does appellant claim that the statutes deny him equal protection of the law. Appellant claims, rather, that the statutes violate the fundamental right of privacy announced in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1965) and elaborated in subsequent cases, notably Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S. Ct. 705, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147 (1973). In Roe v. 410 U.S. at 152-53, 93 S. Ct. at 726-27. Thus the question is: Does the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee a citizen the right to stimulate his, her or another's genitals with an object designed or marketed as useful primarily for that purpose? Put another way, is there a right to stimulate human genital organs with an object designed or marketed as useful primarily for that purpose, such that the right is a ""fundamental"" one ""implicit in the concept of ordered liberty""? Roe v. Wade, supra, quoting Palko v. Connecticut. The statute does not criminalize the use of obscene devices, or the mere possession of such devices without the intent to promote them. Nevertheless, appellant argues that by inhibiting the citizen's ability to acquire obscene devices, the statute unconstitutionally burdens the citizen's fundamental right to possess and use them. Appellant relies on the line of cases holding that the right to decide whether to bear or beget a child is a fundamental right under the Fourteenth Amendment. The line began with the dissent in Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 457, 81 S. Ct. 1752, 6 L. Ed. 2d 989 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting) and continued through Griswold v. Connecticut, supra, and Eisenstadt v. Baird, supra, to Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U.S. 678, 97 S. Ct. 2010, 52 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1977). A similar argumentthat a right to use or possess implies a right of access or acquisitionwas repeatedly urged on the Supreme Court after its decision in Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, 89 S. Ct. 1243, 22 L. Ed. 2d 542 (1969). In that case police, authorized by warrant, searched Stanley's home for evidence of bookmaking. They found instead an obscene film. Georgia prosecuted Stanley for ""knowingly hav[ing] possession of ... obscene matter."" The Supreme Court invalidated the conviction, holding that ""the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit making mere private possession of obscene material a crime."" The holding rests on both the First Amendment right of free speech and also ""the [fundamental] right to be free, except in very limited circumstances, from unwanted governmental intrusions into one's privacy."" Stanley v. Georgia, supra. A theory developed that, because Stanley established the right to possess obscene material in the privacy of the home, there must be a correlative right to receive it, transport it, and distribute it. The Court has consistently rejected this reasoning. See United States v. 12 200-Ft. Reels of Super 8mm. Film, 413 U.S. 123, 93 S. Ct. 2665, 37 L. Ed. 2d 500 (1973); United States v. Orito, 413 U.S. 139, 93 S. Ct. 2674, 37 L. Ed. 2d 513 (1973); United States v. Reidel, 402 U.S. 351, 91 S. Ct. 1410, 28 L. Ed. 2d 813 (1971); United States v. Thirty-Seven Photographs, 402 U.S. 363, 91 S. Ct. 1400, 28 L. Ed. 2d 822 (1971). These cases held that, despite Stanley v. Georgia, the government may constitutionally proscribe the mailing (Reidel, supra), importation (12 200-Ft. Reels, supra; Thirty-Seven Photographs, supra), and transportation on interstate carrier (Orito, supra) of obscene material. The holdings in Reidel, Thirty-Seven Photographs, and Orito ""negate the idea that some zone of constitutionally protected privacy follows [obscene] material when it is moved outside the home area protected by Stanley."" Orito, supra; accord, Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 93 S. Ct. 2628, 37 L. Ed. 2d 446 (1973). Moreover, the states may constitutionally proscribe the sale or commercial exhibition of obscene material. Kaplan v. California, 413 U.S. 115, 93 S. Ct. 2680, 37 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1973); Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, supra. Thus the Court held in Stanley that there is a fundamental privacy right to *265 possession of obscene material in the home which the State may not infringe. In subsequent cases, however, the Court made it clear that this homebound privacy right does not carry with it a right of access to obscene material. By contrast, the Court ultimately held in Carey that the right to decide whether to bear or beget a child may not be unnecessarily burdened by restrictions on access to contraceptives. The question in the instant case then comes down to this: Are obscene devices like obscene materialwhich the State may deny access toor like contraceptives which citizens must be free to obtain? The answer lies in the difference between the uses of obscene material and contraceptives. Contraceptives are used to implement the decision not to beget a child. Because the right to make this decision is protected by the Constitution, access to the means to implement it may not be unnecessarily burdened by the State. Obscene material, by contrast, is used for sexual stimulation and gratification. ""Obscene material is material which deals with sex in a manner appealing to prurient interest ... I.e., material having a tendency to excite lustful thoughts."" Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 77 S. Ct. 1304, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1498 (1957); accord, Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S. Ct. 2607, 37 L. Ed. 2d 419 (1973). Yet ""In an unbroken series of cases extending over a long stretch of [the Supreme] Court's history, it has been accepted as a postulate that `the primary requirements of decency may be enforced against obscene publications.'"" Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, supra, quoting Kingsley Books, Inc. v. Brown, 354 U.S. 436, 77 S. Ct. 1325, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1469 (1975), quoting Near v. Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697, 51 S. Ct. 625, 75 L. Ed. 2d 1357 (1931). Accordingly, legislatures may act on this postulate and restrain obscenity to protect ""the social interest in order and morality."" Roth v. United States, supra, quoting Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 62 S. Ct. 766, 86 L. Ed. 1031 (1942) (emphasis in Roth); see also, Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, supra. Appellant maintains that ""[obscene] devices are designed, purchased and used consensually only for the purpose of sexual stimulation and gratification."" Thus obscene material and obscene devices are used for the same purpose. Appellant does not claim that obscene devices serve, like contraceptives, to implement the constitutionally protected decision not to beget a child. Section 1.02, supra (emphasis added). The Penal Code's prohibitions against obscene devices are found in Title 9. ""Offenses Against Public Order and Decency."" In the face of the Constitution's explicit protection of speech by the First Amendment, the states and the federal government may suppress traffic in obscene expression. We hold it is also appropriate for the State to act to protect the ""social interest in order and morality"" (Roth, supra) or ""decency"" (Paris Adult Theatre I, supra) by restraining traffic in non-communicative objects designed or marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs. Moreover, we do not discern in the language of the Constitution or in the principles of the Supreme Court cases discussed above any fundamental right to use obscene devices. If there is such a right, however, we find that the exercise of that right is protected by the rule of Stanley v. Georgia, supra. By analogy with the cases *266 limiting Stanley and upholding the denial of access to obscene material outside the home, we hold that the State may criminalize promotion of and possession with intent to promote obscene devices. Thus we distinguish between contraceptives and obscene devices. This distinction strikes us as no more ""exotic,"" in appellant's words, than the distinction between protected and obscene expression. See United States v. Gentile, 211 F. Supp. 383 (D.Md.1962) (distinguishing dildoes from condoms in federal obscenity prosecution). Appellant's second contention invokes Art. I, Sec. Appellant claims that the prohibition of obscene devices arbitrarily deprives him of a substantive economic right, the right to use and dispose of his property as he pleases, in violation of Art. I, Sec. 19. Appellant concludes that the statutes exceed the State's police power. This Court's many decisions affirming obscenity convictions implicitly recognize and uphold the State's authority to ban obscenity under the police power. See also Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, supra: ""[The Supreme] Court has consistently held that obscene material is not protected by the First Amendment as a limitation on the state police power by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment."" We hold that the rationale justifying the State's exercise of the police power against obscene expressionthat is, the protection of the social interest in order and moralityalso justifies the State in criminalizing the promotion of objects designed or marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs. The statute does not violate Art. I, Sec. 19 of the Texas Constitution. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. CLINTON, Judge, dissenting. Whether an answer is correct may well depend on how the question is framed. In Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 58 S. Ct. 149, 82 L. Ed. 288 (1937), the Supreme Court was deciding whether a statute permitting appeals in criminal cases to be taken by the State infringed the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Id., U.S. at 320, S.Ct. at 149. In the course of coming to its conclusions that execution of the sentence against him ""will not deprive appellant of his life without due process of law assured to him by the Fourteenth Amendment,"" id., U.S. at 322, S.Ct. at 150, and that his conviction ""is not in derogation of any privileges or immunities that belong to him as a citizen of the United States,"" id., U.S. at *267 328, S.Ct. Id., U.S. at 324-325, S.Ct. at 151-152. Then in the next paragraph of the opinion there is mention of rights such as trial by jury and immunity from prosecution except upon indictment that ""may have value and importance [but] are not of the very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty. To abolish them is not to violate a `principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.' [Citations omitted.]"" So when Justice Blackmun came to write the opinion of the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S. Ct. 705, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147 (1973), he sought to sustain a constitutional ""right of personal privacy"" by identifying decisions which had found one source or another of that right""decisions mak[ing] it clear that only personal rights that can be deemed `fundamental' or `implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,' Palko v. Connecticut, [supra] are included in this guarantee of personal privacy."" Id., 410 U.S. at 152, 93 S. Ct. at 727. If the answer is in the affirmative, then it follows from what the majority itself says is the ""full import"" of the ""contraception cases"" that ""[r]estrictions of the distribution of [such objects] clearly burden the freedom to make such decisions."" The answer given by the majority to its own question is derived from bits and pieces of opinions deciding First Amendment law pertaining to obscenity. Particularly favored is Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 77 S. Ct. 1304, 37 L. Ed. 2d 419 (1973). But Roth takes care to explain that ""sex and obscenity are not synonymous,"" id., U.S. at 487, S.Ct. at 1310. *268 Obscene material is condemned because of its ""tendency to excite lustful thoughts,"" Roth ibid, n. 20. Sex is sexually motivated behavior or phenomena""a great and mysterious motive force in human life [that] has indisputably been a subject of absorbing interest to mankind through the ages,"" Roth, supra, U.S. at 487, S.Ct. at 1310. An unwritten but necessary premise in both abortion and contraception cases is that the constitutional personal right of privacy in such matters of personal liberty encompasses the threshold decision of whether to engage in sexual activity at all. When the first decision is to indulge in one of ""the most intimate of human activities and relationships,"" Carey, supra, U.S. at 685, S.Ct. at 2016, naturally involving ""the stimulation of human genital organs,"" whether to use contraceptives in order to prevent conception or, as the majority phrases it, ""to implement the decision not to beget a child"" is a secondary decision. That the Constitution provides the freedom to make the second decision necessarily means that the right to make the first one is protected. Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 453, 92 S. Ct. 1029, 1038, 31 L. Ed. 2d 349 (1974). If such decisions are ""among the most private and sensitive,"" Carey, supra, U.S. at 685, S.Ct. at 2016, the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to engage in private consensual sexual activity in the first instances must be practically invulnerable. The majority need not look for Supreme Court decisions to find ""any fundamental right to use ... devices"" that are said to be obscene. It is sufficient that there is a constitutional right to personal privacy broad enough to encompass a person's decision to engage in private consensual sexual activity in any manner or means not proscribed by law. Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 478, 48 S. Ct. 564, 572, 72 L. Ed. 944, 956 (1928) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). They did not contemplate that exercise of the right could be infringed by notions of ""the social interest in order and morality,"" that the Supreme Court found in Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 62 S. Ct. 766, 86 L. Ed. 1031 (1942), justified a State in proscribing and punishing uttering ""`fighting' words"" to a City Marshall on a public sidewalk near the entrance to City Hall. I respectfully dissent. TEAGUE, Judge, dissenting. After a bench trial, Kenneth Alan Yorko, appellant, was convicted of ""possess[ing] with intent to sell an obscene device, namely, a dildo, knowing the content and character of the device."" Punishment was assessed at three days' confinement in the Harris County jail and a $750 fine. This offense is circumscribed by the provisions of V.T.C.A., Penal Code, Sections 43.21(a)(7) and 43.23(c)(1). The latter provides in part that a person commits an offense if, knowing its content and character, he possesses any obscene device with intent to promote it. The word ""promote"" is statutorily defined to mean ""to manufacture, *269 issue, sell, give, provide, lend, mail, deliver, transfer, transmit, publish, distribute, circulate, disseminate, present, exhibit, or advertise, or to offer or agree to do same."" ""Obscene device"" is statutorily defined to mean ""a device, including a dildo or artificial vagina, designed or marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs."" Sec. 43.21(a)(7), supra. A ""dildo"" is not defined in the Penal Code. However, its common definition is that it is an inanimate object or device, designed in the form of an erect penis, which, in its manufactured state, can only be seen or touched. See Hall v. State, 661 S.W.2d 101 (Tex.Cr.App.1983) (Teague, J., Concurring Opinion). A dildo may be used to stimulate human genital organs, but it need not be so used. There are no exceptions provided in the statute. Any person who, knowing its content and character, possesses with intent to ""promote"" a dildo is guilty of violating the statute. A physician, a psychiatrist, or a psychologist may be guilty of committing such crime. Whether the promotion of the object occurs in the privacy of one's bedroom or out in the general public makes no difference. A husband who provides his wife with a commercially available vibrator in the form of a dildo in the privacy of their bedroom may be just as guilty as a psychologist who provides the wife such in the privacy of his office. In the trial court, appellant filed a motion to quash the information, asserting therein that V.T.C.A., Penal Code Sections 43.21(a)(7) and 43.23(c)(1) were both unconstitutional, ""under the due process ... [clause] of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and the equivalent provision of the Constitution of Texas."" The motion was denied by the trial court. On appeal, appellant further argued that the statutes violated his right to privacy guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution. He lastly argued that the statutes are an excessive use of the State's police power under the Texas Constitution. The Fourteenth Court of Appeals, in a unanimous opinion by its Chief Justice, Hon. J. Curtiss Brown, affirmed, see Yorko v. State, 681 S.W.2d 633 (Tex.App.1984) and held that the above statutes are not unconstitutional under either the United States or Texas' Constitutions. In rejecting appellant's assertion that the statutes are unconstitutional, the Court of Appeals started with the premise that a dildo is an ""obscene device"" and that one has no right of privacy to an obscene device. It held: ""The United States Supreme Court has stated that there is no privacy right implicit in obscene displays in public places. Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 2628, 2640 (1973). The right to privately possess obscene material [or an obscene device] is simply not at issue when such material is offered for sale to the public. Goodwin v. State, 514 S.W.2d 942, 944 (Tex.Cr.App.1974)."" In Red Bluff Drive-In, Inc. v. Vance, 648 F.2d 1020 (5th Cir.1981), cert. denied 455 U.S. 913, 102 S. Ct. 1264, 71 L. Ed. 2d 453 (1982), the Fifth Circuit had occasion to address the validity of Sec. 43.21(a)(7), supra. That Court pointed out that the language of the Texas statute is patterned on the Georgia obscenity statute, Ga.Code Sec. 26-2101(c), and also pointed out that the Georgia Supreme Court, see Sewell v. State, 238 Ga. 495, 233 S.E.2d 187 (1977), had rejected the defendant's assertion that the statute was vague and overbroad and found no constitutional problem with Georgia's prohibition on the sale of such devices. The Fifth Circuit next pointed out that the United States Supreme Court had dismissed Sewell's appeal for want of a substantial federal question. Sewell v. Georgia, 435 U.S. 982, 98 S. Ct. 1635, 56 L. Ed. 2d 76 (1978). It then concluded: ""Thus, the constitutional propriety of the Texas counterpart to this Georgia obscenity provision is clear."" (1028). This Court's majority opinion in this cause correctly points out that we do not have a transcription of the statement of the facts, or a stipulation of evidence, before us. We do not even have the dildo that *270 appellant was convicted of possessing. Thus, in making the determination whether the above statutes are constitutionally valid, we are dealing with an extremely sparse record on appeal. I find that the gist of what appellant asserts before us is that he claims that he has a constitutional right to privacy that authorizes him to sell dildos in public to those persons who desire them. Appellant, however, does not claim that what he wants to sell is protected by the First Amendment. This is easily understandable when one considers that there is no case authority that stands for the proposition that the sale of an object or device such as a dildo is protected by the First Amendment provisions of either the Federal or State Constitutions. E.g., Hall v. State, 661 S.W.2d 101 (Tex.Cr.App.1983) (Teague, J., Concurring Opinion). Appellant claims, however, that prosecution for sale of a dildo ""is nonsensical; that the State cannot articulate any reason, compelling or otherwise, why public sale of a dildo should be outlawed."" I believe what Justice Stewart stated in the dissenting opinion he filed in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1965), which case held that a Connecticut law which prohibited the distribution of contraceptive devices unconstitutionally intruded upon the right of marital privacy, is responsive to appellant's statement: ""I think this is an uncommonly silly law. As a practical matter, the law is obviously unenforceable, except in the oblique context of the present case. As a philosophical matter, I believe the use of contraceptives in the relationship of marriage should be left to personal and private choice, based upon each individual's moral, ethical, and religious beliefs. As a matter of social policy, I think professional counsel about methods of birth control should be available to all, so that each individual's choice can be meaningfully made. But we are not asked in this case to say whether we think this law is unwise, or even asinine. We are asked to hold that it violates the United States Constitution."" Except for the fact that we are dealing with a sexual device, I adopt and approve all of what Justice Stewart has stated as far as it may be applied to this cause. It is not now open to question that each State has the right, under its police power, to safeguard the health, comfort, safety, morals, and general welfare of its citizens by such laws as are reasonable and necessary for that purpose. Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, 53, 25 S. Ct. 539, 49 L. Ed. 937 (1905). The exercise of this power is a legitimate legislative function, and this Court does not sit as a superlegislative body to determine the desirability or propriety of statutes enacted by the Legislature. Griswold v. Connecticut, supra, 381 U.S., at 482, 85 S. Ct. at 1680. If a law is legislatively enacted under the police power of the State to protect the health, comfort, safety, morals, and general welfare of its citizens, and such has a real, substantial relation to that object, the courts will not strike it down upon grounds merely of public policy or expediency. Lombardo v. Dallas, 124 Tex. 1, 73 S.W.2d 475 (1934). Courts favor the constitutionality of statutes and the cardinal principle of statutory construction is to save, not to destroy. Our courts are obligated to uphold such laws and avoid doubts as to the constitutionality whenever possible. The courts should be reluctant to strike down a statute as unconstitutional unless and only when it is absolutely necessary on the facts or circumstances presented by the particular case. In the field of constitutional law, no stronger presumption exists than that which favors the validity of a statute. A legislative act must be sustained unless it is clearly invalid beyond a reasonable doubt. The strength of this presumption is nurtured by an appreciation of the needs of the people and by a recognition that laws are directed to problems manifested by experience. The courts will not exert ingenuity to find reasons for holding a statute invalid; rather, they will sustain its validity even if it is valid by the narrowest of margins. This is particularly true when *271 the statute pertains to governmental policies established in the interest of public health, safety, morals, and welfare, Vernon v. San Antonio, 406 S.W.2d 236 (Tex. Civ.App.Corpus Christi 1966), and the statute does not involve proscribing that which is constitutionally protected. Thus, where there is a challenge to the constitutionality of a statute, it is vested with a presumption of validity and this Court must construe it so as to uphold its constitutionality when possible. V.T.C.A., Penal Code, Section 1.05(b); Art. 5429b-2, Sec. 3.01(1), V.A.C.S.; Ely v. State, 582 S.W.2d 416 (Tex.Cr.App.1979). I agree that the issue before us does not implicate the doctrine of vagueness, because the terms of the statute clearly put one on notice that which is proscribed. Conally v. General Construction Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S. Ct. 126, 127, 70 L. Ed. 322 (1926). But, the doctrine of overbreadth, a legal concept parallel to the doctrine of vagueness, does not speak to the issue of notice and adequate standards, but, instead, speaks to the issue of whether the language of the statute is so broad that it criminalizes conduct protected under the Constitutions. Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 93 S. Ct. 2908, 37 L. Ed. 2d 830 (1973); Dombrowski, et al. v. Eastland, et al., 387 U.S. 82, 87 S. Ct. 1425, 18 L.E.2d 577 (1966). Before Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S. Ct. 2607, 37 L.E.2d 419 (1973), which held that printed material was not protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution if the material, when viewed as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest in sex, and the material portrays ""Sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, in which, taken as a whole [does] not have serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value,"" was decided, this Court had stated the following: ""The legislature [of Texas] has made certain activities in obscenity the subject of criminal liability, and, with the exception of private possession for personal use, Stanley v. Georgia, the federal constitution does not immunize those properly convicted from the sanctions imposed."" Bryers v. State, 480 S.W.2d 712, 716 (Tex.Cr.App.1972). In light of what the majority opinion states and holds, it is obvious to me that it fails to appreciate the importance that human sexual devices play in our present society, opting instead to put all human sexual devices under the umbrella labeled ""obscene devices."" A ""dildo,"" however, is not a human sexual device that is covered by a first amendment protected expression right, for the simple reason that it expresses nothing. See Andrews v. State, 652 S.W.2d 370 (Tex. Cr.App.1983); Hall v. State, supra; also see Gitlow v. New York, 268 U.S. 652, 45 S. Ct. 625, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1138 (1925). However, the majority appears to hold that because this inanimate object has been declared by the Legislature to be an ""obscene device"" there is no way that one might have a constitutionally protected right to privacy in such an object. An ""Obscene device"" is legislatively defined to be a device, including a dildo or artificial vagina, designed or marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs. Sec. 43.21(a)(7). However, therein lies the problem. Nowhere does the statute prescribe any guidelines or standards by which one might make the factual determination whether what is called ""a dildo"" is an ""obscene device."" Facial overbreadth will not be invoked, however, when a limiting construction can be placed on the challenged statute. Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 85 S. Ct. 1116, 14 L. Ed. 2d 22 (1965). It is not now open to debate that the above statutes include far reaching prohibitions that the State cannot legitimately control. Red Bluff Drive-In, Inc. v. Vance, supra. Also see the dissenting opinion that Judge Clinton has filed in this cause. Appellant does not refer us to any legal authority, and my research has yet to reveal *272 any, that expressly states or holds that knowing possession of a dildo in public, however such object or device might be defined, with intent to sale, is either a Federal or State constitutionally protected right. Thus, this appears to be a case of first impression. It is obvious that appellant's attack upon the statutes rests in his claim that they infringe upon his constitutional right to privacy, i.e., the constitutional right to privacy is without a zone of privacy which might otherwise surround a seller or giver of an object such as a dildo. E.g., Goodwin v. State, 514 S.W.2d 942 (Tex.Cr.App. 1974). What is the real legal distinction between a seller or giver of rubbers or contraceptive devices and a seller or giver of dildos? The Supreme Court has seen fit to give the seller or giver of rubbers or contraceptive devices a constitutional right to privacy but has not yet seen fit to give the seller or giver of a human sexual device, such as a dildo, such a right. Should, however, in resolving this issue, it not be true that, as Judge Clinton points out in the dissenting opinion he has filed in this cause: ""It is sufficient that there is a constitutional right to personal privacy broad enough to encompass a person's decision to engage in private consensual sexual activity in any manner or means not proscribed by law?"" In this regard, I am aware of the constitutional attacks that have been made against the Georgia statute, which is in all things like our own statute. See Sewell v. State, 238 Ga. 495, 233 S.E.2d 187 (1977), appeal dism'd sub nom. Sewell v. Georgia, supra; Teal v. State, 143 Ga.App. 47, 238 S.E.2d 128 (1977), appeal dism'd sub nom. Teal v. Georgia, 435 U.S. 989, 98 S. Ct. 1639, 56 L. Ed. 2d 79 (1978); and Simpson v. State, 144 Ga.App. 657, 242 S.E.2d 265 (1978), appeal dism'd sub nom. Simpson v. Georgia, 439 U.S. 887, 99 S. Ct. 241, 58 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1978). On each occasion, the United States Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal for want of a substantial federal question. In light of Hicks v. Miranda, 422 U.S. 332, 95 S. Ct. 2281, 45 L. Ed. 2d 223 (1975), the dismissals by the Supreme Court may constitute adverse decisions on the merits of the Federal constitutional claim appellant attempts to assert in this cause. Nevertheless, a careful reading of what the members of the Supreme Court have said in the above cases easily leads one to conclude that they have not yet answered the question that is before this Court. The majority opinion makes a valiant, but unsuccessful, effort to draw a distinction between the sale or receipt of a sexual behavioral device, such as a dildo, and the sale and use of contraceptive devices. However, but because of what the Supreme Court stated and held in Griswold v. Connecticut, supra, Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S. Ct. 705, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147 (1973), and Carey v. Population Services International, et al. 431 U.S. 678, 97 S. Ct. 2010, 52 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1977), its efforts are actually without merit. I would hold that appellant had the constitutional right to sell or give away the dildo he was prosecuted and convicted for possessing. The above challenged statutes are overboard, as applied to the cause, because they reach a constitutionally protected right. Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 92 S. Ct. 2294, 33 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1972). If the State may not deny access to contraceptive devices, how can it deny access to human sexual devices that, as a matter of common knowledge, have much therapeutic value, and are harmless in themselves. We have come too far in the study of human sexual behavior of the human male and female since the day Kinsey, Pomeroy, and Martin wrote their work Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948), and their sequel, Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953), and have learned too much from the scientific research compiled by such persons as Kaplan, Caplan, Silvergalp, Lapichio, Green, Masters, Johnson, McCarthy, McCary, Ryan, Lee, Ellis, Pomeroy, and others to turn the clock back to more unenlightened times, and to approve the distinction the majority attempts *273 to make. The majority's efforts should not be applauded. It is common knowledge today that a person who has problems dealing with sexual behavior can suffer from depression and anxiety reaction, to such an extent that such a problem can cause an identity problem as far as self-image and self-confidence is concerned. It is also common knowledge today that trained experts in the field of human sexual behavior use sexual aids, such as a dildo, in their endeavors to cure their male and female patients' sexual problems. In fact, a Dr. William Simon of Houston, who is an eminently qualified expert in the field of human sexual behavior, has testified that it should be lawful for persons who are not licensed and certified psychologists to distribute, disseminate, give away, or lend such a sexual device as a dildo to others. As to harmful effects, Dr. Simon has testified that ""Insofar as I can see no significant chance of harm or risk to the individual exists. This kind of self-prescribing doesn't strike me as being at all untoward and indeed may well serve many people who have neither the money nor the sophistication to seek more professional help."" Hall v. State, supra, at p. 307 of the transcription of the statement of facts. It is axiomatic that a regulation valid for one sort of enterprise, or in a given set of circumstances, may be invalid for another sort, or for the same enterprise under other circumstances, because the reasonableness of each regulation depends upon the relevant facts. Nebbia v. New York, 291 U.S. 502, 524, 54 S. Ct. 505, 78 L. Ed. 940 (1934). Under the State's police power, as long as the law is reasonable, as applied, and that the means selected have a real and substantial relation to the object sought to be attained, provided that it does not infringe upon or burden a constitutionally protected right, it will be upheld. ""If the laws passed are seen to have a reasonable relation to a proper legislative purpose, and are neither arbitrary nor discriminatory, the requirements of due process are satisfied, and judicial determination to that effect renders a court functus officio ..."" Nebbia v. New York, supra. In this cause, it is not disputed that appellant was squarely on notice that his possession for sale of an unconstitutionally protected device or object, a dildo, was penally prohibited. Without more, the above principles of law would control the disposition that must be made of appellant's contention. However, in this instance, appellant had the right to privacy in the dildo he possessed with intent to sell. Thus, such falls without the prohibited zone of the police power of the State. Cf. Smith v. State, 478 S.W.2d 518 (Tex.Cr.App.1972); Deeds v. State, 474 S.W.2d 718 (Tex.Cr.App.1971). In this instance, the statutes as applied to appellant's act of knowingly possessing in public what has been labeled by the Legislature an obscene device are overbroad, and violate a constitutionally protected right. Cf. McMorris v. State, 516 S.W.2d 927 (Tex.Cr.App.1974). However, but as the Supreme Court pointed out in Carey, supra, such a business as manufacturing and selling such sexual devices as dildos may be regulated in ways that do not infringe protected individual choices. Notwithstanding this principle of law, regulations imposing a burden on such must be narrowly drawn to express only those interests, such as safeguarding health, maintaining medical standards, etc. It should be obvious to anyone that from the little information that the Legislature had before it when it enacted the above statutes, governing the prohibition of knowing public possession, with intent to sell, of a dildo, it did not have before it sufficient evidence to justify what it did on the basis of the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the public. The statutes, encompassing dildos, are unconstitutional. For the above reasons, I must respectfully dissent to the majority opinion sustaining the statutes. *274 MILLER, Judge, dissenting. Mr. Justice Brennan in Reed v. Ross, ___ U.S. ___, 104 S. Ct. 2901, 2910, 82 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1984). ""Promote"" means to manufacture, issue, sell, give, provide, lend, mail, deliver, transfer, transmit, publish, distribute, circulate, disseminate, present, exhibit, or advertise, or to offer or agree to do the same. Sec. 43.21(a)(5), supra. But see Whalen v. Roe, supra, 429 U.S. at 609, 97 S. Ct. at 881, restricting Stanley solely to its First Amendment rationale (Stewart, J., concurring). All emphasis is mine unless otherwise indicated. As to right to trial by jury at least, the dictate was overruled in Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 89 S. Ct. 2056, 23 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1969). Though Justice Blackmun utilized some terminology from Palko, his opinion of the Supreme Court makes plain that a right of privacy flows from the personal ""liberty"" interest that is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Unlike Palko, Roe v. Wade is not concerned with privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States. The majority excerpts a portion from part III of the opinion in Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U.S. 684, 97 S. Ct. 2010, 52 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1977); the issue being addressed is validity of statutory restrictions on ""distribution of nonprescription contraceptives."" ""A total prohibition against sales of contraceptives, for example, would intrude upon individual decisions in matters of procreation and contraception as harshly as a direct ban on their use. Indeed, in practice, a prohibition against all sales, since more easily and less offensively enforced, might have an even more devastating effect upon the freedom to choose contraception. Cf. Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 81 S. Ct. 1752, 6 L. Ed. 2d 989 (1961)."" Id., U.S. at 688-689, S.Ct. at 2017. In saying that ""obscene material and obscene devices are used for the same purpose,"" surely the majority does not mean to equate lustful thoughts with private sexual activity. If it does, some supporting authority would aid one in comprehending the equation. 394 U.S. 557, 89 S. Ct. 1243, 22 L. Ed. 2d 542 (1969)."		0

Customers at a Buffalo Wild Wings in Eastvale say an employee refused to let them hear the anthem before an NFL game Monday night – which happened to be the 16th anniversary of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. A customer who identified herself as Lori said the employee refused to play the sound of the anthem for one game, but played it for the game before. When he was asked why, the employee — who was not identified – said the anthem is too controversial, and it was company policy not to play it. “No one understood what was so controversial. It’s 9/11, it’s a sporting event, why is it controversial?” she said. Lori took the employee’s picture and posted it on social media, where it spread quickly. She said a manager on Monday apologized immediately for that employee’s behavior. The franchise owner also apologized in a statement and said the company has no policy regarding the matter.		1

Mixture	['slavery']	http://www.theroot.com/	http://www.theroot.com/articles/history/2013/03/black_slave_owners_did_they_exist/	2017/09/18	"Go to permalinkNicolas Augustin Metoyer of Louisiana owned 13 slaves in 1830. He and his 12 family members collectively owned 215 slaves.Editor's note: For those who are wondering about the retro title of this black history series, please take a moment to learn about historian Joel A. Rogers , author of the 1934 book 100 Amazing Facts About the Negro With Complete Proof, to whom these ""amazing facts"" are an homage.(The Root) — 100 Amazing Facts About the Negro No. 21: Did black people own slaves? If so, why?One of the most vexing questions in African-American history is whether free African Americans themselves owned slaves. The short answer to this question, as you might suspect, is yes, of course; some free black people in this country bought and sold other black people, and did so at least since 1654, continuing to do so right through the Civil War. For me, the really fascinating questions about black slave-owning are how many black ""masters"" were involved, how many slaves did they own and why did they own slaves?The answers to these questions are complex, and historians have been arguing for some time over whether free blacks purchased family members as slaves in order to protect them — motivated, on the one hand, by benevolence and philanthropy, as historian Carter G. Woodson put it, or whether, on the other hand, they purchased other black people ""as an act of exploitation,"" primarily to exploit their free labor for profit, just as white slave owners did. The evidence shows that, unfortunately, both things are true. The great African-American historian, John Hope Franklin, states this clearly : ""The majority of Negro owners of slaves had some personal interest in their property."" But, he admits, ""There were instances, however, in which free Negroes had a real economic interest in the institution of slavery and held slaves in order to improve their economic status."" In a fascinating essay reviewing this controversy, R. Halliburton shows that free black people have owned slaves ""in each of the thirteen original states and later in every state that countenanced slavery,"" at least since Anthony Johnson and his wife Mary went to court in Virginia in 1654 to obtain the services of their indentured servant, a black man, John Castor, for life.AdvertisementAnd for a time, free black people could even ""own"" the services of white indentured servants in Virginia as well. Free blacks owned slaves in Boston by 1724 and in Connecticut by 1783; by 1790, 48 black people in Maryland owned 143 slaves. One particularly notorious black Maryland farmer named Nat Butler ""regularly purchased and sold Negroes for the Southern trade,"" Halliburton wrote.Perhaps the most insidious or desperate attempt to defend the right of black people to own slaves was the statement made on the eve of the Civil War by a group of free people of color in New Orleans, offering their services to the Confederacy, in part because they were fearful for their own enslavement: ""The free colored population [native] of Louisiana … own slaves, and they are dearly attached to their native land … and they are ready to shed their blood for her defense. They have no sympathy for abolitionism; no love for the North, but they have plenty for Louisiana … They will fight for her in 1861 as they fought [to defend New Orleans from the British] in 1814-1815."" These guys were, to put it bluntly, opportunists par excellence: As Noah Andre Trudeau and James G. Hollandsworth Jr. explain, once the war broke out, some of these same black men formed 14 companies of a militia composed of 440 men and were organized by the governor in May 1861 into ""the Native Guards, Louisiana,"" swearing to fight to defend the Confederacy. Although given no combat role, the Guards — reaching a peak of 1,000 volunteers — became the first Civil War unit to appoint black officers. AdvertisementLike The Root on Facebook . Follow us on Twitter . When New Orleans fell in late April 1862 to the Union, about 10 percent of these men, not missing a beat, now formed the Native Guard/Corps d'Afrique to defend the Union. Joel A. Rogers noted this phenomenon in his 100 Amazing Facts: ""The Negro slave-holders, like the white ones, fought to keep their chattels in the Civil War."" Rogers also notes that some black men, including those in New Orleans at the outbreak of the War, ""fought to perpetuate slavery.""How Many Slaves Did Blacks Own?So what do the actual numbers of black slave owners and their slaves tell us? In 1830, the year most carefully studied by Carter G. Woodson, about 13.7 percent (319,599) of the black population was free. Of these, 3,776 free Negroes owned 12,907 slaves, out of a total of 2,009,043 slaves owned in the entire United States, so the numbers of slaves owned by black people over all was quite small by comparison with the number owned by white people. In his essay, "" ' The Known World' of Free Black Slaveholders ,"" Thomas J. Pressly, using Woodson's statistics, calculated that 54 (or about 1 percent) of these black slave owners in 1830 owned between 20 and 84 slaves; 172 (about 4 percent) owned between 10 to 19 slaves; and 3,550 (about 94 percent) each owned between 1 and 9 slaves. Crucially, 42 percent owned just one slave.AdvertisementPressly also shows that the percentage of free black slave owners as the total number of free black heads of families was quite high in several states, namely 43 percent in South Carolina, 40 percent in Louisiana, 26 percent in Mississippi, 25 percent in Alabama and 20 percent in Georgia. So why did these free black people own these slaves?It is reasonable to assume that the 42 percent of the free black slave owners who owned just one slave probably owned a family member to protect that person, as did many of the other black slave owners who owned only slightly larger numbers of slaves. As Woodson put it in 1924's Free Negro Owners of Slaves in the United States in 1830, ""The census records show that the majority of the Negro owners of slaves were such from the point of view of philanthropy. In many instances the husband purchased the wife or vice versa … Slaves of Negroes were in some cases the children of a free father who had purchased his wife. If he did not thereafter emancipate the mother, as so many such husbands failed to do, his own children were born his slaves and were thus reported to the numerators.""Moreover, Woodson explains, ""Benevolent Negroes often purchased slaves to make their lot easier by granting them their freedom for a nominal sum, or by permitting them to work it out on liberal terms."" In other words, these black slave-owners, the clear majority, cleverly used the system of slavery to protect their loved ones. That's the good news. AdvertisementLike The Root on Facebook . Follow us on Twitter . But not all did, and that is the bad news. Halliburton concludes, after examining the evidence, that ""it would be a serious mistake to automatically assume that free blacks owned their spouse or children only for benevolent purposes."" Woodson himself notes that a ""small number of slaves, however, does not always signify benevolence on the part of the owner."" And John Hope Franklin notes that in North Carolina, ""Without doubt, there were those who possessed slaves for the purpose of advancing their [own] well-being … these Negro slaveholders were more interested in making their farms or carpenter-shops 'pay' than they were in treating their slaves humanely."" For these black slaveholders, he concludes, ""there was some effort to conform to the pattern established by the dominant slaveholding group within the State in the effort to elevate themselves to a position of respect and privilege."" In other words, most black slave owners probably owned family members to protect them, but far too many turned to slavery to exploit the labor of other black people for profit.Who Were These Black Slave Owners?If we were compiling a ""Rogues Gallery of Black History,"" the following free black slaveholders would be in it:John Carruthers Stanly — born a slave in Craven County, N.C., the son of an Igbo mother and her master, John Wright Stanly — became an extraordinarily successful barber and speculator in real estate in New Bern. As Loren Schweninger points out in Black Property Owners in the South, 1790-1915 , by the early 1820s, Stanly owned three plantations and 163 slaves, and even hired three white overseers to manage his property! He fathered six children with a slave woman named Kitty, and he eventually freed them. Stanly lost his estate when a loan for $14,962 he had co-signed with his white half brother, John, came due. After his brother's stroke, the loan was Stanly's sole responsibility, and he was unable to pay it.AdvertisementWilliam Ellison's fascinating story is told by Michael Johnson and James L. Roark in their book, Black Masters: A Free Family of Color in the Old South . At his death on the eve of the Civil War, Ellison was wealthier than nine out of 10 white people in South Carolina. He was born in 1790 as a slave on a plantation in the Fairfield District of the state, far up country from Charleston. In 1816, at the age of 26, he bought his own freedom, and soon bought his wife and their child. In 1822, he opened his own cotton gin, and soon became quite wealthy. By his death in 1860, he owned 900 acres of land and 63 slaves. Not one of his slaves was allowed to purchase his or her own freedom.Louisiana, as we have seen, was its own bizarre world of color, class, caste and slavery. By 1830, in Louisiana, several black people there owned a large number of slaves, including the following: In Pointe Coupee Parish alone, Sophie Delhonde owned 38 slaves; Lefroix Decuire owned 59 slaves; Antoine Decuire owned 70 slaves; Leandre Severin owned 60 slaves; and Victor Duperon owned 10. In St. John the Baptist Parish, Victoire Deslondes owned 52 slaves; in Plaquemine Brule, Martin Donatto owned 75 slaves; in Bayou Teche, Jean B. Muillion owned 52 slaves; Martin Lenormand in St. Martin Parish owned 44 slaves; Verret Polen in West Baton Rouge Parish owned 69 slaves; Francis Jerod in Washita Parish owned 33 slaves; and Cecee McCarty in the Upper Suburbs of New Orleans owned 32 slaves. Incredibly, the 13 members of the Metoyer family in Natchitoches Parish — including Nicolas Augustin Metoyer, pictured — collectively owned 215 slaves.Antoine Dubuclet and his wife Claire Pollard owned more than 70 slaves in Iberville Parish when they married. According to Thomas Clarkin, by 1864, in the midst of the Civil War, they owned 100 slaves, worth $94,700. During Reconstruction, he became the state's first black treasurer, serving between 1868 and 1878.AdvertisementAndrew Durnford was a sugar planter and a physician who owned the St. Rosalie plantation, 33 miles south of New Orleans. In the late 1820s, David O. Whitten tells us , he paid $7,000 for seven male slaves, five females and two children. He traveled all the way to Virginia in the 1830s and purchased 24 more. Eventually, he would own 77 slaves. When a fellow Creole slave owner liberated 85 of his slaves and shipped them off to Liberia, Durnford commented that he couldn't do that, because ""self interest is too strongly rooted in the bosom of all that breathes the American atmosphere.""It would be a mistake to think that large black slaveholders were only men. In 1830, in Louisiana, the aforementioned Madame Antoine Dublucet owned 44 slaves, and Madame Ciprien Ricard owned 35 slaves, Louise Divivier owned 17 slaves, Genevieve Rigobert owned 16 slaves and Rose Lanoix and Caroline Miller both owned 13 slaves, while over in Georgia, Betsey Perry owned 25 slaves. According to Johnson and Roark, the wealthiest black person in Charleston, S.C., in 1860 was Maria Weston, who owned 14 slaves and property valued at more than $40,000, at a time when the average white man earned about $100 a year. (The city's largest black slaveholders, though, were Justus Angel and Mistress L. Horry, both of whom owned 84 slaves.) In Savannah, Ga., between 1823 and 1828, according to Betty Wood 's Gender, Race, and Rank in a Revolutionary Age, Hannah Leion owned nine slaves, while the largest slaveholder in 1860 was Ciprien Ricard, who had a sugarcane plantation in Louisiana and owned 152 slaves with her son, Pierre — many more that the 35 she owned in 1830. According to economic historian Stanley Engerman, ""In Charleston, South Carolina about 42 percent of free blacks owned slaves in 1850, and about 64 percent of these slaveholders were women."" Greed, in other words, was gender-blind.AdvertisementWhy They Owned SlavesThese men and women, from William Stanly to Madame Ciprien Ricard, were among the largest free Negro slaveholders, and their motivations were neither benevolent nor philanthropic. One would be hard-pressed to account for their ownership of such large numbers of slaves except as avaricious, rapacious, acquisitive and predatory.But lest we romanticize all of those small black slave owners who ostensibly purchased family members only for humanitarian reasons, even in these cases the evidence can be problematic. Halliburton, citing examples from an essay in the North American Review by Calvin Wilson in 1905, presents some hair-raising challenges to the idea that black people who owned their own family members always treated them well:A free black in Trimble County, Kentucky, "" … sold his own son and daughter South, one for $1,000, the other for $1,200."" … A Maryland father sold his slave children in order to purchase his wife. A Columbus, Georgia, black woman — Dilsey Pope — owned her husband. ""He offended her in some way and she sold him … "" Fanny Canady of Louisville, Kentucky, owned her husband Jim — a drunken cobbler — whom she threatened to ""sell down the river."" At New Bern, North Carolina, a free black wife and son purchased their slave husband-father. When the newly bought father criticized his son, the son sold him to a slave trader. The son boasted afterward that ""the old man had gone to the corn fields about New Orleans where they might learn him some manners."" AdvertisementCarter Woodson, too, tells us that some of the husbands who purchased their spouses ""were not anxious to liberate their wives immediately. They considered it advisable to put them on probation for a few years, and if they did not find them satisfactory they would sell their wives as other slave holders disposed of Negroes."" He then relates the example of a black man, a shoemaker in Charleston, S.C., who purchased his wife for $700. But ""on finding her hard to please, he sold her a few months thereafter for $750, gaining $50 by the transaction.""Most of us will find the news that some black people bought and sold other black people for profit quite distressing, as well we should. But given the long history of class divisions in the black community, which Martin R. Delany as early as the 1850s described as ""a nation within a nation,"" and given the role of African elites in the long history of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade , perhaps we should not be surprised that we can find examples throughout black history of just about every sort of human behavior, from the most noble to the most heinous, that we find in any other people's history.The good news, scholars agree, is that by 1860 the number of free blacks owning slaves had markedly decreased from 1830. In fact, Loren Schweninger concludes that by the eve of the Civil War, ""the phenomenon of free blacks owning slaves had nearly disappeared"" in the Upper South, even if it had not in places such as Louisiana in the Lower South. Nevertheless, it is a very sad aspect of African-American history that slavery sometimes could be a colorblind affair, and that the evil business of owning another human being could manifest itself in both males and females, and in black as well as white.AdvertisementAs always, you can find more "" Amazing Facts About the Negro "" on The Root, and check back each week as we count to 100.Henry Louis Gates Jr. is the Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and the director of the W.E.B.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/donald-trump-vp-arpaio/	sheriff joe arpaio has been named as donald trump's running mate.	False	['2016 presidential election', ' donald trump', ' joe arpaio']	https://www.washingtonpost.com/	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/01/26/arizona-sheriff-joe-arpaio-endorses-trump/	2016/01/27	"MARSHALLTOWN, Iowa -- Joe Arpaio, the prominent and controversial sheriff of Arizona's Maricopa County endorsed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Tuesday, uniting a law enforcement official known for his unyielding efforts to stop and expose undocumented immigrants with a candidate who has made border security a central theme of his candidacy. Arpaio flew to this tiny town on Tuesday to endorse Trump in person, calling him a ""great patriot"" and someone ""easy to endorse."" ""Everything I believe in he’s doing and he’s going to do it when he becomes president,"" Arpaio told reporters shortly after addressing hundreds of Trump supporters waiting in a high school gymnasium here. ""I met Donald six months ago in Phoenix, introduced him then, 30 days back in Phoenix, introduced him then. It is my privilege and honor to help him, to endorse him today for president of the United States."" The brash sheriff is perhaps best known for his close association to the controversial 2010 Arizona law that directed local authorities to routinely stop people they suspected of being undocumented immigrants, for the purpose of determining their legal status. Arpaio has been repeatedly accused of racial profiling and discrimination against the area's Hispanic residents. Arpaio's endorsement of Trump will likely be applauded by anti-immigration activists who say Arpaio’s uncompromising efforts are necessary because of the federal government’s inaction on the issue. But Trump’s liberal critics have already lambasted the endorsement, which they say is yet another display of Trump’s hard-line anti-immigrant rhetoric. ""Today Donald Trump continued his efforts to divide Americans on his way to the GOP nomination by accepting the endorsement of infamous anti-immigrant Sheriff Joe Arpaio in Marshalltown, a city with one of the largest Latino populations in Iowa,"" said Pablo Manriquez, the Hispanic media director at the Democratic National Committee. The so-called “show me your papers” law, at the time dubbed the toughest immigration law in the country, notably triggered a high-profile legal challenge from the Obama administration. Although the Supreme Court struck down several aspects of the law — including one provision that would make it a misdemeanor for immigrants to not carry registration documents — it nonetheless upheld the provision requiring officers to check the immigration status of those they stopped. Arpaio addressed the crowd before introducing Trump at a press conference, so most reporters didn't see the sheriff in front of the crowd. Trump was clearly pleased with the endorsement. ""This is a man when we talk about borders, this is a man that believes in borders and getting his endorsement means a lot to me,"" he said. On Tuesday Trump also announced the endorsement of Liberty University president Jerry Falwell Jr., the son of late televangelist. DelReal reported from Washington."		0

GrynbaumApril 29, 2018WASHINGTON — The panna cotta had been served and the First Amendment duly celebrated by the time the comedian Michelle Wolf took the stage on Saturday at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner.What followed was a roast that took unflinching aim at some of the notables in the room — and quickly opened a divide, largely but not entirely along partisan lines, over the limits of comedy and comity under a president who rarely hesitates to attack the press.Ms. Wolf described Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, as “an Uncle Tom but for white women who disappoint other white women” and took a shot at her “smokey eye” makeup, saying that it was made from the ashes of “burnt facts.” She called Ivanka Trump “as helpful to women as an empty box of tampons.” She labeled Kellyanne Conway, the president’s counselor, an inveterate liar, and asked: “If a tree falls in the woods, how do we get Kellyanne under that tree?”“I’m not suggesting she get hurt, just stuck,” Ms. Wolf added, puckishly, as an icy silence — and a few scattered chortles — fell over the black-tie crowd here. Ms. Conway sat expressionlessly. Ms. Sanders, granted a seat of honor on the dais, limited her reaction to an arched eyebrow and pursed lips.It was an earthy performance by Correspondents’ dinner standards, if nothing out of place in an average comedy club. But feedback from the political left and right quickly leapt to extremes.“It was personally offensive,” Brian Kilmeade, a co-host of “Fox & Friends,” said in the ballroom, minutes after Ms. Wolf ended her set.“To me, that was an attack to impress Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert,” Mr. Kilmeade added, previewing a line of criticism that would be dominant on Fox News by Sunday morning. “Congratulations, when the three of you go out to dinner, I’m sure you’ll be laughing a lot. But in terms of the people here and the people at home — totally offensive, horrible choice. In fact, it’s the reason why the president didn’t want to go.”Critics of President Trump — who is no stranger to lobbing insult-comic punch lines at his opponents and is the first president to outright skip the Correspondents’ gala since Jimmy Carter — wondered what the fuss was about.“Before we criticize Michelle Wolf, let’s remember that Donald Trump has done and said some of the crudest things that any president in history has ever done,” said Howard Fineman, an analyst at NBC News and MSNBC. “Just have a little perspective.”ImageSarah Huckabee SandersCreditTasos Katopodis/Getty ImagesBy Sunday, Ms. Wolf, a contributor to “The Daily Show With Trevor Noah” whose Netflix talk show starts in May, had seemingly scandalized Washington’s intersecting political and media tribes.In one Twitter exchange, Sean Spicer, the former White House press secretary — who recently turned up at Madame Tussauds to promote a wax statue of Melania Trump — described the dinner as “a disgrace.”“Thank you!” Ms. Wolf replied.Prominent Washington journalists, meanwhile, took pains to defend Ms. Sanders — earning their own opprobrium from some liberals who asked why reporters were sticking up for an administration that routinely impugns their work.Andrea Mitchell, the NBC News correspondent, tweeted that an “apology is owed” to the press secretary. Her network colleague Mika Brzezinski wrote that “watching a wife and mother be humiliated on national television for her looks is deplorable.”Several reporters who cover the White House approached Ms. Sanders in the Hilton ballroom to express sympathy in the immediate aftermath of Ms. Wolf’s monologue. Later, at a windswept after party hosted by NBC News, Ms. Sanders appeared in good spirits as reporters swarmed her. (She even took time to chastise one journalist for asking a question at a news conference that she disliked.)Late on Sunday, Margaret Talev, president of the Correspondents’ Association, issued a statement acknowledging “dismay” from members about Ms. Wolf’s performance.“Last night’s program was meant to offer a unifying message about our common commitment to a vigorous and free press,” Ms. Talev wrote. “Unfortunately, the entertainer’s monologue was not in the spirit of that mission.”Ms. Talev said her organization would consider new ideas about the future format of the dinner — a sentiment echoed by Mr. Trump in a tweet about a half-hour later.“The White House Correspondents’ Dinner was a failure last year, but this year was an embarrassment to everyone associated with it,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, adding: “Put Dinner to rest, or start over!”Going back to Stephen Colbert’s blistering monologue in 2006 — delivered as President George W. Bush sat unsmiling a few feet away — the comic portion of the Correspondents’ dinner has courted controversy. Roast-style humor is an odd fit for protocol-oriented Washington, and some comedians praised Ms. Wolf for discomfiting the audience of elite journalists and administration officials.ImagePresident Trump at a rally on Saturday in Washington Township, Mich.CreditTom Brenner/The New York Times“If you want to focus on the journalism do a boring award show,” tweeted Kathy Griffin, the comedian whose own brush with crude presidential humor — posting a photo of herself holding what appeared to be Mr. Trump’s decapitated head — led to her losing a CNN job. “Journalism is all about the 1st amendment. If you don’t see the import of what @michelleisawolf did tonight then you don’t get it.”The doyens of Washington did not agree. Mike Allen, a prime voice of the city’s establishment, declared in his newsletter on Sunday: “Media hands Trump embarrassing win.” There were even whispers about a revolt against the Correspondents’ Association by news organizations displeased by the night’s events. (The New York Times stopped attending the dinner in 2008.)Ms. Talev, speaking on CNN on Sunday, noted that the dinner had praised Mr. Trump for meeting with aspiring journalists at the White House and featured the story of an Egyptian social activist who was freed from prison with the help of the Trump administration.She said she regretted that Ms. Wolf’s monologue had overshadowed the rest of the evening, but added: “When the entertainer is a comedian — as has been the case for the last 30 years or so — they are often controversial, they are often to some extent polarizing, or provocative, and it’s a night about free speech.”Ms. Wolf’s 19-minute set also took on Democrats and the news media itself. She quipped that “it’s kind of crazy that the Trump campaign was in contact with Russia when the Hillary campaign wasn’t even in contact with Michigan,” and joked about CNN’s hyperactive approach to coverage.“You guys love breaking news, and you did it, you broke it!” Ms. Wolf said. “Good work! The most useful information on CNN is when Anthony Bourdain tells me where to eat noodles.”Her most cutting joke came at the end, when the 32-year-old comic took direct aim at the journalists in the room. Mr. Trump, she said, “has helped you sell your papers and your books and your TV. You helped create this monster and now you are profiting from him.”Kyle Pope, the editor of the Columbia Journalism Review, posted a message on Twitter suggesting that even journalists had had enough of the annual ritual. “The #WHCD debacle was inevitable, destined to be either sycophantic, on one extreme, or mean spirited, on the other. Neither is a good look at a time when trust in media is tenuous. Can we finally all agree to put an end to this thing?”Speaking with The Times in February, after her selection as the evening’s entertainer was announced, Ms. Wolf said that comedians at the Correspondents’ dinner “are not necessarily performing for the room.”“You’re performing for everyone that’s watching it,” Ms. Wolf said, adding: “If you’re willing to say something when someone’s not there, you should definitely be willing to say it to their face.”A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Press Dinner’s Comedy Act Sets Off Furor.

False	['advertisements', ' nissan']	http://jalopnik.com/	http://jalopnik.com/5884703/science-smackdown-nissan-frontier-airplane-ad	2017/04/14	Go to permalinkThe most known of Nissan's batch of masturbatory hero-fantasies masquerading as commercials is the one where a Frontier takes the place of the broken front landing gear of an airliner. It's presented as a faux-newscast, which only makes it worse, really. Here's the analysis of why this is such crap provided by our Official Unofficial Physicist, Dr. Stephen Granade :Okay, so let's talk planes!Plane weight, landing speed, etc. vary a bunch. The CGIed plane is similar to a 727, though it looks like they changed things like making the CGI plane's nose more blunt and having its wing tips point straight up. I assume they did that so Boeing wouldn't sue them for implying that their planes' front wheel might break.Anyway, let's pretend it's a Boeing 727-200. When it lands, the 727-200 weighs somewhere between 105,000 lbs and 160,000 lbs, and it's going somewhere between 130 knots (150 MPH) and 105 kts (120 MPH).Some fine internet research indicates that the front wheel will have to bear about 5-10% of the jet's weight. Let's be generous and say that it's 5% and the 727's low on fuel, so that its weight is close to its zero-fuel weight. You'd be dropping 5,000+ lbs onto the back of a Nissan Frontier that's only rated for at most 1,500 lbs (assuming you're driving the manual V6) and that's going 100+ MPH. That weight won't hit all at once — it'll slowly grow heavier and heavier as the pilot pitches the nose down. Pretty soon you'll break the tires, rims, suspension and more.And that's only the start! The question of whether or not the Frontier tips is one of forces and torques. Think of the Frontier as a table. If you apply a force between the front and back legs (axles), it won't tip.Advertisement____V_____..O............O..If you apply an overall force behind the back legs (axle), it'll pivot around that back and tip up._V________.......O .......OLooking at the commercial, the landing gear is between the axles and thus the truck won't tip, but imagine what happens if the Frontier driver doesn't exactly match the jet's speed. If you drive too slow, that wheel will punch forward into the cab, shoving you forward. If you drive too fast, that wheel will push on the back of your truck bed. At that point you're applying force that's behind your back wheel and you'll start to tip the front of your truck up. I expect both will happen, since it'll be hard to match speed and as soon as the pilot reverses his engines to slow down the Frontier'll want to shoot forward relative to the plane.AdvertisementAnd this is the best case scenario.As the Mythbusters say: don't try this at home. Or at the airport. Or anywhere. Stick to CGIed planes like Nissan did.		0

They called her phone so many times Wednesday only to hear it ring and ring and ring.“We can’t locate her. I keep looking at my phone,” Pollack said outside Broward Health North hospital. “I don’t know where to go from here.”He never got those words. Andrew Pollack said Thursday morning that Meadow had died.BROWARD SCHOOL SHOOTING: Parents, students describe mayhem, aftermathOn Wednesday night, Pollack rattled off details about his 18-year-old — she plans to go to Lynn University for college. He showed a Palm Beach Post reporter a photo of her wearing a dark, strapless dress and a smile while standing next to her cousin.As of 7:45 p.m. that evening, he still hadn’t heard.About a couple hundred feet from where Pollack stood, two doctors gave an update to reporters on the nine patients brought to the hospital after 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz opened fire at the high school. The doctors said Wednesday marked the biggest mass casualty incident the hospital has seen.PHOTOS: Terror and tears at Stoneman Douglas High SchoolOne of the hospitals’ nine patients was Cruz. The doctors — Evan Boyar and Igor Nichiporenko — said he was released to police custody and did not detail his injuries. They said authorities took him to Broward North because it was the closest trauma facility.“Every patient that comes in gets treated as a patient,” said Boyar, director of the emergency medicine department.Another shooting victim was taken to Broward Health Coral Springs and seven others were taken to Broward Health Medical Center. Doctors at Broward North couldn’t give updates on those patients’ conditions.Of the eight at Broward North, two died, three are in stable condition and three are in critical, the doctors said. At the time of the news conference three were in operating rooms.Nichiporenko said none of the six at Broward North are expected to be released from the hospital Wednesday evening, but gave a positive outlook on their conditions: “They’re going to have successful surgeries. They’re going to recover. They’re going to go home.”The doctors declined to give details about the patients including their names, ages or exact injuries, but said they all received gunshot wounds.“I prefer not to comment on specific patients’ demeanor but you know as a human being you can imagine that they would be in shock or you know be emotional about the whole situation,” Boyar said.The doctors said they send their sympathy and condolences to all involved in the shooting. They said the hospital was ready for a day like this and often runs drills to make sure if a day like this does come the patients receive “calm, collected care.”“We do this every day. So what we saw today, we have penetrating trauma, non-penetrating trauma. We’re a Level 2 trauma center and that’s what we do everyday,” said Nichiporenko, the trauma medical director. “So fortunately for everybody we are located very close to the high school where the shooting happened, so fortunately for everybody they brought these patients to our hospital and we were able to do a great job to do the right thing.”Recommended for you		0

On Monday, China said it would slap tariffs on 128 American products in response to a separate White House plan to tax steel and aluminum from China and other countries.The products targeted by the White House are part of its plan to go after China’s dominance in cutting-edge technologies like semiconductors, electric vehicles and advanced medical products — industries that China is pursuing dominance in as part of an industrial plan known as “Made in China 2025 .”The Trump administration said that its analysts had identified products that benefit from these policies but refined the list to remove goods that were likely to cause disruptions to the United States economy or consumers.The list of goods excludes many Chinese-made consumer products available for sale at Target or Walmart, including clothing, shoes and toys. But it will most likely increase costs for American manufacturers that depend on imported parts because it concentrates heavily on machinery and high-tech components. The tariffs will be imposed on a total of $50 billion worth of Chinese products each year.The designation of targeted products will be followed by a comment period in which American companies can provide feedback to the Trump administration on the product choices. The administration will hold a public hearing on the submissions on May 15 in Washington, and companies will have until May 22 to file final objections.ImageThe products targeted by the White House are part of an effort to go after China’s dominance in cutting-edge technologies like semiconductors, electric vehicles and advanced medical products — industries that China is pursuing dominance in as part of an industrial plan known as “Made in China 2025.”CreditGilles Sabrié/BloombergBusiness groups, concerned about the effect on companies and workers, swiftly criticized the move.“Unilaterally imposing $50 billion of new tariffs without a long-term strategy that leads to economic reforms in China will only hurt America’s businesses, workers, and families,” the Business Roundtable, a corporate trade group, said in a statement. “Instead, the administration should work with U.S. allies on an approach that advances meaningful reform in China without imposing significant harm on America’s economy.”Jay Timmons, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said that American manufacturers were concerned about the trade relationship with China, including intellectual property theft, counterfeit goods and unfair subsidies, but also that tariffs were not the best response.In a strongly worded statement on Tuesday, the Chinese Embassy in the United States condemned the tariffs. “Such unilateralistic and protectionist action has gravely violated fundamental principles and values of the W.T.O.,” the statement said. “It serves neither China’s interest, nor U.S. interest, even less the interest of the global economy.”The Chinese would resort to “measures of equal scale and strength against U.S. products in accordance with Chinese law,” the statement said.While many American companies say they are unfairly treated in China, they have rued the possibility of a trade war between the world’s two largest economies, and the economic harm it could cause, and have begun pushing back against the White House’s plans . China remains a crucial and growing market for companies like John Deere and Apple, as well as for soybean farmers and growers of other agricultural products.Financial markets fell sharply on Monday as China imposed its own retaliatory tariffs on American products but regained most of their lost territory on Tuesday.President Trump, who has repeatedly promised tough action on China’s trade practices, said Tuesday that he intended to get along with China but that its unfair trade behavior had gone on too long. “It’s not something we can live with,” Mr. Trump said at the White House, adding, “I campaigned on that.”Trump advisers have criticized past administrations for allowing China to receive the benefits of global trade while continuing to break the international trade rules imposed by organizations like the World Trade Organization — a charge China denies.But the administration has struggled to persuade its critics that the kind of tough trade measures Mr. Trump favors can alter China’s behavior without tipping the world into a trade war and ultimately harming American workers and consumers. In addition to the tariffs, the White House is preparing to restrict Chinese investment in American technology and innovation, and to start a case against China at the World Trade Organization.“The administration is rightly focused on restoring equity and fairness in our trade relationship with China,” said Myron Brilliant, an executive vice president and the head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “However, imposing taxes on products used daily by American consumers and job creators is not the way to achieve those ends.”The Coalition for a Prosperous America, an organization that has supported the president’s trade agenda, called the China action a shift from “naïve” to “strategic” trade. “The age of appeasement must end,” said Paola Masman, the group’s media director.But the administration’s trade measures are prompting concern among many American companies, who are wary of Beijing’s response.The United States’ largest exports to China last year were aircraft and aircraft parts, which totaled more than $16 billion, according to IHS Markit. These products featured heavily on Tuesday’s list, setting off fears that China could retaliate with similar penalties against American plane maker Boeing.Dan Stohr, a spokesman for the Aerospace Industries Association, said the group was still reviewing the tariff list but would almost certainly file comments with the administration.Farming communities, one of the country’s largest exporters and a solid base for Mr. Trump, are among the most vulnerable. Chinese tariffs of 25 percent will particularly hurt American pork farmers, who sent more than $1 billion worth of products to China last year.Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, said American farmers were already struggling to make ends meet. “Increasing tariffs on exports will harm Iowa producers and undermine the rural economy,” Ms. Ernst said. “It’s my hope that we can pursue policies that enhance our competitiveness, rather than reduce our access to foreign markets.”Natalie Kitroeff and Ben Casselman contributed reporting from New York, and Keith Bradsher from Shanghai.Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook , Twitter and the Morning Briefing newsletter .Follow Ana Swanson on Twitter: @AnaSwanson.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A20 of the New York edition with the headline: White House Unveils Tariffs on Over 1,300 Chinese Products.

The second stage (divided into three stages of development) was finished a decade ahead of schedule.Size and Physical CharacteristicsThe Sidu River Bridge is the tallest bridge in the world, standing around 1,500 ft tall. There are exactly 1,550 feet from the bottom of the bridge to the valley floor.It is located at the border of Yichang and En’shi in the Hubei province. It is 1365 m across. Impact on Physical GeographyThe Sidu River Bridge connects Shanghai on the pacific coast with Chongqing and Chengdu in the west. Effect on Ecological Systems (Plants & Animals)When assembling the bridge builders dug tunnels into the rocky peaks of the mountains, which could have resulted in the cutting down of trees that are home to many different species.Impact on Human GeographyThe Sidu River Bridge is a part of the G50 Huyu Expressway which parallels the China National Highway 318, making an east-west route between Shanghai and Chengdu. This bridge provides an alternate route for people across the Sidu River.Was there any CONTROVERSY over the construction? There was no controversy over the building of this bridge. It was needed in order to pass over the Sidu River. The Government's Role in the Construction.It looks like the government had little involvement other than the company that built the Sidu River Bridge being state-owned. The Sidu River Bridge was constructed by China Communications Construction Company Limited. The company was founded by the China Communications Construction Group and incorporated on October 8, 2006. Interesting Facts:· The highest bridge in the world at 1,627 feet (496m).· The main span of the bridge is 2,952 feet long (900m).· Between the valley floor of the river gorge and the bridge’s roadway, there’s about a 1,550 foot drop!· The cost to build this bridge was 720 million yuan (approximately $100 million US).· “It is said that if a person falls from the Siduhe bridge it will reach terminal velocity, meaning that there is no acceleration, the body of the person is falling at a constant speed; this is the only bridge in the world where is possible such a phenomenon.” · The bridge consists of 71 different sections, the largest of which weighs 91.6 metric tons!Citations:		0

Mostly False	['donald trump']	http://occupydemocrats.com/	http://occupydemocrats.com/2016/07/18/trump-kids-face-charges-massive-250-million-tax-evasion-suit/	2016/07/19	SHARE THIS STORYPresumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump and two of his children, Donald Jr. and Ivanka, have been named as material witnesses in the investigation of a tax evasion scheme concerning $250 million of unreported income. The case centers around Felix Sater, a man who secretly pleaded guilty to a massive stock swindle in 1998, which defrauded investors and funneled the money into his own pockets and into the coffers of Mafia families. There is a significant chance that Trump and his children will be charged with tax evasion.A material witness is a secondary suspect to a crime. There is not enough evidence to label a material witness as a suspect or file charges, but there is enough to hold them in custody, if necessary, and force them to testify. Depending on what further evidence is uncovered and his statements to investigators, Trump could easily be charged and have to pay out around $21 million.The scheme depicted below shows how money was hidden from authorities by Sater’s investment firm, Bayrock, which financed several Trump-branded real estate development projects. The four boxed in projects at the bottom of the chart were classified as partnerships. Partnerships are not taxed since the profits go directly to the partners and are reported in the partners’ income tax filings. However in this case, earnings were not reported by Sater and other partners – including Trump.Ever since the tenure of Richard Nixon, every presidential candidate has released at least some of their tax returns to prove to voters that they are clean. Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has released all of her tax returns for the last 30 years. Trump has claimed that he cannot release his returns from 2012 onwards because they are being audited. However, that doesn’t explain why he has not released any returns from years prior to 2012. Former commissioner of Internal Revenue Mark Evans also says that routine auditing is not a reason for Trump to hide his recent tax returns.Trump likes to accuse Clinton of being “crooked,” but he is by far the least transparent candidate in modern history and probably the most corrupt as well. Trump claims to stand for the average working American, but he has spent his entire career trampling over the working class and has engaged in rampant tax evasion and fraud over the course of his career (he paid no taxes in 1978, 1979, 1992, and 1994 despite making millions each year).Trump is a criminal who deserves to be behind bars. He has no right to pretend to champion the rights of workers or to pretend to be qualified to sit in the Oval Office. The American people deserve transparency, a law-abiding president, and most of all a president who stands for their interests, not just the status of his own bank account.Download our NEW Occupy Democrats app for your iPhone by clicking here or for your Android by clicking here .		1

Trump granted a Presidential pardon to Joe Arpaio, former Sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona. Arpaio’s life and career, which began at the age of 18 when he enlisted in the military after the outbreak of the Korean War, exemplify selfless public service. After serving in the Army, Arpaio became a police officer in Washington, D.C. and Las Vegas, NV and later served as a Special Agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), formerly the Bureau of Narcotics. After 25 years of admirable service, Arpaio went on to lead the DEA’s branch in Arizona.In 1992, the problems facing his community pulled Arpaio out of retirement to return to law enforcement. He ran and won a campaign to become Sheriff of Maricopa County. Throughout his time as Sheriff, Arpaio continued his life’s work of protecting the public from the scourges of crime and illegal immigration. Sheriff Joe Arpaio is now eighty-five years old, and after more than fifty years of admirable service to our Nation, he is worthy candidate for a Presidential pardon.The White House		0

Income is very important to me.""– Gary D. 74-year-old retireeIt doesn't matter if you love Trump or if you hate him...One thing's for certain...The proof is in this type of check right here...I call it a ""M.A.G.A."" check.M.A.G.A. stands for Make America Great Again, which is the campaign promise Donald Trump ran on.And it looks like he's fully intending to keep that promise...Because today, any U.S. resident can collect these massive checks... regardless of age, income, or employment status.Just ask Jim G., a retired health and safety manager from Iowa State University. He's on pace to collect $5,295 in ""M.A.G.A. checks"" before the year is over.Commercial real estate developer Fredrick M. is taking advantage too. He is using this program to collect an additional $18,000 this year.And 79-year-old Neil W. is set to collect $24,000 on his first year of M.A.G.A. checks.And here's the best part...You don't have to stand in long lines at any government center... or fill out complicated forms... or even provide sensitive information to begin collecting your ""M.A.G.A. checks.""With just a few clicks of the mouse or a quick phone call, you could be sitting back, collecting your own M.A.G.A. checks, too.I'll show you exactly how in this video...Checks worth $1,200...$13,000...even $18,000 or more depending on your investment.That's why some of America's wealthiest and smartest investors are cashing in on this secret too...Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones, can expect to receive a M.A.G.A.check for $313,028 this year.America's second richest hedge fund manager – billionaire Jim Simons – can expect to collect around $184,354 every month in M.A.G.A. checks.Don't worry... you don't need to be a billionaire to collect these types of checks... not even close.62-year-old retired engineer, Peter P. had this to say...[As of] March of 2017...

Checks"", ""very reliable and repeatable.""Nasdaq.com claims...""M.A.G.A Checks"" will soar in 2018.And to be clear, because this is not a government program or sponsored by the government like Social Security or Medicare are, your payouts are virtually unlimited depending on your investment...In fact, in any given month you could receive multiple checks thanks to this investment opportunity.For instance, there's a $66 million M.A.G.A check payout estimated for June 8th. Around June 15th,there's another massive payout of $57 million... And around June 30th, an astonishing $400 million will be sent to thousands of Americans. In July, the payouts keep coming and they're even bigger...$25 million is estimated to be sent out around July 15th. Over $303 millionaround July 16th. $105 million in M.A.G.A checks will go out around July 27th. And around July 31st, the amount of money up for grabs will be over $325 million.Imagine what your life would be like if you could get checks deposited directly into your account, over and over again.In fact, I've already shown dozens of ordinary people across America how to begin collecting ""M.A.G.A. checks"" with amazing results...Folks like...Hank C. who told us he should receive $9,456 in 2018.Bob A. used to run a restoration company with his wife but retired two years ago.So far, they're on pace to collect around $2,400 in M.A.G.A. checks and are using the income to help grow their nest egg.Jacksonville, Florida resident John B. said he's collecting $15,129 and is very satisfied.But you'll want to set yourself up now, so you can start collecting your checks right away.Folks like Randy T. who has collected $9,306 in his first year.Reed N., also started collecting his own checks. He's already made $965 dollars and expects to earn an additional $3,782 this year...And Shawn M. – a 65-year-old retired engineer – uses his checks in his active lifestyle.In the next several weeks, you can start collecting your very own checks and put the money to use however you see fit.Maybe you'll finally take that dream vacation you've been planning for years... or even buy a vacation home...Maybe you'd like to help a family member in need or put your grandkids through college.Brian H. – a 57-year-old trial lawyer – told us he uses this income stream to fund his sons trust account.And a woman named Teresa wrote me and said she used this income stream to help make her sister $6,000 a year.Or perhaps, you'd like to simply donate it to a good cause that's near and dear to your heart.Whether you decide to spend your checks or tuck them away for a rainy day...It's your money to spend however you'd like.And as you're about to see, the next big windfall is yet to come. But time is of the essence. I strongly recommend you take a few steps BEFORE July 27th.I'll show you why in just a moment.Here's everything you need to know to get started right away.How ""M.A.G.A. checks"" put money BACK into the pockets of ordinary, hardworking folksIt's not hard to see how M.A.G.A.checks could have a profound impact on your retirement...Just listen to the story of a man named Kirk O. and you'll see exactly what I mean.Kirk is your typical hardworking American.He lives in Nevada and was a truck driver for many years.But 5 years ago – at the age of 61 – a work related accident forced him to stop working and go into early retirement.To make matters worse, not too long after, he was diagnosed with cancer.This would put most Americans in a dire financial situation.But luckily for Kirk, he discovered a unique opportunity made possible by several companies, which allowed him to start collecting safe and steady income ever since.Today, he earns over $1,200 a month in M.A.G.A. checks and his goal is to collect over $2,000 a month, very soon.All without working or leaving the house.Kirk wrote us a letter saying, ""I'm able to generate money... to live on and have enough funds to still play poker.""In a moment, I'll tell you exactly how to start collecting your own M.A.G.A. checks. It's simple to get started.You see, over the past few weeks, my inbox has been overflowing with stories of dozens of people who've discovered this situation.The best part is, ANYONE with a bit of investment capital can do it.Just look at some of the notes I've received:""I have helped my children with house down payments and have been able to purchase several new vehicles without financing.""– Jim K.""[This] provides me a comfortable living. I only use about half [of my payments] to support my lifestyle and travel. The remaining balance I invest."" – Dan D.And Otto S. – who has been a farmer for 60 years – expects to collect over $1,891 this year.Here's what he told me:""I'm 88, going on 89... income is an important issue to me – not rich, not poor... but at my age income is important.""I've created this presentation for two reasons...First, now is a great time to start collecting these checks.And second, whether you're in your 20s or well into retirement, by collecting these M.A.G.A. checks you'll be able to live life on your own terms, knowing that the checks will keep rolling in like clockwork depending on the size of your investment.But before I go any further...First, Let Me Introduce MyselfHi. My name is Dr. Steve Sjuggerud.I've had just about every job on Wall Street. I've been a stockbroker, Vice President of a global mutual fund at the age of 24, and President of a 250,000-reader program called Investment U.I've been asked to appear on numerous TV stations like Fox News and Bloomberg to help their viewers make sense of the financial world and offer new ways to grow and protect their wealth.I've helped ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, and have given closed-door presentations to billionaires and some of the most famous investors on the planet.But my true passion is research... finding new and undiscovered opportunities to help ordinary Americans... Which is why about two decades ago, I left the Wall Street world behind.Don't get me wrong. I learned a lot... and I established a lot of important connections.But it didn't take long to find out my main job there wasn't to help my clients make money. It was to get as many new clients as possible and as much money as possible under management, to collect fees.That's not what I set out to do...Quitting the Wall Street side of finance was easily the best decision I've ever made.Now I get to spend my time doing what I love most... finding new and profitable investment ideas for regular folks... like the M.A.G.A. checks I've been describing in this presentation.Through my years of experience, I can tell you one thing with 100% conviction: Sufficient income is the #1 secret to a successful retirement.You must earn consistent income.In fact, this is one of the main reasons people love reading my work... because I routinely find new income opportunities you won't hear about from your broker or the mainstream press.For example...In 2009, I uncovered a series of Social Security ""loopholes"" that allowed retirees to increase the size of their monthly checks. It was a legal way to push the system in your favor and get paid an extra $1,100 or more per month, EVERY year.Some people even wrote in to share their results...""Based on Steve's research, I did a ""re-do"" on my Social Security last year... [I got] an increase of slightly more than $600 per month... It was a smart investment decision.""– Fred W.""The new monthly payment was $2,017... [which is] a GAIN of $495 per month!""– Bill B.""This has added $853 per month to our income without reducing [my wife's] Social Security benefits. Pretty neat!!""– Charles B.Not too long after the dotcom crash in 2001, I uncovered a little-known gov't-backed opportunity – something I called 'The Portfolio Repair Program' – that enabled investors to recoup some of the losses from the market crash – and even earn a steady amount of income...Not many Americans were aware this option was available to them. As far as I know, we were among the first to write about it.My passion for research has enabled me to uncover all sorts of new and exciting income opportunities you're not likely to hear about from a stockbroker or in the mainstream press.A few years ago, for example, I found a unique opportunity that allows you to collect tremendous royalties, every single month, simply by becoming a ""trademark"" owner of some of North America's most popular fast food chains.You simply become a part share holder of the trademarked name like McDonald's or Burger King. Then, every time one of these restaurants sells a burger, shake, or fries... you collect royalties.One of the opportunities I've recommended has paid consecutive monthly royalties since 2002! Total gains have been over 1,120% since inception.I've never seen this opportunity written about anywhere else!But what I'm most excited about right now is the income opportunity I began describing earlier in this presentation: the M.A.G.A. checks.So, why haven't you heard about these M.A.G.A. checks before?Where do these checks come from and how can you get started immediately?I'll show you...Trumps Promise to Put America FirstIn 2016, Donald Trump campaigned on the promise to ""Make America Great Again.""And when he officially took office on January 20, 2017, Trump got right down to business.Within his first year he helped pass a law that would immediately help thousands of Americans.His new law also helps a specific industry as much or more than any other. An industry he probably knows as well as anyone else in the country...The same industry that made him a billionaire...I'm talking, of course, about real estate.Now, it's widely known that Donald Trump's wealth comes from real estate.And for good reason...The U.S. real estate markets are among the most lucrative in the world.The total value of all the real estate in America is well over $35 Trillion.Real estate has helped create countless millionaires too. Probably more than any other industry in history.Did you know that 90% of the world's millionaires got there, in part, because of real estate!?That's a remarkable fact, isn't it?It's why some of America's richest people, like media mogul Ted Turner... Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos... and Microsoft founder Bill Gates are all huge real estate investors too.You see, real estate is vital to the success of the American economy.Yes, it provides housing for families.But most people don't realize that commercial real estate also creates jobs, spaces for retail, offices, storage, warehousing, and manufacturing.Agricultural real estate is essential for the production of crops and livestock... of our food supply... of our building supplies... and more.In short, real estate is the secret backbone of American wealth and ingenuity.The ultra-rich know this.Personally, I own stocks, gold, shares of private business, and more. But by far my largest holdings today and by far the biggest profits of my career have come from real estate.The thing is, tapping into this great source of wealth has often been time-consuming and expensive... essentially making many of the best real estate investments off limits to the little guy.Enter Trump, who's recent law helps revitalize an obscure government real estate program from the 1960sYou see back then, the government wanted to make sure certain companies would always have a built-in financial incentive to keep America's real estate markets strong.These are the companies that develop... manage... and own America's best commercial, residential, and agricultural real estate.So, congress proposed a plan that would allow these companies to get away with paying practically ZERO Federal income taxes.In exchange, the government required these businesses to turn over the bulk of their earnings to shareholders – that's regular folks like you and me – in the form of steady payments.But here's the thing. The government didn't heavily advertise this program, so many investors never knew it existed.After all, it was buried deep inside an obscure bill passed back in 1960.But Trump's new legislation brings this program back to the forefront of the American economy, in a major way – allowing everyday Americans to collect more and bigger paychecks from America's most lucrative real estate investments...For example, one company– based in Kansas City, Missouri – is paying over $26 million every single month to ordinary Americans right now.Another one based in Bethesda, Maryland, is sending out $70 Million every single month to ordinary folks...Imagine how your life would change by tapping into this income stream...And an institution in New York City is expected to send over $1.35 billion to a handful of citizens in 2018.The best part is, anyone in America can now be a part of these massive payouts.Folks like...Dana H., a 67-year-old retired manufacturing manager, who says he enjoys a $1,880 yearly payment from just one of these institutions.Retired Aerospace engineer, Kurt B., who has already collected over $11,000 in what we're calling ""M.A.G.A. checks.""And Kevin T., who is collecting M.A.G.A. checks worth around $4,200, like clockwork.Look...We've had a lot of great men as Presidents, but none of them have been as successful in business, or had such an intimate understanding of the real estate markets as Donald Trump...He's a billionaire because of it.So, it makes sense that he's the one to lead Americans to this opportunity.But the question is... Why haven't you heard about this opportunity before?Well... the main reason is probably because there just aren't a lot of companies that distribute these Trump-approved ""M.A.G.A. checks.""Only about 1 out of 26,000 companies in America are registered to participate.As I said, these companies must be able to produce lots of cash via real estate income... and pay it out to ordinary Americans like you and me. Not just any business is eligible to register in the program.So, how does it all work?How can you find one of these organizations and begin tapping in to these huge payouts year after year?Let me show you...CASE STUDY: M.A.G.A.-Approved San Diego Firm Pays Out MillionsMake no mistake, these special institutions send out billions of dollars in checks every year.One example is an institution based out of San Diego, CA.Even though you've probably never heard of it before, it owns some of the most valuable real estate in America and then leases it to the country's top commercial enterprises.I'm talking about huge corporations like Wal-Mart, FedEx, BJ's, Walgreens, and Home Depot, just to name a few.That's some pretty important real estate, wouldn't you agree?As a result, this firm rakes in billions of dollars in revenue every year.But here's the thing.Unlike most businesses today, this company doesn't pay a penny in income taxes to Uncle Sam...Thanks to this Trump-approved plan, a huge portion of this money – even larger than what they paid before – now goes directly into the pockets of ordinary citizens like you and me.The business behind this payout LOVES this arrangement. In fact, they're fanatical about paying out huge income checks to Americans, month after month... year after year.It even clearly states that paying out this income is their primary goal on page 4 of their most recent annual report...We have remained dedicated to our mission of providing... dependable monthly [incomes] that increase over time.Companies avoid annoying taxes... investors get huge monthly checks... and the U.S. economy gets a boost. Everybody wins.Just look at a few more of these M.A.G.A.-approved institutions paying out huge streams of income...Like this institution based in Glendale, California.It's the largest public storage provider in the U.S and is on pace to send over $1.6 billion in M.A.G.A. checks to Americans, in 2018.Another one headquartered in Chicago owns more than 1,200 hospitals and senior living centers.It's also on pace to deposit over $827 million into accounts this year...A growing firm in Boston owns over 70 million square feet of industrial properties and on pace to deliver more than $141 million to thousands of Americans before 2018 is over.One nationwide institution owns roughly 13 million acres of forest throughout the U.S. and they create construction materials needed to rebuild some of our country's aging infrastructure...They'll send around $235 million worth of M.A.G.A. checks every 3 months this year.Another institution based in Boston owns more than 150,000 cell towers which helps American businesses communicate and stay competitive every single day.And they've already started sending checks of the $1.1 billion set to go out this year.I've been conducting independent financial research for over 20 years and I can tell you with 100% conviction... this is one of the best income opportunities I've ever seen.And look, I'm not just saying this. I'm investing in real estate with my own money, too.I'm in the middle of setting up a private deal for my business partners and me that could deliver us $100,000 or more a year in real estate income.Another real estate deal I have in place pays me several thousand a month.Depending on your situation, you could use these income streams I've been telling you about to collect up to 24 checks or more every single year.Just so we're clear: there are always risks involved with investing, and you should never put more into this idea than you could afford to lose.That being said, I really believe in the potential for the low-risk, consistent income you can earn from this opportunity.But I'll be upfront with you, if you want to get in on the next payout...You need to position yourself NOW.That's because the next payout date is scheduled for the end of July. And if you want to be a part of this payout you simply must be in by the deadline.I want you to collect as many checks as possible, before the year's over.And set yourself up for a chance at lifelong income, if that's something you'd like.That's why I recently went through all 225 Trump-approved institutions and selected the very best ones.The best institutions with the biggest and safest paydays...Let me tell you a little more about them...How to Tap into the World's Greatest Income StreamI narrowed these institutions down based on 4 critical factors.FIRST, I want to make sure these institutions are being managed by the best and brightest in the industry... folks who know the real estate world as well as Donald Trump – like the backs of their hands.If you choose to get involved with one of these institutions, you need to know it's being managed in a way that will deliver you the biggest checks.One of the men running these firms, for example, has been in the real estate markets for over 20 years and successfully managed a real estate portfolio valued at $700 billion.Which leads me to the SECOND factor I look for.The institution must have a history of consistently paying lots of big checks to shareholders.These companies rake in LOTS of cash... and we only want the ones that have a history of doling out as much of this money as possible over the longest period of time.One of these firms for example has made these payouts EVERY SINGLE MONTH for the past 3 years, without skipping a beat.THIRD, I like to make sure the people who work closely with or operate these institutions ""put their money where their mouth is,"" so to speak. Inside ownership is one of the secrets to evaluating the true health of a business.And the FOURTH factor may be the most important.We want the BIGGEST and FATTEST checks.This part is key.Based on the research my team and I have done, the companies that pay out the biggest checks typically have one thing in common...They own one very specific kind of real estate asset...In fact, of the 225 institutions in the country, only a small handful actually own this asset.These companies pay out, on average, 3 TIMES more than the other M.A.G.A.-check companies...I won't tell you exactly what this asset is right here, but the important thing to know is... it's generally government-backed real estate assets.This not only makes these checks bigger, but SAFER, and more reliable, too.One of the things I love about this opportunity is that while stocks have become very expensive since the financial crisis of 2008, you can still get into incredible deals in real estate that produces tons of reliable income.In fact, real estate is my #1 favorite investment for the next decade. I think it's going to be much more lucrative, much safer, and much more reliable than anything else out there.How much income could you earn? That's completely up to you.One of the best parts of getting M.A.G.A. checks is that you decide how much you're paid.That's why I've put the full details of everything you need to know in my recent report called...M.A.G.A. Checks: How to Cash in on the White House's Multibillion-Dollar Program.In this special report, I'll tell you what I believe are the 4 most stable, reliable and cash-rich companies in the M.A.G.A. program today – ones that regularly dole out big cash payments to their shareholders.One of these institutions, for example, payed out a whopping $1.3 BILLION in M.A.G.A. checks to thousands of Americans last year.And has already sent out $348,000,000 million in 2018.It has government-backed real estate assets in California, Texas, and New York, just to name a few.The second institution – based in Maryland – sends out $70 million every single month.And there's no sign of these checks going away.This is a no brainer if you want monthly checks rolling in like clockwork.Which is probably why a hedge-fund manager – billionaire Jim Simons – decided to rely on this institution to bring in $184,354 every month.Depending on your situation you could soon see checks worth $1,200... $1,800... even $3,600, or more in some cases.It all depends on how much you're willing to put in.The third institution detailed in the report is a New York based firm.Because of its unique position, you can tap into the $301 million income stream the company paid last year, backed by $11 billion worth of real estate throughout the countries major markets.And they've already sent $67,077,800 out this year.And the fourth company might be the best opportunity yet...In short, this company is the best in class.Thanks to the experienced and nimble management team in place, this institution has been able to outperform its competition.Which is why it's prepared to send out an estimated $422 million this year.But you'll want to get your name on the list in advance if you'd like to get a cut of this massive payout.Remember: If you want to get started collecting these checks, you must act soon.The next scheduled payout date is around July 27th.Everything you need to know to take advantage of these amazing situations – and start collecting M.A.G.A. checks repeatedly – is detailed inside my new report called: M.A.G.A. Checks: How to Cash in on the White House's Multibillion Dollar Program.This report is yours free of charge when you consider a no-risk trial subscription to my monthly independent research advisory called True Wealth...Let me tell you a little about it so you can decide if it's right for you...A New Way to Build Wealth in AmericaWhat we've found after writing to literally hundreds of thousands of people who are looking to enhance their income is that most people simply don't realize there are safer and more profitable investments than ordinary stocks and bonds.I promise you this: True Wealth is like no other investment newsletter you have seen before.I guarantee that in True Wealth you will learn about unique opportunities you won't hear about anywhere else.Is True Wealth right for you? I can't say for sure, but I believe the research my team and I do is better than anything else out there, on or off Wall Street.Our track record backs this up...For example, I'm particularly proud of the investments we found after the dotcom bust, which could have made our subscribers, who decided to act on our recommendations, very nice gains while most investors were too scared to act...I told my readers about a unique type of currency investment outside the stock market. They had the chance to capture 273% gains.In 2005, I uncovered a new type of gold company most people had never heard about before, called a ""prospect generator."" These companies don't explore for or mine gold, but their share prices typically go up much higher and faster in gold bull markets.As a result, our readers had the chance to pocket massive 995% gains when the price of gold took off.And back in 2011, right after a new health bill was passed, I knew it'd mean a surge of new capital for one investment in particular. Our readers were among the first to know about it and had the opportunity to see gains as high as 420%.I know anyone can cherry-pick a few winners, but our overall track record is unmatched as far as I know over both the short and long term.For instance, since inception the average annualized return on all my True Wealth recommendations was more than doubled the return of the stock market. That's pretty significant, considering most mutual funds and hedge funds rarely even beat the market.As the head of our firm said, ""There isn't a better investor anywhere in the world than Steve Sjuggerud.""I'm extremely proud of the hard work we've done for our readers...Right now, for example, we have more than 20 recommendations in our model stock portfolio... and they've gone up an average of 26% since we recommended them.But, at the end of the day, nothing makes me happier than hearing how our research has impacted the lives of thousands of readers...Like James H. who said:""I've made over $2 million [in six months].""80-year-old retire, Robert B. sent me this note:""Dr. Steve Sjuggerud... has helped me enormously in the management of my wife's portfolio; it has quadrupled since I took it away from her advisor.""True Wealth reader, Michael M. said:""I'm up more than $400,000.""Clyde L. wrote in to share his success, too:""I have been following Steve's investments for several years... My investment was approximately $600,000 and now its well over $1,000,000... Other letters... don't hold a light to Steve's. He is very honest.""And my personal favorite...A handwritten note from a subscriber named Bill G.He went on to show me in detail how he'd used my research to make almost $1,000,000 over the past 4 years.Remember, these people once faced the same decision you face today.Now, I can't promise you'll make $1 million following my work... and I can't tell you if True Wealth is right for you. Past performance doesn't guarantee future success.But I've come up with a way for you to find out – totally risk free.Your M.A.G.A.

https://www.factcheck.org/2018/04/muslim-nurses-not-exempt-from-hand-washing/	Muslim Nurses Not Exempt From Hand Washing	false	['International', 'anti-Muslim', 'false stories']	https://web.archive.org/	https://web.archive.org/web/20100413221537/http://bnp.org.uk/2010/04/islamic-colonisation-of-britain-continues-nhs-relaxes-hygiene-measure-to-accommodate-muslim-staff-but-bans-crucifix/	2018/04/20	 April 11, 2010 - By BNP News The National Health Service has amended its hygiene rules to allow Muslim staff not to wash before attending to patients — in the same week when it was ruled that a British nurse’s crucifix could not be worn at work. The open display of anti-British bias will now put patients in hospitals at even greater risk of infection by the “superbug” epidemic which has directly paralleled the increasing numbers of ethnic NHS staff. According to an announcement by the Department of Health (DoH), female Muslim staff will now be exempt from the rule that all personnel be scrubbed and bare below the elbow. Long sleeves have been identified as one of the leading causes for the spread of bacteria responsible for the superbugs. In addition, the DoH also announced that Sikh employees could wear bangles “as long as they can be pushed up the arm during direct patient care.”At the same time, British nurse Shirley Chaplin was ordered in an employment tribunal called to adjudicate on a discrimination battle with Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital Trust, to stop wearing a crucifix because it “might carry bacteria” and could “scratch patients.”The ruling discarded evidence showing that Mrs Chaplin, 53, had worn the crucifix around her neck since she was 16 and there had never been any evidence that it had ever harmed a single patient in any way. “I don’t believe my cross is a danger, so this is double standards. What can you say? It seems that life is stacked up against Christians these days,” Mrs Chaplin was quoted as saying in a newspaper. The lifting of the sleeve ban is a direct result of agitation from the Muslim community that female NHS workers should dress modestly in terms of Koranic teaching and that this included not baring their arms in mixed company. The multiculturalist ideology promoted by decades of Tory and Labour rule has led to these demands, and the measure to prevent the spread of disease will now only be applied to non-Muslim staff. The NHS is proposing an utterly pathetic alternative which consists of “disposable sleeves” for Muslim staff. This scheme was dismissed by Derek Butler, chairman of MRSA Action UK, a campaign group headed by respected microbiologist Professor Hugh Pennington. “My worry is that by allowing some medics to use disposable sleeves you compromise patient safety because unless you change the sleeves between treating each patient, you spread bacteria. Scrubbing bare arms is far more effective,” Mr Butler was quoted as saying. “I’ve seen doctors and nurses fail to change their gloves, and I’ve no doubt this will see exactly the same thing happening. These sleeves are just another risk, and you cannot take risks with patient safety.”Once again, the interests of British people are put last before the demands of the increasingly bold Islamic colonisers. The British National Party is the only party to demand that the NHS be completely revamped to ensure that it is staffed primarily by British people and that First World standards are enforced and maintained. A BNP government will ensure that sufficient funding is given to the NHS to recruit and train British people for work at livable wages in this vital sector. The extra money for this process will be drawn away from the £9 billion per year foreign aid budget, the £70 billion illegal foreign wars budget and the £60 billion per year EU membership fee. In addition, a BNP government would invest heavily in training up our own people to fulfil important roles in the NHS, and not rely on stealing staff from Third World countries. Digg this!

The National Health Service has amended its hygiene rules to allow Muslim staff not to wash before attending to patients — in the same week when it was ruled that a British nurse’s crucifix could not be worn at work. The open display of anti-British bias will now put patients in hospitals at even greater risk of infection by the “superbug” epidemic which has directly paralleled the increasing numbers of ethnic NHS staff. According to an announcement by the Department of Health (DoH), female Muslim staff will now be exempt from the rule that all personnel be scrubbed and bare below the elbow. Long sleeves have been identified as one of the leading causes for the spread of bacteria responsible for the superbugs. The ruling discarded evidence showing that Mrs Chaplin, 53, had worn the crucifix around her neck since she was 16 and there had never been any evidence that it had ever harmed a single patient in any way. “I don’t believe my cross is a danger, so this is double standards. What can you say? It seems that life is stacked up against Christians these days,” Mrs Chaplin was quoted as saying in a newspaper. The lifting of the sleeve ban is a direct result of agitation from the Muslim community that female NHS workers should dress modestly in terms of Koranic teaching and that this included not baring their arms in mixed company. The multiculturalist ideology promoted by decades of Tory and Labour rule has led to these demands, and the measure to prevent the spread of disease will now only be applied to non-Muslim staff. The NHS is proposing an utterly pathetic alternative which consists of “disposable sleeves” for Muslim staff. This scheme was dismissed by Derek Butler, chairman of MRSA Action UK, a campaign group headed by respected microbiologist Professor Hugh Pennington. “My worry is that by allowing some medics to use disposable sleeves you compromise patient safety because unless you change the sleeves between treating each patient, you spread bacteria. Scrubbing bare arms is far more effective,” Mr Butler was quoted as saying. “I’ve seen doctors and nurses fail to change their gloves, and I’ve no doubt this will see exactly the same thing happening.

Dixie spawned theme motels, juice stands and wacky roadside attractions.They’re almost all gone in 21st century Florida, but stretches of Dixie — truncated, relocated and sometimes renamed — remain.In the highway’s 100th birthday year, we’re still driving Dixie, the road that created Florida.A rough, rutted roadInteractive: Then and now photos of Dixie HighwayFor intrepid tourists and adventurers at the dawn of the Automobile Age, a trip south on “The Dixie” was a grueling, often dangerous journey.It could take 10 days to two weeks to drive on a Tin Lizzie’s narrow tires from Chicago to Miami, down the Deep South’s dirt roads and Florida’s lonely sand tracks.Coming into Palm Beach County, Dixie followed the dry ridge that Flagler’s railroad crews had surveyed two decades earlier.“The FEC had taken the high ground, so basically they had whatever was left,” said Lake Park historian L.J. Parker. “When they came to a lake or a sinkhole, they moved the road to the other side of the tracks.”Today, the road is still called Dixie Highway in downtown West Palm Beach, but farther north the city’s Evergreen and Poinsettia avenues also follow the century-old route.After U.S. 1 was built in the 1920s, the highway became known as Old Dixie in Lake Park and Delray Beach. Alternate A1A through Palm Beach Gardens follows Dixie’s old track. In Riviera Beach, Dixie was recently renamed President Barack Obama Highway.Its location sometimes shifted. In Boca Raton, today’s Dixie is on the east side of the tracks, but the road’s original route is on the west side, now known as Southwest First Avenue.Dixie Highway, argues historian Tammy Ingram, modernized the South by providing its first good farm-to-market roads while simultaneously creating the dream of a winter Florida vacation.“Auto tourism opened up Florida to middle class tourism. You didn’t need a train depot anymore,” said Ingram, author of “ Dixie Highway: Road Building and the Making of the Modern South ” and a history professor at the University of Charleston.Credit goes to Carl Fisher, the founder of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and an early automobile enthusiast. He helped form the Dixie Highway Association in 1914 to create a reliable route to remote and undeveloped Florida.His idea was to cobble together the country’s existing north-south roads and improve them, creating an interstate highway. (He’d done the same thing earlier with his transcontinental Lincoln Highway, connecting New York to San Francisco.) His genius was persuading states and cities to tax themselves into paying for improving those existing roads.Unlike Flagler, who used his personal fortune to build his railroad, Fisher didn’t spend a dime on road construction.‘Not a trip for faint of heart’At first, Dixie was hardly worthy of the name “highway.” Much of it was a rutted sand track through Florida’s piney woods and coastal scrub. Nevertheless, it still funneled tourists and new residents into the state, which ultimately resulted in real estate sales.Which was Fisher’s idea from the start.He wanted a way to get Midwesterners down to his latest project: a mangrove swamp he was busy transforming into Miami Beach.When it officially opened in the fall of 1915, the road wandered south via two meandering, gerrymandered routes. The eastern route started in Detroit then entered Florida at Jacksonville before following the Atlantic coast. The western route left Chicago, connecting Tallahassee with Orlando then continued down the peninsula’s west coast.Eventually, the combined Dixie Highway routes stretched 5,786 miles across 10 states from the Canadian border at Sault Sainte Marie in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula to Miami on Biscayne Bay.“Before that, you had to find your own way down without maps or road signs,” said Susan Gillis, curator at the Boca Raton Historical Society, which is sponsoring a lecture on the history of Dixie Highway later this month.In 1916, a Palm Beach Post article encouraged locals to welcome a 500-car cavalcade that was to start in Cincinnati in October and run “the entire length of the Dixie Highway” through West Palm Beach ending in Miami.“It was very treacherous, but that was part of the appeal,” said Ingram. “It was not a trip for the faint of heart. You left early and timed it so you were hitting major towns to eat lunch, get gas, have a place to stay overnight. You carried supplies including extra tires and gas. Wealthy people would have a driver and mechanic go with them.”Florida’s torrential downpours were big trouble for those early motorists.Yet, thousands came and stayed, starting Florida’s 1920s land boom.By 1920, Motor Travel magazine wrote that Florida “no longer lay beyond arduous and impassable sands … just around the corner from Stygian cypress swamps …”But many of those who followed Dixie to the boom did a U-turn during the bust that began in 1926.By May of 1928, Boca Raton was so desperate for tourists it erected a painted plywood camel over the road to attract Shriners headed to a national convention in Miami. A sign advertised that its new town hall (now the city’s history museum) had restrooms.A month later during a Miami Elks convention, said Gillis, the city added antlers to transform the camel into an elk.Today, most of what remains of Dixie’s original route through Palm Beach is Old Dixie, a workingman’s road lined with thrift shops and car repair places.But a tiny abandoned stretch of road in North Palm Beach offers a glimpse of how the road once looked.Old Dixie dead-ends at the south bank of the C-17 canal/Earman River. The old roadbed once led to a bridge that burned in 1933. Shading the cracked roadbed is a line of the Australian pines once planted along Dixie as a windbreak.It’s a lonely forgotten spot. Four wood storks stood on the bank on a recent afternoon.“Time kind of passed her by,” said Gillis of the road that created Florida.DIXIE HIGHWAY’S WINDING PATHNorth county:In 1915, Dixie Highway ran through what is now Jonathan Dickinson State Park and into today’s Jupiter Hills Club, which removed the road to build a golf course.Today, you can pick up N. Old Dixie Highway at County Line Road, bearing right onto Alternate A1A/ State Road 811 and over the Intracoastal Waterway bridge. On the other side of the bridge, another section of Old Dixie begins west of the railroad and ends south of Jupiter Lakes Blvd. This is the road’s original path through northern Palm Beach County. Pavement remnants can be seen west of the tracks.Backtrack and return to Alternate A1A/SR 811 and head south through Palm Beach Gardens. After crossing the C-17 Canal/Earman River into North Palm Beach, turn right on Richard Road then right onto Old Dixie/95th Court. On your right, you’ll see a short remaining line of the old Australian pine windbreaks that were planted along Dixie before coming to a dead end at the canal. This is the site of a wooden Dixie Highway bridge that burned in 1933. After the fire, Dixie was rebuilt on the east side of the tracks where Alternate A1A/SR 811 is today.Return to Old Dixie and head south. Until the road was widened in the 1980s, an arch spanned Old Dixie at Watertower Road at the entrance to Kelsey City, now called Lake Park.Continue south through Riviera Beach, where Dixie has been renamed President Barack Obama Highway.Central county:In West Palm Beach, the road becomes Greenwood Avenue, still running on the west side of the tracks. At 36th Street, turn left then right onto Poinsettia Avenue/N. Flagler Drive. Continue south through West Palm Beach and Lake Worth on Dixie Highway/U.S. 1.South county:In south Boynton Beach past Woolbright Road, veer right onto Old Dixie and head south into Delray Beach, where the road runs along the railroad’s east side. Merge with Federal Highway/Fifth Avenue and continue south.Turn right on Southeast 10th Street, then left onto Dixie Highway/FL 811 before the railroad tracks. This road becomes Old Dixie Highway/Dixie Highway at Yamato Road in Boca Raton and leads past the 1930 Boca Raton Train Depot and out of Palm Beach County.To see a short remnant of Dixie’s original path through Boca Raton, turn right at Palmetto Park Road, then take the first turn right or left onto Southwest First Avenue on the west side of the tracks.Source: Historical Society of Palm Beach CountyTHE HISTORY OF DIXIEHistorian Amy An will present a lecture on Dixie Highway’s centennial Wednesday at 7 p.m., at the Boca Raton History Museum, 71 N.

The results of the Resolution votes are outlined here. It is official: The 26th General Assembly for the International Astronomical Union was an astounding success! More than 2500 astronomers participated in six Symposia, 17 Joint Discussions, seven Special Sessions and four Special Sessions. New science results were vigorously discussed, new international collaborations were initiated, plans for future facilities put forward and much more. Resolution 1 for GA-XXVI : ""Precession Theory and Definition of the Ecliptic"" Resolution 2 for GA-XXVI: ""Supplement to the IAU 2000 Resolutions on reference systems"" Resolution 3 for GA-XXVI: ""Re-definition of Barycentric Dynamical Time, TDB"" Resolution 4 for GA-XXVI: ""Endorsement of the Washington Charter for Communicating Astronomy with the Public"" Resolution 5A: ""Definition of ‘planet' "" Resolution 6A: ""Definition of Pluto-class objects"" The IAU members gathered at the 2006 General Assembly agreed that a ""planet"" is defined as a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit. This means that the Solar System consists of eight ""planets"" Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. A new distinct class of objects called ""dwarf planets"" was also decided. It was agreed that ""planets"" and ""dwarf planets"" are two distinct classes of objects. The first members of the ""dwarf planet"" category are Ceres, Pluto and 2003 UB313 (temporary name). More ""dwarf planets"" are expected to be announced by the IAU in the coming months and years. Currently a dozen candidate ""dwarf planets"" are listed on IAU's ""dwarf planet"" watchlist, which keeps changing as new objects are found and the physics of the existing candidates becomes better known. The ""dwarf planet"" Pluto is recognised as an important proto-type of a new class of trans-Neptunian objects. The IAU will set up a process to name these objects. Results:Resolution 5A: ""Definition of Planet"" was not counted but was passed with a great majority. Resolution 5B: ""Definition of Classical Planet"" had 91 votes in favour, but many more against so there was no count. Resolution 6A: ""Definition of Pluto-class objects"" was passed with 237 votes in favour, 157 against and 17 abstentions. Resolution 6B: ""Definition of Plutonian Objects"" had 183 votes in favour and 186 votes against. Below are the planet definition Resolutions that were passed. A press conference about the Closing Ceremony of the General Assembly, including the results of the planet-definition vote, will be held at 18:00, in Meeting Room 3.3 of the Prague Congress Center. This press conference will conclude around 18:30 CEST. The IAU is the international astronomical organisation that brings together distinguished astronomers from all nations of the world. Its mission is to promote and safeguard the science of astronomy in all its aspects through international cooperation. Founded in 1919, the IAU is the world's largest professional body for astronomers. The IAU General Assembly is held every three years and is one of the largest and most diverse meetings on the astronomical community's calendar. Resolution 5A is the principal definition for the IAU usage of ""planet"" and related terms. Resolution 6A creates for IAU usage a new class of objects, for which Pluto is the prototype. The IAU will set up a process to name these objects. Contemporary observations are changing our understanding of planetary systems, and it is important that our nomenclature for objects reflect our current understanding. This applies, in particular, to the designation ""planets"". The word ""planet"" originally described ""wanderers"" that were known only as moving lights in the sky. Recent discoveries lead us to create a new definition, which we can make using currently available scientific information. (1) A ""planet"" is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit. (d) is not a satellite. (3) All other objects , except satellites, orbiting the Sun shall be referred to collectively as ""Small Solar-System Bodies"". Pluto is a ""dwarf planet"" by the above definition and is recognized as the prototype of a new category of trans-Neptunian objects. The eight planets are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. An IAU process will be established to assign borderline objects into either dwarf planet and other categories. These currently include most of the Solar System asteroids, most Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs), comets, and other small bodies."		0
