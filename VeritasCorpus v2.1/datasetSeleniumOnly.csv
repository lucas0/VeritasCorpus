http://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-gold-formula	Claim: The Apple Watch Edition has less gold than typical 18k gold	unverified	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Edition', 'Dr Drang', 'Gold', 'Leancrew.com']	http://leancrew.com/	http://leancrew.com/all-this/2015/03/apple-gold/	2015/03/07	March 7, 2015 at 10:53 AM by Dr. DrangTwitter user Sumocat got some blowback for this tweet:@marco_org Apple has a patent that can reduce the gold content of their 18k gold by half. veg.gy/ZhMF2— Sumocat ( @SumocatS ) Mar 6 2015 1:58 PMIt’s inartfully put (140 characters is a bitch), but as a practical matter he’s correct. Apple’s patent application is for a method that allows them to make 18k gold that has, on a volume basis, less gold than regular 18k gold.How can this be? It’s because Apple’s gold is a metal matrix composite , not a standard alloy. Instead of mixing the gold with silver, copper, or other metals to make it harder, Apple is mixing it with low-density ceramic particles. The ceramic makes Apple’s gold harder and more scratch-resistant—which Tim Cook touted during the September announcement—and it also makes it less dense overall.The karat measure of gold is based on the mass fraction. One hundred grams of 18k gold has 75 grams of gold and 25 grams of other material. If that “other material” is a low-density ceramic, it takes up a bigger volume than if it’s a high-density metal. Because the casing of a watch is made to a particular size (i.e. volume), not to a particular weight, the Watch will have less gold in it than an 18k case made of a conventional alloy.As an example, assume a conventional 18k gold alloy with 75% gold (19.3 g/cc), 15% silver (10.5 g/cc), and 10% copper (8.96 g/cc) by weight. The alloy will have a density of[\frac{1}{\frac{0.75}{19.3} + \frac{0.15}{10.5} + \frac{0.10}{8.96}} = 15.6\;\mathrm{g/cc}]A cubic centimeter of this alloy will contain[0.75 \times 15.6 = 11.7\;\mathrm{g}]of gold.Now assume an 18k gold with 75% gold and 25% boron carbide by weight (that’s one of the ceramics mentioned in Apple’s patent). Boron carbide has a density of 2.52 g/cc , so a gold/boron carbide metal matrix composite would have a density of about[\frac{1}{\frac{0.75}{19.3} + \frac{0.25}{2.52}} = 7.24\;\mathrm{g/cc}]A cubic centimeter of this material will contain only[0.75 \times 7.24 = 5.43\;\mathrm{g}]of gold. Here, the gold takes up[\frac{5.43\;\mathrm{g}}{19.3\;\mathrm{g/cc}} = 0.28\;\mathrm{cc}]or 28% of the volume.Table 1 of Apple’s patent gives other configurations and shows the gold savings.Some of these numbers look flatly wrong to me. For example, changing from a baseline of 25.8 g of gold in a particular part to 12.1 g is not a savings of 43%, it’s a savings of 53%. Maybe I’m reading the table wrong.In any event, the patent makes it clear that saving gold is one of the goals of the process. I suppose it’s not surprising that Tim didn’t make a big deal out of that in September.	2015/03/07

School lunches in the United States stand in stark contrast to the wholesome and in some cases even decadent meals served to kids in other markedly less fortunate nationsThe first new school lunch standards championed by Michelle Obama have been phased in over the last several school years.In addition to whole grain requirements, the rules set fat, calorie, sugar and sodium limits on foods in the lunch line and beyond. While many schools have had success putting the rules in place, others have said they are too restrictive and costly.Backlash against the rules have spawned a wave of social media photos along with the tag #thanksMichelleObama. If these pictures are any indication, schools have responded to the rules by cutting down on portions to reduce fat and calories rather than by using potentially more costly ingredients. Meanwhile, the widely different meals from Spain, Ukraine, Greece, South Korea, Brazil, France, Finland and Italy are all fresh and wholesome, with fish, steak and vegetables featuring prominently.Photos of the meals appear on Sweetgreen.com. But in the UK and US, lunch trays feature processed foods such as popcorn chicken, frankfurters, cookies, and beans from a tin.

Mary's Meals - which began in 2002 as a one-off school feeding programme - currently provides daily life changing meals to over 989,000 hungry children in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Eastern Europe and South America.The surprising pictures show just how the UK and US measures up to the rest of the world when it comes to feeding schoolchildren.

http://www.emergent.info/Jihadi-John-is-Mohammed-Emwazi	Claim: 'Jihadi John' is a Londoner named Mohammed Emwazi	unverified	['ISIS', 'Jihadi John', 'Mohammed Emwazi', 'Washington Post']	http://www.washingtonpost.com/	http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/jihadi-john-the-islamic-state-killer-behind-the-mask-is-a-young-londoner/2015/02/25/d6dbab16-bc43-11e4-bdfa-b8e8f594e6ee_story.html	2015/02/26	 LONDON — The world knows him as “Jihadi John,” the masked man with a British accent who has beheaded several hostages held by the Islamic State and who taunts audiences in videos circulated widely online. But his real name, according to friends and others familiar with his case, is Mohammed Emwazi, a Briton from a well-to-do family who grew up in West London and graduated from college with a degree in computer programming. He is believed to have traveled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined the Islamic State, the group whose barbarity he has come to symbolize. “I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John,” said one of Emwazi’s close friends who identified him in an interview with The Washington Post. “He was like a brother to me. . . . A representative of a British human rights group who had been in contact with Emwazi before he left for Syria also said he believed Emwazi was Jihadi John, a moniker given to him by some of the hostages he once held. “This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person,” Qureshi added. Authorities have used a variety of investigative techniques, including voice analysis and interviews with former hostages, to try to identify Jihadi John. James B. Comey, the director of the FBI, said in September — only a month after the Briton was seen in a video killing American journalist James Foley — that officials believed they had succeeded. Nevertheless, the identity of Jihadi John has remained shrouded in secrecy. Since Foley’s killing, he has appeared in a series of videos documenting the gruesome killings of other hostages, including four other Westerners, some of whom he personally beheaded. In each, he is dressed in all black, a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose. He wears a holster under his left arm. A spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Washington said: “Our prime minister has been clear that we want all those who have committed murder on behalf of ISIL to face justice for the appalling acts carried out. There is an ongoing police investigation into the murder of hostages by ISIL in Syria. It is not appropriate for the government to comment on any part of it while this continues.” ISIL is another name for the Islamic State. U.S. officials declined to comment for this report. Emwazi’s family declined a request for an interview, citing legal advice. The Kuwaiti-born Emwazi, in his mid-20s, appears to have left little trail on social media or elsewhere online. Those who knew him say he was polite and had a penchant for wearing stylish clothes while adhering to the tenets of his Islamic faith. He had a beard and was mindful of making eye contact with women, friends said. He was raised in a middle-class neighborhood in London and on occasion prayed at a mosque in Greenwich. The friends, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the investigation, believe that Emwazi started to radicalize after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster. Emwazi and two friends — a German convert to Islam named Omar and another man, Abu Talib — never made it on the trip. Once they landed in Dar es Salaam, in May 2009, they were detained by police and held overnight. It’s unclear whether the reason for the detention was made clear to the three, but they were eventually deported. Emwazi flew to Amsterdam, where he claimed that an officer from MI5, Britain’s domestic security agency, accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates in the southern part of the country, according to e-mails that he sent to Qureshi and that were provided to The Post. Emwazi denied the accusation and claimed that MI5 representatives had tried to recruit him. But a former hostage said Jihadi John was obsessed with Somalia and made his captives watch videos about al-Shabab, which is allied with al-Qaeda. The episode was described in the Independent, a British newspaper, which identified Emwazi as Muhammad ibn Muazzam. Emwazi and his friends were allowed to return to Britain, where he met with Qureshi in the fall of 2009 to discuss what had happened. “Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated,” Qureshi said. Shortly afterward, Emwazi decided to move to his birthplace, Kuwait, where he landed a job working for a computer company, according to the e-mails he wrote to Qureshi. He came back to London twice, the second time to finalize his wedding plans to a woman in Kuwait. In June 2010, however, counterterrorism officials in Britain detained him again — this time fingerprinting him and searching his belongings. When he tried to fly back to Kuwait the next day, he was prevented from doing so. “I had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started,” he wrote in a June 2010 e-mail to Qureshi. But now “I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London. Nearly four months later, when a court in New York sentenced Aafia Siddiqui, an al-Qaeda operative convicted for the attempted murder of U.S. personnel in Afghanistan, Emwazi expressed sympathy for her, saying he had “heard the upsetting news regarding our sister. . . . In the interview, Qureshi said he last heard from Emwazi in January 2012, when Emwazi sent him an e-mail seeking advice. “This is a young man who was ready to exhaust every single kind of avenue within the machinery of the state to bring a change for his personal situation,” Qureshi said. Close friends of Emwazi’s also said his situation in London had made him desperate to leave the country. It’s unclear exactly when he reached Syria or how. One friend said he believed Emwazi wanted to travel to Saudi Arabia to teach English in 2012 but was unsuccessful. Soon afterward, the friend said, he was gone. “He was upset and wanted to start a life elsewhere,” one of the friends said. Once in Syria, Emwazi contacted his family and at least one of his friends. It’s unclear what he told them about his activities there. A former hostage who was debriefed by officials upon release said that Jihadi John was part of a team guarding Western captives at a prison in Idlib, Syria, in 2013. The hostages nicknamed the facility “the box.” Emwazi was joined by two other men with British accents, including one who was dubbed “George.” A former hostage said Emwazi participated in the waterboarding of four Western hostages. Former hostages described George as the leader of the trio. Jihadi John, they said, was quiet and intelligent. “He was the most deliberate,” a former hostage said. Beginning in early 2014, the hostages were moved to a prison in the Syrian city of Raqqa, the Islamic State’s de facto capital, where they were visited often by the trio. They appeared to have taken on more powerful roles within the Islamic State. About the same time, Qureshi said, he sent an e-mail to Emwazi. “I was wondering if you could send me your number,” he wrote. There was no response. Goldman reported from Washington. Julie Tate in Washington and Griff Witte and Karla Adam in London contributed to this report.

I used to chat with her quite a lot and was shocked when I learned what she did and what might have been going on at the house.'Another neighbour, who is in his 70s and asked not be named, said no one in the quiet suburban street spoke to DeJesus or her husband about their work in the porn industry.'We heard what they did but it was none of our business,' he said.Credido's ex-wife Maribel Barreto was also approached by Daily Mail.com and viewed the photos of DeJesus and Summers. The effect [of DC Toys Collector] is somewhat akin to crack for toddlers because of how you see them pining for it after its over.' When asked if DeJesus and Summers were the same person the 44-year-old went ashen-faced and hurried away.'I have nothing to say,' she said as she sprinted into her apartment.But Barreto, who was divorced in 2011, had earlier confirmed that her ex-husband and his wife Daiane ran the DC Toys Collector site from their home in Orlando.She said: 'Yes, they are the Disney Collectors. I can't say any more.' While DeJesus has done nothing illegal, many parents who allow their children to watch the videos might be dismayed to learn about the other graphic videos and photo shoots DC Toys Collector apparently took part in a decade ago.Attempts by Daily Mail.com to speak with DeJesus and her husband have failed as they have no phone listing and they do not accept unsolicited callers to the gated community where they now live. Neighbours in the upscale gated community confirmed that they know the blonde woman who lives with Messias Credido as Daiane DeJesus.The couple, who have an 18 month old son, were married on December 26th 2013, according to records lodged with Seminole County Court.Credido, who is also from Brazil, is behind another successful You Tube site called BluCollector. +29 <img id=""i-12f22b67eedbcd28"" src=""http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/02/18/25C87D9100000578-2958242-image-a-29_1424262065196.jpg"" height=""444"" width=""634"" alt=""DeJesus as she is today, with the mole near her elbow showing she used to be the porn star Sandy Summers"" class=""blkBorder img-share""/> Copy link to paste in your message DeJesus as she is today, with the mole near her elbow showing she used to be the porn star Sandy Summers +29 <img id=""i-934a81fde4c5fc0a"" src=""http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/02/24/25C640BC00000578-2958242-DeJesus_was_formerly_well_known_as_an_adult_performer-a-5_1424780752707.jpg"" height=""614"" width=""306"" alt=""DeJesus was formerly well known as an adult performer"" class=""blkBorder img-share""/> Copy link to paste in your message +29 <img id=""i-59eeaabde36cc6b2"" src=""http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/02/18/25C87D9900000578-2958242-image-a-36_1424262206012.jpg"" height=""614"" width=""306"" alt=""She is much less high profile these days"" class=""blkBorder img-share""/> Copy link to paste in your messageDeJesus was formerly well known as an adult performer (left) but now keeps a far lower profile (right) +29 <img id=""i-4636ff1b92d7170b"" src=""http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/02/18/25C8803500000578-2958242-image-a-38_1424262284463.jpg"" height=""926"" width=""634"" alt=""DeJesus as Sandy Summers by the fireplace thought to be at the Winter Park, Florida home "" class=""blkBorder img-share""/> Copy link to paste in your message DeJesus as Sandy Summers by the fireplace thought to be at the Winter Park, Florida home +29 <img id=""i-f2d3504c5168de8a"" src=""http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/02/24/25C6851500000578-2958242-The_29_year_old_once_made_risqu_videos_but_the_market_for_her_Yo-a-6_1424780776083.jpg"" height=""489"" width=""634"" alt=""The 29-year-old once made risque videos but the market for her YouTube channel now is toddlers"" class=""blkBorder img-share""/> Copy link to paste in your message The 29-year-old once made risque videos but the market for her YouTube channel now is toddlersIt is identical to the DC Toys Collector channel except it focuses mainly on toys for young boys.Both the BluCollector and the DC Toys Collector site are produced in exactly the same way.Shipping receipts seen by Daily Mail.com show toys being sent from Germany to the home address of Credido.Former neighbours in the Orlando suburb of Winter Springs where DeJesus and Credido lived said they would see deliveries from UPS and Fed Ex almost daily at their home.'There would be delivery trucks up to three times a day. We all wondered what was going on and what was being dropped off,' said a neighbour.Credido has been named as the man behind the Blu Collector by other media outlets.But until now the identities behind DC Toys Collector have been a closely guarded secret.The videos first began appearing on YouTube in 2012.They quickly became an online sensation attracting millions of page views and popular with children aged three and under because of their simplicity.The most watched video is called 'Play Doh Sparkle Princess' and has had more than 200 million views.Five other videos have received more than 40 million views, and another 15 have more than 20 million.The channel's 1,600 videos have been watched more than 2.4 billion times since being uploaded.One of the most recent, called 'LUNCH BOX SURPRISE Magnetic Dress-Up FROZEN', has already notched up more than 260,000 page views.The DC Toys Collector channel has more than 3.7m subscribers with a new video posted almost every day. +29 <img id=""i-e4148f307b3d12f6"" src=""http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/02/18/25C87CD900000578-2958242-image-a-60_1424262647108.jpg"" height=""423"" width=""634"" alt=""DC Toy Collector's local Toys R US store where she buys some of the products she features on her channel"" class=""blkBorder img-share""/> Copy link to paste in your message DC Toy Collector's local Toys R US store where she buys some of the products she features on her channel +29 <img id=""i-205c6eeb05d3e271"" src=""http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/02/18/25C87C6100000578-2958242-image-a-61_1424262657372.jpg"" height=""423"" width=""634"" alt=""The branch of Target where Diane DeJesus sources some of the toys for her usually daily video posts"" class=""blkBorder img-share""/> Copy link to paste in your message The branch of Target where Diane DeJesus sources some of the toys for her usually daily video postsLike others on YouTube, DC Toys Collector is able to make money from the site from pop-up and banner adverts on the site.With so many children watching the videos on a daily basis it is an obvious choice for companies advertising toys to place their adverts within the short videos.Each time the DC Toys Collector site is watched, the producers are paid.Industry experts say they get between .60cents and $5 each time the page is viewed.Google, which owns YouTube, takes 45 per cent of any money earned.The company Open Slate, which analyses YouTube, estimated that in 2014 DC Toys Collector earned $4.9m.They reached the figure by looking at the account's subscribers, social media reach and average monthly view count. I call it first-person toy porn. I think it works because it's Christmas morning every minute. In the videos DC Toys Collector's face is never seen. Viewers only ever see her hands and hear her slightly accented voice.Each video always begins with the words: 'Hey guys, Disney Collector here'.The narrator, who has a slight accent, regularly uses the words 'adorable' to describe the toys and carefully unwraps each item before explaining its features.The videos are expertly produced with professional sound and lighting.A focal point of the videos are the brightly coloured fingernails that often feature toy characters intricately painted on them.The videos are said to have an entrancing effect on children who sit mesmerized as the toys are slowly opened in front of their eyes.Technology strategist David Williams told the NBC Today show in July 2014 that the effect on kids, including his own, was like 'crack for toddlers'.He told the show: 'The effect is somewhat akin to crack for toddlers because of how you see them pining for it after it's over'.Williams also told Buzz Feed: 'I call it first-person toy porn.

That same fireplace is pictured on the estate agent's webpage advertising the home for sale.DeJesus and Credido, who ran a now defunct photographic business called High Tec Photography, lived in Winter Park for almost seven years.The couple aroused the curiosity of neighbours as they were ultra secretive.One said: 'Messias said he was a photographer but he never left the house. They always made sure that no one would come into the house.'They were friendly when you bumped into them in the street, but they would not go out of their way to be talkative.'Another said: 'Word soon got around that Daiane was involved in some sort of adult work. No one liked to ask any questions but once we knew her working name we looked her up.'Publically available records with Seminole County show that the couple moved in April 2013 from Winter Park to a gated community in Orlando, paying $690,000 for a four-bedroom home.Daily Mail.com knows the exact location but has declined to publish it. It is also possible that Ms Barreto works with the couple on the DC Toys Collector website or even plays the part of the hands herself. However, she claimed to DailyMail.com that the couple are behind the production of the videos.Credido has also recently paid $300,000 for a plot of land in another gated community where he is expected to build a multi-million dollar home.Records filed with Seminole County court show that DeJesus and Credido were married on December 26, 2013. DeJesus is listed as a single woman while Credido is divorced.Her birth date is listed on the official form as April 1982 - four years different that Summer's on adult film websites containing her biographyDaily Mail.com has attempted to speak with the couple but they have declined to return any calls.

(Updated: Feb. 24, 2015 8:49 P.M.)GAZA CITY (Ma'an) -- Hundreds of Palestinians were evacuated from their homes Sunday morning after Israeli authorities opened a number of dams near the border, flooding the Gaza Valley in the wake of a recent severe winter storm.The Gaza Ministry of Interior said in a statement that civil defense services and teams from the Ministry of Public Works had evacuated more than 80 families from both sides of the Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) after their homes flooded as water levels reached more than three meters.Gaza has experienced flooding in recent days amid a major storm that saw temperatures drop and frigid rain pour down.The storm displaced dozens and caused hardship for tens of thousands, including many of the approximately 110,000 Palestinians left homeless by Israel's assault over summer.The suffering is compounded by the fact that Israel has maintained a complete siege over Gaza for the last eight years, severely limiting electricity and the availability of fuel for generators. It has also prevented the displaced from rebuilding their homes, as construction materials are largely banned from entering.Gaza civil defense services spokesman Muhammad al-Midana warned that further harm could be caused if Israel opens up more dams in the area, noting that water is currently flowing at a high speed from the Israel border through the valley and into the Mediterranean sea.Evacuated families have been sent to shelters sponsored by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, in al-Bureij refugee camp and in al-Zahra neighborhood in the central Gaza Strip.The Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) is a wetland located in the central Gaza Strip between al-Nuseirat refugee camp and al-Moghraqa. It is called HaBesor in Hebrew, and it flows from two streams -- one whose source runs from near Beersheba, and the other from near Hebron.Israeli dams on the river to collect rainwater have dried up the wetlands inside Gaza, and destroyed the only source of surface water in the area.Locals have continued to use it to dispose of their waste for lack of other ways to do so, however, creating an environmental hazard.This is not the first time Israeli authorities have opened the Gaza Valley dams.In Dec. 2013, Israeli authorities also opened the dams amid heavy flooding in the Gaza Strip. The resulting floods damaged dozens of homes and forces many families in the area from their homes.In 2010, the dams were opened as well, forcing 100 families from their homes. At the time civil defense services said that they had managed to save seven people who had been at risk of drowning.Related

Aldeson.“Determining an official cause of death could take as long as 3 weeks,” said County Coroner Frank Shultz. “It’s just too early to tell what caused his tragic death.”The shocking news comes just days after a recent “60 Minutes” interview where Nelson was quoted as saying “Life is good and I have never felt better or been happier.”This story is still developing and all information is not yet officially verified.Related Posts

However 3:2 repetition can be added to 24p video, which has never been near a telecine, and in Europe we use 2:2 pull-down, where there are no duplicate fields to detect and remove/cope with.There's so much misinformation and poor explanation of broadcast video - and in particular interlacing and de-interlacing - it gets a bit annoying. Particularly when a phrase appears that is based on a standard broadcast production process (Telecine-ing is the act of transferring film to video using a telecine machine) is used to mean something else (removing 3:2 pull-down/repetition which may or may not have been caused by a telecine)Quote:As such, any video with an altered framerate is expected to undergo IVTC to restore the progressive frames and decimation to remove duplicate ones, whereas material that is truly interlaced is more difficult to decomb.Yes - though in 50i/60i they are both forms of de-interlacing. 24p/25p content with 3:2/2:2 can be restored losslessly with the right de-interlacing algorithm, whereas native interlaced content will always be ambiguous (there is spectrum folding in the vertical spatial and temporal domains that cannot be undone - though some good guesswork can be made) Obviously native interlaced 50i/60i content should be de-interlaced to 50p/60p not 25p/30p if you want to keep the full motion (i.e. temporal resolution) of the original. How you do this depends on the quality you want to achieve (particularly the vertical resolution) and the processing power you have. The best de-interlacers will use stuff like Phase Correlation Motion Compensation to detect which areas are moving, and in what direction, to create the ""missing"" fields that need to be created to generate a decent 50p or 60p result.(These processes aren't new, and in fact have been an issue in broadcast production since the 80s. High quality DVEs (Digital Video Effects devices) used in production control rooms, that zoom and shrink, rotate, page peel etc. pictures have used realtime de-interlacing to generate the highest vertical resolution pictures they can when you zoom into a live native interlaced source. If you process fields individually (which lower cost DVEs do) you end up with noticeably poorer quality results (particularly when you enlarge a picture))Quote:Since you seem knowledgeable in this area, one thing I've yet to understand is what happens with US dramas shown at 720p60. Material on stations that broadcast 1080i60 can be restored through IVTC to achieve 1080p24 frames, but if the source is already progressive, I don't know if the frames are simply duplicated (rather than the fields), which would then mean that only decimation would be needed to restore the original framerate, or if there is a separate way to IVTC progressive content to restore its original framerate.They're both very similar. In interlaced 3:2 you are looking for the repeated field (which will be alternating between field 1 and field 2) in a pair of source frames which you simply discard to give you 2:2 (which you can de-interlace to 1:1 with a simple field-merge - aka weave). You obviously need to continuously detect the field duplication - as 3:2 content edited in the video domain could break the 3:2 cadence (i.e. you could end up with edits that break the repeated 3:2:3:2:3:2 pattern) by comparing fields and where two are identical you discard one.The same techniques can be done in the 3:2 60p domain, but in this case you also need to detect the repeated pairs of frames as well as the repeated triple frames as you need to go from 3:2 to 1:1 without any de-interlacing. You are still detecting and discarding repeated images - but you have 3 repeated frames rather than 1 repeated field to detect per pair of source frames. With a 3:2 regular cadence 24p within 60p you detect 2 repeated frames followed by 1 repeated frame.Some compression systems optionally also allow you to flag 3:2 sources so you don't have to send redundant content (though repeated fields/frames compress quite well) so rather than sending the duplicate fields or frames, you flag them for duplication in the receiver. If you have access to the compressed stream you can detect the flags and thus recreate the 24p source without having to run any content-based repeated field/frame detection."

Now tonight a senior defense official confirming to Fox News that Marines were directed to turn over their weapons before they were allowed to leave. According to one source the order came from the U.S. State Department. That is generating some serious outrage tonight especially among Marines who are taught from day one never surrender your weapon. At least one Marine telling Fox News, ‘Blank yeah, it pissed me off.’ Pardon me, his term. ‘I’m not giving up my weapon to anyone.’”UPDATE:The U.S. Marine Corp denied the report in a statement released Wednesday night:The Marine Security Force left the American embassy in Yemen for the movement to the airfield as part of the “ordered departure” with only personal weapons. All crew served weapons were destroyed at the embassy prior to movement. None of them were ‘handed over’ in any way to anyone. The destruction of weapons at the embassy and the airport was carried out in accordance with an approved destruction plan.Upon arrival at the airfield, all personal weapons were rendered inoperable in accordance with advance planning. Specifically, each bolt was removed from its weapons body and rendered inoperable by smashing with sledgehammers. The weapons bodies, minus the bolts, were then separately smashed with sledgehammers. All of these destroyed components were left at the airport — and components were scattered; no usable weapon was taken from any Marine at Sana’a airport.To be clear: No Marine handed a weapon to a Houthi, or had one taken from him.Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor	2015/02/11

I now know that these are “adults” who just cannot handle the fact that I have the right to make choices, and that these choices ultimately hardly even affect them.1/17/15 – Editor’s note: Due to the large number of interview requests, I have extended an invitation to the author to post her response to the comments and general negative feelings towards her. I will post an update as soon as she responds.In the spring of 2012, I found out that I was pregnant. I had a good idea who the donator was, but money wasn’t really an issue, and I knew that I would be a good mother-like figure for the child by myself. I have always believed in the right for all women to have a choice in terminating their pregnancy, but when I confirmed the diagnosis about a month into into it, I decided that I WAS ready to have this child.My journey has taken me to many different places fighting for women’s rights and carrying the banner of the Feminist Movement, even to the point of eschewing a career. One of the more prominent themes that I saw in these places was that men generally would look down on us, refuse to help us, or hardly even lend an ear so that we could air our grievances. This didn’t surprise me, the patriarchy has been well entrenched since the dawn of time, but here I was, here I am, ready to change it.One of the more alarming incidents happened while I was on my way to San Francisco to participate in an Occupy Wall Street rally. I sat down in my seat on the plane, which happened to be extra full for that day, and a particularly well dressed man happened to be sitting in the seat beside me, in the aisle. After takeoff, he asked me what I was going to San Francisco for, while I generally wouldn’t talk to a man sitting next to me on an airplane, I told him I was going to the OWS rally.The man literally scoffed when I spoke those words and leaned in and quietly said to me “B****** like you need to learn their place”. Stunned, I screamed “ASSAULT!” while other passengers looked at us, the woman across the aisle from him immediately told him to get away from me, but not 5 seconds passed before a flight attendant had rushed over to intervene. [sociallocker id=”86″] As I explained to the flight attendant what had happened and I demanded to move seats, I was told that there were only 2 other open seats available, both back in Economy.*Trigger warning* – Extreme patriarchyBy this time, a male flight attendant was on the scene and I told him to have the man moved. The woman-hater just laughed as the flight attendant continued to press me on if he made any physical contact with me. For a moment, I contemplated bending the truth in order to get the woman-hater away from me. His words had violated both my feelings, and my trust, perhaps as much of a violation as actual physical touch. In the end, I confirmed that no physical contact was made, to which both flight attendants told me they couldn’t make him move.I was flabbergasted, and then betrayed as they recommended that I move to one of the empty seats. This left me in tears. I knew the only way to get away was to move seats so I did so tearfully and having felt as though I had been verbally and emotionally raped.By the time we landed, my outlook had changed, I could no longer depend on men to be an ally of the cause.As spring turned into summer and my belly started to grow, my mind ran wild with the thoughts of teaching my daughter from a young age tolerance and feminist ideals. Choosing the right all-girls daycare, then elementary school, all so that she could grow up and thrive in an environment where women are told that they can do anything that they want to do. No man will be around to hurt her progress, no boys there to demean her or call her names.I had already started buying gender neutral clothing since I did not want outside influences affecting what gender she would ultimately become. My research on nannies one day came to an abrupt end when my cell phone alarm went off – time for my 5 month appointment. These early appointments had gone well enough, my baby was progressing in a healthy manner.Today, my doctor, who I will call “Sandy” did an ultrasound and everything appeared to be fine. “Would you like to know the gender?” Sandy asked. I thought to myself “That machine is an ultrasound, not a crystal ball, you couldn’t tell me the gender of my baby even if you wanted to”“Sure” was my response.“It’s a boy”…..……“What?” I managed to sputter. Sandy then showed me on the ultrasound how exactly my body had betrayed me even worse than the misogynistic suit jockey on the airplane so many months before. I was in shock, I started crying, weeping at the thought of what I was about to curse the world with.On my way home, my driver asked if I was ok and if I needed anything. “JUST STOP RIGHT HERE” I yelled. Deciding to walk the 4 blocks back home. My home became my prison and my fetus became my warden the next 48 hours. Crying, sobbing, uncontrollable weeping, mental anguish the likes of which may only be experienced by those who have had their lives destroyed by war, I was a refugee, and my home was my refugee camp, an unfamiliar place that was just….sheltering me.By the third day, I started regaining some of my mental strength and knew what I had to do. I couldn’t bring another monster into the world. We already have enough enemies as it is. It didn’t matter that I would be raising a son, he would still come into contact with boys, men, perhaps even the suit jockey who would inevitably twist his carefully constructed upbringing with their kindness. He would think “These men aren’t so bad, why would mom say that they are holding me down?”Not all men are bad, my driver showed genuine concern for my well-being that day and I may have taken my anger out on him. That may have been uncalled for. But I knew what I had to do.A few days later, I went in for the procedure, as it was fairly later in my pregnancy, I was aware there were certain risks, but it went off without a hitch. My body’s betrayal was no more, I was free, and for the first time since the airplane incident, I felt strong. I had done something positive, something that would actually make a difference, something good, even though as I would find out, many others wouldn’t see it that way.Today, I have a beautiful 1 year old female who will hopefully grow up to be just as strong and driven as her mother. I have endured a lot regarding my first pregnancy, but I don’t care. Sometimes, even allies will turn on you, but I don’t care.I stand by my decision to abort my baby because it was a male.I don’t hate men, I hate the patriarchy, what men, and even some women, turn into, I wasn’t going to let that happen with my offspring. The chances were greater that it would with a male, it was unacceptable.If the curse returns, I would do the exact same thing all over again.[/sociallocker]30 thoughts on “I Aborted My Baby – Because it was a Boy”My internet name says:TL:DR womans meets an asshole on a plane, who happens to be a man, falsely claims assault and 5 MONTHS aborts a boy because it’s a boy EVEN THOUGH she made a point of raising her girl gender neutral.Dave Spiller says:Doesn’t all-girl daycare and schooling just reinforce the gender divide, telling boys and girls they are defined by their sex?Totally says:No no no, this is gender equality did you even read the tags. It’s all good, all good.Sammy says:January 17, 2015 at 10:11 amThis is not meant to be hateful or condescending so please please read this. I feel like you’re taking the wrong mentality with this. Part of how we change society is by teaching our children. If your child is a boy, you can help change society by teaching him that misogyny is wrong and to treat women with respect and equality. He would then, in turn pass that on to his children, and so on, and so forth. I’m not saying a girl doesn’t also have the power to change things for the better but when the issue lies with the way men think, you had a chance to bring a respectful male into the world who would then be helping to pass on that mentality. I support a woman’s right to an abortion because there are several reasons why it might be necessary. Be it an inability to care for the child, the woman’s life being in danger, or an unwanted pregnancy due to rape, just to name a few. However I feel the gender of your child is not a valid reason as it’s extremely superficial and even somewhat hypocritical, especially when gender is a social construct anyway. Nothing can be changed and what you’ve done cannot be taken back so I won’t dwell on it and berate you for it but I do sincerely hope that if you ever have any more children, please give them all an equal chance, regardless of gender. If the child is a boy, use it as an opportunity to teach them what’s right so they can pass it down. If the child is a girl, then teach them to be strong like you currently are with your daughter. The gender of your child should never matter and by being selective, all you’re doing is supporting inequality in either gender.Disa says:January 27, 2015 at 10:33 amAGREED! Doesn’t matter the gender of your child, it is your child so you get to teach them what you think is right and they will pick that up and teach it to more people, male or female. Boy children are not born with any hatred for women. They are born with compassion and love for their mother and or other caretaker. Their mother, father, or other caretakers are who teach the child who to hate, not their assigned gender.Ashish says:’’Teach them to be strong like you currently are’’….Sabrina Parnas says:January 17, 2015 at 12:42 pmYou are a sick and twisted individual. A man hater like no other. Having a young child that is male, it makes me think that you could just abort it because it was a boy. You don’t deserve to have children if you discriminate based on their sex. You are no worse than all the men who are misogynist.Although I am very much pro choice, I find your reasoning flawed and disturbing. I hope you won’t damage your child with your vitriol.And where is the gender equality, if you are ready to abort at the first sign that it is a boy.Michael G says:January 17, 2015 at 2:39 pmYour loss. Your son would have loved you with all his heart. You would have been the most beautiful woman in the world to him. You would have been the most important person in his life forever.You won’t know the caring, loving man he could have been. You won’t know how great men can be…how great your son could have been. Your loss.Paul says:January 29, 2015 at 4:50 pmWhy is his value defined in terms of what he could do for her? He has value just because he’s human. I think the greater loss is his but I dread to think what his life would have been like with a mother like that.Yeah I'm going to remain anonymous... says:This almost made me cry I’m a sucker for words of sadness…but so trueCorey says:You are not a Feminist. You are a misandrist, plain and simple.Jen says:that’s the most immature thing done by a sane adult.unborn says:You clearly have no idea what assault is.Ted says:January 25, 2015 at 6:37 pmWhile I find the choice horrendous, I can’t fault the logic involved. If abortion is truly a woman’s choice, then what business is it of ours to question the reasons behind her choice? As I see it, there are only two possibilities*:A fetus is a meaningless bundle of tissue, without whatever makes life worthy of protection.or:A fetus is a human being.If the first is true, then what difference does it make why she had the abortion? It was a lifeless ball of inanimate matter. It was no more legally or morally wrong than choosing to play checkers, or choosing not to. And if the second is true, again, why should it matter? Aborting for ANY reason would be murder. (health reasons may leave no alternative, but the result is still a purposefully dead child) In either case, the reasoning behind the decision to abort is irrelevant. The only question is whether the concept of abortion (for non-health reasons) is morally defensible.*Of course, it’s entirely possible that a fetus is both, starting as lifeless, then becoming human at some point. In that case, no one knows when that transition occurs, leaving us again with only the above two choices.Joe Wilson says:That was disturbing and sad.scott not scared to use my real name mother fucking rodger says:I dont even have words.Ravi says:Um…not clear on how a fetus can be called a ‘boy.’ It could easily have been a trans girl, gay boy or non-binary person. It would certainly have been a feminist.Yeah I'm going to remain anonymous... says:She said, “I don’t see how she would know the gender- it’s an ultrasound, not a crystal ball” and ur rightTenny Mucho says:So, what was a wealthy person who flies first class and has a chauffeur doing going to an OWS rally?Me_Love_You_Long_Time says:Speaking truth to power, of course.Eline Piepo says:January 29, 2015 at 2:54 amQuestion for Lana (the mother): What are you going to tell your little girl, when she finds out that she’s actually only alive because mommy couldn’t stomach raising a boy? Don’t you think that’s going to produce a dent in her self-confidence, and maybe even her attitude towards feminism?calam says:January 29, 2015 at 3:08 amI am shocked and disgusted at this. YOU my dear are not a feminist, aborting your child because it’s a boy :-0.. The anger that fills me right now can not be put into words. Women like you give the rest of us who are feminists an awful name.I have a son, I adore him and he’s my world. . My husband is an amazing caring smart guy whom i hope my son takes after and we’ll do our best to help him grown into a wonder man.All I see from this is hatred of men instead of thinking you could have helped bring a wonderful man into the world you chose to KILL him. . It’s heartbreaking.I’m not against abortion for the RIGHT reasons.. Medical or rape but because it’s the wrong gender??????.Feminist you are not! And I as one am ashamed of youwhy says:Love how you delete hateful comments so much for freedom of speech.Bombe 20 says:January 29, 2015 at 4:20 pmLet me start by saying this: I totally respect and support the right of every woman to decide whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term. For any reason at all. A pregnancy has all sorts of effects on the body (and the mind) and while I find the slogan “my body, my choice” a bit too slogan-ish, I consider it basically correct.Now, I do think it is too late for an abortion once the fetus could be kept alive outside the womb, but that is a different discussion.But I have just had a look into my crystal ball and learned a few interesting about your daughter:In one to two years, she will find out that she has a sex — that she is a girl. And she will strongly defend that. She will love Arielle and Barbie and all things pink. She will want to be a princess for Halloween.Maybe you will try to push her in a different direction. You will give her a toy car. She will cuddle it, give it a name and put it to bed. Then you will give her a toy plane. She will make sure the plane becomes friends with the car and put them to bed together. You will give her toy tools. She will use the hammer as a baby bottle to feed the plane and the car. And she’ll still like pink.Sure, you will try to reason with her, argue with her, maybe shout at her. But that won’t change anything. At the most, she will learn not to talk about what she likes because it upsets mommy; in that case, you will not have liberated her, you will have broken her.Eventually she will learn what you did. That you betrayed her out of having an elder brother. An elder brother who would have loved her, cherished her, protected her. Maybe you will be able to outwardly convince her that your decision and your reasons were right. But deep inside she will despise you.And somewhere around 13 to 16 years of age she will start to rebel. On whatever the internet looks like then, she will find intelligent, thoughful and outspoken women like Erin Pizzey, Karen Staughan and the rest of the Honey Badgers. She will listen to what they have to say, see that it has merit and she will think of what you did to her brother.And she will become a vocal Men’s Human Rights Activist. You will have raised the next leader of the MHRM. Just by being who you are, doing what you do.Like making light of a horrendous crime. A man on a plane says something mean to you and you have the gall to claim you feel like you had been raped? Can you even imagine how reading such a sentence must feel to an actual victim of rape?But maybe you do. Everything that you write makes it very clear that you are harboring some kind of trauma. Maybe something really bad happened to you at some point in your life, maybe you even inherited it from your parents.But one thing is very clear: Joining a hateful ideology is not a healthy and productive way to process trauma. Therapy is.B20January 29, 2015 at 8:42 pmWhat the author is describing, frankly, is full-on, cold-blooded, willful, premeditated murder, and a hate crime against that. Misandry doesn’t begin to cover it. Whatever wrongs you may have suffered in your life, you had no right take it out on your child like that. That’s flat-out inhuman. And yes, you earned every bit of derision and disgust expressed in these comments.Duffy says:January 29, 2015 at 9:13 pm“One of the more alarming incidents happened while I was on my way to San Francisco to participate in an Occupy Wall Street rally.” “……and I demanded to move seats, I was told that there were only 2 other open seats available, both back in Economy.”*Trigger warning* – Extreme Sense of entitlement coupled with a shocking lack of self awareness.Noneya says:January 29, 2015 at 10:36 pmThere is no love that is like the love a son feels for his mother. From infancy, tiny hands clutching helplessly, embracing the loving warmth of his mother’s touch, to the childhood years of bumps and bruises and the tender healing love that only a mother provides.And you threw that all away. There are no going back. When you are lying down at night in bed, cold and alone, maybe then you’ll feel consequence. When your bed is a few degrees colder, and the spot next to you is empty and barren, where someone with absolute love and adoration could have been, nestled lovingly against you.	2015/01/17

http://www.emergent.info/McDondalds-pizza-still-being+served	Claim: Two locations in the U.S. are still serving the original McDonald's pizza	false	"[""McDonald's"", 'McPizza', 'Ohio', 'Pizza', 'West Virginia']"	http://o.canada.com/	http://o.canada.com/life/food-drink/attention-children-of-the-90s-you-can-still-get-mcdonalds-pizza	2015/01/29	Remember the crunch of the cornmeal crust? And the stringy cheese, with a slightly sweeter-than normal marinara underneath? Maybe you shoved french fries in it like birthday candles. Or ate it crust first, as was the style at the time. In any case, if you’re a child of the nineties, you remember it well: McDonald’s pizza. And, like pogs and Beanie Babies, it too disappeared with the innocence of your childhood. Except, in two magical locations in Ohio and West Virginia, where one hero owner has kept the McDonald’s pizza ovens burning all these years later. So bust out a gel pen to jot down these directions, because I’m about to tell you where you can still buy McDonald’s pizza. Neslted on the banks of the Ohio River, along the border with West Virginia sits the village of Pomeroy, population 1,852 in the 2010 census. And its McDonald’s, located along Main Street on the riverbank, still pumps out pizza — in five minutes or less, of course. It’s just a seven-and-a-half hour drive from Toronto in zero traffic, according to Google Maps. And, thanks to owner Greg Mills, there’s another McD’s where you can still get a slice, just over ninety kilometres away, across the state border. Spencer, West Virginia also boasts a McDonald’s that’s still lighting the pizza fires — or electrical coils, as the case may be. According to employee Judy Norman, it’s the same pizza as they sold when she started there 11 years ago and it’s presumably the same that children everywhere enjoyed throughout the 1990s. Mills, who it’s pretty safe to call an American hero for preserving this very unique pizza, couldn’t not be immediately reached for comment, but this post will be updated should he return our calls. Whatever actually happened to McDonald’s pizza, you ask? Well, for starters, it turned out adult palates didn’t quite take to it the same way kids did. When McDonald’s first launched its pizza in the Canadian market in the early ’90s, it was tapping into a growing appetite for pizza as burger sales dwindled. It even launched hockey-themed TV ads. The market for the savoury pie topped $2 billion in the early 90s, according to a 2004 National Post article on the death of McDonald’s pizza. And the company poured $25 million into the ovens alone across Canada, to moderate success throughout the decade. Then the-drive through took over — remember waiting for your pizza to be delivered with a plastic number on top of your car? — and pizza slowed things down as its own sales were dragging. So the ovens were scrapped and McDonald’s turned its sights on other gimmicky productions — like the Arch Deluxe, which I think we can blame for Jessica Biel becoming a thing. McPizza we all remember. Unfortunately, McDonald’s headquarters says it’s not the exact recipe, but it’s also reviewed online as being very close. So, the only way to sure is a road trip followed by a taste test. Canada.com will surely keep you abreast if we ever get around to doing that.	
http://www.emergent.info/Texas-Sharia-law	Claim: A jurisdiction of Texas is now under Sharia law	false	['Dallas', 'Sharia Law', 'Texas']	http://www.breitbart.com/	http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2015/01/27/hold-islamic-tribunal-confirmed-in-texas-its-voluntary-says-attorney/	2015/01/29	Islamic Tribunal Confirmed in Texas; Attorney Claims ‘It’s Voluntary’Islamic Tribunal Website27 Jan 2015An Islamic Tribunal using Sharia law in Texas has been confirmed by Breitbart Texas. The tribunal is operating as a non-profit organization in Dallas. One of the attorneys for the tribunal said participation and acceptance of the tribunal’s decisions are “voluntary.”Breitbart Texas spoke with one of the “judges,” Dr. Taher El-badawi. He said the tribunal operates under Sharia law as a form of “non-binding dispute resolution.” El-badawi said their organization is “a tribunal, not arbitration.” A tribunal is defined by Meriam-Webster’s Dictionary as “a court or forum of justice.” The four Islamic attorneys call themselves “judges” not “arbitrators.”El-badawi said the tribunal follows Sharia law to resolve civil disputes in family and business matters. He said they also resolve workplace disputes.In matters of divorce, El-badawi said that “while participation in the tribunal is voluntary, a married couple cannot be considered divorced by the Islamic community unless it is granted by the tribunal.” He compared their divorce, known as “Talaq,” as something similar to the Catholic practice of annulment in that the church does not recognize civil divorce proceedings as ending a marriage.He also said there is a difference between how a man and a woman can request a divorce under their system. “The husband can request the divorce directly from the tribunal,” El-badawi stated. “The wife must go to an Imam who will request the divorce for her.” He called it “two paths to the same result.” The practice of Khula is the process where a wife can initiate a divorce proceeding and where the husband can agree to the divorce in exchange for a financial compensation. It appears the wife must agree to give up any claim to the “dower” that was not already paid or to return it if it has already been paid. Once the financial issues are resolved the husband can then proclaim the Talaq (divorce).El-badawi said they follow Texas family law when it comes to child support, visitation, and custody. He said that in most cases, custody of children is awarded to the mother.Breitbart Texas asked what happens when there is a conflict between Sharia law and Texas law. El-badawi said most of the time, the laws are in agreement. When pushed further he admitted that, “we follow Sharia law.” However, he explained, “If the parties are not satisfied with the tribunal’s decision, they do not have to accept it and they can take the matter to Texas civil courts.” He did not say what the social ramifications of rejecting the “judge’s” decision would be.The website for the Islamic Tribunal states, “The courts of the United States of America are costly and consist of ineffective lawyers. Discontent with the legal system leads many Muslims in America to postpone justice in this world and opt for an audience on the Day of Judgment.”It goes on to state, “It is with this issue that Muslims here in America are obligated to find a way to solve conflicts and disputes according to the principles of Islamic Law and its legal heritage of fairness and justice in a manner that is reasonable and cost effective.”In explaining Sharia law, the website states, “Stoning adulterers, cutting of the hands, polyandry and the like (all can be traced in the relevant literature and can be explained in their Islamic legal mentality and rational context in fairness and justice), are mainly a part of Islamic Criminal Law. In fact criminal law within Islam only makes up a fraction of the Shari’ah. It is unscholarly and unfair to generalize that type of understanding, that is Criminal Law, to compromise the whole of Islamic law if we stick to speaking in technical terms.”The website lists four “ judges :” Imam Yusuf Z.Kavakci, Imam Moujahed Bakhach, Imam Zia ul Haque Sheikh and Dr. El-badawi. It states the Islamic Tribunal resolves business disputes, divorce (Talaq) cases, community problems, serious family problems, and Khula.El-badawi restated several times that participation in the tribunal is voluntary. However, he would not discuss what happens to someone who did not follow their rulings.Bob Price is a senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas and a member of the original Breitbart Texas team.

Kershov leaked private information that revealed that Michael Jackson is Mars’Â biological father.In a statement emailed to news and media outlets across the world, Kershov revealed that he was told by the singer that DNA testing had proven that Jackson, known across the world as the King of Pop, was without a doubt his biological father. After pleading with Mars, born under the name Peter Hernandez, to go public with the revelation, Mars refused to do so. Kershov insisted that it be made known to the public, and that the news would catapult the singer’s fame and boost record sales. Mars remained adamant that the information not be released. According to Kershov, he then took it upon himself and emailed the shocking news to media sources all over the world.“DNA testing has proven that Michael Jackson is the biological father of Bruno Mars,” Kershov said in the statement. “Against his wishes, I have decided to relay this message for the greater good and betterment of Bruno’s life and extravagant music career.”In a statement released by Mars’ new publicist, Jacqueline Pryor, it has been announced that Kershov was immediately fired by the singer, and may seek legal action against his former publicist. “The job of a publicist is indeed to better the career of their clients by persuading them to take part in things that cause their popularity to grow, however, the client must trust their publicist. The artist has the final say, no matter what.”When asked about the validity of Kershov’s statement, Pryor surprisingly made it clear that the information is accurate. “It is true. Doesn’t mean he was right in saying so, but it is true. When it comes to 29-year-old Bruno Mars, Michael Jackson is the father!”

Sutter said the film will star Charlie Hunnam, who played the lead character Jax Teller, as well as Ryan Hurst who played Opie Winston, and Katey Sagal as Gemma Teller. The film, which is a prequel to the storyline of Sons will also introduce fans to Jax’s father, John, who will be played by Brad Pitt.“I am most excited about bringing Brad (Pitt) on as John Teller, he is absolutely perfect for the role. The movie will take place from the day Jax was born, and leads up to the era just before Sons Of Anarchy began as a series.”Sutter also said that he is really happy to bring Ryan Hurst back as Opie Winston, and hopes fans will forgive him for killing Opie off. “Man I tell ya, when we killed Opie off, it was like the thing turned real. I’ve never gone public with this, but I’ve had people get really crazy when they see me in public,” said Sutter. “They shout at me, and they get angry – ‘You shouldn’t have killed Ope! I hope you rot in Hell!,’ that sort of thing. I had people try to run me off the road when they recognized me, although that just might be because I’m kind of a dangerous driver. Anyway, my hope is that this film will help them cope.”Sutter says pre-production on film will begin in the middle of 2015, and will begin shooting sometime in the fall. “For a movie of this scope, with this much storyline attached, you should expect to see the film by the end of 2016,” said Sutter. “In the mean time, buy all the official Sons of Anarchy merchandise you can. Every dollar goes to helping get this movie completed. Brad Pitt isn’t cheap, you know.” 	
http://www.emergent.info/mcdonalds-big-mac-hoax	Claim: McDonald's will stop serving the Big Mac	false	['Daily Buzz Live', 'Fake News', 'Hoaxes']	http://dailybuzzlive.com/	http://dailybuzzlive.com/mcdonalds-removing-big-mac-apple-pies-large-options/	2014/12/22	McDonald’s Removing Big Mac, Apple Pies And Eliminating Large Size OptionsPosted onby Daily Buzz LiveMcDonald’s Removing Big Mac, Apple Pies And Eliminating Large Size Options.McDonald’s has just announced that it will be phasing out 8 menu items the beginning of next year and most McDonald’s customers are not happy.With McDonald’s profits tanking over the recent months, the company has had to make some tough decisions to find adequate solutions for their financial distress by shrinking menu sizes. “Our intent is to have a cleaner menu board that is easier for customers to absorb,” spokeswoman Lisa McComb said in a statement. “To do so we must simplify our current menu.This means the end of the Big Mac, apple pie and large size menu items. Currently, the Big Mac has a whopping 550 calories and 29g of fat. The Apple pie contains 250 cal, and it would take a full 69 minute to walk that off! With that being said, those two menu items were not a tough decision for elimination.McDonald’s is currently testing out a new version of their slim down menu in Delaware, Little Rock, Waco, Bakersfield, Macon and Knoxville. They plan a full nationwide rollout beginning February 1, 2015.One notable “ingredient” – preservatives – might also be eliminated from the menu altogether. Mark Andrés, President of McDonald’s USA, sparked widespread speculation when he asked investors, “Why do we need to have preservatives in our food?” And then answered himself with a “We probably don’t.”What do you think about this new menu transformation at McDonald’s? In an attempt to make America healthier, do you think it will work?

Having said all that, yes I think they made a mistake,"" Obama said at a White House press conference.""We cannot have a society where some dictator someplace can impose censorship here in the U.S.,"" he added.Obama: Sony made a 'mistake'Related: FBI: North Korea responsible for Sony hackThe FBI has officially linked the cyberattack at Sony to the North Korean government.""The destructive nature of this attack, coupled with its coercive nature, sets it apart,"" the FBI said in a statement.The Motion Picture Association of America called the hack a ""despicable, criminal act"" on Friday.""This situation is larger than a movie's release or the contents of someone's private emails,"" said Chris Dodd, CEO of the lobbying group. ""This is about the fact that criminals were able to hack in and steal what has now been identified as many times the volume of all of the printed material in the Library of Congress.""The hacker message is effectively a victory lap, telling the studio, ""Now we want you never let the movie released, distributed or leaked in any form of, for instance, DVD or piracy.""The message also says, ""And we want everything related to the movie, including its trailers, as well as its full version down from any website hosting them immediately.""It warns the studio executives that ""we still have your private and sensitive data"" and claims that they will ""ensure the security of your data unless you make additional trouble.""The email was titled ""Message from GOP."" The anonymous hackers have called themselves ""Guardians of Peace.""Sony is still reeling from the late November cyberattack that crippled its computer systems, and now it is under severe scrutiny for canceling the Christmas release of ""The Interview,"" Seth Rogen and James Franco's comedy about an attempted assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.U.S. officials now believe North Korea instigated the hack , lending credence to the Sony executives who privately started calling it a ""terrorist act"" weeks ago.Since the cancellation on Wednesday, the same executives have been wondering whether the leaks of private emails and corporate documents would now stop.Thursday night's message implied that the leaks will stop.In a statement on Wednesday when the film's release was scrapped, the company said ""we stand by our filmmakers and their right to free expression and are extremely disappointed by this outcome.""Many lashed out at the studio for its unprecedented decision to pull the movie. Others have rallied around Sony's predicament.George Clooney, in an interview with Deadline.com on Thursday, revealed that he had circulated a petition earlier in the week saying ""we fully support Sony's decision not to submit to these hackers' demands"" -- but no one was willing to sign it.""It was a large number of people. It was sent to basically the heads of every place,"" Clooney said without naming names.The petition said, ""This is not just an attack on Sony. It involves every studio, every network, every business and every individual in this country,"" and it concluded, ""We hope these hackers are brought to justice but until they are, we will not stand in fear. We will stand together.""It's outdated now, since Sony did cancel ""The Interview."" In the interview, Clooney expressed sadness that ""as we watched one group be completely vilified, nobody stood up.""CNNMoney (New York) First published December 19, 2014: 10:12 AM ET"

Terms of use .Showing a rather shocking disregard for the long-term safety of human civilization, Microsoft has become one of the first companies to deploy autonomous robot security guards. Dubbed the K5, Microsoft’s Silicon Valley campus was being policed last week by five of these roughly human-sized 300-pound (136 kg) robots, each equipped with enough cameras, sensors, artificial intelligence, and alarms that they can replace most human security patrols. Fortunately, despite looking like uncomfortably like a Dalek from the Doctor Who universe, the K5 is not (yet) equipped with a ray gun or any other method for harming or detaining humans.Updated: Microsoft contacted ExtremeTech to tell us that the robots were only temporarily deployed at its Silicon Valley campus, as part of a demonstration put on by Knightscope. Microsoft PR says it isn’t “aware of any future plans” to deploy such robots.The K5 , built by the Californian company Knightscope, is billed rather euphemistically as an “autonomous data machine” that provides a “commanding but friendly physical presence.” Basically, it’s a security guard on wheels. Inside that rather large casing (it’s 5 foot tall!) there are four high-def cameras facing in each direction, another camera that can do car license plate recognition, four microphones, gentle alarms, blaring sirens, weather sensors, and WiFi connectivity so that each robot can contact HQ if there’s some kind of security breach/situation. For navigating the environment, there’s GPS and “laser scanning” ( LIDAR I guess). And of course, at the heart of each K5 is a computer running artificial intelligence software that integrates all of that data and tries to make intelligent inferences — like, should I tell HQ about that large gathering of teenagers, or should that man be climbing in through that window?K5 security robot. The lights can change color (red for trouble, orange for caution, etc.)If a K5 decides that there’s a situation, it can use one of its built-in sirens to try and diffuse things — or it can message HQ to summon a human. If you step in front of the K5, or otherwise interfere with it, it will gently warn you with some chimes — but if you don’t move, an “ear-piercing alarm” is triggered . Other than its sirens and its rather imposing design, the K5 isn’t equipped with any weapons or other tools for resolving situations. (Does anyone else think it looks like the lovechild of a Dalek and EVE from WALL-E?)A slightly odd photo of a US sheriff holding a gun to the head of a K5 robotK5 isn’t just for catching criminals, either: If you find yourself in trouble/danger, there’s also a button on the top of the robot that summons help from HQ.Read: Microsoft wants to be part of Judgment Day, tooThe purpose of the K5, like most robots, is straightforward: To replace expensive human workers. The K5 can run for around 24 hours on a single battery charge, automatically navigates back to the charging point when it’s running low, and only takes 15-20 minutes to recharge. Obviously, in the long run, this is cheaper and more efficient than a human security guard — plus, as technology improves, the K5 will probably be more vigilant and capable of spotting smaller discrepancies than a human. In theory, because of the lower cost, you could also field lots of K5 robots, reducing the number of potential holes in security coverage.It goes without saying, though, that deploying a fleet of roughly human-sized, autonomous robots is just a little bit scary. At the very least, a 300-pound robot would cause a lot of damage if it ran into something — a car, a shop window, a child. In all likelihood, though, if these robotic security guards are popular, they’ll eventually be equipped with weapons — perhaps a taser for subduing a suspect, and a tear gas launcher for clearing groups of people.

The ongoing rodent problem at Vogue, however, might give some prospective tenants pause. Even Anna Wintour is worried.Multiple sources tell Gawker that the offices of Vogue, located on floors 25 and 26 of 1WTC, are dealing with a rat infestation. The infestation is so acute, one source said, that the fashion title’s editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, recently issued a standing order: Staffers must ensure that her personal office is rat-free before she enters it. (If you have any other details, do get in touch .)Update (3:05 p.m.): Another source with knowledge of the rat situation writes in:Sales/marketing is already in but editorial was supposed to move in Monday and they’re figuring out today if they’re pushing that back due to the infestation. A serious concern (laughable but I guess it makes sense) is all the clothing that could get nibbled through.The rodent invasion is particularly noteworthy given how much the magazine has been advertising its new digs on various social media channels, particularly Instagram :Here’s what Anna Wintour’s office looks like:Condé Nast did not immediately return a request for comment.Update (5:45 p.m.): Condé Nast has still not returned a request for comment.If you know more, send an email to trotter@gawker.com or hop in below.Photo credit: Associated Press

Variety reported on Oct. 15 that Bale was in talks to star in “Jobs,” Sony’s biopic about the late Apple co-founder. Writer Aaron Sorkin recently confirmed the Bale casting. Jessica Chastain is being eyed for an unspecified role. Based on Walter Isaacson’s biography “Steve Jobs,” the real-life drama is directed by Oscar-winner Danny Boyle. Scott Rudin is producing the tech drama along with Mark Gordon and Guymon Casady. Sorkin, who also penned the Facebook drama “The Social Network,” has publicly said the movie will be divided into three long scenes, each taking place backstage before one of Apple’s famous product launches. Sony acquired rights following the Apple mogul’s death in 2011. Wozniak founded Apple with Jobs and Ronald Wayne and is credited with launching the Apple I and Apple II computers in the late 1970s, which had a profound impact on the microcomputer revolution. He left Apple as a full-time employee in 1987. Last year’s independently financed “Jobs” starred Ashton Kutcher as Jobs and Josh Gad as Wozniak and covered the era from 1974 to 2001 when the iPod launched. Worldwide box office was modest at $36 million. He is represented by UTA, Principal Entertainment LA and attorney Fred Toczek.

http://www.emergent.info/nhl-vegas	Claim: The NHL will announce an expansion to Las Vegas in 2014	false	['Las Vegas', 'NHL']	http://www.theprovince.com/	http://www.theprovince.com/sports/Tony+Gallagher+Bettman+changed+tune+expansion/10150984/story.html	2014/08/27	Gallagher: Bettman has changed his tune on NHL expansionTony Gallagher (The Province)Updated: August 28, 2014 9:56 AMFiled Under:EmailNHL commissioner Gary Bettman says the National Hockey League will ‘listen to expressions of interest’ in adding teams.Photo by Mark HumphreyIt wasn’t very long ago that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman was treating talk of expansion as though he was being asked if he’d like an epidemic of Ebola.But recently the nature of the rhetoric has changed so much that the question is becoming not if, but when.And then the ultimate question. Will they be able to limit the number of new teams to just two?Sources close to the situation have indicated Las Vegas is a done deal, the only thing to be determined being which owner will be entitled to proclaim that he brought the first major league sports franchise to Sin City.And given how dead set against a team in the gambling haven the commissioner was 10 years ago, this move into another player friendly state-tax-free zone represents a considerable about-face indeed.But people have been betting on hockey games for years and to pretend games couldn’t be fixed just as easily anywhere as in Vegas is pretty ridiculous, so that posturing has fallen by the wayside.A new team close to the newly renamed Arizona squad and California’s big three is all but assured, the only question being when and with which other city. Or should that be plural?With all the activity going on in the Seattle area in the last little bit it would be quite a stretch to imagine that much time and effort being spent by so many wealthy men being frittered away for nothing.At the moment there are no surefire plans to build a new rink, but that could change at any time with Vancouver billionaire Victor Coleman among many reportedly showing interest in putting an NHL team into the city.And Bettman hasn’t been visiting there to see if it really does rain a lot.It’s been 15 years since the NHL expanded — and given there are 16 teams in the east and just 14 in the west, taking in two more teams would certainly seem to make a lot of sense, the same amount of sense it made when realignment was first announced.And expanding without the players getting their mitts on any of the money other than the increase in payrolls is surely tempting, at least to those owners who remember the hefty cheques they cashed for Columbus and Minnesota.Whereas before the commissioner balked at expansion, this is a sample of his more recent verbal footwork:“There’s a lot of interest. We’re hearing from multiple groups in Seattle and in Vegas and Kansas City and Quebec City,” Bettman said to the Tribune while scoping out Target field in Minny for yet another trip to the well of outdoor games.“We have not decided to engage in a formal expansion process but we listen to expressions of interest. It’s not something we’ve seriously considered yet.”Like hell it isn’t. They’d have to be nuts not to be thinking about it seriously.And since then things have changed for a commissioner who hates to move teams in his league no matter how dire the circumstances might appear — one of the most likable aspects of his regime for most hockey fans. Once the league comes to your area, it is going to stay through thick, thin and the almost impossible, as seems to be the case in Phoenix.But could that long-standing policy and loyalty change with the Florida situation? True there’s a lease until 2028, but with the Panthers bleeding money, even the city of Sunrise can’t seem to see the point of carrying on much longer, so perhaps one of these new cities could get an existing team after all.And while Kansas City isn’t really likely to be a serious contender in this expansion soup unless they’re going to stretch it to four teams, saying no to Quebec City in favour of two more U.S. cities with no proven NHL backgrounds is almost certainly not going to happen.Going back to Minnesota has been a success, and there’s no question there’s more money and corporate backing than ever before in Quebec. Even an expansion team there in a new arena would be virtually assured of sellouts into perpetuity.There will be all manner of bleating about there being insufficient talent, of course, but even if it’s true, after such a long wait this trivial detail — which only troubles the fans — isn’t going to get in the way of a financial windfall like this.And any time the league decides it could use talent, they can start doing away with most of the coaches they employ whose chief calling in life is to devise ways to stop offensive players and choke the very life out of the game that’s paying their salaries.Expansion will be happening, and soon. The only question is how many new cities will be involved.

Devens Detention Center in Massachusetts, just a few short months after his high-profile trial and sentencing, according to warden Paul Jacobson.Corrections officers reportedly found the terror suspect face down in a pool of his own blood in his cell; a banana peel was found on the floor nearby.“It initially appeared as though Tsarnaev slipped on a discarded banana peel and hit the floor with such force that his head bounced off the hard tile surface, probably 16 or 17 times. There was blood everywhere – all over the walls, the floor, even the toilet. The injuries have caused massive brain trauma,” said prison investigator Joe Goldsmith. “We determined though, through expert analysis, that it would be impossible for these injuries to have occurred through a fall. Our investigation has shown that that it was the Aryan Brotherhood who initiated an attack on Tsarnaev.”“Yes, it was the brotherhood who took care of that bomber,” said Miles Smith, head of the Aryan Nation inside Devens. “The other gangs, they wanted him, too. We paid the guards the most money to have a shot. They stood aside, and let us do what we do. On the way out, they shook our hands, told us ‘Thank you.’ Well, You’re welcome. You’re welcome, Boston. You’re welcome, America!”“Normally, an attack this violent, this cruel, on another inmate would get any offending party more time added to their sentence,” said warden Jacobson. “Because of the nature of Tsarnaev’s crimes, though, we have decided to actually reduce the sentences of the Aryan members who were involved. They have done our prison and our country a great service, and we appreciate it immensely. They are heroes in the eyes of not only this institution, but also in the eyes of the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.”Tsarnaev had pled not guilty to all thirty charges filed against him, but was found guilty on all counts in April. He was sentenced to the death penalty per the crimes committed.

http://www.emergent.info/Planetary-alignment-weightlessness-hoax	Claim: A unique planetary alignment on Jan. 4, 2015 will cause partial weightlessness on earth	false	['Daily Buzz Live', 'Fake News', 'Hoaxes', 'Science']	http://dailybuzzlive.com/	http://dailybuzzlive.com/planetary-alignment-jan-4-2015-will-decrease-gravity-5-minutes-partial-weightlessness/	2014/12/29	Planetary Alignment On Jan 4, 2015 Will Decrease Gravity For 5 Minutes Causing Partial WeightlessnessPosted onby Daily Buzz LivePlanetary Alignment On Jan 4, 2015 Will Decrease Gravity For 5 Minutes Causing Partial Weightlessness.Strange natural occurrences are happening in the world today. But nothing more magnificent than the one you will experience on January 4, 2015.According to British astronomer Patrick Moore, at exactly 9:47 PST AM on January 4th, Pluto will pass directly behind Jupiter, in relation to Earth. This rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull, temporarily counteracting the Earth’s own gravity and making people virtually weightless. Moore calls this the Jovian-Plutonian Gravitational Effect.Moore told scientists that they could experience the phenomenon by jumping in the air at the precise moment the alignment occurred. If they do so, he promised, they would experience a strange floating sensation.Astronomers have long been aware that there would be an alignment of the planets on that date, when Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto would be on the same side of the sun, within an arc 95° wide. But now they are guaranteeing the occurrence as the gravitational effect of the other planets on the Earth’s crust is maximum even at their closest approach.But don’t get too excited. If you think you’ll be able to float around your house, you’re wrong. But, if you jump in the air at 9:47 AM PST, on January 4, 2015, it should take you about 3 seconds to land back on your feet instead of the usual 0.2 seconds.So, mark this date on your calendar and share it with your friends! Zero gravity day is just around the corner!

Their names were not released in anticipation of the oncoming media storm.Butte Police Commissioner Bartholomew S. Harrington told members of the Associated Press in a brief press conference that the five men, part of a local street gang connected with the infamous Crips, were seeking to collect on a drug debt and invaded the wrong house, with the intended target just so happening to be the next door neighbor of O’Neill’s.“Mr. O’Neill had just turned in for the night, but was awoken by a loud crash when his backdoor was abruptly kicked in. As the five thugs ran aimlessly through the home, Mr. O’Neill used silent hand-to-hand combat tactics to individually disarm them of their weapons. Once Mr. O’Neill had taken down the five men and secured his home, he brewed a pot of coffee and called the police station. Those boys sure did find the wrong house!” commissioner Harrington said as he chuckled.O’Neill had little to say on the matter when Butte Daily Times journalist Kevin Williamson interviewed the celebrated war hero.“It was nothing really. Those kids didn’t have their mission planned out properly and hit the wrong target. I hated to break their wrists and dislocate each of their knees like I did, but it was necessary in order to immobilize the invasion. I hope they get the money that is owed to them once they get out of jail and decide to live better lives. My main concern is getting my back door fixed. Those boys really did a number on the door jamb,” O’Neill stated.The neighbor who was the intended target seems to have abandoned home and has not been found by police. According to the men in custody, the debt was over a $50 bag of marijuana.

So how will McDonald’s define overweight?Obesity rates in America have more than doubled over the last 2 decades and has become the leading public health issue in the U.S. With more than two-thirds of the adult population overweight, McDonald’s has decided to become part of the obesity rate solution – not the problem.According to reports, beginning January 1, 2015, McDonald’s will no longer serve customers who show risks of being overweight. They will define overweight by these standards: Over 170 lbs for women and 245 lbs for men. Children’s weight restrictions will vary depending on age and height.McDonald’s is currently running campaigns to shake its “junk food” image, insisting they sell nothing but good quality food. They are are branding themselves from “A dining experience of fast food” to “Good food served fast.” They want people to understand the risks of being overweight.So how will they know if you are overweight ? Will they ask you what you weigh and trust your answer? NOThey are implementing scales at the from of every register just like the one in the photo below. You must stand on the scale when ordering or you will not be served. They also plan on posting signs to let customers know that they have the legal “Right to refuse service to anyone.” For drive-thru patrons it may be a bit more difficult to enforce. However, if the person looks like they exceed the weight restrictions, they will be refused service at the drive-thru window.

They know who’s being naughty, and who’s being really naughty, things that even extensive online snooping couldn’t provide. Dildos, vibrators, chains — all the things stashed in closets and under beds.”Sources told reporters these were previously inaccessible to the government’s leading intelligence agency, if the owners paid cash at least.“If you want to know why the ‘privacy advocates’ have settled down, and moved on? My guess is, blackmail. These elves have accumulated petabytes of evidence against pretty much everybody,” Snowden said.“You wouldn’t believe what perverse things people will do to each other, right in front of these things,” Snowden concluded. “It’s why ‘ElfMonitor’ is such a highly sought after duty assignment.”Recommended For You:

His prediction was issued in a new note to investors this week, a copy of which was provided to AppleInsider.Bachman is bullish on the Apple Watch, but he believes it will take some time for applications to be built that will truly sell the public on the upcoming wrist-worn device.His estimates suggest there will be an installed base of more than 484 million iPhone users as of December 2015. Sales of 19 million Apple Watch units would equate to 3.9 percent of the total user base.For fiscal year 2016, Bachman believes Apple will sell 36.5 million of the Apple Watch, growing to 10.9 percent of iPhone users by September of 2016.Bachman's confidence in the Apple Watch comes despite the fact that there is still much not known about the wearable. In particular, he's especially curious to find out final pricing, application availability, and battery life.Regarding the high-end price point, BMO's analyst isn't concerned if the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition sells for more than $10,000. He suspects Apple will sell very few units at that price, as most high-end watch consumers will opt for a brand like Rolex that can stand the test of time.Bachman also isn't concerned about suspected battery life of around 24 hours. He noted that most consumers have become accustomed to recharging their iPhone at night by their bedside, and he expects Apple Watch users will do the same.BMO has maintained its price target of $135 for shares of AAPL, along with an ""outperform"" rating.Topics:"

Martin teased that some of the characters still alive in the books will die in ""Game of Thrones"" Season 5. Photo: Facebook/Game of ThronesHBO is in talks with Apple to make Apple TV a launch partner for its highly anticipated streaming service when it debuts next month. HBO and streaming partner Major League Baseball Advanced Media are working to have the standalone service, called “HBO Now,” ready to launch in April in conjunction with the premiere of the fifth season of “Game of Thrones,” according to sources familiar with the plan.When it launches, consumers will be able to subscribe to HBO Now directly from HBO for the first time, rather than through a cable, satellite or telco TV distributor such as Comcast or Verizon. The retail price is expected to be $15 a month when purchased directly from HBO, or about what consumers pay when they order HBO through their cable, satellite or telco provider.HBO’s corporate parent, Time Warner Inc., will rely on a whole new line of distributors (e.g., Apple TV, Roku, Xbox, PlayStation, Amazon, etc.) to help market HBO Now to an estimated 10 million U.S. broadband subscribers who do not pay for a cable TV bundle. CEO Jeff Bewkes has said the offering could also help reach some of the 70 million cable TV subscribers who do not subscribe to HBO but might if given the opportunity to subscribe online.HBO’s over-the-top service has been cast as the biggest challenge yet to the so-called cable bundle, in which consumers are required to buy packages of channels, some of which they may never watch. One study claimed the service would lead to a 7 percent drop in pay TV subscriptions , as users opt out of cable and opt in to HBO Now.Some cable providers, however, such as Cablevision and Cox Communications, have expressed interest in bundling HBO Now with broadband for their own subscribers who don’t get cable TV.Apple has been most aggressive in courting HBO in a bid to add the service to Apple TV, sources say. Apple TV already carries HBO Go for current HBO subscribers, but it may add a second app for HBO Now. Apple has spent the past several years negotiating for the rights to offer its own linear TV package; in the meantime, HBO Now is seen as an added service to drive adoption of Apple TV.While HBO has not confirmed a launch date for HBO Now, internally the target is an April launch, in time for the April 12 debut of “Game of Thrones.” That’s an aggressive time frame for Major League Baseball Advanced Media, which is building the back end along with a new front end separate from HBO Go. HBO is taking care not to launch HBO Now before it can guarantee that the service will work without some of the technical glitches that plagued HBO Go during last year's debut of cult-fave ""Game of Thrones.""The launch of HBO Now will be a milestone for Time Warner’s premium TV channel, which has for most of its 42-year history been distributed as an add-on to a package of cable channels. The Web service will allow HBO to sign on a new group of distribution partners, which it sees as no different than when it added satellite TV and, later, telcos such as Verizon and AT&T.Each of those distributors pays a wholesale price for HBO and then resells it to consumers for anywhere from $13 to $18 a month. Most see HBO as a retention device; those who subscribe are less likely to drop service or switch providers. HBO and Time Warner declined to comment.At $15 a month, HBO Now will be significantly more expensive than Netflix, which ranges from $8 to $12 a month for various levels of service, but cheaper than some were predicting. HBO makes the case that it has more original programming than Netflix and a better, more current film library. “It’s a premium product, and it will be priced accordingly,” HBO CEO Richard Plepler said during a Time Warner earnings call in February.HBO’s push to launch HBO Now comes after years of talking about launching an over-the-top service that bypasses traditional cable TV. Understandably, it has been met with some resistance from current distributors, including Time Warner Cable and Comcast, two companies in the midst of a $46 billion merger, according to sources.HBO, of course, heard the same misgivings from cable companies when it first added satellite TV providers and then telcos as distributors. HBO’s strategy is to give early partners a pricing advantage over newer ones; it’s unclear how this will go over with Apple, which has a track record of squeezing advantageous deals out of media, including the 99-cent single more than a decade ago.Bewkes said in December that he saw “cord-cutting” accelerate as pay TV providers dropped subscribers. U.S. pay TV providers lost 125,000 subscribers in 2014, according to Leichtman Research Group. At the same time, HBO and Cinemax reported their highest number of new subscribers (2.8 million) in 30 years.Among the challenges HBO faces to get HBO Now launched is how to avoid confusion with HBO Go, the service that allows HBO’s cable TV subscribers to access it on the Web, smartphones and tablets. The two services will have separate log-in pages and separate apps, but some cable execs are concerned about customer confusion. The explanation might challenge even the best call center employee: HBO Go is for TV subscribers to watch their content on devices; HBO Now for those who don’t subscribe via TV.​Stay up to date with our daily newsletterRelated Stories"

Munster sees an overall ASP at around $650 for the mid-tier Watch series.On the high end, the analyst forecasts base model Apple Watch Edition devices to start at $4,999, but classifies segment ASP closer to $7,500 after adding in straps made from precious metals.Based on current pricing for Apple's silicon iPhone 6 cases, which come in at $35, Munster sees elastomer Apple Watch straps to start in a similar $29 to $35 range, while leather bands could be priced between $49 to $59. Pricing for metal bands like the link bracelet and Milanese loop are more difficult to determine, but the analyst believes steel versions will come in at $99, while gold bands could be priced into the thousands of dollars.""If you assume that 55 percent of bands purchased are elastomer, 35 percent leather, 10 percent steel, and about 5,000 total gold bands are sold, the average band ASP could be around $50,"" Munster writes.He added that if half of all Watch buyers purchase a band —assuming 8 million Watches are sold in 2015 —the accessory range would add $25 to Apple's watch category, equating to a $575 ASP. If every Watch customer purchases an extra strap, it would tack on $50, bringing ASP up to $600.The lower-cost Sport model is expected to make up 55 percent of overall Watch sales, while the mid-tier Apple Watch will take another 45 percent. That leaves very little room for Apple Watch Edition, but Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10,000 units this year. In an interesting comparison, the firm calculates that Apple Watch Edition business could equate to about two percent of luxury watchmaker Rolex, which moves between 600,000 to 750,000 units each year.Finally, Munster expects Apple to reveal a better sense of device pricing at its March 9 event , as well as highlight ""special features"" to drum up consumer interest ahead of release.AppleInsider will be covering the ""Spring forward"" event live from San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center next week.Topics:"

Pricing for metal bands like the link bracelet and Milanese loop are more difficult to determine, but the analyst believes steel versions will come in at $99, while gold bands could be priced into the thousands of dollars.""If you assume that 55 percent of bands purchased are elastomer, 35 percent leather, 10 percent steel, and about 5,000 total gold bands are sold, the average band ASP could be around $50,"" Munster writes.He added that if half of all Watch buyers purchase a band —assuming 8 million Watches are sold in 2015 —the accessory range would add $25 to Apple's watch category, equating to a $575 ASP. If every Watch customer purchases an extra strap, it would tack on $50, bringing ASP up to $600.The lower-cost Sport model is expected to make up 55 percent of overall Watch sales, while the mid-tier Apple Watch will take another 45 percent. That leaves very little room for Apple Watch Edition, but Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10,000 units this year. In an interesting comparison, the firm calculates that Apple Watch Edition business could equate to about two percent of luxury watchmaker Rolex, which moves between 600,000 to 750,000 units each year.Finally, Munster expects Apple to reveal a better sense of device pricing at its March 9 event , as well as highlight ""special features"" to drum up consumer interest ahead of release.AppleInsider will be covering the ""Spring forward"" event live from San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center next week.Topics:"

http://www.emergent.info/8dot2-release-march-2	Claim: Apple will release iOS 8.2 March 2	false	['BGR', 'iOS', 'Jonathan S. Geller']	http://bgr.com/	http://bgr.com/2015/02/27/ios-8-2-ios-8-3-download-release/	2015/02/27	Apple has been hard at work on multiple upcoming iOS versions simultaneously, and we’ve been told that iOS 8.2 is finally moving to the release stage. Barring any last minute problems, I would expect to see iOS 8.2 released this coming Monday, or the following week at the absolute latest. Additionally, we were told there might be as many as four iOS 8.3 beta versions. Apple released iOS 8.3 beta 2 earlier this week, so that leaves two more versions before the company makes it publicly available to customers. iOS 8.3 adds support for multiple new features and is filled with improvements in the operating system, though the biggest addition is support for the upcoming Apple Watch, which is slated to be released in early April. Apple’s event on March 9th should answer our remaining questions on pricing and other details. Additionally, stay tuned for the first The Boy Genius Report podcast coming later today with some thoughts on Apple Watch, the Apple Car, my struggle with the iPhone 6 Plus, and other interesting topics.

Apple critics have always roasted the company for selling products that are more expensive than they should be, and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers. But the “18-karat gold” Apple Watch Edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of $10,000. The funny thing in this case is that Apple is perfectly right to be charging that much!Do you disagree? Check out my counterpoint, “ The Case Against the $10,000 Gold Apple Watch Edition “Gold is ExpensiveLet’s start with a little backgrounder in gold. Everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive. Even rabid Internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news. But most people don’t understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is. So this is a good place to begin the discussion.Update: My calculations were wrong! Also, this was a bit “back of the envelope.” Now that it has some readership I realize I should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more realistic…Here are the basic facts:Gold currently sells for between $1,200 and $1,300 per troy ounce and has been over $1,000 per troy ounce for the last five years.18-karat gold contains 75% pure gold, and that term is regulated by law.One ounce of 18k gold occupies about 1.8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18-karat gold alloy weighs about 16.5 grams per cc.18-karat gold currently sells for $29.11 per gram, $905 per troy ounce, or $480 per cc..25 cc of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and .75 cc gets you a deployant clasp. It takes a few more to build a watch case, anywhere from 1.5 to 8 cc depending on the size and thickness of the case. So the buckle is worth $120-$360 and the watch case $720 to $3800 just as raw gold. This is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than $6,000!Gold Watches are ExpensiveLet’s apply this to a watch case. Imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep. If it was solid, this would equal 15.12 cc of volume. But it’s a watch case, so you have to leave room for the movement, dial, case back, etc. So let’s just leave 5 mm of thickness all around, making a hollow rectangle. This equals 6.8 cc (42 x 36 x 10 – 32 x 26 x 10). Therefore, the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost $3,200 as of this writing.A simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would cost more than $3,200Now let’s consider the same shape but just 2 mm thick. That’s 2.9 cc of gold, worth $1,400. Pick your thickness and you’re still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold.How does this translate in the real world? Let’s look at the retail price of some watches that are available in both stainless steel and 18-karat gold.This Cartier Tank MC is $15,000 more in 18k goldThe Cartier Tank MC measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9.5 mm thick: $15,000 extra (list) for 18k goldCartier Tank MC in stainless steel: $7,000 list, $5,800 streetCartier Tank MC in 18k pink gold: $22,000 list, $18,200 streetThe Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime measures 50.5 mm by 34.9 mm by 14 mm thick: $14,750 extra (list) for 18k goldJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in stainless steel: $8,550 list, $6,800 streetJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in 18k pink gold: $23,300 list, $18,400 streetThis list could go on and on, but the gist is simple: 18-karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel. In fact, it’s pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size and from any manufacturer. Even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny Chopard Happy Sport Mini sells for $11,000! Most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14-karat or less, very slim and small, or long out of production and with outdated pricing.Then there’s the bracelet. Swap a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra $20,000. Adding a gold bracelet to that Jaeger-LeCoultre bumps the price to $42,900!Certainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches, but one simply cannot deny the raw material value in a gold watch case. And the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities: There are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold, and plenty of reserves, so no company, no matter how strong, can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers.Another reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility. They can’t price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labor, distribution, and profit in a watch.The Apple Watch Edition Will Cost $10,000There’s a reason I picked those two watches for my comparisons: Both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm Apple Watch. The Cartier is a little smaller and the Jaeger-LeCoultre is a little larger, but both represent a traditional watchmaker’s gold-cased square-ish offering in the space. And both cost more than $20,000, with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle. And Jony Ive recently said that the historic Cartier Tank was one of his inspirations for the Apple Watch design!Apple would be crazy to sell the Apple Watch Edition for $20,000, though. That’s not going to happen. So they’re likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically.First, as we can see, the Apple Watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions. Although questionable from an esthetic standpoint, this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot. Second, Apple Watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display, sensors, and such. Third, the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum, not gold, to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions.Could it be gold plated? No. Numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case. Although Apple has not apparently used the word, “solid” in their press releases, they do claim it is “crafted from 18-karat gold” and nowhere does it say it is plated or “gold filled” (the industry term). There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could.Apple says that the Apple Watch will start at $349 for that aluminum Sport model, and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel Apple Watch to be roughly $1,000. It is reasonable to assume that the gold Edition model will sell for substantially more than this, with many suggesting $4,000 or $5,000. But remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold! Even with thin walls and a steel frame, it’s hard to see how Apple could make a solid 18-karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold.Gold is soft, but Apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as “standard gold”. Taking that at face value, perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately, cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch. This still leaves a few thousand dollars of material value in the case. The Apple Watch Edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes, a difference of about 20% in terms of case volume. So the smaller model could sell for 20% less still.My prediction is that the 42 mm Apple Watch Edition will retail for $9,999 with the 38 mm Apple Watch Edition retailing for $7,999. This covers the cost of the gold case, the internals, manufacturing, sales, and profit, and yet does not leave Apple subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too-thin or plated case. I will be shocked if the price is $4,999, but I suppose it’s possible with some finagling and if that’s the smaller model. And it will not be any less than that.This is a $10,000 productBonus prediction: Given the very high price of the Apple Watch Edition, I predict that availability will be quite limited. Apple will likely create special store-within-a-store spaces in certain Apple Store locations for the Edition. I further expect them to open special standalone Apple Edition Boutiques to sell the Watch Edition, accessories, and perhaps other future high-end products.Update!Needless to say, many people disagree with me. And now that @Gruber Fireballed this post , I imagine I’ll hear from lots of them real soon!The gist of the disagreement lies in the amount of gold needed for the watch case. I assumed it would be quite thick (read sturdy) and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold. Then there’s the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams. But @GAK_PDX (and others, though he was most visually eloquent) suspects it contains much less gold.For fun, I took my Apple Watch models and used SW and some basic assumptions to figure the gold content. 29.16g: pic.twitter.com/WGEnjtj1Yh— Greg Koenig (@gak_pdx) February 19, 2015I think this number is way too low, but it’s a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow. And it puts the raw gold at about $849 at $29.11 per gram of 18k gold. Although this is admittedly much, much lower than my estimate, it still illustrates my point that the Apple Watch Edition is not going to be cheap. And I think he’s way off but time will tell who is right and who is wrong.Another argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold Rolex watch . Right off the bat one should point out that gold cost $400/oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well, something Apple is apparently not going to do with the Edition. That Rolex case contained 18.5 grams of gold alloy, but it’s much, much smaller than the Apple watch and it’s circular to boot! A 34mm circle is 107mm in circumference, while the 42mm Apple Watch is 156mm in circumference. Use the magic of math to scale the Rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and we’re at 27.75 grams. But that case is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel, and the Apple Watch is pretty slab-sided. So we can probably double this safely and come out with $1,615 of gold in my mangled square Rolex case.So there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold. I can accept that. But let’s take a step back and think about the final price. Even if it contained less than $1,500 of gold, how much would it sell for? Certainly not $2,000 or $3,000. You still have to account for the cost of everything else, plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution. And profit for Apple (and a hedge against the volatility of the price of gold). So we’re back at the $4,000-$5,000 estimate others have made. As Greg Koenig tweeted, and Forbes reported , “If anyone thinks Apple is charging less than $5k for the Edition, they are smoking crack.”Regardless of the total, it’s important to realize that the price of gold is in the driver’s seat when it comes to pricing the Apple Watch Edition.I’d love to be wrong, and I look forward to updating this piece.

It’s entirely possible for them to put together a gold-cased Apple Watch for a much-lower price point, but I’m much more interested in the reasons why: Apple’s manufacturing and retail empire would be seriously disrupted by a $10,000 lump of gold!Apple probably doesn’t want to reconfigure their stored to resemble the Bank of England gold vaults! image CCbyND www.bankofengland.co.ukHow To Make A Gold Watch For Under $10,000In my last post, I pointed out (hyperbolically) that there are no gold watches available for less than $10,000. This isn’t really true – there are a few small gold-cased watches available below that mark. But comparing these to an Apple watch is (if you pardon the pun), a case of “apples and oranges”: They’re much smaller; they’re round; and they’re not Apple Watches!This last point is critical: We have no idea how the case of an Apple Watch is constructed. And, more importantly, the components, manufacturing, and sales process is entirely different from a Swiss mechanical wristwatch. My point was simply that Apple’s Watch Edition case looks like a big chunk of gold and that’s an expensive thing, likely pushing the total cost all the way to $10,000 if my assumptions are correct.But let’s say Apple didn’t want to build, stock, and sell a $10,000 watch but still wanted it to be “crafted from 18-karat gold.” How would they do it?Our first argument against the $10k solid gold watch is commonality of design and certification. Apple has never (to my knowledge) delivered a device with different models constructed of different materials. Electronics aren’t like watches. They are mass-produced and must be certified for electromagnetic (“RF”) interference. Apple says they’ll deliver Watches in aluminum, steel, and gold, but it would be much easier of all three had an identical internal design and only varied when it comes to the outer skin. (Counterpoint: Commonality inside doesn’t necessarily mean cheap outside.)This would also make the final product much cheaper, since the “gold case” could be extremely thin and not structural. Note that nowhere does Apple use the term, “solid gold case”, to describe the Watch Edition. I’m no lawyer, but their “crafted from 18-karat gold” boast could be weasel words to describe a conventional Watch wrapped in a thin gold skin.The lugs and bars (that’s the watch insider term for “the things that the strap attaches to”) as well as the strap buckle could simply be gold plated or even gold colored. This is important because even these seemingly-small pieces would cost hundreds of dollars if they are solid 18-karat gold. That’s how expensive gold is.One big clue could be the missing gold bracelet. It’s pretty glaring that the steel Apple Watch has two metal bracelets while the gold one only has leather and rubber. A gold watch bracelet has much more gold in it than the watch case itself, so the missing bracelet could be a clue that Apple is trying to keep the price in check. And the mere availability of the rubber strap which, as John Gruber notes , is the same as on the cheapest cheapie in the whole lineup could be another tell. Rubber bracelets are sometimes found on expensive dive watches, but this is no X Fathoms … (Counterpoint: They could add the gold bracelet later as an accessory.)Combine these clues and we could be looking at a much cheaper watch. It’s still inconceivable to imagine prices less than $1,000, but Apple could definitely finagle a $2,000 Apple Watch Edition. It’s more likely that the Edition would retail over $4,000, but this is a far cry from my earlier assertion that it would cost $10,000!Why Apple Wouldn’t Want A $10,000 WatchIt’s entirely possible for the “gold” Apple Watch Edition to be way under $10,000, but a more important question is why would Apple do this. After all, those making the decisions are very familiar with the luxury watch market and the incredible prices that gold watches command at retail. Why wouldn’t they want to “pull a Vertu” and cash in if customers are willing to buy?Let’s return to the cost of gold. Although Apple has produced $10,000 products in the past and currently stocks some pretty expensive devices in the stores, a gold watch is an entirely different animal. Gold is much more fungible than anything else Apple sells, so security is a much more critical issue. Remember the smash-and-grab iPhone heists ? How about that pallet of stolen iPhones ? Now imagine if those thieves could melt the case down and have an untraceable $4,000 lump of gold instead of some hot electronics.The high price of gold affects every aspect of my purported solid gold Apple Watch. Where would Apple manufacture a $10,000 watch? Even that little buckle would be worth more than a month’s pay for a Foxconn assembly line worker. And the level of finish required to compete with Swiss watches is not yet possible at scale in China. (Counterpoint: Apple could build the solid gold Watch Edition in Texas alongside the Mac Pro.)Then there’s shipment and warehousing. Although it is extremely unlikely that Apple would manufacture and ship the millions of gold Watches some analysts suggest, even more modest shipments would be immensely valuable. Securing these shipments from factory to warehouse to freight to warehouse to store will be a real challenge. Apple currently packs as many as 1.5 million iPhones into a single 747, but they couldn’t ship $15 billion worth of Watch Editions this way! Every point of collection and shipping would instantly be a ripe target for criminals. (Counterpoint: Apple already deals with armored cars, security systems, and locked vaults.)Even the stores themselves would need to be reconfigured. Is Apple ready to add armed guards, armored display cases, and time-lock vaults to their stores? Certainly the smaller stores don’t have space for a private room or boutique for Watch Edition buyers. (Counterpoint: We know they are working on a major redesign of the retail stores already.)And what about payment? Luxury watch buyers typically pay using wire transfers, not credit cards. Apple must prepare to process five-figure credit card transactions and accept wires. Are they ready to accept the hassle of validating buyers and payments of this size?Apple also has to worry about what a “1%” product like a $10,000 Apple Watch Edition would say about the company and its buyers. As Adam Fields notes on Medium , Apple will have to abandon their historic focus on “accessible luxury” and fully embrace their new role as a vendor of conspicuous luxury. Already frequently criticized as a maker of status symbols, this would be a lightning rod for Apple: If the gold Watch Edition sells for $10,000, it could spike Apple’s broader reputation and turn away customers rather than attract them.Apple risks alienating their loyal customers with a “1%” product. Could “Occupy Apple” become a reality? CC image by David ShankboneIt seems smart for Apple to skimp on the gold and bring the cost of the Apple Watch Edition to under $4,000. They would still have issues with production, shipping, and security but these would be reduced since they would no longer be dealing with four-figure lumps of fungible bullion.Yet even at that price the stores will need reconfiguration and the pundits will hurl jokes about the rich. If the company is going to suffer to bring out a gold Apple Watch Edition anyway, why not embrace the change and go solid gold?That’s why I’m sticking to my original predictions:The starting prices will be $7,999 and $9,999The Apple Watch Edition will have a solid gold case weighing more than 5 ouncesIf sales go well, Apple will later offer a gold Edition bracelet at $9,999 as an accessoryThe Apple Watch Edition will be offered through certain high-end third-party fashion boutiques and retailersSome larger Apple Stores will add a private “Edition Boutique” (but not all)A whole line of expensive and exclusive Edition products will appearThe Edition line will not be available from the online store or by mailRelated Posts

Apple critics have always roasted the company for selling products that are more expensive than they should be, and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers. But the “18-karat gold” Apple Watch Edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of $10,000. The funny thing in this case is that Apple is perfectly right to be charging that much!Do you disagree? Check out my counterpoint, “ The Case Against the $10,000 Gold Apple Watch Edition “Gold is ExpensiveLet’s start with a little backgrounder in gold. Everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive. Even rabid Internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news. But most people don’t understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is. So this is a good place to begin the discussion.Update: My calculations were wrong! Also, this was a bit “back of the envelope.” Now that it has some readership I realize I should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more realistic…Here are the basic facts:Gold currently sells for between $1,200 and $1,300 per troy ounce and has been over $1,000 per troy ounce for the last five years.18-karat gold contains 75% pure gold, and that term is regulated by law.One ounce of 18k gold occupies about 1.8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18-karat gold alloy weighs about 16.5 grams per cc.18-karat gold currently sells for $29.11 per gram, $905 per troy ounce, or $480 per cc..25 cc of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and .75 cc gets you a deployant clasp. It takes a few more to build a watch case, anywhere from 1.5 to 8 cc depending on the size and thickness of the case. So the buckle is worth $120-$360 and the watch case $720 to $3800 just as raw gold. This is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than $6,000!Gold Watches are ExpensiveLet’s apply this to a watch case. Imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep. If it was solid, this would equal 15.12 cc of volume. But it’s a watch case, so you have to leave room for the movement, dial, case back, etc. So let’s just leave 5 mm of thickness all around, making a hollow rectangle. This equals 6.8 cc (42 x 36 x 10 – 32 x 26 x 10). Therefore, the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost $3,200 as of this writing.A simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would cost more than $3,200Now let’s consider the same shape but just 2 mm thick. That’s 2.9 cc of gold, worth $1,400. Pick your thickness and you’re still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold.How does this translate in the real world? Let’s look at the retail price of some watches that are available in both stainless steel and 18-karat gold.This Cartier Tank MC is $15,000 more in 18k goldThe Cartier Tank MC measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9.5 mm thick: $15,000 extra (list) for 18k goldCartier Tank MC in stainless steel: $7,000 list, $5,800 streetCartier Tank MC in 18k pink gold: $22,000 list, $18,200 streetThe Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime measures 50.5 mm by 34.9 mm by 14 mm thick: $14,750 extra (list) for 18k goldJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in stainless steel: $8,550 list, $6,800 streetJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in 18k pink gold: $23,300 list, $18,400 streetThis list could go on and on, but the gist is simple: 18-karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel. In fact, it’s pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size and from any manufacturer. Even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny Chopard Happy Sport Mini sells for $11,000! Most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14-karat or less, very slim and small, or long out of production and with outdated pricing.Then there’s the bracelet. Swap a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra $20,000. Adding a gold bracelet to that Jaeger-LeCoultre bumps the price to $42,900!Certainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches, but one simply cannot deny the raw material value in a gold watch case. And the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities: There are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold, and plenty of reserves, so no company, no matter how strong, can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers.Another reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility. They can’t price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labor, distribution, and profit in a watch.The Apple Watch Edition Will Cost $10,000There’s a reason I picked those two watches for my comparisons: Both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm Apple Watch. The Cartier is a little smaller and the Jaeger-LeCoultre is a little larger, but both represent a traditional watchmaker’s gold-cased square-ish offering in the space. And both cost more than $20,000, with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle. And Jony Ive recently said that the historic Cartier Tank was one of his inspirations for the Apple Watch design!Apple would be crazy to sell the Apple Watch Edition for $20,000, though. That’s not going to happen. So they’re likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically.First, as we can see, the Apple Watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions. Although questionable from an esthetic standpoint, this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot. Second, Apple Watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display, sensors, and such. Third, the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum, not gold, to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions.Could it be gold plated? No. Numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case. Although Apple has not apparently used the word, “solid” in their press releases, they do claim it is “crafted from 18-karat gold” and nowhere does it say it is plated or “gold filled” (the industry term). There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could.Apple says that the Apple Watch will start at $349 for that aluminum Sport model, and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel Apple Watch to be roughly $1,000. It is reasonable to assume that the gold Edition model will sell for substantially more than this, with many suggesting $4,000 or $5,000. But remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold! Even with thin walls and a steel frame, it’s hard to see how Apple could make a solid 18-karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold.Gold is soft, but Apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as “standard gold”. Taking that at face value, perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately, cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch. This still leaves a few thousand dollars of material value in the case. The Apple Watch Edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes, a difference of about 20% in terms of case volume. So the smaller model could sell for 20% less still.My prediction is that the 42 mm Apple Watch Edition will retail for $9,999 with the 38 mm Apple Watch Edition retailing for $7,999. This covers the cost of the gold case, the internals, manufacturing, sales, and profit, and yet does not leave Apple subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too-thin or plated case. I will be shocked if the price is $4,999, but I suppose it’s possible with some finagling and if that’s the smaller model. And it will not be any less than that.This is a $10,000 productBonus prediction: Given the very high price of the Apple Watch Edition, I predict that availability will be quite limited. Apple will likely create special store-within-a-store spaces in certain Apple Store locations for the Edition. I further expect them to open special standalone Apple Edition Boutiques to sell the Watch Edition, accessories, and perhaps other future high-end products.Update!Needless to say, many people disagree with me. And now that @Gruber Fireballed this post , I imagine I’ll hear from lots of them real soon!The gist of the disagreement lies in the amount of gold needed for the watch case. I assumed it would be quite thick (read sturdy) and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold. Then there’s the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams. But @GAK_PDX (and others, though he was most visually eloquent) suspects it contains much less gold.For fun, I took my Apple Watch models and used SW and some basic assumptions to figure the gold content. 29.16g: pic.twitter.com/WGEnjtj1Yh— Greg Koenig (@gak_pdx) February 19, 2015I think this number is way too low, but it’s a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow. And it puts the raw gold at about $849 at $29.11 per gram of 18k gold. Although this is admittedly much, much lower than my estimate, it still illustrates my point that the Apple Watch Edition is not going to be cheap. And I think he’s way off but time will tell who is right and who is wrong.Another argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold Rolex watch . Right off the bat one should point out that gold cost $400/oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well, something Apple is apparently not going to do with the Edition. That Rolex case contained 18.5 grams of gold alloy, but it’s much, much smaller than the Apple watch and it’s circular to boot! A 34mm circle is 107mm in circumference, while the 42mm Apple Watch is 156mm in circumference. Use the magic of math to scale the Rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and we’re at 27.75 grams. But that case is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel, and the Apple Watch is pretty slab-sided. So we can probably double this safely and come out with $1,615 of gold in my mangled square Rolex case.So there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold. I can accept that. But let’s take a step back and think about the final price. Even if it contained less than $1,500 of gold, how much would it sell for? Certainly not $2,000 or $3,000. You still have to account for the cost of everything else, plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution. And profit for Apple (and a hedge against the volatility of the price of gold). So we’re back at the $4,000-$5,000 estimate others have made. As Greg Koenig tweeted, and Forbes reported , “If anyone thinks Apple is charging less than $5k for the Edition, they are smoking crack.”Regardless of the total, it’s important to realize that the price of gold is in the driver’s seat when it comes to pricing the Apple Watch Edition.I’d love to be wrong, and I look forward to updating this piece.

As disciplinary authority, Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu directed dismissal from service of Executive Engineer (Electrical), A K Verma, after the charge of wilful absence from duty against him was proven in an inquiry set up to probe the matter. A senior ministry official said that Verma, who had joined CPWD as an Assistant Executive Engineer in 1980, went on Earned Leave in December, 1990 and did not report to work thereafter. Verma went on seeking extension of leave which was not sanctioned and defied directions to report to work. An inquiry was instituted against him in September, 1992 for major penalty for wilful absence from duty. Due to non-cooperation of Verma with the inquiry and for other reasons, it got delayed and a fresh charge sheet was issued in 2005. The inquiry report, establishing the charges was submitted in July, 2007 and the same was accepted by the then Minister of Urban Development in August, 2007. But no further action was taken in the matter. Seeking to streamline the functioning of CPWD and to ensure accountability, Naidu, soon after assuming office directed review of pending vigilance and disciplinary cases for expeditious action against the accused. Verma’s case surfaced in due course and Naidu directed his dismissal from service.

Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., said he learned the information from the Border Patrol, warning that the alleged attempts to cross into the U.S. raise serious security concerns. ""ISIS is coming across the southern border,"" he told Fox News. ""They aren't flying B1 bombers bombing American cities, but they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico."" Hunter continued: ""I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas."" He claimed Border Patrol ""caught them,"" but ""you know there's going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol."" The Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday denied Hunter's claim. ""The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,"" a senior DHS spokesman said. ""DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border."" But Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper said the information -- that about 10 individuals with ""known ISIS affiliations"" -- came from a ""high-level source within the Border Patrol."" ""The congressman was conveying what he knows -- and what he was told,"" Kasper said. ""It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn't know what the right hand is doing -- it's been that way for a long time and we don't expect that to change."" Obama administration officials previously have downplayed the threat of Islamic State militants infiltrating the U.S. through the southern border, as warnings about that possibility have circulated. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in an interview with Fox News last week, acknowledged reports that four men with suspected terror ties had been apprehended at the southern border in Texas and questioned. But Johnson said they were ""scrutinized very, very carefully"" and officials found ""no evidence that these individuals were tied to terrorism."" Border Patrol and Homeland Security sources also told Fox News that they have not been able to substantiate Hunter's claim. They said between Sept. 23 and Oct. 6, only five illegal immigrants from ""special interest"" countries were arrested at the Texas border -- and they were from Bangladesh. The four men that Johnson referred to were actually Kurds, Fox News is told. Johnson, at a hearing last month, stressed that the government had ""no specific intelligence or evidence to suggest at present that ISIL is attempting to infiltrate this country though our southern border."" At the same hearing, National Counterterrorism Center head Matthew Olsen also said: ""There has been a very small number of sympathizers with ISIL who have posted messages on social media about this, but we've seen nothing to indicate there is any sort of operational effort or plot to infiltrate or move operatives from ISIL"" into the U.S. through the southern border. Still, Johnson said the U.S. needs to be ""vigilant"" and aware of the possibility of ""potential infiltration by ISIL or any other terrorist group."" The union representing America's immigration caseworkers also sounded an urgent warning last month about the threat. Kenneth Palinkas, president of the National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council, alleged the administration has made it easier for terrorists to ""exploit"" the country's visa policies and enter the homeland. He complained that the administration has ""widened the loophole"" they could use through the asylum system, and has restricted agents from going after many of those who overstay their visas. Further, he warned that executive orders being contemplated by President Obama would ""legalize visa overstays"" and raise ""the threat level to America even higher."" He said there is ""no doubt"" many are already being ""targeted for radicalization."" FoxNews.com's Judson Berger and Fox News' Jennifer Griffin and William La Jeunesse contributed to this report.Advertisement"

""There's been a marked increase in the number of elite officials visiting the ward,"" the source added.One intelligence official here said Kim's official car does not appear to have left Pyongyang, so it is likely he remains in the capital.The official said Kim is overweight and appears to have sprained his ankles during a grueling tour of military bases and factories in Cuban heels. Kim is around 170 cm tall and has become noticeably overweight since he came to power.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was seen limping in footage shown Friday on North Korean Central TV.There has been speculation that his obesity and binge drinking brought on gout. The official Rodong Sinmun daily recently said Kim ""labored on"" by visiting various facilities braving the hot summer weather.Kim missed a regular session of the Supreme People's Assembly in Pyongyang on Thursday.A government official here said, ""It's unlikely that a young man like Kim Jong-un would have missed the Supreme People's Assembly just because he has gout.""State TV in a rare admission on Thursday showed footage of Kim limping and admitted he is ill. South Korean intelligence also learned that a team of doctors from Europe recently went to North Korea."

Well you only need to be hear a very short while to know they can do very very little,' they added.The claims were backed up by Canon White himself, who shared the message just hours after he had earlier suggested the group were approximately six miles from the centre of Baghdad.In a message he also posted on Facebook, Canon White had said: 'The Islamic State are now within 10km of entering Baghdad. Over a 1000 Iraqi troops were killed by them yesterday, things are so bad. As I said all the military air strikes are doing nothing. If ever we needed your prayer it is now.'The militants are understood to have had their advance halted by airstrikes yesterday at Ameriyat Al-Falluja yesterday - a small city about 18 miles south of Fallujah and 40 miles west of Baghdad.But the clashes did not force the bulk of the fighters - with many of them now having made their way to the Baghdad suburbs for this morning's fighting.Approaching: Reports that ISIS militants are now just one mile from Baghdad came from the Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East - an organisation supporting the work of Canon Andrew White Fear: Canon Andrew White, is the vicar of Baghdad's St George's Church - the only Anglican church in Iraq. Earlier Canon White had claimed the terrorist group were six miles from the cityNo protection: Canon Andrew White later updated his Facebook page questioning the ability of the Iraqi ArmyFEMALE PILOT LEADS FIRST SORTIEA female fighter pilot led Britain's first combat mission against Islamic State.The woman, who has not been named, flew one of the RAF Tornados on the perilous sortie over jihadist-held territory in northern Iraq on Saturday.Stationed at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, she is believed to be a weapons systems operator.She sits in the jet's rear seat and fires the aircraft's Brimstone and Storm Shadow missiles and Paveway IV bombs.The airwoman, who serves with II (AC) Squadron, flies at exactly the same combat level as her male colleagues.A Ministry of Defence source said: 'No one makes a big fuss of having a female pilot. We have females in aircrews and ground crews and they are here because of their abilities. Everyone is just doing their jobs.'The news comes as RAF jets flew armed sorties for a second day over Iraq yesterday – but despite having now sent out jets five times, they again failed to locate any suitable targets for their weapons.Defence chiefs insisted that the flights by Tornado GR4 fighter-bombers were invaluable for gathering intelligence on the Islamist jihadists who have swept across large swathes of Iraq and Syria, carrying out massacres.But the failure to unleash any firepower has fuelled concern that Britain is failing to pull its weight in the international coalition against Islamic StateIt came as military commanders warned that Britain should brace itself to be dragged into a ground war in Iraq to crush IS, which is also known as Isis and Isil. Former top brass also warned that the air campaign would be futile unless the UK could target the terrorists in Syria.While the Ministry of Defence confirmed that the RAF's third mission had – like on Saturday – failed to locate any targets, US-led coalition aircraft targeted four makeshift oil refineries under IS control in Syria, as well as a command centre.The mobile refineries generate up to £1.2million a day for the militants.On a mission: The RAF jets seek out their terror targets in Iraq - which they failed to find and bomb, againStrong presence: Military leaders have said about two-thirds of the estimated 31,000 Islamic State militants were in Syria. But ISIS have held a number of towns and villages close to the Iraqi capital since earlier in the year, when government troops melted away following a lightning advance in the west of the countryMeanwhile, U.S. President Barack Obama has acknowledged that US intelligence agencies underestimated the threat posed by ISIS extremists in Syria, and overestimated the capabilities of the Iraqi army.Obama added that breaking up the terrorist cell will be a complicated battle involving both military and political action. The president spoke about the multi-national effort against ISIS in a televised interview with 60 Minutes, which aired Sunday night.Citing earlier comments by James Clapper, director of national intelligence, Mr Obama acknowledged that U.S. intelligence didn't take seriously enough what had been taking place in Syria.'Well I think, our head of the intelligence community, Jim Clapper, has acknowledged that I think they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria,' Mr Obama said.Conversely, the United States overestimated the ability of the Iraqi army to fight the militant groups, Obama said in the interview taped on Friday, days after the president made his case at the United Nations for action.President Obama says the US intelligence agencies underestimated Islamic State activity in Syria and overestimated the Iraqi army's role to fight back against militants Speaking to CBS's 60 Minutes, he said the militants had used the chaos of the Syrian civil war, when large swathes of the country were ungoverned, to 'reconstitute themselves'Militants: The terrorist-group ISIS has been taking large swaths of Syria and Iraq in the recent absence of a permanent U.S. military presence in Iraq KEY PARTNERS IN THE COALITION AGAINST THE ISLAMIC STATEThe U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group is growing, with dozens of countries among its ranks. The coalition is contributing a wide range of efforts, from carrying out airstrikes to providing military assistance and humanitarian aid.Here are some of the key partners in the coalition.UNITED STATESThe U.S., which is leading the coalition, has launched dozens of airstrikes on Islamic State targets. It also has sent military advisers, supplies and humanitarian aid to help Iraqi troops and Kurdish forces beat back the insurgents.GULF STATESSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have participated in airstrikes in Syria. A fourth, Qatar, has played what the Pentagon called a supporting role.The Emirates and Qatar also host air bases that are being used for the coalition's aerial campaign against the Islamic State group. U.S. Navy ships involved in the airstrikes are assigned to the Bahrain-based Fifth Fleet. Saudi Arabia has agreed to host training facilities for Syrian rebels on its territory.JORDANJordan has launched airstrikes against Islamic State positions, with government spokesman Mohammad al-Momani calling the move 'necessary in light of continuous attempts to infiltrate our borders.' The kingdom didn't give any specifics about its operations, but said the airstrikes aim to insure the country's security.EGYPTEgypt hasn't announced any specific participation in airstrikes, but President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi told the AP that Egypt is 'completely committed to giving support,' and will do 'whatever is required' to support the coalition.ISRAELIsrael is offering intelligence estimates and concrete intelligence to the U.S. on the Islamic State group as part of ongoing intelligence sharing between the two countries, an Israeli defense official said. But, he added, Israel wasn't asked to contribute anything beyond that. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the issue. The prime minister's office declined to comment.BRITAINBritain said that Tornado fighter bombers, supported by air-to-air refueling aircraft and signals intelligence, are operating over Iraq. Britain's media has widely reported that six warplanes are on standby in Cyprus, but defense officials have declined to offer specific numbers. Ben Goodlad from IHS Jane's has said that the Tornado jets offer the coalition enhanced capability to engage moving targets. Britain also has two weapons for long-range strikes: the Tornado's Storm Shadow cruise missile and the submarine-launched Tomahawk cruise missile, he said.FRANCEFrance has carried out airstrikes in Iraq on two occasions since joining the U.S.-led coalition on Sept. 19, firing laser-guided bombs from Rafale fighter planes upon munitions and military hardware stockpiles — first near northern Mosul, then on Thursday, near Fallujah. France is conducting the operations in Iraq from a French air base in the United Arab Emirates. The base, with about 750 French service personnel and six Rafales, is 1,700 kilometers (1,050 miles) from Mosul, meaning that the planes need refueling in flight to strike in Iraq.AUSTRALIAAn Australian air force contingent, including eight F/A-18 Hornet jet fighters and two support aircraft, has arrived in the United Arab Emirates. About 600 troops — most of them air force personnel — are being deployed with the aircraft. The jets are expected to be used in airstrikes against Islamic State fighters in Iraq, although the Australian government has yet to commit to a combat role.BELGIUMSix F-16 multirole fighters and a contingent of 120 support staff, including eight pilots, to be based in Jordan. Authorized to take part in operations over Iraq for one month, subject to extension if approved by the Belgian government.DENMARKDenmark has pledged seven F-16 fighter jets — four operational planes and three reserve jets along with pilots and support staff for 12 months. The U.S. also has asked Danes to provide military trainers to Iraq to school Iraqi and Kurdish fighters battling the Islamic State group on the ground. Denmark has already contributed a transport plane with personnel to a U.S.-led humanitarian operation in northern Iraq.CANADACanada has contributed about 70 special operations soldiers to offer instruction to Kurdish forces battling Islamic State militants in northern Iraq. Early this week, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Cabinet will be considering a U.S. request to support airstrikes against Islamic State forces. This could include five to eight CF-18 fighter aircraft as well as tanker aircraft. Canada has already contributed two military cargo planes that carried weapons to Kurdish fighters.GERMANYGermany isn't participating in any airstrikes against the Islamic State group. They have sent weapons to Kurdish fighters in Irbil, and a group of Kurdish peshmerga fighters arrived in Germany to receive weapons' training here by the German army. There's also German military in Irbil to train the peshmerga fighters in Irbil.GREECEGreece is participating with humanitarian aid and by sending ammunition for Kurdish forces fighting the Islamic State group. They haven't specified any more details on quantities or type of humanitarian aid.GEORGIAGeorgia will be providing humanitarian assistance, not military aid, according to comments made by Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili on Thursday to local news websites.HUNGARYHungary has promised to send 15 types of ammunition totaling nearly 6 million units to Iraqi Kurds. Most of the ammunition, 4.1 million cartridges, was the M43 type for the AK-47 assault rifle.ROMANIAPrime Minister Victor Ponta said his country would offer 'logistic, operational and humanitarian' support to the coalition, but not troops. He provided no details of the assistance.POLANDPoland supports the coalition against the Islamic State, but is not actively engaged in combat.Advertisement

http://www.emergent.info/texas-turkey-farm-ebola-hoax	Claim: A Texas turkey farm was contaminated with Ebola	false	['Ebola', 'Fake News', 'Texas']	http://dailybuzzlive.com/	http://dailybuzzlive.com/texas-turkey-farm-contaminated-ebola-holiday-turkeys-infected/	2014/11/16	Texas Turkey Farm Contaminated With Ebola, Over 250,000 Holiday Turkeys InfectedPosted onby Daily Buzz LiveTexas Turkey Farm Contaminated With Ebola, Over 250,000 Holiday Turkeys Infected.A Texas turkey farm employee is now under quarantine after he tested positive for the Ebola virus. Texas Prime Turkey Farm, the largest supplier of turkeys in the United States, has been ordered by the CDC to quarantine over 250,000 holiday turkeys. The CDC has confirmed 3,000 turkeys have tested positive for the virus since Friday’s incident.According to investigators, long time employee Philip Canseco was seen vomiting in the facilities restroom three days prior to the incident on Friday. “I was passing by the restroom, when I heard somebody throwing up inside,” said one Texas Prime Turkey Farm employee. “I opened the door and looked inside and saw Canseco throwing up in one of the urinals. I asked him if he was okay, he said yes, and I left. I didn’t want to get close to him and get sick.”Management confirmed that Canseco worked three full work days at the facility with flu-like symptoms, before passing out unconscious with a fever of 106°. Due to his symptoms, he was rushed to a local hazmat tent where he tested positive for the Ebola virus. The CDC reports an additional 7 coworkers are being quarantined and tested. However, they have not released those results as of yet.The facility has been ordered by the CDC to burn their entire flock of turkeys, over 250,000. Texas Prime Turkey Farm is requesting permission from the state of Texas to send the shipment of incinerated turkey ashes to Veolia’s Port Arthur environmental waste facility. This facility has already accepted one shipment of Ebola waste from household goods where Thomas Eric Duncan had stayed. Duncan was the first man to die of Ebola on US soil.Activists are protesting the shipments of contaminated Ebola waste to their community. “We feel every precaution should be taken to protect our community, our children and our elderly. We are not a dumping ground for the nations, or the world’s bio waste.”Plant manager Mitch Osborne said on Saturday that even though no contract has yet been signed, the plant will likely receive the second shipment of contaminated Ebola waste. “It is a safe and sound process,” Osborne said. “I am not going to place my employees in harms way, or the community. The company is here to improve the environment and I believe we are doing a pretty darn good job of that. I believe we are doing the right and safe thing.”A spokesperson for Texas Prime Turkey Farm said there is a good chance Ebola turkeys may have already shipped out to major suppliers for distribution. Each retailer will have to perform recalls individually if they feel they have received a contaminated shipment.

http://www.emergent.info/fort-carson-lockdown	Claim: Fort Carson is locked down because of a missing nuclear weapon	false	[]	http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/	http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index1809.htm	2014/10/14	"By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers The Foreign Intelligence Service ( SVR ) is reporting today that President Putins order to begin deploying tactical nuclear weapons throughout the Crimean Federal District is intensely/directly related to a missing, and believed stolen, low-yield atomic cannon shell from its storage bunker in Fort Carson , Colorado, which is a United States Army installation located near the city of Colorado Springs.According to the SVR, the atomic weapon missing fromFortCarsonhas been identified as a W48 nuclear artillery shell that measures 155 mm (6.1 inches) in diameter and 845.82 mm (33.3 inches) long.This report notes that the W48 was produced in two models, Mod 0 and Mod 1, which weighed 53.5 and 58 kg (118 and 128 pounds) respectively and have an explosive yield equivalent to 0.072 kiloton (72 tons of TNT).Though the US had reported that all of their W48 nuclear shells had been retired by 1992, this report says, the SVR has long noted their continued use for training by US Army 4th Infantry Division forces headquarter at Fort Carson and under the command of North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ) forces operating from the Cheyenne Mountain nuclear bunker complex, all of whom are located in El Paso County , Colorado.The specificUSweapons platform designed to fire the W48, this report notes, is the Paladin M109A6 155mm Artillery System [3rd photo left] which is currently operated by forces belonging to the 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 4th Infantry Division.Over the past few days when this W48 nuclear shell disappeared, this report continues, the forces of the 1st Brigade Combat Team were involved in training exercises with the 1st Battalion of the 66th Armored Regiment at Fort Carson ahead of their planned deployment in the next few weeks to the Fort Irwin National Training Center , in California, which will span much of November, after which they will be prepared to deploy to combat worldwide .US media reports about this missing W48 nuclear shell are nonexistent, this report further notes, other than their noting that Fort Carson has been put on a  total lockdown  as US military forces there continue their search for what they call a lost "" sensitive item "", a term they use that refers to gear including weapons, ammunition and night vision goggles - items that cause high-level concern when missing.These media reports further report that whatever is missing, it must be small enough to fit in a car causing Fort Carson security officers to spend about two hours inspecting all vehicles leaving Fort Carson's gates yesterday and their spokesman stating: As part of random searches at the gate, we are conducting outbound vehicle searches in order to prevent the unauthorized removal of government property from the installation.Of critical concern to the Kremlin regarding this missing W48 nuclear shell, SVR intelligence analysts in this report state, is that if fits nearly exactly to the strange and mysterious war game sprung on world leaders this past March by President Barack Obama that he named nukes on the loose and involved a terrorist attack with an atomic dirty bomb that takes place in the financial heart of an unnamed but Western metropolis.Londons Telegraph News Service in their report on this nukes on the loose war game further noted:David Cameron joined Barack Obama, Angela Merkel and Xi Jinping and other world leaders to play a ""nukes on the loose"" war game to see how they would cope with a terrorist nuclear attack. The German chancellor grumbled at being asked to play games and take tests with the Prime Minister, US and Chinese presidents around a table with dozens of heads of state at a nuclear summit in The Hague. Her complaints were overruled because Mr Obama was keen on the idea and in on the surprise.Of equal concern to the Kremlin, this report continues, are that these events are occurring as predicted by former US Assistant Treasury Secretary Dr. Paul Craig Roberts who this past June warned that Obama regime was planning for a preemptive nuclear attack.In his warning Dr. Roberts stated: Washington not only has war plans for launching a preemptive nuclear attack on Russia, and also possibly China, but Washington has a cadre of people who advocate nuclear war. We have people running around Washington saying things such as Whats the good of nuclear weapons if you cant use them.With the suicidal tendencies of the Obama regime becoming more apparent by the day, the SVR in this report grimly concludes, Russias near record de-Dollarization efforts , when coupled with the secret deal between the US and Saudi Arabia to destroy Syria , point towards a truly tragic global outcome as the American-backed Western economy is near collapseand all who oppose them will surely suffer their wrath.including the 1.2 million of their own citizens they currently have under surveillance and targeted for destruction.October 12, 2014 © EU and US all rights reserved.

The foreign bodies were identified as squidspermatophores.”A similar case was reported last year after a woman ate raw seafood in Japan,but British diners are unlikely to be hit because chefs in the West removeinternal organs when preparing squid.

They had prepared a plank which read thus:This party pledges itself and its candidates to stand inflexibly for government by due process of law and against all groups, open or secret, which attempt to take the law into their own hands. If its candidates are elected, this party gives assurance that no act of theirs will render aid or comfort to any organization based on prejudice or discrimination against any citizens for reasons of race, color, or creed.R.B. Creager of Texas, a friend of the late President Harding, was one of the leaders of the movement. He declared that the Klan proscribed:20,000,000 Foreigners 16,000,000 Catholics 10,000,000 Negroes 4,000,000 Jews _________ 50,000,000 peopleIt was a glaring indictment. It carried the inference that the party which opposed the Klan could win the support of half the people in the country. But the Republican Party was unpersuaded. It chose to temporize and inserted a plank of no particular meaning:The Republican Party reaffirms its unyielding devotion to the Constitution and to the guarantees of civil, political and religious liberty therein contained.So Mr. Creager of Texas went away somewhat discomfited. But another Texan went away feeling much better. He was Dr. Hiram Wesley Evans, a dentist by profession. Dr. Evans thrives in the regalia of Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.It was late in the Fall of 1922, some 18 months ago, that this Texan - a round-faced, plump man, somewhere in his forties, looking not unlike a successful, energetic politician - was elevated to the Wizardry from whence he directs the affairs of the Klan, controlling all the Imperial Genii - Klaliffs, Klaziks, Klokards, Kludds, Kligrapps, Klabees, Kladds, Klarogos, Klexters, Klonsels, Night Hawks, ---- as well as Kleagles, Giants, Cyclopes, Titans, Klepeers, Goblins, Dragons, Terrors, Klokans and common Klansmen-supreme over all the Klantons, Provinces and Realms of the Invisible Empire as well as Klonvocations, Konciliums, and Klonclaves as set forth in the Kloran and symbolized in the Klikon.But for all his high nomenclature, he is a modest man, who describes himself as ""the most average man in America,"" and who once said to his Knights: ""We have not been appointed by Almighty God or any Imperial Wizard to go out meddling in other people's business. . . . Get behind the law.""This personage, the visible Emperor of the invisible Empire, with a retinue estimated at 60 souls, moved into Cleveland shortly before the Convention. He established headquarters in a private house on Euclid Avenue, which according to some accounts was rented, according to others borrowed of a prominent Klansman. From there he conducted his efforts against an anti-Klan plank. His comparative success is attested by the plank quoted above.Only one setback was believed to have attended his visit in Cleveland. That took place in regard to the Vice Presidential aspirations of Senator Jim Watson of Indiana.At Cleveland, some Indiana Klansman at the Imperial headquarters let it be known that the Klan wanted Watson for Vice President. A storm ensued. ""Are they trying to kill me politically?"" demanded the Senator. ""I don't belong to the K.K.K. If they have issued a statement naming me, they have done it for the express purpose of injuring me.""Thereupon Dr. Evans denied emphatically that he was for Watson:""The statement that the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan are demanding the nomination of any man to any office is unqualifiedly false. I am the only man authorized to authoritatively speak for the Klan, and I solemnly deny that any political party will be allowed to attach, own or disown the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. (Signed) ""Dr. H. W. Evans, ""Imperial Wizard, ""Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.""Be that as it may, Senator Watson, when asked if he favored an anti-Klan plank, asseverated:""No, I do not. A platform, I believe, should be exclusively a statement of fundamentals which may be crystallized later into legislation. The Klan is a religious, not a political issue.""But whether the Klan is religious or political, Dr. Evans watched the Republican Convention with a critical eye; and it was made known that there would be a Klan headquarters in Manhattan during the Democratic Convention. Emperor Hiram has his finger on the pulse."

Turns out, Sprite stimulates the body to metabolize the sickening byproducts of alcohol more quickly.A hangover might not exactly be a genuine health crisis, but many days of productivity have been lost to the droning headaches, aching bones, and nausea that come with this self-induced form of mild alcohol poisoning.Closed CaptioningHung over? Sip a Sprite, study saysPlay Video - 1:01Hung over? Sip a Sprite, study saysPlay Video - 1:01David Letterman returns to ‘Late Night’ (as Seth Meyers’ guest)If Sprite manages to help with hangovers without even trying, what might happen if someone set out to make a lemon-lime flavored drink specifically designed to prevent a hangover? Let’s find out.RESQWATER (pronounced “rescue water”) has recently rolled out across the United States. It’s billed as an “anti-hangover drink” and is full of ingredients the manufacturer claims will help prevent a hangover when ingested in between alcoholic drinks. These include homeopathic-sounding things like organic prickly pear cactus fruit extract and milk thistle, as well as science-y stuff like electrolytes, B vitamins and N-acetyl L-cysteine.“Sugar, B-vitamins, electrolytes, water etc, all have been shown to have a role in alcohol breakdown,” NBC News health and diet editor Madelyn Fernstrom told TODAY.com when reviewing RESQWATER’s nutritional label, “but in the amounts found in this drink, who knows?”I decided to find out for myself by engaging in a night of slightly irresponsible alcohol consumption, supplemented with RESQWATER. I was curious to see if it would do a better job than my usual trick for warding off a hangover – matching each adult beverage with a glass of water.The manufacturer recommends one 8-ounce bottle of RESQWATER for every two or three alcoholic drinks consumed, and possibly another as a nightcap. They also recommend drinking the concoction cold, which is good advice, because while it has a pleasant enough lemon-lime flavor, there’s a funky sourness lurking beneath the surface, reminiscent of coconut water, which is minimized when chilled.My experiment took place the same evening I was playing around with my Dogfish Head Randall Jr. beer infuser, and I was happily concocting several interesting and inspired brews. When my experimentation was through, I’d gleefully consumed about four bottles worth of beer, with ABV’s ranging from 5.5 percent to 10 percent.I was feeling fine and the night was young, so I downed my first RESQWATER and retired to the man cave to enjoy a couple of drams of whiskey and catch up on my man-shows until about 2 a.m.Whiskey invariably leads to a nasty morning for me, so I was putting my faith in RESQWATER to save me from this ill-advised behavior. I drank another bottleful before hitting the sack and hoped for the best.I awoke the next morning feeling surprisingly well. I had no headache, no body stiffness, no oh-lord-please-let-me-die feeling. Even more, I felt noticeably better than when I match each glass of beer or booze with a glass of water.I did sweat a bit when I got to moving around doing Sunday chores, but I was essentially hangover-free, ready to tackle a busy day without the burden of the bourbon I had imbibed the night before. RESQWATER did the trick!To make sure things would stay that way, I drank a third bottle soon after waking up, a “hail Mary” move the manufacturer says can provide some relief, but not as much as swallowing the stuff during a night of drinking.Each 8-ounce bottle of RESQWATER retails for $4.49, putting the price tag of my symptom-free Sunday at about $15. While that might sound steep, it was a small price to pay for getting the poison of my poor decision-making out of my system and getting on with life.“Bottom line with this, and other kinds of ‘hangover’ treatments,” said Fernstrom, “The ingredients are all geared to help the body metabolize alcohol more quickly. The faster it gets out of your system, the less bad you feel.“It’s worth a try if you have the money,” she added. “There’s nothing in this that is potentially harmful.”According to the Economist , hangovers cost the American economy a whopping $220 billion dollars in lost productivity every year, and drinks like RESQWATER and plain old Sprite now give us hope for recovering the costs of all this wasted time.

He says he had to endure his mistreatment because he needed the money, but that now that he won $125 million it was time for revenge.”The Clarendon Hills Police Department admitted that its response time was inadequate and said it would keep a close eye on Mr. Morris to avoid any more incidents.Brian Morris had attracted a lot of media attention two weeks ago after winning $125 million at Powerball Multi-state lottery.When asked by organizers what he would do with the money, he had simply answered: “Just read the news, you’ll see“.He was freed on bail a few hours after his arrest, and told reporters to “stay alert“, claiming he had “a few other pranks to pull over the next few weeks“.

The meeting had been arranged on Craigslist, according to the paper.SIGN UPHelp us deliver journalism that makes a difference in our community.Our journalism takes a lot of time, effort, and hard work to produce.

Jeremy Lewis told the Norman Transcript . “So one of them fired four rounds.”The bullets hit both Moreland and Smith, and as Garcia-Boettler sped out of the parking lot, police say the brothers called their mom, 40-year-old Crystal Boettler, who told them to drive the bodies to her boyfriend's house, KFOR reported. When they arrived, police say the boyfriend, 43-year-old Johnny Shane Barker, helped the boys clean up the bloody van and sink the two bodies in a nearby pond with bricks, according to KOCO . The bodies had been dismembered, according to News9. A tip reportedly led police to the property where they found the truck four days later, alongside cleaning products and a power washer, according to KFOR . In the van, police found dried blood spattered on the ceiling and ""a bucket of water with a chainsaw bar inside and soaking in the water along with several jigsaw blades,"" according to the station.""We're just glad that we get some closure and we found him,"" Moreland's uncle Anthony Anderson told KFOR as police searched the residence. ""We needed this.""“It’s like my whole world’s been crumbled,” Moreland's mother Kennetha told KFOR.Smith's family is still grieving too.“I won’t get to see my only son ever again,” Alize's mother Destiny Smith told News9 . “Not only was he taken, I cannot even bury him the proper way.”She told the station she believed it was a ""hate crime,"" but Cleveland County District Attorney Greg Mashburn told the station his office had investigated and rejected the possibility.A total of four people have been charged in connection to the murders. The 16-year-old faces charges of first-degree murder, second-degree murder, unlawful removal of a dead body, desecration of human corpse and possessing a firearm after delinquent adjudication, according to KOCO. His brother Garcia-Boettler, Barker, and the mother, Crystal Rachelle Boettler, have been charged with accessory after the fact, according to the station.SHARECOPY LINKWitnessing a crime and reporting it can be just as frightening as being the victim of a crime.

The Trump administration has placed tariffs on a number of items, including electronic touch screens, iron and steel plates, medical devices, aircraft parts, batteries and other Chinese products.CreditChina Network/Reuters查看简体中文版 查看繁體中文版WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said Tuesday that it will place a 25 percent tariff on Chinese products like flat-screen televisions, medical devices, aircraft parts and batteries, outlining more than 1,300 imported goods that will soon face levies as part of a sweeping trade measure aimed at penalizing China for its trade practices.The move, which stems from a White House investigation into China’s use of pressure, intimidation and theft to obtain American technologies, is likely to inflame an already-simmering trade war between the countries. On Monday, China said it would slap tariffs on 128 American products in response to a separate White House plan to tax steel and aluminum from China and other countries.The products targeted by the White House are part of its plan to go after China’s dominance in cutting-edge technologies like semiconductors, electric vehicles and advanced medical products — industries that China is pursuing dominance in as part of an industrial plan known as “Made in China 2025 .”The Trump administration said that its analysts had identified products that benefit from these policies but refined the list to remove goods that were likely to cause disruptions to the United States economy or consumers.The list of goods excludes many Chinese-made consumer products available for sale at Target or Walmart, including clothing, shoes and toys. But it will most likely increase costs for American manufacturers that depend on imported parts because it concentrates heavily on machinery and high-tech components. The tariffs will be imposed on a total of $50 billion worth of Chinese products each year.The designation of targeted products will be followed by a comment period in which American companies can provide feedback to the Trump administration on the product choices. The administration will hold a public hearing on the submissions on May 15 in Washington, and companies will have until May 22 to file final objections.ImageThe products targeted by the White House are part of an effort to go after China’s dominance in cutting-edge technologies like semiconductors, electric vehicles and advanced medical products — industries that China is pursuing dominance in as part of an industrial plan known as “Made in China 2025.”CreditGilles Sabrié/BloombergBusiness groups, concerned about the effect on companies and workers, swiftly criticized the move.“Unilaterally imposing $50 billion of new tariffs without a long-term strategy that leads to economic reforms in China will only hurt America’s businesses, workers, and families,” the Business Roundtable, a corporate trade group, said in a statement. “Instead, the administration should work with U.S. allies on an approach that advances meaningful reform in China without imposing significant harm on America’s economy.”Jay Timmons, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said that American manufacturers were concerned about the trade relationship with China, including intellectual property theft, counterfeit goods and unfair subsidies, but also that tariffs were not the best response.In a strongly worded statement on Tuesday, the Chinese Embassy in the United States condemned the tariffs. “Such unilateralistic and protectionist action has gravely violated fundamental principles and values of the W.T.O.,” the statement said. “It serves neither China’s interest, nor U.S. interest, even less the interest of the global economy.”The Chinese would resort to “measures of equal scale and strength against U.S. products in accordance with Chinese law,” the statement said.While many American companies say they are unfairly treated in China, they have rued the possibility of a trade war between the world’s two largest economies, and the economic harm it could cause, and have begun pushing back against the White House’s plans . China remains a crucial and growing market for companies like John Deere and Apple, as well as for soybean farmers and growers of other agricultural products.Financial markets fell sharply on Monday as China imposed its own retaliatory tariffs on American products but regained most of their lost territory on Tuesday.President Trump, who has repeatedly promised tough action on China’s trade practices, said Tuesday that he intended to get along with China but that its unfair trade behavior had gone on too long. “It’s not something we can live with,” Mr. Trump said at the White House, adding, “I campaigned on that.”Trump advisers have criticized past administrations for allowing China to receive the benefits of global trade while continuing to break the international trade rules imposed by organizations like the World Trade Organization — a charge China denies.But the administration has struggled to persuade its critics that the kind of tough trade measures Mr. Trump favors can alter China’s behavior without tipping the world into a trade war and ultimately harming American workers and consumers. In addition to the tariffs, the White House is preparing to restrict Chinese investment in American technology and innovation, and to start a case against China at the World Trade Organization.“The administration is rightly focused on restoring equity and fairness in our trade relationship with China,” said Myron Brilliant, an executive vice president and the head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “However, imposing taxes on products used daily by American consumers and job creators is not the way to achieve those ends.”The Coalition for a Prosperous America, an organization that has supported the president’s trade agenda, called the China action a shift from “naïve” to “strategic” trade. “The age of appeasement must end,” said Paola Masman, the group’s media director.But the administration’s trade measures are prompting concern among many American companies, who are wary of Beijing’s response.The United States’ largest exports to China last year were aircraft and aircraft parts, which totaled more than $16 billion, according to IHS Markit. These products featured heavily on Tuesday’s list, setting off fears that China could retaliate with similar penalties against American plane maker Boeing.Dan Stohr, a spokesman for the Aerospace Industries Association, said the group was still reviewing the tariff list but would almost certainly file comments with the administration.Farming communities, one of the country’s largest exporters and a solid base for Mr. Trump, are among the most vulnerable. Chinese tariffs of 25 percent will particularly hurt American pork farmers, who sent more than $1 billion worth of products to China last year.Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, said American farmers were already struggling to make ends meet. “Increasing tariffs on exports will harm Iowa producers and undermine the rural economy,” Ms. Ernst said. “It’s my hope that we can pursue policies that enhance our competitiveness, rather than reduce our access to foreign markets.”Natalie Kitroeff and Ben Casselman contributed reporting from New York, and Keith Bradsher from Shanghai.Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook , Twitter and the Morning Briefing newsletter .Follow Ana Swanson on Twitter: @AnaSwanson.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A20 of the New York edition with the headline: White House Unveils Tariffs on Over 1,300 Chinese Products.

Seventeen people were killed.Published OnFeb. 14, 2018CreditImage by Saul Martinez for The New York TimesBy Audra D. S. Burch and Patricia MazzeiFeb. 14, 2018PARKLAND, Fla. — A heavily armed young man barged into his former high school about an hour northwest of Miami on Wednesday, opening fire on terrified students and teachers and leaving a death toll of 17 that could rise even higher, the authorities said.Students huddled in horror in their classrooms, with some of them training their cellphones on the carnage, capturing sprawled bodies, screams and gunfire that began with a few shots and then continued with more and more. The dead included students and adults, some of whom were shot outside the school and others inside the sprawling three-story building.The gunman, armed with a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle, was identified as Nikolas Cruz, a 19-year-old who had been expelled from the school, the authorities said. He began his shooting rampage outside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in this suburban neighborhood shortly before dismissal time around 2:40 p.m. He then made his way inside and proceeded down hallways he knew well, firing at students and teachers who were scurrying for cover, the authorities said.“Oh my God! Oh my God!” one student yelled over and over in one video circulating on social media, as more than 40 gunshots boomed in the background.ImageA father embraced his daughter after being reunited outside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Wednesday.CreditSaul Martinez for The New York TimesBy the end of the rampage, Mr. Cruz had killed 12 people inside the school and three outside it, including someone standing on a street corner, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said. Two more victims died of their injuries in local hospitals. The aftermath at the school was an eerie shrine, with chairs upended, a computer screen shattered with bullet holes and floors stained with blood.On Thursday, the authorities charged Mr. Cruz with 17 counts of premeditated murder .“This is catastrophic,” said Sheriff Israel, who has three children who graduated from the high school. “There really are no words.”Mr. Cruz was arrested in Coral Springs, a neighboring city a couple of miles from the school, about an hour after fleeing the scene, the authorities said. He had slipped out of the building by mixing in with crowds of students. In addition to the rifle, Sheriff Israel said Mr. Cruz had “countless magazines.”The gunman had clearly prepared for the attack, Senator Bill Nelson of Florida said in an interview after speaking to the F.B.I.Feb. 15, 2018“The shooter wore a gas mask, had smoke grenades, and he set off the fire alarm so the kids would come out of the classrooms,” said Mr. Nelson, citing details he learned from the F.B.I. Several students said they found it strange to hear the alarm, because they had already had a fire drill earlier in the day.Sheriff Israel said he did not know the gunman’s motive. He said a football coach was among the dead, and the son of a deputy sheriff among the injured. Twelve of the 17 dead had been identified by Wednesday night, he added, noting that not all of the students had backpacks or wallets on them.Mr. Cruz was enrolled at another Broward County school, officials said. Sheriff Israel said law enforcement officials had already discovered material on Mr. Cruz’s social media accounts that was “very, very disturbing.”Jim Gard, a math teacher at the school, said Mr. Cruz was in his class in 2016 and appeared to be a “quiet” student. But Mr. Gard also recalled that “there was concern” about his behavior on the part of the school administration, which emailed teachers relaying those fears.Feb. 15, 2018Mr. Gard said that after the shooting, he learned from several students that Mr. Cruz was obsessed with a girl at the school to the point of “stalking her,” a point the authorities did not raise in news briefings near the scene.The massacre called to mind the country’s two mass shootings that have come to be known by the name of the schools: Columbine, the high school outside Denver where 12 students and a teacher were killed in 1999; and Sandy Hook, the elementary school in Newtown, Conn., where 20 students and six adults were shot dead in 2012.More than 40 “active shooter” episodes in schools have been recorded in the United States since 2000, according to F.B.I. and news reports. Two 15-year-old students were killed and 18 more people were injured last month in a school in rural Benton, Ky. The shootings have become common enough that many schools, including Stoneman Douglas High, run annual drills in which students practice huddling in classrooms behind locked doors.With the Parkland shooting, three of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern United States history have come in the last five months.ImageLavinia Zapata embraced Jorge, her son, after the shooting.CreditSaul Martinez for The New York TimesMr. Nelson said the episode made him relive recent shootings that also shook the state. “Forty-nine slaughtered at the Pulse nightclub. Another handful slaughtered at the Fort Lauderdale airport, just a year ago, in the same county where this took place,” he said. “And that’s just Florida.”After the gunfire had stopped Wednesday afternoon and Mr. Cruz had fled, students ran out of the school, some in single file with their hands on the shoulders of those in front of them and others in all-out sprints. As the students sought cover, law enforcement officers armed with military-grade weapons swarmed the building. Parents rushed to a local Marriott hotel to reunite with their children.“I tried to stay calm. Students were running everywhere,” said Dianna Milleret, a 16-year-old sophomore who heard the gunshots.Noelle Kaiser, 17, was in history class when a fire alarm went off. The class was gathered just outside the building when she heard three distinct gunshots.VideoThe AR-15 assault rifle, and others like it, is commonly used in mass shootings in the United States. Here's a closer look at likely reasons.Published OnNov. 9, 2017“I am in shock,” she said softly after clutching her mother, Cheryl Kaiser, on the sidewalk outside the school.Seventeen patients were treated in three area hospitals, including two who died, said Dr. Evan Boyar of the Broward Health System. All suffered gunshot wounds.“Words cannot express the sorrow that we feel,” said Robert W. Runcie, the Broward schools superintendent. “No parent should ever have to send their kid to school and have them not return.”Parkland, an affluent suburb of Fort Lauderdale with a population of about 30,000, is known for its good public schools. Stoneman Douglas High is among the largest in the Broward school district, with about 3,000 students. The school will remain closed for the rest of the week. Gov. Rick Scott directed the state to lower its flags at half-staff until Monday.“My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting,” President Trump wrote on Twitter . “No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school.”As the authorities frantically searched for the person responsible, they asked residents of the city to avoid the area around the school.For hours, parents were lined along Coral Springs Drive, calling their children on cellphones and pacing. Some parents said their children told them only to text to not make noise. One parent of two daughters at a nearby middle school said he sat in a bank lobby near the school and prayed.The gunfire came as some students were still staring at chalkboards and listening to lectures.Rebecca Bogart, 17, a senior, said her teacher was finishing up a discussion of the Holocaust when she heard a series of loud bangs.“We all got on the floor and under the desk,” said Ms. Bogart, who was still shaking outside the school. “It felt like we were there 10 or 15 minutes and then shots came through the window and the glass shattered.”She couldn’t see her classmates fall, but she could see at least five were bleeding, one in the head and one in the leg. “I was trying to keep calm and my friend was holding my hand to keep it from shaking,” she said.When the authorities arrived, they took out her wounded classmates first. “There was blood all over the floor,” she said, “You never think something like this is going to happen to you and then it does.”Audra D.S.

False	['duffel blog']	https://www.duffelblog.com/	https://www.duffelblog.com/2018/01/armys-new-holistic-medics-treat-gunshot-wounds-crystals-essential-oils/	2018/01/18	Share TweetFORT SAM HOUSTON, Texas — In an effort to match the broad range of medical treatments available to the civilian population, the U.S. Army has introduced a new breed of battlefield medic, the service announced Friday.The new MOS, Complementary Medicine Specialist (69W), or “holistic medic,” will be trained in a variety of alternative medical treatments, ranging from aromatherapy to interventional prayer, and will be authorized to prescribe medications like megavitamins and homeopathic dilutions.“There’s great demand for treating warfighter injuries with more natural, holistic remedies,” said Col. Thomas Sorrenson, commander of the new program. “So where a traditional combat medic treats an amputated limb with a tourniquet and hemostatic gauze, our protocol opts for a healing-hands reiki session followed by some cleansing herbs.”“It’s a more integrative approach,” he said. “After all, what’s really more important: stopping massive blood loss and preventing shock, or curing a devastating disruption of a soldier’s chi?”In lieu of conventional trauma supplies like bandages, tourniquets, and chest seals, holistic medics’ aid bags will be stocked with colon cleanse kits, prayer beads, and ginkgo biloba auto-injectors.Sgt. 1st Class Nick Bye, an instructor in the holistic medic course, told Duffel Blog that the training to become a 69W is intense.“The course includes both lecture and hands-on instruction,” said Bye. “Holistic medics have to not only know their pharmacology, such as which essential oils to use for local anesthesia, but also practical skills, like stopping a sucking chest wound in under 30 seconds through the power of positive thinking.”“Sure, some have dismissed our methods as ‘pseudoscience,’ but we’ve demonstrated a 100% success rate,” he added with a confident smile. “We haven’t lost a training mannequin yet.”At Brooke Army Medical Center, the force is already witnessing the effects of the new methods of care.“Pretty sure I broke my ankle fast-roping from a UH-60, so I thought I’d be getting some X-rays and painkillers today,” Spc. Timothy Steiner told reporters from a hospital bed. “Instead this dude puts some magnets next to my leg and says that we just need to ‘redirect my body’s vital energy field.’”“Then he said he’d order some healing crystals and left the room,” he continued. “I really hope ‘crystals’ is some kind of doctor talk for Percocet. My energy field is fucking killing me.”Recommended For You:	2018/01/15
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/did-cdc-flu-shot-causing-outbreak/	a centers for disease control and prevention doctor said the flu vaccine is causing the deadly flu epidemic.	False	['anti-vaccine', ' big pharma', ' flu', ' flu shot', ' yournewswire']	https://www.independent.com/	https://www.independent.com/news/2018/jan/08/flu-kills-eight-santa-barbara-residents-two-weeks/	2018/01/17	Yahoo!Eight Santa Barbara County residents have died from the flu in the past two weeks alone. By contrast, only three residents died throughout last year’s entire flu season, which typically runs from October to April. All eight people were ages 65 or older.“These numbers are unprecedented for the past 10 years,” said Dr. Charity Dean, public health czar for Santa Barbara County. Dean said all but one of the eight had been vaccinated and all had been given flu-fighting medications. “I’m worried about how severe our flu season will be,” she said.Dean said the number of patients who are testing positive for the flu at local hospitals and health clinics is also off the charts. “Our numbers are in line with statewide numbers, and they’re definitely cause for concern,” she said. Dean reported that local emergency rooms are slammed, reportedly experiencing a threefold increase in number of patients reporting flu-like symptoms. Emergency room waiting times have grown significantly longer as a result.Initially, Dean said she wondered whether Santa Barbarans were reporting higher numbers in part because of the insult to the lungs inflicted by smoke from the Thomas Fire. Santa Barbara County, she said, began reporting elevated flu numbers sooner than the rest of the state. But now that the rest of the state has caught up, she said, she’s discarded that theory.Dean attributed this year’s impact to a strain of flu — H3N2 — that’s particularly resistant to vaccination. According to the Center for Disease Control, vaccines have been effective at knocking this strain out only 32 percent of the time. But studies from Australia — where the flu season runs about six months ahead of the United States and Europe — indicates the vaccine’s effectiveness could be even more limited than that, only ten percent.Even so, Dean said people should still get flu shots, particularly those younger than 5, older than 65, pregnant, or otherwise dealing with compromised health. “If your choice is between life and death or a trip to intensive care, why would you pass up that kind of protection, particularly if you’re already vulnerable?” she asked.For otherwise healthy people who become infected, Dean said they should stay home, rest, and hydrate. Treatment is most effective when administered within the first 48 hours. Given the long waits and high concentrations of sick people, emergency rooms are to be avoided if at all possible. This flu strain can inflict lethal damage, Dean explained, by attacking a person’s respiratory function outright. But sometimes the body’s reaction against the flu leaves patients vulnerable to pneumonia.More like this story	2018/01/08

False	['apocalypse', ' new york post', ' the sun']	https://news.uark.edu/	https://news.uark.edu/articles/34087/u-of-a-researcher-links-mass-extinctions-to-planet-x-	2016/04/07	U of A Researcher Links Mass Extinctions to 'Planet X'March 30, 2016Photo by Matt ReynoldsDaniel Whitmire.FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. – Periodic mass extinctions on Earth, as indicated in the global fossil record, could be linked to a suspected ninth planet, according to research published by a faculty member of the University of Arkansas Department of Mathematical Sciences.Daniel Whitmire, a retired professor of astrophysics now working as a math instructor, published findings in the January issue of Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society that the as yet undiscovered “Planet X” triggers comet showers linked to mass extinctions on Earth at intervals of approximately 27 million years.Though scientists have been looking for Planet X for 100 years, the possibility that it’s real got a big boost recently when researchers from Caltech inferred its existence based on orbital anomalies seen in objects in the Kuiper Belt, a disc-shaped region of comets and other larger bodies beyond Neptune. If the Caltech researchers are correct, Planet X is about 10 times the mass of Earth and could currently be up to 1,000 times more distant from the sunWhitmire and his colleague, John Matese, first published research on the connection between Planet X and mass extinctions in the journal Nature in 1985 while working as astrophysicists at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Their work was featured in a 1985 Time magazine cover story titled, “Did Comets Kill the Dinosaurs? A Bold New Theory About Mass Extinctions.”At the time there were three explanations proposed to explain the regular comet showers: Planet X, the existence of a sister star to the sun, and vertical oscillations of the sun as it orbits the galaxy. The last two ideas have subsequently been ruled out as inconsistent with the paleontological record. Only Planet X remained as a viable theory, and it is now gaining renewed attention.Whitemire and Matese’s theory is that as Planet X orbits the sun, its tilted orbit slowly rotates and Planet X passes through the Kuiper belt of comets every 27 million years, knocking comets into the inner solar system. The dislodged comets not only smash into the Earth, they also disintegrate in the inner solar system as they get nearer to the sun, reducing the amount of sunlight that reaches the Earth.In 1985, a look at the paleontological record supported the idea of regular comet showers dating back 250 million years. Newer research shows evidence of such events dating as far back as 500 million years.Whitmire and Matese published their own estimate on the size and orbit of Planet X in their original study. They believed it would be between one and five times the mass of Earth, and about 100 times more distant from the sun, much smaller numbers than Caltech’s estimates.Matese has since retired and no longer publishes. Whitmire retired from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in 2012 and began teaching at the University of Arkansas in 2013.Whitmire says what’s really exciting is the possibility that a distant planet may have had a significant influence on the evolution of life on Earth. “I’ve been part of this story for 30 years,” he said. “If there is ever a final answer I’d love to write a book about it.”About the University of Arkansas: The University of Arkansas provides an internationally competitive education for undergraduate and graduate students in more than 200 academic programs.

Nathan Deal's remarks regarding HB 757, delivered at a news conference on March 28, 2016.The decision surrounding HB 757 has generated more intense feelings that most legislation, perhaps because it has highlighted the concerns of many in our religious communities regarding the actions of federal courts, especially the United States Supreme Court in its 5-4 opinion last summer which legalized same-sex marriage. (Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. ____(2015)).HB 757 enumerates certain actions that religious leaders, faith-based organizations and people of faith shall not be required to take or perform. These include solemnizing a marriage, attending such marriages, hiring church personnel or renting church property when such acts would be contrary to their sincerely held religious beliefs. While most people would agree that government should not force such actions, there has not been a single instance of such taking place in Georgia. If there has been any case of this type in our state it has not been called to my attention. The examples being cited by the proponents of this bill have occurred in other states that have very different laws than Georgia.One example that is used is the photographer in New Mexico who refused to photograph a same-sex marriage (Elane Photography, LLC v. Willock, 309 P. 3d53 (2013)). That state has a Religious Freedom Restoration Act, but it was not applicable. It was the New Mexico Human Rights Act that determined the results in that case. Georgia does not have a Human Rights Act.The second case that is cited is that of the bakery in Colorado that refused to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple. There the court ruling was based on Colorado’s Public Accommodation Act which prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation (Craig v. Masterpiece Cakeshop, Inc. ____ P 3d_(2015)). Georgia does not have a Public Accommodation Act.Therefore, as I have examined the protections this bill seeks to provide to religious organizations and people of faith I can find no examples that any of the things this bill seeks to protect us against have ever occurred in Georgia. It is also apparent that the cases being cited from other states occurred because those state had passed statutes that specifically protected their citizens from adverse actions based on their sexual orientation. Georgia has no such statutes. HB 757 appeared in several forms during the recent session of the Georgia General Assembly. I had no objection to the “Pastor Protection Act” that was passed by the House of Representatives. The other versions of the bill, however, contained language that could give rise to state-sanctioned discrimination. I did have problems with that and made my concerns known as did many other individuals and organizations, including some within the faith-based community.I appreciate the efforts of the General Assembly to address these concerns and my actions today in no way disparage their motivations on those who support this bill, Their efforts to purge this bill of any possibility that it will allow or encourage discrimination illustrates how difficult it is to legislate on something that is best left to the broad protections of the First Amendment to the United State Constitution. That may be why our Founding Fathers did not attempt to list in detail the circumstances that religious liberty embraced. Instead, they adopted what the late Supreme Court Justice Scalia referred to as “negative protection.” That is, rather than telling the government what it can do regarding religion, they told the government what it could not do, namely, “establish a religion or interfere with the free exercise thereof.” They had previously proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence that Man’s Creator had endowed all men “with certain unalienable rights,” including “Liberty” which embraces religious liberty. They made it clear that those liberties were given by God and not by man’s government. Therefore, it was unnecessary to enumerate in statute or constitution what those liberties included.In light of our history, I find it ironic that today some in the religious community feel it necessary to ask the government to confer upon them certain rights and protections. If indeed our religious liberty is conferred by God and not by man-made government, we should heed the “hands-off” admonition of the First Amendment to our Constitution. When legislative bodies attempt to do otherwise, the inclusions and omissions in their statutes can lead to discrimination, even though it may be unintentional. That is too great a risk to take.Some of those in the religious community who support this bill have resorted to insults that question my moral convictions and my character. Some within the business community who oppose this bill have resorted to threats of withdrawing jobs from our state. I do not respond well to insults or threats. The people of Georgia deserve a leader who will make sound judgments based on solid reasons that are not inflamed by emotion. That is what I intend to do.As I've said before, I do not think we have to discriminate against anyone to protect the faith-based community in Georgia of which my family and I are a part of for all of our lives. Our actions on HB 757 are not just about protecting the faith-based community or providing a business-friendly climate for job growth in Georgia. This is about the character of our State and the character of its people. Georgia is a welcoming state filled with warm, friendly and loving people. Our cities and countryside are populated with people who worship God in a myriad of ways and in very diverse settings. Our people work side-by-side without regard to the color of our skin, or the religion we adhere to. We are working to make life better for our families and our communities. That is the character of Georgia. I intend to do my part to keep it that way.For that reason, I will veto HB 757. 	2016/03/28

Then ISIS invaded her village. Her mother and six brothers were killed in a massacre and she and her three sisters were enslaved.After months of unspeakable brutality, Nadia escaped and found a way to Germany. She never viewed a roadblock as a dead end. She found a way through, even as she faced the most daunting crisis of her young life.I met her recently at a restaurant in New York. Her courage left me speechless.As the world's business leaders gather in Davos for the World Economic Forum, Nadia is on my mind.What would happen if big companies showed some of Nadia's courage and determination? What would happen if they summoned the spirit of innovation and ingenuity to solve the greatest humanitarian crisis of our lives? What if -- to borrow a word from Silicon Valley -- we could ""hack"" the refugee crisis?That's what I'm asking business leaders to do in Davos this week.As people of a free world, we have a moral obligation to the 60 million people who, like Nadia, have been kidnapped or forced from their homes. People who need food, shelter, and opportunity, and have risked their lives to escape something that makes their childhood nightmares now seem like distant dreams.But it's not just people who can help. Businesses -- and the hundreds of thousands of people they represent -- have a major role to play.At Chobani, the food company I founded in the United States, we have hired hundreds of refugees in the past five years, and they are some of the most talented, dedicated people I've ever met.Refugees haven't just helped build our business; they've helped improve our community. The same is true of former refugees like Google ( GOOG ) co-founder Sergey Brin, Intel ( INTC ) co-founder Andy Grove, or WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum -- some of the world's most innovative and successful businesses simply wouldn't exist if they had been turned away in their time of need.Related: Today's refugee could be tomorrow's entrepreneurThis year, I launched Tent, a personal foundation focused on helping refugees and bringing together the private sector to help end the worst humanitarian crisis since World War II.Tent has conducted research that shows that refugees' contribution to society far outweighs the costs. Germany's Commerzbank ( CRZBF ) estimates that refugees will help boost the country's economic growth next year to 1.9% from 1.7%. They are more likely to do jobs that others may not, and add skills that fill gaps in the labor market.The private sector has a powerful incentive to find new solutions to a crisis that cannot be solved by governments and goodwill alone. We can move faster, think bigger, and modernize approaches to relief and resettlement that haven't changed since the 1940s. We can do what entrepreneurs do best: hack the way we handle this problem.Some business leaders have stepped up. Airbnb is offering travel credits to relief workers on the ground. LinkedIn will run an innovative pilot project in Sweden that uses data to match refugees with job openings by comparing the skills they have with the skills employers are looking for. Other companies are providing refugees with free computers, access to online education, and packages filled with essentials like soap and sunscreen.Related: Immigrants: These cities want you!These actions have inspired us to launch the Tent Pledge and the Tent Challenge. The Tent Pledge asks companies all over the world to step up and do more. We're asking them to provide refugees with job training, employment opportunities, and the kind of direct assistance that experts have identified as a priority -- everything from blankets and water, to debit cards and Internet access.Chobani CEO Hamdi Ulukaya visiting refugees on the Greek island of Lesbos.I'm so proud to announce that our founding partners include Airbnb, Ikea Foundation, MasterCard, LinkedIn, UPS Foundation and Western Union -- and we have more on the way, with the aim to enlist 100 companies by May.The Tent Challenge will provide grants to entrepreneurs and other individuals who are using data and technology to come up with the most innovative solutions to the refugee crisis. The hope is that we can then replicate these solutions on a much larger scale.Refugees like Nadia who have seen the worst in humanity deserve to see our best. At stake is an entire generation of men, women, and children who just might grow up to change the world.Let's help them succeed by changing theirs.Hamdi Ulukaya is CEO and founder of Chobani and the Tent foundation.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-cab-ride/	account describes a cab driver taking an elderly woman to a hospice on the last ride of her life. see example( s )	Legend	['']	http://kentnerburn.com/	http://kentnerburn.com/about	2016/03/27	Kent NerburnAboutNormally, a background section gives an historical narrative of an author’s personal and professional life. But I like this interview, done years ago by a web magazine in Washington D.C. I’ve edited it for relevance and updated it a bit to reflect changes in my life. I find it more informative and full of life than a standard bio. I hope you agree.Can you tell us a little about your background?I was born and raised near Minneapolis. Perhaps the most formative experience of my childhood was going out with my father, who worked for the Red Cross, when he went to help victims of fires and floods who had lost their homes, their possessions, and, sometimes, their families. He would get the same calls as the fire department, and we would often arrive simultaneously, often in the deepest night, and confront the same tragedies the police and firemen confronted, only our responsibility was to provide aid and comfort. These experiences gave me a profound understanding of human suffering and hope, and left me with an indelible belief in a life of service. They also taught me how fragile our good fortune is, and how lucky and blessed I have been to live the life I’ve lived.After high school I went to the University of Minnesota in American Studies, then to Stanford University in Religious Studies and Humanities, then to Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, where I received a Ph.D. in conjunction with the University of California at Berkeley. My doctorate was in Religious Studies and Art. For many years I devoted my life to creating over-life sized sculptures from tree trunks. My heroes and mentors were Michelangelo, Donatello, and Rodin, all of whose works I had the good fortune to study in person while living for a time in Europe.After returning to Minnesota, I moved north to the pine and lake country near the Canadian border, where my wife and I got married and have lived ever since. For several years I worked on the Red Lake Ojibwe reservation helping students collect the memories of the tribal elders. This changed my life and introduced me to the native spiritual traditions that have become so central to the message in my writings.I switched to writing from sculpture about 30 years ago when I realized that I could reach more people as a writer and that I had skills in that area.My work has been a constant search, from various perspectives, for an authentic American spirituality, integrating our western Judeo-Christian tradition with the other traditions of the world, and especially the indigenous spirituality of the people who first inhabited this continent. Someone once called me a “guerilla theologian,” and I think that is fairly accurate. I am deeply concerned with the human condition and our responsibility to the earth, the people on it, and the generations to come. I believe that we are, at heart, spiritual beings seeking spiritual meaning, and I try to honor this search wherever I discover it in the course of my daily life.My wife and I currently live just outside of Portland, Oregon, where we moved after her retirement from Bemidji State University, partly to be near some of our grandchildren and partly because I figured that continuing to climb on roofs to pull down snow in our northern Minnesota winters was going to bring me to a bad end. Nonetheless, we do miss our lives amid the great powerful forces of the Minnesota north, where the winter winds blew unstopped from the vast Manitoba prairies, and on beautiful summer nights we were serenaded to sleep by the songs of loons and the lapping of waters on the lake outside our window. But times change and the seasons of life turn. The Pacific Northwest with its lush beauty and proximity to the monumental presences of oceans and mountains has been a wonderful revelation and has allowed us to see life through new eyes. It has been a move we don’t regret.I have four children – three who came in the “package deal” with my wife, each wonderful and interesting in his or her own right, and each now well into adulthood and building careers and family. The fourth, my biological son, is a fascinating documentarian photographer and filmmaker. We are fortunate that he got the best parts of each of his parents. As you know, it doesn’t always work that way.We have three grandchildren, and find that all the clichés about grandparenting are real. What a joy and gift they are.Your writing seems very poetic in style. Is this something you do consciously, or is this just the way the words flow out?I take the music of language very seriously. Like a heartbeat, it exists right below consciousness, but it animates and infuses your language with life. As both a reader and a writer, I tend to subvocalize, thus making my pacing and thoughts more auditory than conceptual. I want the sentences to aspirate and pulsate with cadence and internal music. A good sentence should sound good and feel good and roll comfortably off your tongue, not simply serve as a conveyor for ideas.Who inspires you?Donatello, Rilke, Nelson Mandela, Black Elk, Bach, Mahler, Lao Tzu, good elementary school teachers, caring nursing home workers, and anyone who spends time with people who can offer them no benefit.You quote the Sioux writer Ohiyesa in “Small Graces: The Quiet Gifts of Everyday Life.” Do you have a favorite quote or thought of his?I constantly hark back in my own life to his comment about spirituality: “Whenever, in the course of our day, we might come upon a scene that is strikingly beautiful or sublime – the black thundercloud with the rainbow’s glowing arch above the mountain; a white waterfall in the heart of a green gorge; a vast prairie tinged with the blood-red of sunset – we pause for an instant in an attitude of worship.” This, it seems to me, is the key to a humble appreciation of the gift of life we have been given and a proper way of honoring the Great Mystery we have come to call God.What makes you hopeful about the future?I am hopeful for human beings because I believe that, at heart, we all seek the same thing – a chance to love and be loved, to raise good children, and to live in peace with our neighbors and families. That we so consistently fail to do so is troubling. And I admit to being deeply upset by the selfishness that is abroad in our own land – believing that we must look out first and foremost for ourselves (though perhaps that may be changing) – and the tendency, both here and abroad, to use religious belief to justify cruelty toward others.Do you have a favorite writer or book?I love Graham Greene, Jim Harrison, Annie Dillard, Barry Lopez, and Rainer Maria Rilke.When you write, do you ever feel that something greater than yourself is providing the words or ideas?Alas, no. I wish I did. But I do believe that we are all God’s hands here on earth, and that in and through my writing I must endeavor to do God’s work, however one chooses to define or give a shape to God. I do know that there are moments when writing feels like a walk in a beautiful garden, and the joy of discovery is everywhere around me. At those times I feel myself in the presence of something close to Grace, though it seems more like a gift that I must honor than a channeling of some outside force.You write about experiences you’ve had that suggest you’ve studied with various spiritual traditions. What’s been particularly helpful or pivotal in your path?I love the Beatitudes from the Christian tradition, the use of natural forces as analogy in the Taoist tradition, and the spiritual commitment to the power of the earth in the Native American traditions. I believe we are our brothers’ and sisters’ keepers, that the ways of force and acquiescence shown in nature must govern an integrated and balanced life, and that each person must, indeed, find his or her own spiritual path and live each day with an attitude of prayerful awareness.Do you recommend spending time in nature?Let me quote Ohiyesa again. “All who have lived much out of doors, whether Indian or otherwise, know that there is a magnetic and powerful force that accumulates in solitude but is quickly dissipated by life in a crowd.” We should all seek the healing and clarifying power of nature so that our spiritual focus and power is not allowed to dissipate.You talk about the importance of ritual in “Small Graces”. Are there any rituals or practices you’d recommend to someone seeking a more spiritually focused life?Prayer – not as petition, but as reflection and contemplation. Mentoring. Service with no thought of recognition. I know these are not specific. But each person must find his or her specific expression of these general principles. Helping a child or an elder or someone in need will do more for one’s spiritual focus than closing any deal or building any building or achieving any position of fame or celebrity. Ignatius Loyola said it simply and best: “Anything we turn toward God is a prayer.”You have a lot of wonderful quotes at the beginning of each chapter of “Small Graces”. Is there one that’s particularly special to you?I believe in them all. But I would think that the essence of my philosophy about life is in the quote, “We are not all called to be great. But we are all called to reach out our hands to our brothers and sisters, and to care for the earth in the time we are given.”Do you have any final thoughts you’d like to share?Seek the unseen in life. Celebrate the ordinary. Serve the weak rather than currying the favor of the powerful. Find a way to direct your life towards God. And live for the seventh generation rather than for yourself. Most of all, follow the invitation of the Lakota chief, Sitting Bull, “Come, let us put our minds together to see what kind of life we can create for our children.” And remember that we do not all live holy lives, but we all live in a world alive with holy moments.Thank you so much for your time.68 thoughts on About	
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/emory-students-trump-graffiti/	"students at emory university were offered ""emergency counseling"" after pro-trump graffiti appeared overnight in campus ""safe spaces."" see example( s )"	Mostly False	['counseling', ' donald trump', ' emory university', ' imaginary offended people', ' political correctness', ' safe spaces']	http://emorywheel.com/	http://emorywheel.com/emory-students-express-discontent-with-administrative-response-to-trump-chalkings/	2016/03/24	By Sam BudnykMar 22, 2016College sophomore Jonathan Peraza leads chants outside the Emory Administration Building during a student protest following pro-Trump slogans that were written in chalk across campus the night before. / Julia Munslow, Executive EditorUPDATE (3/22 at 9:49 p.m.) Scroll down for the original article:The following day, University President James W. Wagner, as well as representatives from College Council (CC) and Student Government Association (SGA) sent emails to the Emory community to address student concerns and responses. In his University-wide email, Wagner wrote that he intends to implement “immediate refinements to certain policy and procedural deficiencies, regular and structured opportunities for difficult dialogues, a formal process to institutionalize identification, review and [the] addressing of social justice opportunities and issues and a commitment to an annual retreat to renew our efforts.” Wagner added in his email that the previous day’s chalkings represented “values regarding diversity and respect that clash with Emory’s own.”In the joint email sent on behalf of CC and SGA, representatives wrote that they “remain unapologetically dedicated to inclusion, diversity and equity,” and that both institutions will stand in solidarity with any Emory students who have encountered a lack of safety and support. To provide Emory students an opportunity to discuss such support and inclusivity on Emory’s campus, SGA will hold office hours on Thursday, March 24 from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. and CC will hold office hours on Thursday from 3:30 p.m. to 5 p.m.According to the Dobbs University Center’s (DUC) Posting Policy, chalking must be reserved and approved through Emory’s campus reservation service, 25Live. The Posting Policy says that: chalk cannot be on columns or walls, it must be done on horizontal, ground surfaces and areas where rain can easily wash it away. Failure to comply with these policies results in a clean up fee. Chalking also may only remain for 48 hours. After this time, another group can chalk, if they reserve their chalking through 25Live.The DUC’s Posting Policy also points out that the DUC is guided by the University’s policy on open expression, and any member of the Emory community who violates the open expression of others will be held in violation of said policy.According to Emory University’s Open Expression Policy 8.14.5.8, “nonpersonal protests” such as chalking, should follow “all applicable flyer posting policies and banner reservation rules.” It also states that “no nonpersonal protests will be denied because of the content” of the display as long as they falls within the law, and that members of the community who “deface the open expression of others” are also violating this policy.The article will be updated as information becomes available.Students protested yesterday at the Emory Administration Building following a series of overnight, apparent pro-Donald Trump for president chalkings throughout campus.Roughly 40 students gathered shortly after 4:30 p.m. in the outdoors space between the Administration Building and Goodrich C. White Hall; many students carried signs featuring slogans such as “Stop Trump” or “Stop Hate” and an antiphonal chant addressed to University administration, led by College sophomore Jonathan Peraza, resounded “You are not listening! Come speak to us, we are in pain!” throughout the Quad. Peraza opened the door to the Administration Building and students moved forward towards the door, shouting “It is our duty to fight for our freedom. It is our duty to win. We must love each other and support each other. We have nothing to lose but our chains.”Students protest apparent pro-Donald Trump chalkings throughout campus. / Julia Munslow, Executive EditorAfter approximately ten minutes outside from the start of the demonstration, the gathered students were ushered into the Quad-facing entrance to the Administration Building and quickly filled a staircase to continue their demonstration. Pausing in the staircase, a few students shared their initial, personal reactions to the chalkings.“I’m supposed to feel comfortable and safe [here],” one student said. “But this man is being supported by students on our campus and our administration shows that they, by their silence, support it as well … I don’t deserve to feel afraid at my school,” she added.A short time later, students moved into the Henry L. Bowden Board Room, surrounding the long table that dominates its center, the students themselves surrounded by portraits of Emory University’s former presidents.“What are we feeling?” Peraza asked those assembled. Responses of “frustration” and “fear” came from around the room, but individual students soon began to offer more detailed, personal reactions to feelings of racial tension that Trump and his ideology bring to the fore.“How can you not [disavow Trump] when Trump’s platform and his values undermine Emory’s values that I believe are diversity and inclusivity when they are obviously not [something that Trump supports]” one student said tearfully. “Banning Muslims? How is that something Emory supports?” asked yet another.University President James W. Wagner, who had been standing just inside the threshold of the door, had been called into the board room by students and listened at the head of the table while they described how the appearance of the chalkings made them feel. He addressed several questions throughout the time in the board room, including “Why did the swastikas [on the AEPi house in Fall 2014] receive a quick response while these chalkings did not?” to which Wagner replied that they “represented an outside threat” and clarified that it was a second set of swastikas that received a swift response from the University. “What do we have to do for you to listen to us?” students asked Wagner directly, to which he asked, “What actions should I take?” One student asked if Emory would send out a University-wide email to “decry the support for this fascist, racist candidate” to which Wagner replied, “No, we will not.” One student clarified that “the University doesn’t have to say they don’t support Trump, but just to acknowledge that there are students on this campus who feel this way about what’s happening … to acknowledge all of us here.”University President James W. Wagner listens to students. / Julia Munslow, Executive EditorOther students asked for improving diversity in the “higher positions” of the University, including the Board of Trustees and the faculty in general who should not be simply “diversity sprinkles” to improve statistics, as one student described it.Grievances were not restricted to shortcomings of the administration. “[Faculty] are supporting this rhetoric by not ending it,” said one student, who went on to say that “people of color are struggling academically because they are so focused on trying to have a safe community and focus on these issues [related to having safe spaces on campus].”While Wagner initially stated that he would not be writing a University-wide email regarding Trump, after over an hour of discussion in the board room, he appeared to have decided to begin working on an email concerned with at least the chalkings, at which point he gently wrapped up the conversation so that he could begin drafting it.Julia Munslow, Executive EditorAssistant Vice President for Community Suzanne Onorato, who was also present during the protest and suggested that she would look into hosting a forum for those involved, agreed with Wagner’s sentiments. “I think it’s wonderful that students are taking a stand for something that they’re passionate about, for something that’s so much about themselves — and we want to support that,” she said in an interview with the Wheel.The chalkings that generated such controversy appeared overnight throughout Emory’s campus. College junior Harpreet Singh said that, initially, he did not find the chalkings significant. “I saw one big one, ‘Trump 2016,’ so I thought it was an isolated incident and I didn’t think much of it,” he said. “I thought, ‘Okay, it’s just a guy who wants to write whatever he wants to believe in for his political campaign.’ I was like, ‘Okay, I’m fine with that, to a certain extent.’”Assistant Vice President for Community Suzanne Onorato addresses the students. / Julia Munslow, Executive EditorSingh reported having seen multiple chalkings that read “Trump 2016” between Cox Hall Bridge and the Dobbs University Center (DUC). “What I also saw on the steps near Cox [Hall] Bridge was ‘Accept the Inevitable: Trump 2016,’” he said. “That was a bit alarming. What exactly is the inevitable? Why does it have to be accepted?”Trump chalking rubbed away. / Julia Munslow, Executive EditorThe University will review footage “up by the hospital [from] security cameras” to identify those who made the chalkings, Wagner told the protesters. He also added that if they’re students, they will go through the conduct violation process, while if they are from outside of the University, trespassing charges will be pressed.Organization and coordination of the protest appears to have fermented in individual student groups independently of one another. Singh, who participated in the protests, also had a part in their planning. While he said that each group or community held their own discussions on the chalkings over social media, he noted that “[he] also reached out to the Muslim community” and that several of these students attended the gathering.Julia Munslow, Executive EditorWhile the University has not released an official response as of press time, Donald Trump obviously remains a flashpoint for many students, but according to Singh there is comfort to be found for those who feel oppressed. “For the students, it’s reassuring to see how they are able to voice out their opinions and, although it might be safe or uncomfortable, we know that we have a community behind us, whether that be the Latin[x] community, the Muslim community or the black student community — there are pools of safety we can go to,” Singh said.Read more Wheel coverage:Read our continued coverage on the Emory administration’s response here .

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/white-strawberries-taste-pineapples/	a white strawberry that tastes like pineapple is available in certain markets. see example( s )	true	['not a hoax', ' strawberries', ' waitrose']	https://winkypedia.net/	https://winkypedia.net/2011/05/13/pineberries-a-cross-between-pineapples-and-wild-strawberries/	2016/03/24	I was curious and excited when I first saw these white beauty- pineberries. They are about the same size as wild strawberries, except that they look like their albino cousins. White body and red seeds- very odd looking indeed! I like how they played tricks on my senses. While they looked like strawberries, pineberries actually carried an amazing sweet fragrance similar to that of pineapples. This aroma was even stronger at room temperature. Just when I thought they would taste like pineapples, I was wrong again. They actually tasted a lot like wild strawberries, which have a strong and intense flavour comparing to normal strawberries. Exactly why are they white and red? I have no idea! Apparently, Pineberries begin life as green berries, just like normal strawberries. They then turn white gradually. By the time their deeply set seeds turn deep red, the white fruit is deemed ripe. It is fun to eat and it is tasty. Though £4.99 for 100g, it might be the most expensive strawberries I am going to have this season! They are now available on the shelves of Waitrose for a limited period. They first came out on 1st April last year when everyone thought it was an April Fool’s joke. But within less than an hour, they were completely sold out. I did not get to try any! I am glad that I had better luck this year!

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-canadian-wall/	donald trump said that as president he would build a wall along the u.s.-canadian border.	False	['canada', ' donald trump', ' fail much', ' mexico']	http://www.cbc.ca/	http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-canadian-us-border-wall-1.3465155	2016/03/24	"Donald Trump said during the latest Republican debate that he sees no contradiction in wanting to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, but not along the Canadian border. Trump doubled down on his desire if elected president to build a wall along the Mexico border at the CNN-Telemundo debate taking place at the University of Houston on Thursday night. Because Mexico officials had derided the idea in recent days, Trump said, ""the wall just got 10 feet taller."" Maria Celeste Arraras, a Telemundo journalist, challenged Trump on whether he was focused on the right border, given that ISIS has called upon its supporters to launch terrorist attacks in Canada. ""As a matter of fact, U.S. officials have warned that it is the Canadian border which is the most significant threat,"" she added. Trump responded that the relative practicality and threat level made the idea a non-starter. ""The problem with Canada, you're talking about a massively long piece,"" said Trump. ""You're talking about a border that would be about four times longer. It would be very, very hard to do, and we – it is not our biggest problem. I don't care what anyone says. It is not our big problem. ""Our big problem [with Mexico] is not only people coming in, and in many cases the wrong people, it's the tremendous amount of drugs that are coming in."" The realistic political prospects of building a wall at either border aside, it's a stance that Trump previously expressed to CBC reporter Meagan Fitzpatrick on the campaign trail last year. ""I love Canada,"" he told Fitzpatrick in Washington in September. ""I would not build a wall on the Canadian border."" For her part, Arraras was likely referring to a meeting earlier this month of the U.S. Senate homeland security committee, during which witnesses and senators expressed concern about the number of Syrian refugees Canada was admitting, as well as the number of agents who patrol the shared border. Successive officials from the National Border Patrol Council have argued over the years for a beefed-up number of agents on the border, and that Canada is more of a threat when it comes to the movement of would-be terrorists into the U.S. than Mexico. They would likely point to the conviction last year of two men for a plot to derail a Via Rail train travelling between New York and Toronto. One of the men, Raed Jaser, originally entered Canada with a fake passport and stayed for years even after his refugee claim was denied. Before the 9-11 attacks, Montreal native Ahmed Ressam made his way to B.C. to launch a planned attack on the Los Angeles airport, but was apprehended in Washington state. As for attacks north of the border, Dabiq, the magazine published by the Islamic State, has advocated attacking Canada on multiple occasions due to the country's involvement in the anti-ISIS campaign in Syria and Iraq. Did Trump just say could build wall on US-Canada border because it is 4x US-Mexico border? US-Canada is 1,538 miles; US-Mexico 1,933 miles. The idea of a wall between Canada and the United States held currency in the Republican race for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, but he has long since dropped out. Ben Carson, still in the race, proposed the U.S. military and National Guard patrol the U.S.-Canada border in his ""Seven Steps to a Safer America"" plan. None of the other four candidates taking part Thursday were asked to weigh in on the Canadian question, with the debate quickly changing focus to another topic. Longtime Republican operative and Fox News commentator Karl Rove was forced to apologize for a tweet during the debate that incorrectly posited that the southern and northern borders the U.S. shares are of comparable length, although Trump's math was also erroneous – albeit closer to the mark. The U.S.-Mexico border is over 3,100 kilometres long. The border between Canada and the U.S. which features the 49th parallel comprises over 6,400 kilometres, with an additional 2,475 kilometres bordering Alaska."

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/alabama-food-stamps-car/	republicans in alabama filed a bill which (if passed) would prohibit people who owned cars from receiving food stamps. see example( s )	false	['food stamps', ' occupy democrats', ' snap']	http://occupydemocrats.com/	http://occupydemocrats.com/2016/03/17/alabama-republicans-file-bill-take-away-food-stamps-car/	2016/03/18	SHARE THIS STORYAlabama Republicans are escalating their war against the poor, wasting precious state resources in a relentless campaign to make life harder for the people of Alabama. Sen. Arthur Orr (R-Decatur) has just proposed a new bill that would prevent people from receiving food stamps or financial support if they own cars and caps the number of years for assistance from five to three. “We want to get people working back in the workforce and not hanging out for public benefits because they can” drawled Orr, perpetuating the cruel myth that welfare recipients are simply lazy moochers – where in fact, t wo out of three welfare recipients are children, single mothers, or elderly. It would also require new photo IDs for EBT cards, the cost of which would run more than $10 million , and adds another layer of hoops for potential recipients to jump through before they can receive benefits – so much for small government.The astonishingly heartless move was met with horror from Senate Democrats, one of whom, Sen. Roger Smitherman (D-Birmingham) was literally pounding the table in fury. “I’m going to do whatever I can to stop this. I am not going to let you do this to these people. I am not going to let people starve” he railed.It’s particularly hurtful because it would force families to choose between being able to take their kids to school or being able to feed them. Worse, the bill assumes that people are simply waiting for jobs – but with a state 6.2% unemployment rate and some county rates reaching a shocking 15.3%, the jobs simply aren’t there. Possibly because – shocker – Republican rule has utterly gutted the budget with tax cuts and they now face a $200 million hole, which they are now trying to fill by cutting public services ( like closing 31 DMVs in black areas ) and killing government jobs.Kimble Forrister, the executive director of nonprofit Alabama Arise points out that the bill won’t actually save any money, and does nothing but shame the poor and make their lives worse. “If you save money on benefits, all you can do is spend the money on other TANF recipients” she said.All across the Midwest and the South, Republican rule has only brought suffering. Empty treasuries and unemployed people are the constant theme – and then these so-called Christians do nothing but shame the poor and make their lives harder, squandering millions on demonizing welfare while their schools and basic infrastructure go unfunded. Republican legislators punish their citizens for being unable to find a job in states where wages are kept stagnant, the economy has been driven into the ground while giving themselves outrageous raises . It’s a disgusting hypocrisy that the whole nation should be ashamed of.Download our NEW Occupy Democrats app for your iPhone by clicking here or for your Android by clicking here .	
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hillary-clinton-benghazi-msnbc/	"hillary clinton overlooked benghazi victims when she said that ""we didn't lose a single person in libya"" during a campaign event on msnbc. see example( s )"	Mostly False	['benghazi', ' hillary clinton']	https://en.wikipedia.org/	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_military_intervention_in_Libya	2016/03/18	"""Operation Freedom Falcon"" redirects here. For the Iraq War battle, see Operation Falcon Freedom. The US military claimed it had no knowledge of civilian casualties. On 19 March 2011, a multi-state NATO-led coalition began a military intervention in Libya, ostensibly to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973. The United Nations Intent and Voting was to have ""an immediate ceasefire in Libya, including an end to the current attacks against civilians, which it said might constitute crimes against humanity ... imposing a ban on all flights in the country's airspace – a no-fly zone – and tightened sanctions on the Qadhafi regime and its supporters."" The resolution was taken in response to events during the Libyan Civil War, and military operations began, with American and British naval forces firing over 110 Tomahawk cruise missiles, the French Air Force, British Royal Air Force, and Royal Canadian Air Force undertaking sorties across Libya and a naval blockade by Coalition forces. French jets launched air strikes against Libyan Army tanks and vehicles. The Libyan government response to the campaign was totally ineffectual, with Gaddafi's forces not managing to shoot down a single NATO plane despite the country possessing 30 heavy SAM batteries, 17 medium SAM batteries, 55 light SAM batteries (a total of 400–450 launchers, including 130–150 2K12 Kub launchers and some 9K33 Osa launchers), and 440–600 short-ranged air-defense guns. The official names for the interventions by the coalition members are Opération Harmattan by France; Operation Ellamy by the United Kingdom; Operation Mobile for the Canadian participation and Operation Odyssey Dawn for the United States. From the beginning of the intervention, the initial coalition of Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Norway, Qatar, Spain, UK and US expanded to nineteen states, with newer states mostly enforcing the no-fly zone and naval blockade or providing military logistical assistance. The effort was initially largely led by France and the United Kingdom, with command shared with the United States. NATO took control of the arms embargo on 23 March, named Operation Unified Protector. An attempt to unify the military command of the air campaign (whilst keeping political and strategic control with a small group), first failed over objections by the French, German, and Turkish governments. On 24 March, NATO agreed to take control of the no-fly zone, while command of targeting ground units remains with coalition forces. The handover occurred on 31 March 2011 at 06:00 UTC (08:00 local time). NATO flew 26,500 sorties since it took charge of the Libya mission on 31 March 2011. Fighting in Libya ended in late October following the death of Muammar Gaddafi, and NATO stated it would end operations over Libya on 31 October 2011. Libya's new government requested that its mission be extended to the end of the year, but on 27 October, the Security Council voted to end NATO's mandate for military action on 31 October. Both Libyan officials and international states and organizations called for a no-fly zone over Libya in light of allegations that Muammar Gaddafi's military had conducted airstrikes against Libyan rebels in the Libyan Civil War. 21 February 2011: Libyan deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Ibrahim Dabbashi called ""on the UN to impose a no-fly zone on all Tripoli to cut off all supplies of arms and mercenaries to the regime."" 23 February 2011: French President Nicolas Sarkozy pushed for the European Union (EU) to pass sanctions against Gaddafi (freezing Gaddafi family funds abroad) and demand he stop attacks against civilians. 25 February 2011: Sarkozy said Gaddafi ""must go."" 26 February 2011: United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970 was passed unanimously, referring the Libyan government to the International Criminal Court for gross human rights violations. It imposed an arms embargo on the country and a travel ban and assets freeze on the family of Muammar Al-Qadhafi and certain Government officials. 28 February 2011: British Prime Minister David Cameron proposed the idea of a no-fly zone to prevent Gaddafi from ""airlifting mercenaries"" and ""using his military aeroplanes and armoured helicopters against civilians."" 1 March 2011: The US Senate unanimously passed non-binding Senate resolution S.RES.85 urging the United Nations Security Council to impose a Libyan no-fly zone and encouraging Gaddafi to step down. The US had naval forces positioned off the coast of Libya, as well as forces already in the region, including the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise. 2 March 2011: The Governor General of Canada-in-Council authorised, on the advice of Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper, the deployment of the Royal Canadian Navy frigate HMCS Charlottetown to the Mediterranean, off the coast of Libya.Canadian National Defence Minister Peter MacKay stated that ""[w]e are there for all inevitabilities. And NATO is looking at this as well ... This is taken as a precautionary and staged measure."" 7 March 2011: US Ambassador to NATO Ivo Daalder announced that NATO decided to step up surveillance missions of E-3 AWACS aircraft to twenty-four hours a day. On the same day, it was reported that an anonymous UN diplomat confirmed to Agence France Presse that France and Britain were drawing up a resolution on the no-fly zone that would be considered by the UN Security Council during the same week. The Gulf Cooperation Council also on that day called upon the UN Security Council to ""take all necessary measures to protect civilians, including enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya."" 9 March 2011: The head of the Libyan National Transitional Council, Mustafa Abdul Jalil, ""pleaded for the international community to move quickly to impose a no-fly zone over Libya, declaring that any delay would result in more casualties."" Three days later, he stated that if pro-Gaddafi forces reached Benghazi, then they would kill ""half a million"" people. He stated, ""If there is no no-fly zone imposed on Gaddafi's regime, and his ships are not checked, we will have a catastrophe in Libya."" 10 March 2011: France recognized the Libyan NTC as the legitimate government of Libya soon after Sarkozy met with them in Paris. This meeting was arranged by Bernard-Henri Lévy. 11 March 2011: Cameron joined forces with Sarkozy after Sarkozy demanded immediate action from international community for a no-fly zone against air attacks by Gaddafi. 12 March 2011: The Arab League ""called on the United Nations Security Council to impose a no-fly zone over Libya in a bid to protect civilians from air attack."" The Arab League's request was announced by Omani Foreign Minister Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah, who stated that all member states present at the meeting agreed with the proposal. On 12 March, thousands of Libyan women marched in the streets of the rebel-held town of Benghazi, calling for the imposition of a no-fly zone over Libya. 14 March 2011: In Paris at the Élysée Palace, before the summit with the G8 Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sarkozy, who is also the president of the G8, along with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé met with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and pressed her to push for intervention in Libya. VOA News report on the United States joining Lebanon, France and United Kingdom to support the no-fly zone. 15 March 2011: A resolution for a no-fly zone was proposed by Nawaf Salam, Lebanon's Ambassador to the UN. The resolution was immediately backed by France and the United Kingdom. 17 March 2011: The UN Security Council, acting under the authority of Chapter VII of the UN Charter, approved a no-fly zone by a vote of ten in favour, zero against, and five abstentions, via United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973. The five abstentions were: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and Germany. Less than twenty-four hours later, Libya announced that it would halt all military operations in response to the UN Security Council resolution. 18 March 2011: The Libyan foreign minister, Moussa Koussa, said that he had declared a ceasefire, attributing the UN resolution. However, artillery shelling on Misrata and Ajdabiya continued, and government soldiers continued approaching Benghazi. Government troops and tanks entered the city on 19 March. Artillery and mortars were also fired into the city. 19 March 2011: French forces began the military intervention in Libya, later joined by coalition forces with strikes against armoured units south of Benghazi and attacks on Libyan air-defence systems, as UN Security Council Resolution 1973 called for using ""all necessary means"" to protect civilians and civilian-populated areas from attack, imposed a no-fly zone, and called for an immediate and with-standing cease-fire, while also strengthening travel bans on members of the regime, arms embargoes, and asset freezes. 21 March 2011: Obama sent a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate. 24 March 2011: In telephone negotiations, French foreign minister Alain Juppé agreed to let NATO take over all military operations on 29 March at the latest, allowing Turkey to veto strikes on Gaddafi ground forces from that point forward. Later reports stated that NATO would take over enforcement of the no-fly zone and the arms embargo, but discussions were still under way about whether NATO would take over the protection of civilians mission. Turkey reportedly wanted the power to veto airstrikes, while France wanted to prevent Turkey from having such a veto. 25 March 2011: NATO Allied Joint Force Command in Naples took command of the no-fly zone over Libya and combined it with the ongoing arms embargo operation under the name Operation Unified Protector. 28 March 2011: Obama addressed the American people on Libya. Initial NATO planning for a possible no-fly zone took place in late February and early March, especially by NATO members France and the United Kingdom. France and the UK were early supporters of a no-fly zone and had sufficient airpower to impose a no-fly zone over the rebel-held areas, although they might need additional assistance for a more extensive exclusion zone. The US had the air assets necessary to enforce a no-fly zone, but was cautious about supporting such an action prior to obtaining a legal basis for violating Libya's sovereignty. Furthermore, due to the sensitive nature of military action by the US against an Arab nation, the US sought Arab participation in the enforcement of a no-fly zone. At a congressional hearing, United States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates explained that ""a no-fly zone begins with an attack on Libya to destroy the air defences ... and then you can fly planes around the country and not worry about our guys being shot down. But that's the way it starts."" On 19 March, the deployment of French fighter jets over Libya began, and other states began their individual operations. Phase One started the same day with the involvement of the United States, United Kingdom, France, Italy and Canada. On 24 March, NATO ambassadors agreed that NATO would take command of the no-fly zone enforcement, while other military operations remained the responsibility of the group of states previously involved, with NATO expected to take control as early as 26 March. The decision was made after meetings of NATO members to resolve disagreements over whether military operations in Libya should include attacks on ground forces. The decision will create a two-level power structure overseeing military operations. In charge politically will be a committee, led by NATO, that includes all states participating in enforcing the no-fly zone, while NATO alone will be responsible for military action. Royal Canadian Air Force Lieutenant-General Charles Bouchard has been appointed to command the NATO military mission. After the death of Muammar Gaddafi on 20 October 2011, it was announced that the NATO mission would end on 31 October. These are the forces committed in alphabetical order. Belgium: Six F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jets of the Belgian Air Component, were already stationed at Araxos, Greece for an exercise, and flew their first mission in the afternoon of 21 March. They monitored the no-fly zone throughout the operation and have successfully attacked ground targets multiple times since 27 March, all of them without collateral damage. The Belgian Naval Component minehunter Narcis was part of NATO's SNMCMG1 at the start of the operation and assisted in NATO's naval blockade from 23 March. The ship was later replaced by the minehunter Lobelia in August. Bulgaria: The Bulgarian Navy Wielingen-class frigate Drazki 41 participated in the naval blockade, along with a number of ""special naval forces"", two medical teams and other humanitarian help. The frigate left port on 27 April and arrived off the coast of Libya on 2 May. It patrolled for one month before returning to Bulgaria, with a supply stop at the Greek port of Souda. Canada: The Royal Canadian Air Force deployed seven (six front line, one reserve) CF-18 fighter jets, two CC-150 Polaris refueling airplanes, two CC-177 Globemaster III heavy transports, two CC-130J Super Hercules tactical transports, and two CP-140 Aurora maritime patrol aircraft. The Royal Canadian Navy deployed the Halifax-class frigates HMCS Charlottetown and HMCS Vancouver. A total of 440 Canadian Forces personnel participated in Operation Mobile. There were reports that special operations were being conducted by Joint Task Force 2 in association with Britain's Special Air Service (SAS) and Special Boat Service (SBS) as part of Canada's contribution. Denmark: The Royal Danish Air Force participated with six F-16AM fighters, one C-130J-30 Super Hercules military transport plane and the corresponding ground crews. Only four F-16s were used for offensive operations, while the remaining two acted as reserves. The first airstrikes from Danish aircraft were carried out on 23 March, with four aircraft making twelve sorties as part of Operation Odyssey Dawn. Danish F-16s flew a total of 43 missions dropping 107 precision bombs during Odyssey Dawn before switching to NATO command under Unified Protector Danish flights bombed approximately 17 percent of all targets in Libya and together with Norwegian flights have been the most efficient in proportion to the number of flights involved. Danish F-16s flew the last fast-jet mission of Operation Unified Protector on 31 October 2011 finishing with a total of 599 missions flown and 923 precision bombs dropped during the entire Libya intervention. France: French Air Force, which flew the highest percentage of NATO's strikes (35%), participated in the mission with 18 Mirage, 19 Rafale, 6 Mirage F1, 6 Super Etendard, 2 E-2 Hawkeye, 2 C-2 Greyhound, 3 Eurocopter Tiger, 16 Aérospatiale Gazelle aircraft. In addition, the French Navy anti-air destroyer Forbin and the frigate Jean Bart participated in the operations. On 22 March, the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle arrived in international waters near Crete to provide military planners with a rapid-response air combat capability. Accompanying Charles de Gaulle were the frigates Dupleix, Aconit, the fleet replenishment tanker Meuse, and one Rubis-class nuclear attack submarine. France did station three Mirage 2000-5 aircraft and 6 Mirage 2000D at Souda Bay, Crete. France also sent an amphibious assault helicopter carrier, the Tonnerre, carrying 19 rotorcraft to operate off the coast of Libya. Greece: The Elli-class frigate Limnos of the Hellenic Navy was deployed to the waters off Libya as part of the naval blockade. The Hellenic Air Force provided Super Puma search-and-rescue helicopters and few Embraer 145 AEW&C airborne radar planes. Italy: At the beginning of the operation, as a contribution to enforce the no-fly zone, the Italian government committed four Tornado ECRs of the Italian Air Force in SEAD operations, supported by two Tornado IDS variants in an air-to-air refueling role and four F-16 ADF fighters as escort. After the transfer of authority to NATO and the decision to participate in strike air-ground operations, the Italian government increased the Italian contribution by adding four Italian Navy AV-8B plus (from Italian aircraft carrier Giuseppe Garibaldi), four Italian Air Force Eurofighters, four Tornado IDSs under NATO command. Other assets under national command participated in air patrolling and air refueling missions. As of 24 March, the Italian Navy was engaged in Operation Unified Protector with the light aircraft carrier Giuseppe Garibaldi, the Maestrale-class frigate Libeccio and the auxiliary ship Etna. Additionally, the Orizzonte-class destroyer Andrea Doria and Maestrale-class frigate Euro were patrolling off the Sicilian coast in an air-defence role. At a later stage, Italy increased its contribution to the NATO led mission by doubling the number of AV-8B Harriers and deploying an undisclosed number of AMX fighter-bombers and KC-130J and KC-767A tanker planes. The Italian Air Force also deployed its MQ-9A Reaper UAVs for real time video reconnaissance. U.S. Jordan: Six Royal Jordanian Air Force fighter jets landed at a coalition airbase in Europe on 4 April to provide ""logistical support"" and act as an escort for Jordanian transport aircraft using the humanitarian corridor to deliver aid and supplies to opposition-held Cyrenaica, according to Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh. He did not specify the type of aircraft or what specific roles they may be called upon to perform, though he said they were not intended for combat. NATO: E-3 airborne early warning and control (AWACS) aircraft operated by NATO and crewed by member states help monitor airspace over the Mediterranean and in Libya. Netherlands: The Royal Netherlands Air Force provided six F-16AM fighters and a KDC-10 refueling plane. These aircraft were stationed at the Decimomannu Air Base on Sardinia. The four F-16s were flying patrols over Libya, while the other two were being kept in reserve. Additionally, the Royal Netherlands Navy deployed the Tripartite-class minehunter HNLMS Haarlem to assist in enforcing the weapons embargo. Norway: The Royal Norwegian Air Force deployed six F-16AM fighters to Souda Bay Air Base with corresponding ground crews. On 24 March, the Norwegian F-16s were assigned to the US North African command and Operation Odyssey Dawn. It was also reported that Norwegian fighters along with Danish fighters had bombed the most targets in Libya in proportion to the number of planes involved. On 24 June, the number of fighters deployed was reduced from six to four. The Norwegian participation in the military efforts against the Libyan government came to an end in late July 2011, by which time Norwegian aircraft had dropped 588 bombs and carried out 615 of the 6493 NATO missions between 31 March and 1 August (not including 19 bombs dropped and 32 missions carried out under operation Odyssey Dawn). 75% of the missions performed by the Royal Norwegian Air Force was so called SCAR ( Strike Coordination and Reconnaissance ) missions. US military sources has confirmed that on the night of 25 April, it was 2 F-16 from the Royal Norwegian Air Force who bombed the residence of Gaddafi inside Tripoli. Qatar: The Qatar Armed Forces contributed with six Mirage 2000-5EDA fighter jets and two C-17 strategic transport aircraft to coalition no-fly zone enforcement efforts. The Qatari aircraft were stationed in Crete. At later stages in the Operation, Qatari Special Forces had been assisting in operations, including the training of the Tripoli Brigade and rebel forces in Benghazi and the Nafusa mountains. Qatar also brought small groups of Libyans to Qatar for small-unit leadership training in preparation for the rebel advance on Tripoli in August. Romania: The Romanian Naval Forces participated in the naval blockade with the frigate Regele Ferdinand. Spain: The Spanish Armed Forces participated with six F-18 fighters, two Boeing 707-331B(KC) tanker aircraft, the Álvaro de Bazán-class frigate Méndez Núñez, the submarine Tramontana and two CN-235 MPA maritime surveillance plane. Spain participated in air control and maritime surveillance missions to prevent the inflow of arms to the Libyan regime. Spain also made available to NATO the Spanish air base at Rota. Sweden: The Swedish Air Force committed eight JAS 39 Gripen jets for the international air campaign after being asked by NATO to take part in the operations on 28 March. Sweden also sent a Saab 340 AEW&C for airborne early warning and control and a C-130 Hercules for aerial refueling. Sweden was the only country neither a member of NATO nor the Arab League to participate in the no-fly zone. Turkey: The Turkish Navy participated with five ships and one submarine in the NATO-led naval blockade to enforce the arms embargo. It also provided six F-16 Fighting Falcon jets for aerial operations. On 24 March, Turkey's parliament approved Turkish participation in military operations in Libya, including enforcing the no-fly zone in Libya. UAE: On 24 March, the United Arab Emirates Air Force sent six F-16 Fighting Falcon and six Mirage 2000 fighter jets to join the mission. This was also the first combat deployment of the Desert Falcon variant of F-16, which is the most sophisticated F-16 variant. The planes were based at the Italian Decimomannu air base on Sardinia. United Kingdom: The United Kingdom deployed the Royal Navy frigates HMS Westminster and HMS Cumberland, nuclear attack submarines HMS Triumph and HMS Turbulent, the destroyer HMS Liverpool and the mine countermeasure vessel HMS Brocklesby. The Royal Air Force participated with 16 Tornado and 10 Typhoon fighters operating initially from Great Britain, but later forward deployed to the Italian base at Gioia del Colle. Nimrod R1 and Sentinel R1 surveillance aircraft were forward deployed to RAF Akrotiri in support of the action. In addition the RAF deployed a number of other support aircraft such as the Sentry AEW.1 AWACS aircraft and VC10 air-to-air refueling tankers. According to anonymous sources, members of the SAS, SBS and Special Reconnaissance Regiment (SRR) helped to coordinate the air strikes on the ground in Libya. On 27 May, the UK deployed four UK Apache helicopters on board HMS Ocean. United States: The United States deployed a naval force of 11 ships, including the amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge, the amphibious transport dock USS Ponce, the guided-missile destroyers USS Barry and USS Stout, the nuclear attack submarines USS Providence and USS Scranton, the cruise missile submarine USS Florida and the amphibious command ship USS Mount Whitney. Additionally, A-10 ground-attack aircraft, Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, AV-8B Harrier II jump-jets, EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft, P-3 Orions, and both McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle and F-16 fighters were involved in action over Libya.U-2 reconnaissance aircraft were stationed on Cyprus. On 18 March, two AC-130Us arrived at RAF Mildenhall as well as additional tanker aircraft.[citation needed] On 24 March 2 E-8Cs operated from Naval Station Rota Spain, which indicated an increase of ground attacks.[citation needed] An undisclosed number of CIA operatives were said to be in Libya to gather intelligence for airstrikes and make contacts with rebels. The US also used MQ-1 Predator UAVs to strike targets in Libya on 23 April. A Qatari C-17 transport plane at Incirlik Air Base, Turkey. Albania: Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha said that Albania is ready to help. Prime Minister Berisha supported the decision of the coalition to protect civilians from the Libyan regime of Gaddafi. Berisha also offered assistance to facilitate the international coalition actions. In a press release of the Prime Ministry, these operations are considered entirely legitimate, having as main objective the protection of freedoms and universal rights that Libyans deserve. On 29 March, Foreign Minister Edmond Haxhinasto said Albania would open its airspace and territorial waters to coalition forces and said its seaports and airports were at the coalition's disposal upon request. Haxhinasto also suggested that Albania could make a ""humanitarian"" contribution to international efforts. In mid-April, the International Business Times listed Albania alongside several other NATO member states, including Romania and Turkey, that have made ""modest"" contributions to the military effort, although it did not go into detail. Australia: Prime Minister Julia Gillard and others in her Labor government have said Australia will not contribute militarily to enforcement of the UN mandate despite registering strong support for its implementation, but the opposition Liberal Party's defence spokesman has called upon the government to consider dispatching Australian military assets if requested by NATO. Defence Minister Stephen Smith said the government would be willing to send C-17 Globemaster heavy transport planes for use in international operations ""as part of a humanitarian contribution"", if needed. Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd described Australia as the ""third largest [humanitarian contributor to Libya] globally after the United States and the European Union"" on 27 April, after a humanitarian aid ship funded by the Australian government docked in Misurata. Croatia: President Ivo Josipović said that if it becomes necessary Croatia will honour its NATO membership and participate in the actions in Libya. He also stressed that while Croatia is ready for military participation according to its capabilities, it will mostly endeavor to help on the humanitarian side. On 29 April, the government announced it planned to send two Croatian Army officers to assist with Operation Unified Protector pending formal presidential and parliamentary approval. Cyprus: After the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, President Demetris Christofias asked the British government not to use its military base at Akrotiri, an overseas territory of the United Kingdom on the island of Cyprus, in support of the intervention, though this request had no legal weight as Nicosia cannot legally bar the United Kingdom from using the base. The Cypriot government reluctantly allowed Qatar Emiri Air Force fighter jets and a transport plane to refuel at Larnaca International Airport on 22 March after their pilots declared a fuel emergency while in transit to Crete for participation in international military operations. Estonia: Foreign Minister Urmas Paet said on 18 March that his country has no current plans to join in military operations in Libya, but it would be willing to participate if called upon to do so by NATO or the European Union. The Estonian Air Force does not presently operate any fighter aircraft, though it does operate a few helicopters and transport planes. European Union: Finnish foreign minister Alexander Stubb announced that the proposed EUFOR Libya operation is being prepared, waiting for a request from the UN. Germany: Germany has withdrawn all forces from NATO operations in the Mediterranean Sea as its government decided not to take part in any military operations against Libya. However it is increasing the number of AWACS personnel in Afghanistan by up to 300 to free forces of other states. Germany allows the usage of military installations on its territory for the intervention in Libya. On 8 April, German officials suggested that Germany could potentially contribute troops to ""[ensure] with military means that humanitarian aid gets to those who need it"". As of early June, the German government is reportedly considering opening a center for training police in Benghazi. On 24 July, Germany lent €100 million Euros ($144 million USD) to the rebels for ""civilian and humanitarian purposes"". Indonesia: President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono called for a ceasefire by all sides, but said that if a UN peacekeeping force was established to monitor a potential truce, ""Indonesia is more than willing to take part."" Kuwait: The Arab state will make a ""logistic contribution"", according to the British Prime Minister David Cameron. Malta: Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi said no coalition forces would be allowed to stage from military bases in Malta, but Maltese airspace would be open to international forces involved in the intervention. On 20 April, two French Mirages were reportedly allowed to make emergency landings in Malta after running low on fuel. Poland: US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, UK Secretary of Defence Liam Fox, and NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen have urged the Polish government to contribute to military operations. As of June 2011, Warsaw has not committed to participation. Sudan: The government has ""quietly granted permission"" for coalition states to traverse its airspace for operations in the Libyan theater if necessary, Reuters reported in late March. 14 May: NATO air strike hit a large number of people gathered for Friday prayers in the eastern city of Brega leaving 11 religious leaders dead and 50 others wounded. 24 May: NATO air strikes in Tripoli kill 19 civilians and wound 150, according to Libyan state television. 31 May: Libya claims that NATO strikes have left up to 718 civilians dead. 19 June: NATO air strikes hit a residential house in Tripoli, killing seven civilians, according to Libyan state television. 20 June: A NATO airstrike in Sorman, near Tripoli, killed fifteen civilians, according to government officials. Eight rockets apparently hit the compound of a senior government official, in an area where NATO confirmed operations had taken place. 25 June: NATO strikes on Brega hit a bakery and a restaurant, killing 15 civilians and wounding 20 more, Libyan state television claimed. The report further accused the coalition of ""crimes against humanity"". The claims were denied by NATO. 28 June: NATO airstrike on the town of Tawergha, 300 km east of the Libyan capital, Tripoli kills eight civilians. 25 July: NATO airstrike on a medical clinic in Zliten kills 11 civilians, though the claim was denied by NATO, who said they hit a vehicle depot and communications center. 20 July: NATO attacks Libyan state TV, Al-Jamahiriya. Three journalists killed. 9 August: Libyan government claims 85 civilians were killed in a NATO airstrike in Majer, a village near Zliten. A spokesman confirms that NATO bombed Zliten at 2:34 a.m. on 9 August, but says he was unable to confirm the casualties. Commander of the NATO military mission, Lieutenant General Charles Bouchard says ""I cannot believe that 85 civilians were present when we struck in the wee hours of the morning, and given our intelligence. But I cannot assure you that there were none at all"". 15 September: Gaddafi spokesman Moussa Ibrahim declares that NATO air strikes killed 354 civilians and wounded 700 others, while 89 other civilians are supposedly missing. He also claims that over 2,000 civilians have been killed by NATO air strikes since 1 September. NATO denied the claims, saying they were unfounded. 2 March 2012: United Nations Human Rights Council release their report about the aftermath of the Libyan civil war, concluding that in total 60 civilians were killed and 55 wounded by the NATO air campaign. In May that same year, Human Rights Watch published a report claiming that at least 72 civilians were killed. The USAF F-15E that crashed over Libya, numbered 91-0304/LN, in Ostrava, Czech Republic, six months before the accident. Both crew members ejected and were rescued. 22 March: One USAF F-15E flying from Aviano crashed in Bu Marim, northwest of Benghazi. The pilot was rescued alive by US Marines from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit based on the USS Kearsarge. The weapons systems officer evaded hostile forces and was subsequently repatriated by undisclosed forces. The aircraft crashed due to a mechanical failure. The rescue operation involved two Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey aircraft, two Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters, and two McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II aircraft, all launched from the USS Kearsarge. The operation involved the Harriers' dropping 227 kg (500 lb) bombs and strafing the area around the crash site before an Osprey recovered at least one of the downed aircraft's crew; injuring six local civilians in the process. 27 April: An F-16 from the United Arab Emirates Air Force crashed at Naval Air Station Sigonella at about 11:35 local time; the pilot ejected safely. The aircraft was confirmed to be from the UAE by the country's General Command of the armed forces, and had been arriving from Sardinia when it crashed. 21 June: An unmanned US Navy MQ-8 Fire Scout went down over Libya, possibly due to enemy fire. NATO confirmed that they lost radar contact with the unmanned helicopter as it was performing an intelligence and reconnaissance mission near Zliten. NATO began investigating the crash shortly after it occurred. On 5 August, it was announced that the investigation had concluded that the cause of the crash was probably enemy fire; with operator or mechanical failure ruled out and the inability of investigators to access the crash site the ""logical conclusion"" was that the aircraft had been shot down. 20 July: A British airman was killed in a traffic accident in Italy while part of a logistical convoy transferring supplies from the UK to NATO bases in the south of Italy from which air strikes were being conducted against Libya. Since the start of the campaign, there have been allegations of violating the limits imposed upon the intervention by Resolution 1973 and by US law. At the end of May 2011, Western troops were captured on film in Libya, despite Resolution 1973 specifically forbidding ""a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory"". In the article however, it reports that armed Westerners but not Western troops were on the ground. On 10 June, US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates criticized some of the NATO member nations for their efforts, or lack thereof, to participate in the intervention in Libya. Gates singled out Germany, Poland, Spain, Turkey, and the Netherlands for criticism. He praised Canada, Norway and Denmark, saying that although those three countries had only provided twelve percent of the aircraft to the operation, their aircraft had conducted one-third of the strikes. On June 24, the US House voted against Joint Resolution 68, which would have authorized continued US military involvement in the NATO campaign for up to one year. The majority of Republicans voted against the resolution, with some questioning US interests in Libya and others criticizing the White House for overstepping its authority by conducting a military expedition without Congressional backing. House Democrats were split on the issue, with 115 voting in favor of and 70 voting against. Despite the failure of the President to receive legal authorization from Congress, the Obama administration continued its military campaign, carrying out the bulk of NATO's operations until the overthrow of Gadaffi in October. On 9 August, the head of UNESCO, Irina Bokova deplored a NATO strike on Libyan State TV, Al-Jamahiriya, that killed 3 journalists and wounded others. Bokova declared that media outlets should not be the target of military activities. On 11 August, after the NATO airstrike on Majer (on 9 August) that allegedly killed 85 civilians, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on all sides to do as much as possible to avoid killing innocent people. The military intervention in Libya has been cited by the Council on Foreign Relations as an example of the responsibility to protect policy adopted by the UN at the 2005 World Summit. According to Gareth Evans, ""[t]he international military intervention (SMH) in Libya is not about bombing for democracy or Muammar Gaddafi's head. Legally, morally, politically, and militarily it has only one justification: protecting the country's people."" However, the Council also noted that the policy had been used only in Libya, and not in countries such as Côte d'Ivoire, undergoing a political crisis at the time, or in response to protests in Yemen. A CFR expert, Stewert Patrick, said that ""There is bound to be selectivity and inconsistency in the application of the responsibility to protect norm given the complexity of national interests at stake in...the calculations of other major powers involved in these situations."" In January 2012, the Arab Organization for Human Rights, Palestinian Centre for Human Rights and the International Legal Assistance Consortium published a report describing alleged human rights violations and accusing NATO of war crimes. According to a Gallup poll conducted in 2012, 75% of Libyans were in favor of the NATO intervention, compared to 22% who were opposed. A 2011 Orb International poll also found broad support for the intervention, with 85% of Libyans saying that they strongly supported the action taken to remove the Ghadafi regime. Some critics of Western military intervention suggested that resources—not democratic or humanitarian concerns—were the real impetus for the intervention, among them a journalist of London Arab nationalist newspaper Al-Quds Al-Arabi, the Russian TV network RT and the (then-)leaders of Venezuela and Zimbabwe, Hugo Chávez and Robert Mugabe.Gaddafi's Libya, despite its relatively small population, was known to possess vast resources, particularly in the form of oil reserves and financial capital. Libya is a member of OPEC and one of the world's largest oil producers. It was producing roughly 1.6 million barrels a day before the war, nearly 70 percent of them through the state-owned National Oil Corporation. Additionally, the country's sovereign wealth fund, the Libyan Investment Authority, was one of the largest in the world, controlling assets worth approximately US$56 billion, including over 100 tons of gold reserves in the Central Bank of Libya. Accusations of imperialism on the part of NATO and the West were voiced by many leaders of states that had traditionally aligned themselves with the Communist bloc and subsequently Russia, including: Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei (who said he supported the rebels but not Western intervention), Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez (who referred to Gaddafi as a ""martyr""), and President of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe (who referred to the Western nations as ""vampires""), as well as the governments of Raúl Castro in Cuba,Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua,Kim Jong-il in North Korea,Hifikepunye Pohamba in Namibia, and others. Gaddafi himself referred to the intervention as a ""colonial crusade ... capable of unleashing a full scale war"", a sentiment that was echoed by Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin: ""[UNSC Resolution 1973] is defective and flawed...It allows everything. It resembles medieval calls for crusades."" President Hu Jintao of the People's Republic of China said, ""Dialogue and other peaceful means are the ultimate solutions to problems,"" and added, ""If military action brings disaster to civilians and causes a humanitarian crisis, then it runs counter to the purpose of the UN resolution."" Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was critical of the intervention as well, rebuking the coalition in a speech at the UN in September 2011. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, despite the substantial role his country played in the NATO mission, also spoke out against getting involved: ""I had my hands tied by the vote of the parliament of my country. But I was against and I am against this intervention which will end in a way that no-one knows"" and added ""This wasn't a popular uprising because Gaddafi was loved by his people, as I was able to see when I went to Libya."" Russia's foreign broadcasting service, RT, has postulated that NATO intervention may have been motivated by Gaddafi's attempts to establish a unified federation of African states that would use the gold dinar as its currency and demand that foreign importers of African oil pay in gold. Despite its stated opposition to NATO intervention, Russia abstained from voting on Resolution 1973 instead of exercising its veto power as a permanent member of the Security Council; four other powerful nations also abstained from the vote—India, China, Germany, and Brazil—but of that group only China has the same veto power. Moreover, criticisms have been made on the way the operation was led. According to Michael Kometer and Stephen Wright, the outcome of the Libyan intervention was reached by default rather than by design. It appears that there was an important lack of consistent political guidance caused particularly by the vagueness of the UN mandate and the ambiguous consensus among the NATO-led coalition. This lack of clear political guidance was translated into an incoherent military planning on the operational level. Such a gap may impact the future NATO's operations that will probably face trust issues. In 2015 through 2016 the British parliament's Foreign Affairs Select Committee conducted an extensive and highly critical inquiry into the British involvement in the civil war. It concluded that the early threat to civilians had been overstated and that the significant Islamist element in the rebel forces had not been recognised, due to an intelligence failure. By summer 2011 the initial limited intervention to protect Libyan civilians had become a policy of regime change. However that new policy did not include proper support and for a new government, leading to a political and economic collapse in Libya and the growth of ISIL in North Africa. The Foreign Affairs Select Committee saw no evidence that the UK Government carried out a proper analysis of the nature of the rebellion in Libya and it ""selectively took elements of Muammar Gaddafi’s rhetoric at face value; and it failed to identify the militant Islamist extremist element in the rebellion. UK strategy was founded on erroneous assumptions and an incomplete understanding of the evidence"". The former Prime Minister David Cameron was ultimately responsible for this British policy failure. Commentator Max Blumenthal claimed that ""blowback from interventionist policies carried out in the name of human rights and 'civilian protection'"", contributed to the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing. The perpetrator, Salman Ramadan Abedi, was British of Libyan ancestry. He was born in Manchester on 31 December 1994 to a Salafi family of Libyan-born refugees who had settled in south Manchester after fleeing to the UK to escape the government of Muammar Gaddafi. Funds spent by Foreign Powers on War in Libya. On 22 March 2011, BBC News presented a breakdown of the likely costs to the UK of the mission. Journalist Francis Tusa, editor of Defence Analysis, estimated that flying a Tornado GR4 would cost about £35,000 an hour (c. US$48,000), so the cost of patrolling one sector of Libyan airspace would be £2M–3M (US$2.75M–4.13M) per day. Conventional airborne missiles would cost £800,000 each and Tomahawk cruise missiles £750,000 each. Professor Malcolm Charmers of the Royal United Services Institute similarly suggested that a single cruise missile would cost about £500,000, while a single Tornado sortie would cost about £30,000 in fuel alone. If a Tornado was downed the replacement cost would be upwards of £50m. By 22 March the US and UK had already fired more than 110 cruise missiles. UK Chancellor George Osborne had said that the MoD estimate of the operation cost was ""tens rather than hundreds of millions"". On 4 April Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Dalton said that the RAF was planning to continue operations over Libya for at least six months. The total number of sorties flown by NATO numbered more than 26,000, an average of 120 sorties per day. 42% of the sorties were strike sorties, which damaged or destroyed approximately 6,000 military targets. At its peak, the operation involved more than 8,000 servicemen and women, 21 NATO ships in the Mediterranean and more than 250 aircraft of all types. By the end of the operation, NATO had conducted over 3,000 hailings at sea and almost 300 boardings for inspection, with 11 vessels denied transit to their next port of call. Eight NATO and two non-NATO countries flew strike sorties. Of these, Denmark, Canada, and Norway together were responsible for 31%, the United States was responsible for 16%, Italy 10%, France 33%, Britain 21%, and Belgium, Qatar, and the UAE the remainder. An in depth investigation into the Libyan intervention and its aftermath was conducted by the U.K. Parliament's House of Commons' bipartisan Foreign Affairs Committee, the final conclusions of which were released on 14 September 2016 in a report titled Libya: Examination of intervention and collapse and the UK’s future policy options. The report was strongly critical of the U.K.'s role in the intervention. The report concluded that the government ""failed to identify that the threat to civilians was overstated and that the rebels included a significant Islamist element."" In particular, the committee concluded that Gaddafi was not planning to massacre civilians with reports to the contrary being propagated by rebels and Western governments, that France's motive for initiating the intervention was economic and political rather than humanitarian, and that Islamic extremists had a large influence on the uprising, which was largely ignored by the West to the future detriment of Libya.

""I had this apocalyptic chic that probably fitted the bill. I looked like I’d survived a zombie apocalypse.”In addition, Lincoln also fit the mold of off-screen actor the at-the-time showrunner Frank Darabont was looking for.""Frank wanted the Gary Cooper of High Noon, a classical leading man, very moral, almost gentle and quiet,"" Lincoln says. ""But he also wanted a family man, so the perfect storm of meeting someone who had just had his second child was really appealing to him.”It's hard to imagine anyone else playing the role of Rick Grimes at this point. Ethan Embry, who played the one-episode role of Carter in the season six premiere, says he auditioned for another role years ago . While he wouldn't reveal which it was, I can only assume it was Rick. Imagine if the roles were swapped?The Walking Dead airs Sundays at 9 PM ET on AMC."

Secret Service agents rushed the stage to protect the billionaire business mogul.Thomas Dimassimo was identified as the barrier jumper. He was charged with inducing panic and disorderly conduct, Montgomery County Sheriff Phil Plummer said.Trump’s path continued onto Kansas City, Mo. where he was interrupted numerous times. At least seven individuals stalled the rally in the first few minutes.""I think they're Bernie [Sanders] supporters,"" Trump said of the protesters, pointing to at least one protester the Republican frontrunner said was holding a sign in support of the Democratic presidential candidate.Trump canceled his rally at the University of Illinois at Chicago on Friday after violence broke out in the arena where he was scheduled to speak. He spoke later to Fox News, saying he canceled the event because he didn’t want to see “people get hurt.”He said he made the decision to cancel after meeting with law enforcement authorities. Trump also said his First Amendment rights had been violated.Hours earlier, Trump supporters and opponents stood calmly in a line together waiting to get inside. Police horses and barricades kept the bulk of the demonstrators across the street.Trump opponents were protesting what they called his divisive comments, particularly about Muslims and Mexicans. Dozens of UIC faculty and staff had petitioned university administrators to cancel the rally, citing concerns it would create a ""hostile and physically dangerous environment.""At one point, nearly 20 officers who had been manning barricades suddenly bolted for an intersection across a street bridge over a freeway -- where protesters shouted at and jostled with police already there. An officer was seen walking from that intersection with blood on his head.For Sunday, Trump is expected to make a stop in Bloomington, Illinois. He is expected to be met with more protests and local officials said they would be deploying extra police.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Advertisement"	
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/church-scientology-tax-exempt/	the supreme court revoked the church of scientology's tax-exempt status in march 2016.	False	['church of scientology']	http://www.religionfacts.com/	http://www.religionfacts.com/scientology/history	2016/03/11	"History of ScientologyWhat is the story of the Scientology faith?The Church of Scientology was founded in 1954, based on the teachings of an American author named L. Ron Hubbard. ""Lafayette"" Ronald Hubbard was born on March 13, 1911, in Tilden, Nebraska. The son of a naval commander, Hubbard moved to Montana at the age of two and traveled with his family over much of the country. His mother, who had attended teacher's college, tutored Hubbard at home, and he learned to read and write at a young age.As a young boy, Hubbard established a friendship with a tribe of Blackfoot Indians living near his Helena, Montana home. This unique opportunity enabled him to learn much about the culture, customs and legends of the tribe. At the age of six, Hubbard was given the rare honor of becoming a blood brother of the Blackfoot Indians.In 1923, Hubbard moved with his family to Seattle, Washington, where he joined the Boy Scouts. At the age of 13, he became the youngest Eagle Scout ever. The same year, the young Hubbard traveled to Washington, D.C. by way of the Panama Canal. Along the way, he established another influential friendship, this time with Naval Commander Joseph C. Thompson. Commander Thompson had been sent by the US Navy Marine Corps to study under Sigmund Freud, and he taught Hubbard much about Freudian theory.Hubbard: adulthoodHubbard in AsiaIn 1927, Hubbard embarked on the first of his many journeys to Asia. By the age of 19, he had traveled more than 250,000 miles - including China, Japan, Guam, and the Philippines. In the course of these travels, he befriended Old Mayo, a Beijing magician, spent time with followers of the Buddhist religion at lamaseries in the Western Hills of China, and spent time with nomadic bandits of Mongolian descent. Hubbard learned and experienced much during his Asian travels, but he was left discouraged by what he observed:For all the wonders of these lands and all his respect for those whom he encountered, he still saw much that concerned him: Chinese beggars willing themselves to die above open graves in Beijing, children who were less than rags, widespread ignorance and despair. And in the end, he came to the inescapable conclusion that despite the wisdom of its ancient texts, the East did not have the answers to the miseries of the human condition. It remained evident in the degradation and sorrow of its people. ( www.aboutlronhubbard.org )Hubbard back to AmericaIn 1929, Hubbard returned to the United States and resumed his formal education. After graduating from the Woodword School for Boys in Washington, D.C., he enrolled in the mathematics and engineering program at George Washington University. In the course of this study, Hubbard theorized that subatomic particles might assist in understanding how the human mind worked, and recognized the great importance of keeping mankind under control in light of atomic studies. He also became keenly disappointed with the knowledge of the psychologists he consulted with. As Hubbard described it:To be very blunt, it was very obvious that I was dealing with and living in a culture which knew less about the mind than the lowest primitive tribe I had ever come in contact with. Knowing also that people in the East were not able to reach as deeply and predictably into the riddles of the mind as I had been led to expect, I knew I would have to do a lot of research. Thus, the result of Hubbard's many travels, experiences, and studies was a determination to discover how the human mind works. Hubbard left college before graduating and made the world his research laboratory. His research was financed by becoming one of the most famous authors of the 1930s. He wrote well over 200 novels and short stories in the genres of science fiction, western, mystery and adventure.In 1938, Hubbard discovered what he believed to be the common denominator of existence, which was: SURVIVE. In a philosophic work entitled ""Excalibur,"" Hubbard wrote:I suddenly realized that survival was the pin on which you could hang the rest of this with adequate and ample proof. It’s a very simple problem. Idiotically simple! That’s why it never got solved. Nobody has ever looked at anything being that simple to do that much. So what do we find as the simplicities of solution? The simplicities of solution lie in this: that life, all life, is trying to survive. And life is composed of two things: the material universe and an X-factor. And this X-factor is something that can evidently organize, and mobilize the material universe. ### Naval yearsHubbard served as a Navy Lieutenant in World War II, and the bloodshed and its effects on man's mind that he observed made him more determined than ever to discover the answers to the human mind. In 1945, he was hospitalized at Oak Knoll Naval Hospital in Oakland, California. While recovering, he took the opportunity to experiment with the idea that mental blocks can prevent medical treatments from being effective. He found this theory to work on numerous patients, and concluded: ""Thought is boss.""After the war, Hubbard continued to test his hypotheses on a broad sample of people from all over the United States. He is said to have helped over 400 hundred people become healthier with the procedures he had developed, including himself. These procedures came to be called ""Dianetics,"" which would eventually become central to Scientology's beliefs.Dianetics, and the AMA and APAIn 1949, Hubbard's first published article on Dianetics appeared in the Explorers Club Journal. He also presented his findings to the American Medical Association and American Psychiatric Association, but neither were interested in his work. Hubbard and his friends concluded that the medical establishment felt their way of life threatened by the simplicity of Dianetics and were motivated by greed rather than helping others. Hubbard therefore presented his findings directly to the public.In May 1950, Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health was published, and went on to sell over 17 million copies. He wrote six books in 1951 on Dianetics technology and began lecturing all over the country. According to the Church of Scientology, over 750 groups were putting Dianetics technology into practice by the end of 1950.Despite this success, Hubbard still puzzled over some unanswered questions. Although he felt he had discovered the mechanism of the mind, he wrote that ""the further one investigated, the more one came to understand that here, in this creature Homo sapiens, were far too many unknowns. This new avenue of research, into the human spirit, was the focus of the next three decades of Hubbard's study and writing. It is out of this period that Scientology was born.In 1954, Scientologists, not Hubbard, founded the first Church of Scientology in Los Angeles. As Scientologists describe it, ""L. Ron Hubbard founded the subject - early Scientologists founded the church."" In 1959 Hubbard and his family moved to England. He bought the Saint Hill Manor in Sussex, which was to be his home for the next seven years and the worldwide headquarters of the Church of Scientology.Later lifeIn the 1960s, Hubbard developed a step-by-step method for reaching higher spiritual awareness and ability, and trained Scientologists in this method. Hubbard also designed administrative principles for Scientology organizations.On September 1, 1966, Hubbard resigned as Executive Director of the Church of Scientology, and spent the next seven years at sea devoted to research. During this time, he developed a drug rehabilitation program, as well as the highest levels of Scientology and further administrative principles.From 1975 to 1979, Hubbard lived in La Quinta, California, where he wrote (and in many cases directed) numerous training films on the application of his principles.In 1980, Hubbard published The Way to Happiness, a ""nonreligious moral code based on common sense,"" of which over 35 million copies have been printed. About this book Hubbard commented:Reading the papers and wandering around in the society, it was pretty obvious that honesty and truth were not being held up to the standards they once had. People and even little kids in schools have gotten the idea that high moral standards are a thing of the past. Man has in his hands today a lot of violent weapons. He doesn’t have the moral standards to go with them.Hubbard died on January 24, 1986.Source:L. Ron Hubbard: The Founder of Scientology - Scientology.orgRelated Content"

That year, she made $2.3 million for three speeches to Goldman Sachs and individual speeches to Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, Fidelity Investments, Apollo Management Holdings, UBS, Bank of America, and Golden Tree Asset Managers.The following year, she picked up $485,000 for a speech to Deutsche Bank and an address to Ameriprise. Last year, she made $150,000 from a lecture before the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.To put these numbers into perspective, compare them to lifetime earnings of the median American worker. In 2011, the Census Bureau estimated that , across all majors, a “bachelor’s degree holder can expect to earn about $2.4 million over his or her work life.” A Pew Research analysis published the same year estimated that a “typical high school graduate” can expect to make just $770,000 over the course of his or her lifetime.This means that in one year — 2013 — Hillary Clinton earned almost as much from 10 lectures to financial firms as most bachelor’s degree-holding Americans earn in their lifetimes — and nearly four times what someone who holds only a high school diploma could expect to make.Hillary Clinton’s haul from Wall Street speeches pales in comparison to her husband’s, which also had to be disclosed because the two share a bank account.“I never made any money until I left the White House,” said Bill Clinton during a 2009 address to a student group. “I had the lowest net worth, adjusted for inflation, of any president elected in the last 100 years, including President Obama. I was one poor rascal when I took office. But after I got out, I made a lot of money.”The Associated Press notes that during Hillary Clinton’s time as secretary of state, Bill Clinton earned $17 million in talks to banks, insurance companies, hedge funds, real estate businesses, and other financial firms. Altogether, the couple are estimated to have made over $139 million from paid speeches.Top photo: Hillary Clinton with Goldman Sachs chief Lloyd Blankfein at a Clinton Global Initiative event, September 2014, in New York City.We depend on the support of readers like you to help keep our nonprofit newsroom strong and independent.

I choose to believe that a deceased person has the ability to come back to Earth without taking a physical form.They do this for a lot of reasons but the basic idea behind most of these ideas is that they are attempting to pass along a message.As they have not taken a physical forms they can only communicate through no direct means. The fact that you are reading this articles says a lot about your willingness to stay open and listen.Here are some of the common ways that spirits try to talk to us .

They will create scenarios or characters that grab at our attention.When you are dreaming especially, you are aligned with other realms o it is easier for spirits to speak to you. Before you meditate or sleep is ask for guidance with sincerity and deliberation.Your Sense Are Sharper, More EnhancedSpirits have to communicate through indirect means so they will sharpen your senses so you may notice more.You'll see them on the edge of your vision, or smell a flower that reminds you of someone deceased. Often at first you won't know what you are seeing, but remain calm and open to the experience.Electronics Randomly Act UpWe've all seen this in movies, but that doesn't make it untrue.Electronics turning on and off, volumes going out of wack or televisions sets get static and change channels. This phenomena will continue until you directly address the situation.You Know Things You Can't ExplainEver got the feeling you knew something that you had no memory of learning? This could be a spirit telepathically popping information to you.You will need this information so stay open to its existence or you will shut it out.Also spirits can lead our intuitions. So listen to your gut as it may lead you to unknown places. Have faith in your spirit guides.You Get Frequent And Random ChillsIf ever you are talking about the deceased, or a situation involving the dead, and you get a chilling sensation, that could be a clear indication of spirits.While this isn't always the most pleasant of sensations remember they are on a different wavelength now.

That might be shocking to younger people, especially anyone who fears old age.Maybe we fear missing out on opportunities in life, and worry that we'll find ourselves too old to do things. But we have many interviews of people 100 and older, and they love to share about their lives and offer advice to the rest of us.Dr. Mercola (of the Mercola Video Library) interviewed three centurions for this very information, and many other people have as well.Quite a few of us (more now than ever) have relatives or know someone who is 100 or over. One lady I know who is 104 is full of sassy attitude and enjoys talking to people.From this wealth of information, we can form the following nine lessons.1. Happiness comes from what we do.At 100 years old, or older, people don't seem to sit around and smile about the things they accumulated in life.Rather, it's more about their life experiences. Happy memories can go a long ways toward happiness later on! One man over 100 years old said he did all he wanted to do.Now he wants to be helpful and keep going. ""I have so many beautiful memories,"" said a woman over 100. ""I got to do all the things I wanted to.""That tells us to jump in and live life - remember that it's about really living and making memories with people we love.Science backs this up as well. We know people derive more happiness that is long-term from experiences such as vacations rather than from possessions.2. Happiness comes from a positive attitude and optimism.People over 100 seem to remember life through rose tinted glasses, making it sound like an adventure even through hard times, like war.""I've always been lucky,"" says one centurion despite living through 2 great wars! She also talked about how ""everything makes me happy. I love talking to people... going shopping.""Common advice from people who are doing well at 100 is to ""Decide to be content."" Others say, ""Don't chase happiness. Just be satisfied.""Deciding life is good changes our perception and makes life better, and apparently it helps you live much longer!3. Happiness comes from living in the NOW.Age is only a number. You live for the day and keep going. This is wisdom from someone with a very long past-but they enjoy the present.The past is the past; we can't change it. But we can rob ourselves of our present happiness and good emotional health by hanging onto old regrets, grudges, and pain.To experience the ultimate feelings of inner calm and living in the now, I highly recommend that you follow this link: Click Here To Discover 7 Minute MindfulnessYou'll gain inner peace, happiness and feel 'uncluttered' in your life.4. Love and Partnership is critical for long life.Centurions often talk about their ""good"" marriage, all their happy memories, and all their good times together.It's another area where they might be applying rose-tinted glasses, but it's apparent that they got emotional support and felt like they have a life partner.They also say that people today give up too easily these days-so there was hard work involved, but at the end of their life that part isn't really important anymore.""Being happily married and happy in general is the remedy for all illness.""We don't have studies on how marriage or long-term relationships affect life span, but you don't have to be a scientist to take note: centurions all speak about their decades long marriage with a smile on their face.Even people who have been widowed for a few decades say they have many, many warm memories about their married life, and that still makes them happy.5. Eat natural, real food to feel good and live long.Many people who are 100 say they feel strong and like they're 69 or 79. These are the people who stay active physically and mentally, and have a lot to share with other people.Many people over 100 talk about eating fresh food that they grew themselves. And older people will tell you over and over: eat in moderation!6. Learn to adapt for a better and longer life.""Life goes on regardless"" is a common theme.

Help others.Helping others is one way to build relationships and connections, and it makes you feel great. It's another common theme among people who live to be over 100.Being kind and helping others gives you a sense of purpose too, and it fights depression and anxiety. Not only that, it's a way of staying active and productive after you retire.It's a win-win for everyone involved, and being older and retired can mean having more time for volunteering.8. Always learn!Older people will advise to get a good education to help you go far in life, and science has shown that people with a Bachelor's degree actually do live about a decade longer than people who don't have one. (From the U.S. Centers for Disease an Control Prevention)Older people will tell you to keep learning all through life, both in and out of school.Be curious-it makes life more interesting and fun. And it helps you stay engaged with life and the changing technology and times. That helps you adapt too.9. Practice MindfulnessPeople over 100 tend to live in the moment as it comes, rather than worrying about plans, regrets, and getting caught up in pressure and worry.They cherish special time with family and friends, the colors and smell of a new flower in spring, or the feel of the grass on their feet.When life is enjoyed in the moment, it's just better and people who live in the moment more tend to live longer, happier lives!For the ULTIMATE experience of mindfulness, I highly recommend that you check out 7 Minute Mindfulness .This method will make your mind as calm as water...

Would you love to make him absolutely addicted to you? If so, you're in the right place.As you may or may not already know, there are certain things women can do to hook men. The good news is that these have nothing to do with looks, but rather attitude.Once you can get yourself in the right mindset, you'll not only have his attention, but like a lovesick puppy dog, he won't leave your side.Here's an easy guide that will tell you exactly what you need to do...1. Be MysteriousHave you ever left a date feeling mentally drained, or like you knew everything there was to know about a man? If so, you probably had little interest in seeing him again.The same rings true for men.If you're the kind of woman who takes over a conversation or shares everything from your childhood memories to your deepest secrets then he's isn't going to be compelled to call you.Instead of spilling your heart out to him it's important that you hold back some information, and keep him coming around for more.Also note that this isn't only for in-person conversations, but it applies to text messages, phone calls, online messaging, the works.Learn how to keep your man coming back for more, click here and watch this free video from relationship expert, Amy North.2. Be PositiveMore than just smiles, emotions in general are contagious. This means that if you're the pessimistic or self-pitying type, those feelings are going to affect your date, too.Even more importantly, men are attracted to happy, outgoing women. Just like you wouldn't want to date someone who was always down, nor do men. That's why it's so important to be positive and try to find the good in everyday situations.Once your man realizes that you're the one to keep him smiling he'll become hopelessly devoted to you.3. Be Hard To GetNow this one has been disputed over the years, but believe me, it works.Since men are hunters at heart, making him work for your love and attention will keep him chasing you. When this happens, he'll become addicted to you.To do so, it's important that you're not ""too available."" This means that you don't drop what you're doing to see him, and you set certain standards for yourself when it comes to making plans with him.For instance, if he calls and asks if you want to go for dinner that night, tell him that you're busy and suggest rescheduling for a day or two later. Even if you have no plans for that night, keeping him on his toes to see you will get him hooked.It's also important that you're not always the one to initiate contact with him. If you're doing all the texting, messaging, phoning, etc., it'll take away from his pursuit for you. Instead let him be the one to woo you.For more tips on how to make him chase you, watch this video: Click Here To Watch The Full VideoIf you found this article helpful, please SHARE it with your family and friends on Facebook!This Networking App Is Going To Completely Change Your LifeNetworking seems like the last priority while trying to balance a full time job, a social life, grocery shopping, and everything in between.Luckily, there is an easy way to make meaningful connections that doesn't require schlepping to events and dead-end meetups.If you're part of an entrepreneur community than you may have already heard of Shapr , the networking app that's taken off with almost 900,000 professionals using it daily.The app facilitates a more efficient, do-it-from-anywhere networking experience, that takes less than two minutes a day.Using Shapr, you pick up to ten self-selected interests such as #yoga or #marketing to get started.

But what does the scientific community have to say about the equation of attractiveness?Is beauty really only in the eye of the beholder? Or are there certain features that steal the show when a man looks at a woman?According to research, men are attracted to certain features over others and this is mostly due to a subconscious, animalistic instinct. Traits associated with procreation, sensuality, and health are key players in the art of seduction.So what are the traits that men secretly find attractive in women?1. Hourglass figureAn hourglass refers to a hip to waist ratio where thick hips are in! Women often think men like skinny, but body shape attractiveness on an instinctual level has more to do with how its perceived in relation to reproductivity.Big hips and curved lower backs relate to a woman's ability to conceive. Women often think men like skinny, but men are most often attracted to a voluptuous figure, which includes wide, child-bearing hips.A small waist and curvaceous hip region signals youth and fertility. So don't disguise your shape. If you've got hips like Shakira, rock them!Learn how to keep your partner coming back for more, click here and watch this free video from relationship expert, Amy North.2. Physical symmetry​In ancient Egypt, physical symmetry was the ultimate sign of the perfect beauty. This is perhaps due to its associations with a strong and healthy bloodline.Whether they know it or not, men are often motivated by an instinctual drive to procreate. When set side by side, a face that is altered to be more symmetrical is perceived as more beautiful.Don't worry if you don't have a perfectly symmetrical face; there are plenty of makeup tutorials to even out asymmetrical features. Besides, no one's face is perfectly symmetrical.3. Gorgeous, long tressesIn a 2003 study published in Human Nature, researchers studied the effect of six different hairstyles including: the top bun, disheveled, unkempt, short, medium-length, and long.The study found that long to medium length hair was perceived not only as more attractive, but a sign of health and longevity.Short hairstyles tend to seem more manly and updos have a feeling of being more uptight. A long luscious flow is inherently sexy. Ditch the hassle of complicated updos or fishtail braids, let your hair down before you go out.4. The color redForget the little black dress! When it comes to attracting the male gaze, it's all about the color red.According to a 2008 study conducted by researchers at the University of Rochester, the color red is highly seductive when it comes to the attraction of men to women.The study showed that men chose a woman in red over any other color. Think of the colors of Valentine or the red light district, red is the color of seduction and has even been found to be an aphrodisiac.5. Pheromone smellWhen people refer to having good chemistry with someone, they are referring to smell. According to an article in Smithsonian magazine, scent can be altered by mood and other biological changes.The smell of a women's tears, for instance, can lower a man's arousal and testosterone levels. Scent is a natural attractor.Fragrance companies have been searching for a magical love potion for years, but the chemical composition for inducing love remains a failed pursuit.There is no one smell that seduces them all. Rather, certain smells attract certain males. Even more interesting, one's smell can send a message of sexual preference or signal when a woman is having a menstrual cycle.Perhaps the old saying ""love at first sight"" should be changed to ""love at first smell.""For more tips on how to keep your relationship alive, watch this video: Click Here To Watch The Full Video6. Captivating eyesIt's no secret that eyes are the windows to the soul. But when it comes to attraction, men really can't help but be enchanted by beautiful eyes.Almond shaped eyes are uniquely effective for drawing the attention of a man, but color plays a huge role as well. Bright, light shades of any color will draw a man like a hummingbird to sugar.There is more to the eye than just overall shape and color. When studied for attractiveness, eyes with curvy slopes and dark eyelashes set further apart were perceived as more appealing.While closely oriented eyes with droopy eyelids would be seen as less attractive.7. Tone of voiceAccording to an article in Psychology Today, men perceive women with a higher pitched voice as more attractive.Vocal attractiveness has also been found to be a direct indicator of how one's overall physical attractiveness is perceived.Women tend to deepen their voices and slow their speech around men in order to induce sexiness, but men actually prefer the higher, lighter tones.Vocal attractiveness also effects perception of personality. A pleasing voice is associated with a pleasing personality. The great thing about this trait is you can train your voice to be sexier.8. Plump, kissable lipsA perfect pout is irresistible to men. In a study by Manchester University , lips were found to be the most attractive part of a woman's body.Coated in red lipstick, men stared at a woman's mouth for an average of seven seconds; whereas the eyes or hair held his attention for less than one second.Thin lips, when donning red lipstick, increased their attractiveness by forty percent.Lips are seen as the most sensual part of a woman's body according to this research and coupled with the color red, it's no wonder men are absolutely captivated by red lips.The point is, if you want to make an impact, quit fussing with your hair and find the perfect shade to make your lips pop.Are you looking for love but not sure how to find it?

It could be that he or she is an empath.An empath hones a magnetism that instantly draws people toward them. It's not that they are sympathetic--it's more.An empath has the ability to not only feel another's pain, but absorb it, too.Here are 16 signs you are in the company of an Empath:1. They are often described as ""too sensitive"" or even mushy.This seems to imply that feeling is a bad thing, but being sensitive is an indication that you are still connected to the heart of the human experience.In a world growing continuously more desensitized, we are need of sensitivity. So, if someone tells you this, take it as a compliment. Being sensitive is a gift.Want to learn more about empaths? Check out this article: Every Empath Will Try To Hide These 10 Things From You2. They really, really hate being lied to.One of the key traits of an empath is being able to sniff out a lie.Because empaths hone such deep understanding toward human nature, they see lying as absolutely unnecessary. Lying will strike an empath right in the heart.3. They feel directly impacted by negative images.Empaths are mostly unable to read or view negative images and forget about them. They soon want to avoid the news or stories of heartbreak at all costs.4. Crowds overwhelm them.One of the unusual traits of an empath is their amphibious nature—they are both introverts and extroverts.However, while they absorb energy from a crowd, their sensitivity toward the ebb of flow of emotions will leave them exhausted after being around so many people.5. They find peace and happiness in helping others.Your true sense of happiness occurs when you feel that you are being in some way a service for another human.When someone needs someone, an empath is the person who will drop what he or she is doing and rush to help. When push comes to shove, an empath will be there.6. They think twice before pouring another cup of coffee or taking medicine.Empaths react differently to stimulants like caffeine, which tends to increase anxiety or agitation. Similarly, empaths will often react adversely to medications, and thus, avoid using synthetic solutions.7. They can’t be anyone but themselves.In other words, empaths are raw and painstakingly honest. They see no reason to put on a false front. Empaths embrace who they are—the good and the bad.They accept the bad as a work in progress. Because of such deep self-insight, empaths epitomize true friendship.8. They know what others are going through and experience it with them.Empaths are deeply connected to those who they care about, and they care about everyone. So, when someone is going through a rough patch in life—from a break-up to major dental work—empaths experience the pain too.9. They have an incredible bond with animals.Pets don't exist to empaths, as ""pet"" implies ownership. Rather, for the empath, animals are family.Places like pet stores and zoos will deeply disturb the empath because animals should be free and not shoved in cages to be gawked at.10. They are used to being emotionally and physically exhausted.Carrying the weight of others' emotions and pain, joy and happiness takes a toll on the empath.For the lucky empaths, knowing how to process and let go of the daily weight will be an accomplishment, though, still exhausting.For other empaths, learning to let go will take time and can sometimes lead to utter debilitation.11. They have a talent for advice.Empaths know how to listen, and they listen to every word you say. They put themselves in your shoes.For this reason, it would be unwise to discard the advice of an empath. Nothing they say is wasted breath. They are invested in your success and well-being.12. They are easily distracted.Sound familiar? Empaths' sensitivity causes them to notice the small things many people look past.They will notice the girl standing alone in the corner, the couple arguing at a nearby table, the sad look in a child's eyes—you get the idea.It would be very hard for an empath to get much done working at a coffee shop.13. They have no room in their life for a narcissist.An empath will flee at the sign of a narcissist. This is perhaps the one trait they will not invest in trying to help. They know it's a losing pursuit.As you can imagine, empaths attract narcissists and they share a very unique bond.We've explained this toxic relationship in a previous article, which you can read here: The Brutal Truth Behind The Toxic Relationship Between A Narcissist And An Empath14. They are hyper sensitive to sound.Empaths operate on a unique frequency, which is most likely why certain pitches, buzzes, and bangs can easily disrupt them.For this reason, empaths will avoid places where loud noise is constantly present. Likewise, pleasing sounds are felt just as intensely, but obviously much more welcomed.15. They are an above-average listener.Be assured, when you are in the presence of an empath, they will not have eyes that glaze over while spoken to, they listen—even to strangers or passers-by on the streets.Even more, empaths are able to listen without judging, so you can trust your words will not be wasted breath.16. They have a strange effect on electronics.Say what? It's true. Empaths have the uncanny ability to cause disruption in electrical currents. It's not unusual for an empath to experience strange glitches on the computer, a phone that dies too quickly, or the like.If it has an electrical current, empaths will surely experience some strange phenomena.If you find that you know an empath, consider yourself lucky!Likewise, the next time someone tells you that you are too sensitive or the lights flicker when you enter a room, you can be comforted in knowing that you hone an incredible understanding of the human heart and the human condition.Embrace this beautiful gift.CATS – Protect You And Your Home From Ghosts And Negative SpiritsDid You Know These Secret Powers of Cats?Cats may be famous on the internet for being funny and adorable, but there may be a deeper reason why we feel an inordinate fondness for felines.What if cats serve not only as objects of our affection, but also as protectors of our home?Guard dogs may be effective at keeping away unwanted intruders, but cats fulfill a far more important purpose of protecting the home from a different kind of uninvited houseguest.Cats and Negative EnergyRecall a time when you noticed your cat staring tensely towards a seemingly empty space or spending a suspicious amount of time around one particular spot in the house.It's likely that your cat is sensitive to a concentrated amount of negative energy and is attempting to protect you and your home from possible infiltration by evil spirits and ghosts.This is because cats bear a uniquely powerful aura, also known as an astral force, that works to repel negative energy.It is possible that this negative energy remains left over from some traumatic experience in the past before you came to live in the home, or the entity could come from outside the home and try to force its way in.The cat serves as a valuable line of defense for you and your loved ones by attempting to trap the evil spirit in its powerful energy field and lead it out of the house.Be sure not to disturb your cat if you notice that it is purposefully wandering around your house.Cats are skilled at discerning the intentions of astral entities and could be following some source of negative energy in the attempt to ambush it and remove it from your immediate environment if it senses a threatening aura.Russians used to allow a cat to enter a house first before they moved in due to its extraordinarily strong aura.In that way, the cat could take immediate action in warding away any excess negative energy left behind from previous inhabitants while also providing powerful positive energy if the house was new or had merely neutral energy.Ways to Remove Heavy Negative EnergyThere are ways that you can assist your cat in removing evil spirits and ghosts from your home.In the case that your cat takes interest in a certain spot in the house, you can read a prayer and perform a cleansing ritual of your choice.Alternatively, you can burn some White Sage at the spot to eliminate any unwanted energy, as the smoke will attach itself to heavy negative energy and convert it back into light energy.You can also simply rub fresh White Sage leaves between your thumbs and forefingers, as this can also be effective way to release the plant's cleansing energy.You can notice later if your cat continues to return to that spot with any regularity or if the cleansing ritual succeeded in burning away the negative energy.Protection from Curses and Evil EyesCats also work to protect you and the house from any curses or evil eyes.Like talismans and necklaces worn in many cultures around the world to protect the wearer from evil eyes, you must be holding your cat for it to be effective in shielding you from the malevolent thoughts of others.The correct way to hold your cat to enjoy the full power of its force field is to use your left hand to gently stroke its neck while simultaneously using your right hand to stroke across its tail.This enables you to keep in full contact with the cat and harness the maximum amount of available protective energy.Cats can also fulfill an important function for their masters through their healing powers.If you are suffering from serious emotional stress, simply lying down and stroking your cat can go a long way in releasing you from the burden of the stress.Protection from Geopathogenic ZonesCats can provide energy protection if you happen to have the misfortune of living in a Geopathogenic Zone.Geopathogenic Zones are so named because they are locations that adversely affect the health of a person living in them for extended periods of time.In such locations, there is a dense and steady flow of negative energy for cats to combat.The Specialties of Cats of Different ColorsAll cats provide the protective healing energies described above, although there is some variation between the benefits they may bestow upon their owners.Read the following description of the specialties of each type of cat and, if in the need of a particular kind of benefit or healing energy, choose the one most suitable for your situation.Black CatsThey provide the most comprehensive magical protection against occult powers and curses. These cats are most adept at nullifying powerful negative energy that may be dwelling inside a home.Calico CatsThey combine the benefits of black, white and red cats and provides your home with significant protection from harm. These three-colored cats are often associated with good luck and prosperity.Blue-Gray CatsThey exert calming influences of emotional stability and bring joy and love to the lives of their owners. The tranquil energy embodied in such cats is often associated with happiness and good luck.Colorpoint Siamese CatsThey are the most playful breed of cat and help bring fame and success to their owners, as well benefit them with a longer life.Two-Tone CatsThey carry with them energy that enhances wisdom and common sense.Tortoiseshell CatsThey specialize in their healing powers and benefit from clairvoyance. This color pattern usually only appears in female cats, giving them a pure energy.Golden CatsThey are often associated with ancient wisdom due to their status as objects to be revered in temples. They also embody solar energy and grace.Tabby CatsThey lighten the mood of an environment and provides a buzz of humor and entertainment.No matter which type of cat you choose, you can be sure to enjoy the benefits from its powerful aura and sensitivity to the presence of evil spirits.If you enjoyed this article, please SHARE it with your family and friends on Facebook!Featured15 Things Strong Women Always Do (But Never Talk About)Strong women are often categorized as being assertive and upfront about their wants and needs.However, women who are strong are very complex people who have a lot more going on than meets the eye.They may be interpreted as demanding or even bossy, but the truth is that strong women can also be very sensitive and thoughtful.If you have a strong woman in your life — or if you are one yourself — then you should consider yourself lucky.Here are some things you might want to know about strong women. Maybe you'll come to appreciate them even more.1. They have a tight circle of close friends.Strong women are better than most people at cutting people out of their lives.These may be people who are toxic and negative to be around, or they may just be people who don't click as well.As a result, they often have a smaller group of friends.

Why?A lot of reasons that we won't get into right now. Ladies, it's time for you to stop giving a f*ck about all this nonsense that you've been told you have to care about.It's time for you to start dancing to your own tune and doing things your way. Most of the stuff you're told you have to care about, you don't really have to care about.What makes life more enjoyable for strong women compared to the average person? They don't give a single f*ck about the little things.They know what really matters in life. They seize the day and live life with positivity and passion.Want to be a strong woman? Read our list of tips to learn how to stop worrying about the little things and make your life more fulfilling and successful.We're going to run through a list of things for you to stop giving a f*ck about. Some of it may be hard for you to hear. But hear it anyway.Stop giving a f*ck about your ex.This is a tough one. It's hard not to separate yourself emotionally from someone that you probably deeply loved at one point.But when the relationship is over, it's time to stop giving a f*ck about your ex. His or her problems, drama, financial woes, or whatever.Even if you decide to remain friends with your ex, that doesn't mean you have to carry the weight of their drama anymore. So cut the dead weight. Stop giving a f*ck about your ex.Stop giving a f*ck about fashion.Women's clothing is a complicated, ridiculous thing nine times out of ten.Kind of unrelated, but how insane is it that most women's' pants are made with smaller pockets to try to force you to buy purses? What a racket. But I digress.Ladies, it's time we stop giving a f*ck about the fashion choices of the day. Who cares? Honestly.Thrift store t-shirt, some jeans, and a cardigan and you're good pretty much most times of the year. You really don't have to overthink it.And honestly, don't feel like you have to wear makeup or anything. All natural is awesome.Hillary Clinton did the whole no makeup thing as Secretary of State and it was fine. You probably don't need to get dolled up for the grocery store.Stop giving a f*ck about “ladylike” etiquette.It's not the 1700s anymore.All this polite, lady-like demands that men try to hoist on you is over. You can fart. You can burp. You don't have to shave your pits and legs. You can wear pants or skirts or overalls or short shorts or nothing, it doesn't matter.The standards for etiquette thrust onto women is absolutely ridiculous. If men don't have to shave their legs and pits, you shouldn't have to either if you don't want to. It's not gross.If it was bad, why the hell does your body grow hair there? And if a guy doesn't wanna be with you because you've got hairy pits, wish him the best of luck on the dating market and move on.Stop giving a f*ck about your mistakes.Intrusive thoughts can be a real bastard. Have you ever been taking a shower and a memory of some massive mistake pops into your head and you can't let go of it?Stop giving a f*ck about it. Don't worry about your mistakes.If your mistakes weren't bad enough to continue haunting you, they probably aren't bad enough for you to be dwelling on them now.Don't get me wrong. This isn't me saying that you're great no matter what mistakes you've made.If you've made some big mistakes and you haven't bothered to learn from them and grow as a person, chances are you're not really that great of a person.Sorry. But if you've taken the time to learn and grow, stop giving a f*ck about old mistakes.Stop giving a f*ck about shady friends.Someone once told me ""you can't break up with your friends."" Says who?I've broken up with so many of my friends. You reach a point where, when you have a toxic friend, you just can't do it anymore.A friend who say things about you behind your back is not your friend. A friend who gets a new boyfriend and then never speaks to you again was not your friend - so don't just take them back when they're single again.A friend who cheats with your boyfriend is not your friend. Dump your shady friends. You'll thank me later.Stop giving a f*ck about fitting in.The whole world isn't high school. Stop giving a f*ck about fitting in.If you're reading this and you are in high school, same advice applies. Throughout this list you'll see a recurring meme: be who you are and let the real people in this world come to you.Don't pretend to be something you're not in order to make friends and attract people to you. Or think about it this way, if you're fake, you're going to attract fakes.If you're pretending to be something you aren't, you're only going to attract people who're pretending to be something they aren't too.And the real you comes out eventually, so even if your act brought in real people, they're not gonna like finding out that it was all an act all along. So cut the act with trying to fit in. It's pointless.Stop giving a f*ck about things you can’t control.There's this old contrived platitude that's like ""life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it"" and as much as it pains me to say it, it's true.The things that happen to you are largely outside of your control. Worrying about it is a misuse of your time and energy.Stop giving a f*ck about the things in your life that you control. Start giving a f*ck about how you react to it.It's hard to get yourself to a point where you're ready at just about any time for anything that can happen, but in this day and age, women especially have to be sharp and aware and prepared to take on anything.So stop worrying about it and start preparing for how you react to the things you can't control.Stop giving a f*ck about your status.Women shouldn't care about what status their accessories indicate. Hell, men can get in on this one too.Ladies and gentlemen alike, you don't have to prove your value through status symbols like rings, fancy cars, designer clothes, and special handbags. That stuff doesn't matter. It's not real.A Gucci purse is just a purse. Who cares? It's where you put your tampons and wallet and things. It is not that important. Don't show off your status. Show off what you know. Show off where you've been.The adventures you have. The people you've met. The experiences you've had. The person you are on the inside is far more interesting than any status symbol you might rock on the outside.And besides, it's a lot more fun to wear, drive, and do whatever you want than what other people think you should.Stop giving a f*ck about basic toxic relationshipsPeople can be such assholes. There's no getting around that in life.Just about every woman can tell you about a time when one of their female friends talked behind their back, did some shady stuff, and just wasn't a very good friend. These things happen.First of all, don't stoop to their level. That's what drama queens want you to do; help them create more drama. Cut them out.These women aren't your friends, and you cannot maintain your friendship with them by being just as terrible as they are.When you remove yourself from toxic people and dump your toxic, basic friends, not only do you free yourself from their influence, but you diminish their influence.And that's what these women want more than anything else. Leave them behind.Stop giving a f*ck about your image.I have known so many women, especially women in their 20s, who think they have to be something super specific in order to fit into the niche they want.I've known funny women who try to be some quirky, Zooey Deschanel knockoff and tough women who try to be Sarah Connor from the second Terminator film.Here's a novel idea: maybe just be the woman you are. It's the 21st century; you don't have to pretend to be a certain way in order to get validation in our society.Hell, you don't even need any kind of validation. Just be yourself. If anyone has a problem with it, forget them.It can be hard to find your way through life, especially when you're a young person, but don't try to be other women.Don't concern yourself with your image. Create your image. Lead the way.Stop giving a f*ck about what other people thinkYou are in charge of your own life. If you spend time worrying about the opinions of others, you could lose track of what makes you happy and what success means to you.Don't make any changes based on the judgments other people make about your lifestyle. The only time you should reconsider the way you live your life is if you feel unsatisfied yourself.Stop giving a f*ck about being right all the timeEveryone makes mistakes. It's a part of the human condition. The difference between a being strong woman and an average one is figuring out how to leverage what you learn moving forward.In fact, making mistakes is often the best way to learn something new and to improve. Owning and admitting when you are wrong is a sure sign that you are a strong woman.Stop giving a f*ck that you're single.Being alone when everyone around you seems to be coupled up can be frustrating and isolating. However, it doesn't mean you should settle for a less than fulfilling relationship.Take your time and don't settle. Focus on yourself first and make sure that anyone you choose to enter into a relationship respects and admires you like the strong woman you are.Stop giving a f*ck about expressing yourself in bed.You and your partner should be on the same page when it comes to what makes you happy in bed.Sometimes, your partner won't know what to do; in order to have the most fulfilling experience, it might mean that you have to take the lead—and that's okay.But don't be afraid to take charge of the situation to make sure you enjoy yourself and have the best experience! This is all about you.Stop not giving a f*ck about your health.There are a lot of people out there who seem to think that you have a responsibility to be happy in your skin no matter what, and it's the world's responsibility to embrace who you are.I personally think that's kinda BS. Self love is good but self awareness is important too. Especially if you're young, if you're making bad decisions with your health, stop.If you're drinking to excess every weekend, cut back. It takes a toll on your body, one that you won't appreciate later on.Same thing goes for smoking. Same thing goes for not exercising. Same thing goes for eating whatever. Same thing goes for being overweight. I'll say it. This blowback against ""fat shaming"" that's all the rage on Tumblr is idiotic.If you're fat, you shouldn't feel ashamed. But if you're crying about fat shaming because children stare and you need to buy two seats on a plane because of how large you are, you should be ashamed.Love yourself. Great. But know that being fat is unhealthy, and this whole ""no fat shaming"" thing is socially detrimental.I'll tell you what any well trained doctor would: if you're overweight because you eat too much, lose some weight.

Simpson: Buried Knife Found at O.J.'s EstateEXCLUSIVEA construction worker found a knife buried on the perimeter of the former O.J. Simpson estate ... and it's currently being tested by the LAPD in a top secret investigation ... law enforcement sources tell TMZ.The story is incredible. We're told a construction worker found the knife years ago -- we have heard several different stories, ranging from ""several years ago"" to 1998, when the house was demolished.The weapon is a folding buck knife.Our law enforcement sources say the construction worker took the knife to the street, where he saw an LAPD cop. He told the officer where he found the knife and the cop took it.Turns out the cop -- who worked in the traffic division -- was off duty at the time, working security for a movie shoot at a house across the street on Rockingham. Our sources say the officer took the knife home and kept it ... kept it for years. In late January of this year, after the cop retired from the LAPD, he contacted a friend who worked in LAPD's Robbery Homicide Division (RHD). The cop told the friend about the knife and said he was getting it framed to put on his wall. He wanted his friend to get the DR (Departmental Record) number for the Nicole Brown Simpson/Ronald Goldman murder case, which he planned on engraving in the frame.We're told the friend was indignant, and told his superiors. The brass was outraged and demanded that the retired cop turn the knife over, which he did.Our sources say the knife is currently being tested for hair and fingerprints. It will be moved to the Serology Unit next week, where it will be tested for DNA and other biological evidence. One source familiar with the investigation tells us, cops who eyeballed the knife think it could have blood residue on it, but it's hard to know without testing because it's extremely rusted and stained.The investigation is top secret. It's been logged into the LAPD's computer system outside the official case file to maintain security. Our sources say, since O.J. was found not guilty, it's still an open case. That means cops can continue investigating, but O.J. cannot be prosecuted again -- double jeopardy."

The bill does this by amending the Vital Records Act. You may be shocked to hear that HB6064 , filed last week, is being sponsored by two white Republican men: Rep. John D. Cavaletto of Salem (which is a couple hours outside St. Louis), and Keith Wheeler , who represents the western 'burbs.Here's a snippet from the proposed legislation:“Provides that if the unmarried mother cannot or refuses to name the child's father, either a father must be conclusively established by DNA evidence or, within 30 days after birth, another family member who will financially provide for the child must be named, in court, on the birth certificate. Provides that absent DNA evidence or a family member's name, a birth certificate will not be issued and the mother will be ineligible for financial aid from the State for support of the child.”In other words, despite this being the year 2016, some lawmakers feel a single mother has to prove she’s somehow deserving of state aid.If this sounds slightly familiar, it may be because it echoes some racist and classist remarks by another republican legislator , State Rep. Jeanne Ives. In September of last year, there was a floor debate in the House that ultimately killed a bill that would’ve restored subsidies lost due to the budget impasse. During this debate, Ives said:""You need to have verifiable need. You better know who the daddy is and whether or not he can afford that child and whether or not the taxpayers should be funding that or if there's actual child support he can provide.”While it’s entirely possible the legislation may never make it out of the rules committee, and would more than likely die due to the Democratic supermajority in the House, it’s still troublesome. “This is a punitive and outrageous bill that would have a hugely negative impact on those most likely in need of safety net programs and support,” said Ed Yohnka of the Illinois American Civil Liberties Union.We reached out to co-Sponsor Rep. Keith Wheeler, who did not return a request for comment.Contact the author of this article or email tips@chicagoist.com with further questions, comments or tips."

Email: firstnamelastname (at) gmail.Oct 17, 2013one of many rusting, decommissioned russian submarines. bellona photoRussia Is Finally Slicing Up Its Abandoned, Radioactive SubmarinesNuclear contamination has been a persistent source of danger along Russia’s Arctic coastThe archetypal image of Eastern European nuclear contamination is the radioactive wilderness of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and the abandoned city of Pripyat . But more than 1,000 miles to the north, the Russians have spent years struggling to dispose of hundreds of nuclear reactors left over from decaying, geriatric Soviet nuke subs.It’s a dangerous, vexing problem. The Soviet Union built more than 260 nuclear-powered ships during the Cold War, most of them submarines with the occasional surface ship and even icebreaker. But Russia decommissioned more than half of them during the 1980s and 1990s as the economy imploded and Moscow’s military budget collapsed.The rusting, contaminated remnants of these ships — the large reactor containers are a particular source of pollution — sit floating along Russia’s Arctic coast, with few places to put them.At least that was the case for most of the post-USSR era. A growing facility at Saida Bay next to the Barents Sea is taking on an increasing share of the storage for all the contaminated material. The facility, one of the largest for nuclear naval waste in Russia, has been the recipient of millions of dollars in international funding in recent years.It’s not glamorous. The facility stores nuclear containers on a piece of dredged and excavated former swampland near the Norwegian border. It’s topped with a large concrete slab and lined with walls and barbed wire. Officially titled Regional Centre for Radioactive Waste Conditioning and Long Term Storage, the facility is expected to begin disassembling large amounts of radioactive waste by the fall of 2014 once a neighboring building with the necessary equipment is finished.“It will allow us forget about the problems of safe storage of reactor units from nuclear submarines, block packages of nuclear icebreakers and service ships, and about radioactive waste in the Murmansk region for many decades ,” Andrey Zolotkov, the director of St. Petersburg-based environmental group Bellona, told the Barents Observer.Nuclear waste storage at Saida Bay, Murmansk Oblast, Russia. Bellona PhotoFifty-eight containers are already at the site, weighing up to 1,600 tons each. The Observer reported it should be able to take on around 130 by this time next year. Many of the nuclear containers that store their reactors are so badly contaminated that it will be a century before they’re safe enough to remove.Even with a growing disposal site, it’s not easy disposing of entire contaminated ships that are still floating out in the water.One of the more notorious examples is the Lepse, a 79-year-old decaying nuclear service vessel that started its life as a cargo ship but spent much of the Cold War handling spent nuclear fuel assemblies and dumping the material in the ocean. It became so contaminated the ship was abandoned outside Murmansk in 1988, still filled with hundreds of tons of radioactive waste. It wasn't moved out of the port — destination being a scrapyard further up the coast — until last month .But it’s still not been scrapped and had its radioactive waste removed. The dry dock at Nerpa Shipyard where Lepse is to be cut apart is currently occupied by the remains of Soviet submarine K-3 Leninsky Komsomol, the first Soviet nuclear submarine ever built.That ship is limbo, with Moscow torn between spending around $15 million to preserve it or $1.5 million to scrap it. “Officially, [Leninsky Komsomol] belongs to the Ministry of Defense, whose decision and financial responsibility it is to give the sub some historical fanfare or just let it be crushed into safety pins ,” wrote Anna Kireeva, an environmental writer with Bellona. The ministry is still undecided.Where Lepse comes, more radioactive ships will follow. Two more nuclear service vessels, the Volodarsky and Lotta, are next in line at the scrap heap after the Lepse.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/wine-makes-you-skinny/	"drinking wine before bed ""officially makes you skinny."" see example( s )"	Mostly False	['daily mail', ' harvard', ' misconstrued research', ' weight loss', ' wine']	http://blog.lastbottlewines.com/	http://blog.lastbottlewines.com/health/drink-wine-lose-weight/	2016/02/19	September 30, 2016Good news! Drinking wine before bedtime can help you lose weight.How’s that New Year’s resolution to lose weight working out for you? Maybe you shouldn’t have participated in a “dry January” because in addition to improving your sex life, helping your heart , extending your life , and making your daughter’s thousandth viewing of Frozen more bearable, wine might also help you shed excess pounds.Red wine can help reduce the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and alzheimers.Drowning bad habitsA quick look at the Last Bottle crew confirms just how integral wine is to sculpting a killer beach body, but since we don’t have any recent photos you’ll just have to trust us. And besides, other people have reported similar effects.An article in the Daily Mail profiled four women who claim that drinking wine helps keep their weight down and curb bad eating habits. One of them was Linda Monk, a 47-year-old woman who says she lost six pounds in three weeks. She credits using wine as a “bedtime snack” to satiate cravings for “sweets, biscuits, and chocolate”.But doesn’t a glass of wine have the same calories as a slice of cake?While people fret over the calories in a glass of wine, it’s not so bad when compared to other choices.Turns out wine isn’t such a bad choice compared to other alcoholic drinks (Via winefolly.com/update/carbs-in-wine)Studies on top of studiesMaybe you don’t fully subscribe to some anecdotes from British housewives and you’re thinking these winos will come up with anything to justify their habits. However, there’s plenty of legit science supporting these claims.A Washington State University study pins resveratrol as the compound responsible for most of the reported benefits. Scientists gave mice amounts of resveratrol equivalent to humans consuming 12 ounces of fruit per day. They found that despite a high fat diet, the mice gained 40% less weight than animals not fed resveratrol.“Drinking two medium glasses of wine a day or more gave the women an incredible 70 per cent reduction in obesity risk.”Professor Min Du, from Washington State Univesity, US, said: “Polyphenols in fruit, including resveratrol, increase gene expression that enhances the oxidation of dietary fats so the body won’t be overloaded. They convert white fat into beige fat which burns lipids (fats) off as heat, helping to keep the body in balance and prevent obesity and metabolic dysfunction. We are using resveratrol as a representative for all the polyphenols.”In layman’s terms, resveratrol prevents fat cells from getting fatter.Now your inner skeptic is thinking, “sure, another so-called study supporting some new diet fad…”. We get it. But this wasn’t some fly by night study. It was very comprehensive by all accounts, taking place over 13 years and involving 20,000 participants .Ellagic acidResveratrol often takes credit for positive effects, but another important compound is ellagic acid, which slows the growth of fat cells. It’s found in any oak-aged wines as “ellagitannin” and the amount of elagitannin increases with each year of oak aging.Still, the hallmark of a valid hypothesis is others who get the same results, and in this case we have plenty of supporting evidence.A six-year study of 43,500 people by the University of Denmark concluded infrequent drinkers ended up with the biggest waistlines, daily drinkers had the smallest.Harvard University researchers tracked the weight & drinking habits of almost 20,000 women over 13 years. Of the 9,000 that put on significant weight, none were drinkers. Surprisingly, the heaviest drinkers were the skinniest!An eight-year study of 49,300 women by University College Medical School, London found women who drank below 30 grams a day (around two medium glasses of wine) were up to 24 per cent less likely to put on weight than non-drinkers.A ten-year study of 7,230 people by the U.S. National Center for Disease Control found drinkers gained less weight than non-drinkers. Alcohol intake did not increase the risk of obesityA 2014 study in The Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry found rats that drank red wine gained less weight than ones that drank water. It turns out red wine’s ellargic acids may slow the growth of fat cells.The psychological effectScientists are good at attributing most of the benefits to fancy sounding organic compounds, but we think there’s something to be said of our own willpower. In The Power of Habit, Charles Duhigg explains how our self-control decreases as the day goes on, making it harder to resist that late night snack. The trick is to identify what triggers the habit, and substitute a less harmful replacement that still rewards the pleasure center in your brain. In this case, they trade sweets for a glass of wine, and since wine contains small amounts of sugar, it gives your brain that reward.So go forth and pour a glass or two, but be careful! Going from a chocoholic to an alcoholic won’t do you much good. In moderation however, you can include regular wine consumption as part of your health routine.References	
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/israel-bans-heinz-ketchup/	israel has banned the sale of heinz brand ketchup, partially due to the product's use of gmo-derived ingredients. see example( s )	Mostly False	['gmos', ' heinz', ' israel']	http://www.healthandhomeremedies.com/	http://www.healthandhomeremedies.com/heinz-ketchup-banned-and-why-you-should-avoid-it/	2016/02/18	Israel has recently banned Heinz Ketchup from the country and they say it’s because it doesn’t have high enough amount of tomatoes in it. But there are a couple of more reasons why it was banned. We know it’s delicious but for your own sake stop consuming Heinz ketchup for good. In recent years people have started turning away from processed food and focusing more on healthy living and eating organic, raw food. This is a result of high toxins and chemical levels in processed food which is extremely unhealthy for our organism. People have started avoiding processed food but they are unaware that the condiments they still use are considered processed and extremely unhealthy too. Ketchup is one of these unhealthy foods we have forgotten to rule out from our diet. Next time you think about eating ketchup turn the bottle and read the label, you’ll be surprised of its contents. 1. It contains high fructose corn syrupHeinz is loaded with high fructose corn syrup which is extremely unhealthy. The corn syrup is made of GMO corn and this is what makes it so dangerous. It can cause a rapid increase in your blood sugar levels and damage your liver. If you are a regular user of high fructose corn syrup it can lead to an increased risk of diabetes, heart disease and obesity. If you’re still not convinced, we’ll share the results of a recent study about high fructose corn syrup which revealed that it’s loaded with mercury – a toxic heavy metal! Doctors are the first to advise you against eating foods which contain this hidden toxin! 2. It contains distilled vinegar and sugarAnother fact about Heinz ketchup which you probably didn’t know is that it contains distilled vinegar and sugar, which is another reason why you should ban in from your meals. Just one tablespoon of this ketchup contains 4 grams of sugar, and by adding it to your meals you’re adding sugars without even knowing it. Just like corn syrup, distilled vinegar derives from GMO corn. During growth GMO corn is treated with chemicals and pesticides and they end up on your plate through the ketchup. Consuming distilled vinegar and sugar which have GMO background has no benefits and is extremely dangerous for your health. It’s a fact that excessive sugar consumption without fibers or other beneficial ingredients can lead to decreased blood sugar levels and live and pancreas damages. 3. It has no nutritional valueThe third reason why you should stop using Heinz ketchup as a condiment is that there are no beneficial nutrients in it. It doesn’t have fibers, proteins or other nutritive ingredients and the unnoticeable amount of tomato it contains has just slight traces of lycopene. All that Heinz ketchup contains is sugar, GMOs and chemicals and has no benefit for your organism whatsoever. It’s not just the ketchup, we are constantly using empty condiments which have no nutritional value but only harm our health. If you truly want to live a healthy life and have a healthy body you need to buy GMO free and organic products. Israel has recently banned Heinz Ketchup from the country and they say it’s because it doesn’t have high enough amount of tomatoes in it. But there are a couple of more reasons why it was banned.

Watch below as Trump talks to me about what God means to him. He calls God, “the ultimate” and, “there’s nothing like God.”MANDATORY COURTESY: CBN NEWS/THE BRODY FILEDavid Brody: “Who is God to you? What are some of your thoughts on this? Clearly, you’re a smart man, you’re a smart businessman, you’ve contemplated this before or have you contemplate this?”Donald Trump: “Well I say God is the ultimate. You know you look at this? Here we are on the Pacific Ocean. How did I ever own this? I bought it fifteen years ago. I made one of the great deals they say ever. I have no more mortgage on it as I will certify and represent to you. And I was able to buy this and make a great deal. That’s what I want to do for the country. Make great deals. We have to, we have to bring it back, but God is the ultimate. I mean God created this (points to his golf course and nature surrounding it), and here’s the Pacific Ocean right behind us. So nobody, no thing, no there’s nothing like God.”Clearly, Huckabee, Carson and Cruz can give you a detailed biblically thorough answer when asked this same question. Trump hasn’t been “versed” (pun intended) in the evangelical Christian vernacular throughout his life so he’s going to speak in more generalities. The question evangelical voters are going to have to decide on is whether they are comfortable enough with Trump’s faith and the way he expresses it or are they looking for something deeper in a candidate from a faith perspective? Trump has plenty of attributes in his corner (strength, deal making, success as a businessman and lack of political correctness) that evangelicals like (along with many other voters). I think there will be certain evangelicals that will simply feel more comfortable with a candidate who has shown to evangelicals that he’s been there on the issues and is comfortable speaking about Judeo-Christian principles. But Trump appeals to the, “I’m Sick and Tired” evangelical voter who may be willing to vote for Trump despite not looking like an evangelical heavyweight. There are so many “Sick and Tired” evangelicals out there who want someone to fight HARD for them. Trump may not be the perfect cookie cutter candidate for them but his bravado and pattern of success has them seriously thinking about it.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/marine-attack-blm-claim/	marine vet christopher marquez was assaulted at a washington, d.c., mcdonald's retaurant by black lives matter activists. see example( s )	Mixture	"['black lives matter', ' christopher marquez', ' daily caller', "" mcdonald's""]"	http://dailycaller.com/	http://dailycaller.com/2016/02/15/marine-allegedly-assaulted-mid-burger-at-mcdonalds-as-gang-yelled-do-you-believe-black-lives-matter/	2016/02/17	 TOPA former Marine became the target of an alleged assault in a McDonald’s Friday night, as a crowd of youths cornered him and demanded he answer the question, “do you believe black lives matter?” Before knocking him unconscious and robbing him.Christopher Marquez, a veteran of Iraq and recipient of the Bronze Star for valor, said he was dining at a McDonald’s in northwest D.C. when a group of black teenagers came up to him and allegedly began harassing him about the black lives matter movement. Marquez ignored them which prompted calls and shouts that he was a racist.Marquez left the establishment after eating, but allegedly sustained a sudden blow to the back of his head outside the McDonald’s, which knocked him unconscious. When he woke up, his pants were ripped and wallet gone, which contained $400 in cash, three credit cards, his VA medical card, school identification, metro card and driver’s license.“I remember this group of teens harassing me while I was eating, they surrounded my table and kept on asking me ‘Do you believe black lives matter,'” Marquez told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “Then they started calling me a racist. I can’t recall if they were saying anything else to me at this moment because the blow to my head really screwed up my memory.”DeAnthony Mason, manager of the McDonald’s, reviewed security footage and told Marquez in a phone call Saturday that when he left the restaurant a teen with a white shirt struck him on the side of the head, knocking him unconscious. The other teens then converged on his incapacitated body, taking his belongings. The head blow Marquez sustained left his memory dazed, but Mason’s review of security footage helped him piece together what occurred.Upon regaining consciousness, Marquez found a cab driver willing to drive him to his apartment across from American University, where he attends school. Workers in the lobby called the police on his behalf, who took him to George Washington Hospital where he was evaluated for several hours. Medical documents obtained by TheDCNF show Marquez was treated for head trauma and an eye contusion.Credit card transactions reviewed by TheDCNF reveal that the assailants charged over $115 on his various credit cards at a liquor store, Five Guys and Walmart. Mason, the McDonald’s store manager told Marquez that police have been looking for the group of teens for a previous incident.“I believe this was a hate crime and I was targeted because of my skin color,” Marquez told TheDCNF. “Too many of these types of attacks have been happening against white people by members of the black community and the majority of the main stream media refuses to report on it.”Marquez served eight years active duty in the Marines between 2003 and 2011 in Iraq and Afghanistan as a Rifleman and Scout Sniper. He received the Bronze Star for valor during his first deployment after he carried the body of his slain team leader from combat following an ambush during the Battle of Fallujah.“When I was in the Marine Corps, I served with people from many different backgrounds, ethnicities, religions, and races,” Marquez told TheDCNF. “Like all Marines, I fought for the freedom of all Americans and not just one particular group.”Should Democrats Denounce This Black Lives Matter Activist? 	
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/student-loan-arrest/	u.s. marshals are arresting people who have not paid their student loans. see example( s )	Mixture	['crime', ' loan arrest', ' marshals', ' student loan', ' us marshals']	http://money.cnn.com/	http://money.cnn.com/2016/02/16/pf/college/arrested-student-loan-marshals/index.html	2016/02/17	"Man arrested by U.S. Marshals for unpaid student loanby Katie Lobosco @KatieLobosco February 17, 2016: 4:31 PM ETA Texas man was arrested by U.S. Marshals last week for not paying his $1,500 federal student loan -- for 29 years.Paul Aker was arrested at his home and later brought before a judge to sign a payment plan for a loan he said he borrowed in 1987.""I was unaware of any outstanding debt,"" Aker told CNNMoney on Tuesday. ""I paid two other student loans and thought I had consolidated everything and paid it all off.""The U.S. Marshals Service made several attempts to serve Aker with a court order requesting that he appear in federal court and searched numerous known addresses, the agency said in a statement. The Marshals Service said it spoke with him by phone in 2012 requesting he appear in court, but he refused.Aker told CNNMoney that he does not remember having that conversation, and said that he hasn't received any notification about the outstanding loan in a long time.A judge issued a warrant for his arrest in December of 2012 after he failed to appear in court, the Marshals Service said.Related: The secret world of government debt collectionOn Friday, Aker was approached by two Marshals outside of his home when he went to check his mail. Things quickly escalated when they attempted to arrest him.""I went inside to get my gun because I didn't know who these guys were,"" he told CNNMoney.The two Marshals requested backup after Aker said that he was armed. After about two hours, he put the gun down and went outside, where he was arrested without further incident, the Marshals Service said.""I saw some local police officers outside and thought if they're here, this must be real,"" Aker said.The original loan was for $1,500, and with interest it now amounts to about $5,700. He said he agreed before a judge on Friday to start paying in installments of $200 a month immediately.""I'm still shaken,"" Aker said. ""Why send seven guys with guns about a student loan?""It is not uncommon for U.S. Marshals to serve summonses to people who fail to appear in court regarding outstanding federal student loans. But a warrant is only issued after someone skips a court appearance.Last year, such warrants were issued for 25 people in the Houston area, the Marshals Service said. Seven were arrested while the others came to court on their own to resolve the matter.""Our goal is not to arrest people regarding this issue, but to give them a chance to comply with the court order and resolve their debt,"" a Marshals spokeswoman said.Former students get many chances to start repaying a federal loan before U.S. Marshals knock on the door.Here's what typically happens after someone misses a payment:After 90 days, a loan becomes delinquent, and possibly damages the borrower's credit score.But it's not considered to be in default until 9 months go by without payment. By this point, the borrower should have heard from the lender several times. But if the borrower still doesn't pay, a collection agency steps in, which will also probably contact the former student.The borrower's wages can be garnished and the government can withhold a tax refund.The collection agency can then sue the borrower, though it doesn't have the authority to arrest them. But if the debt is still ignored and the person fails to appear in court, then a judge could issue a warrant for arrest. That's where the U.S. Marshals could come in.At this point, a borrower will owe a lot more than the principal as interest, late fees, and collection fees add up.At the end of 2014, there were 43.3 million Americans with student loans who owe a total of $1.3 trillion. About 11% are in default, which means they failed to pay for more than 9 months, according to the New York Federal Reserve. About 1,500 people in the Houston area have defaulted on federal student loans, according the the Marshals Service.Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that warrants for 1,500 people in the Houston area had been issued because they failed to appear in court for a hearing regarding unpaid student loans.

""This is meant to be temporary assistance, not a way of life. Many major employers and small businesses require applicants to pass a drug test, this bill will ensure that welfare recipients are job-ready. "" ""If a welfare recipient has the money to buy drugs then they have the money to buy food. The federal government should not be enabling people to fund their drug addiction at taxpayer expense. “This bill provides states with the ability to identify those who are gaming the system as well as those who are struggling with addiction. For those struggling, it provides funds to assist states in providing drug treatment. “The goal is not only to break welfare recipients dependence on government programs but also on their addiction to drugs. “SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, is used by 46 million Americans. The number of Americans on the program has doubled during the last seven years. With this large number of people on the program, it’s crucial that states have the ability to protect the integrity and purpose of the program.” In Washington Congressman Aderholt serves as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies for the powerful House Appropriations Committee; he is also a member of the Committee’s Defense Subcommittee, the Committee’s Commerce, Justice, and Science Subcommittee, and the Helsinki Commission.For more information about Aderholt’s work in Congress visit: www.aderholt.house.gov .###"

The legal definition and status of conscientious objection has varied over the years and from nation to nation. Religious beliefs were a starting point in many nations for legally granting conscientious objection status. Acceptable grounds for granting conscientious objector status have broadened in many countries.In 1971 a United States Supreme Court decision broadenedU.S.rules beyond religious belief but denied the inclusion of objections to specific wars as grounds for conscientious objection. Some desiring to include the objection to specific wars distinguish between wars of offensive aggression and defensive wars while others contend that religious, moral or ethical opposition to war need not be absolute or consistent but may depend on circumstance or political conviction. Currently, the U.S. Selective Service System states, ""Beliefs which qualify a registrant for conscientious objector status may be religious in nature, but don't have to be. Beliefs may be moral or ethical; however, a man's reasons for not wanting to participate in a war must not be based on politics, expediency, or self-interest. In general, the man's lifestyle prior to making his claim must reflect his current claims. In the US, this applies to primary claims, that is, those filed on initial SSS registration. On the other hand, those who apply after either having registered without filing, and/or having attempted or effected a deferral, are specifically required to demonstrate a discrete and documented change in belief, including a precipitant, that converted a non-CO to a CO. The male reference is due to the current ""male only"" basis for conscription in theUnited StatesCOs willing to perform non-combatant military functions are classed 1-A-O by theUS; those unwilling to serve at all are 1-O.Conscientious objection and doing civilian service has, in many countries, evolved into a veritable institution. Today inGermany, civil servants who are fulfilling their service in the nursing or social domain bear a huge part of the respective workload. It is believed that abolishing the draftand with that, the compulsory civil service for objectorswould plunge hospitals and nursing homes into severe trouble.Religious motivesThe reasons for refusing to serve are varied. Many conscientious objectors are so for religious reasons. Members of the Historic Peace Churches are pacifist by doctrine. Jehovah's Witnesses, who, while not pacifist in the strict sense, refuse to participate in the armed services on the grounds that they believe Christians should be neutral in worldly conflicts. Some look at Romans 12:19, which says, Do not take revenge, my friends, but leave room for God's wrath, for it is written: ""It is mine to avenge; I will repay,"" says the Lord. Other objections can stem from a deep sense of responsibility toward humanity as a whole, or from simple denial that any government should have that kind of moral authority.There are divergent views about the degree of pacifism in the early Christian Church. Within theRoman Empireavoiding military service was not a problem, because the legions and other armed forces were largely composed of volunteers. Some legionaries who converted to Christianity were able to reconcile warfare with their Christian beliefs which is formalized in the Just War theory. This option became more normal afterConstantineI made Christianity an official religion of the Empire. In the 11th century, there was a further shift of opinion in the Latin-Christian tradition with the crusades, strengthening the idea and acceptability of Holy War. Objectors became a minority.Feudalism imposed various forms of military obligation, before and after the crusading movement (which was composed of volunteers). But the demand was to send someone rather than any particular person. Those who did not wish to fight, for whatever reason, were left alone if they could pay or persuade someone else to go. Armies in medieval times were quite small - for instance Bosworth Field settled the fate of England with 8,000 fighting for Richard III defeated by 5,000 gathered by Henry Tudor/Henry VII. The question of unwilling service did not arise until armies became much larger.One argument used by some Christian objectors is that every soldier should be given the choice to go home before every battle according to Deuteronomy 20:8 which states, Then the officers shall add, ""Is any man afraid or fainthearted? Let him go home so that his brothers will not become disheartened too."" By this interpretation, any military draft as well as all military service that is based on enlistment in years or tours of duty would be unethical without the option to refuse any battle without punishment. This interpretation makes almost all wars in violation of Christian Just War theory.Because of their conscientious objection to participation in military service, whether armed or unarmed, Jehovah's Witnesses have often faced imprisonment or other penalties. InGreece, for example, before the introduction of alternative civilian service in 1997, hundreds of Witnesses were imprisoned, some for three years or even more for their refusal. More recently, inArmenia, young Jehovah's Witnesses have been imprisoned (and remain in prison) because of their conscientious objection to military service. InSwitzerland, virtually every Jehovah's Witness is exempted from military service. The Finnish government exempts Jehovah's Witnesses from the draft completely.For believers in Dharmic Religions, the opposition to warfare may be based on either the general idea of ahimsa, non-violence, or on an explicit prohibition of violence by their religion, e.g., for a Buddhist, one of the five precepts is ""Pānātipātā veramaṇi sikkhāpadam samādiyāmi,"" or ""I undertake the precept to refrain from destroying living creatures,"" which is in obvious opposition to the practice of warfare. The 14th Dalai Lama, the highest religious authority in Tibetan Buddhism, has stated that war ""should be relegated to the dustbin of history.""Alternatives for objectorsSome conscientious objectors are unwilling to serve the military in any capacity, while others accept noncombatant roles. Alternatives to military or civilian service include serving an imprisonment or other punishment for refusing conscription, falsely claiming unfitness for duty by feigning an allergy or a heart condition, delaying conscription until the maximum drafting age, or seeking refuge in a country which does not extradite those wanted for military conscription. Avoiding military service is sometimes labeled draft dodging, particularly if the goal is accomplished through dishonesty or evasive maneuvers. However, many people who support conscription will distinguish between ""bona fide"" conscientious objection and draft dodging, which they view as evasion of military service without a valid excuse.United StatesDuring the American Revolutionary War exemptions varied by state.Pennsylvaniarequired conscientious objectors, who would not join companies of voluntary soldiers called Associations, to pay a fine roughly equal to the time they would have spent in military drill. Quakers who refused this extra tax had their property confiscated.The first conscription in theUnited Statescame with the Civil War. Although conscientious objection was not part of the draft law, individuals could provide a substitute or pay $300 to hire one. By 1864 the draft act allowed the $300 to be paid for the benefit of sick and wounded soldiers. Conscientious objectors in Confederate States initially had few options. Responses included moving to northern states, hiding in the mountains, joining the army but refusing to use a weapon or imprisonment. Between late 1862 and 1864 a payment of $500 into the public treasury exempted conscientious objectors from Confederate military duty.We were cursed, beaten, kicked, and compelled to go through exercises to the extent that a few were unconscious for some minutes.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/mark-cuban-millennials-quote/	"mark cuban said that millennials will probably vote for a democrat in 2016, ""because they fact-check everything."" see example( s )"	false	['fact check', ' fake quote', ' mark cuban']	http://blogmaverick.com/	http://blogmaverick.com/2016/02/08/some-thoughts-on-the-presidential-race-and-sociocapitalism/	2016/02/14	There is a mantra I repeatÂ all the time: “If the information is important it will find me” . We don’t go find the news. It finds us. Â The majority of presidential election voters don’t turn on the evening news or open a newspaper or even tune to cable news network to learn about the candidates and decide on who they will vote for it. Â They probably can’t name all the candidates running for POTUS. Â I’m not sure if they care. What they trust are their social media news feeds. Â Whats on their instagram. Â Whats mentioned on snapchat stories. Â What’s in their FB feed. We are on the verge of Ground Game meaning not just what influencers you can get going door to door or calling their friends, but who will develop a FB, snapchat, instagram and twitter following and push messages out. Along these same lines, while we have seen some Youtubers during debates, we haven’t really seen any endorsements of candidates from big time social media influencers. Â IMHO, any candidate that wants to win the youth vote should be more interested in getting an endorsement from Nash Grier types than traditional political influencers. It’s a new political world. If you watch Shark Tank Â you may have noticed a trend. Â Entrepreneurs don’t just want to make a profit, they want to make a profit and share their success with those less fortunate. Â I first saw this in the mid 90’s when Rob Glaser founded Progressive Networks and promised 5 pct of their profits to those less fortunate. We saw this type of philanthropy gain interest with Tom’s Shoes and their One for One program. Not only are 20-something entrepreneurs starting companies with a social component , 20 – Something consumers are EXPECTING a social component from companies they do business with. So how can it be a surprise that Millennials are excited about Bernie Sanders ? Millennials EXPECT capitalism to reflect a socialist element. Â I don’t think Bernie knew this going in. Either way, any candidate that expects to get millennial votes needs to understand that your father’s capitalism is not what how they understand the world. Â Soci0-Capitalism is who they are and what this country will be. Whether you like it or not. Bitching about everyone else is not leadership. It may play to the base, but it certainly doesn’t reflect an ability to lead. Â This years candidates seem to want to prove to everyone that they conform to “party principles” rather than offering strategies and solutions and rallying consensus behind it. Â In fact, they argue with each other about who conforms to party standards more. IMHO, this is just crazy. The democrats argue about who can give away more stuff and is more progressive. The republicans argue about who is the purer conservative and how hard they will work to undo what is already done. Â Both sides stick purely to issues that are raised in polls and in debates. None of the candidates have moved into new territory. It’s as if there is an island for democrats and an island for republicans and no one ventures off. A leader would come up with new ideas and new solutions for issues that are outside what everyone is talking about and make people realize just how important they are to the country. Â It may not seem like it sometimes, but this country does want exciting new ideas. We want to know there is a positive direction for us. Â The future of this country can’t just be about free stuff, raising taxes on the rich or cutting taxes for everyone, Â keeping people out and undoing what is already done. Using or not using email, being on social media, neither reflect a knowledge of technology. Â No one is saying they have to be hard core geeks, but the future of this country, our jobs, economy, security, culture, lifestyle and more are intertwined with advanced technology. How can you hope to strategize and create solutions to issues we face without having more than a basic understanding of technology ? Wars won’t be fought with bombs and bullets as much as bytes and advanced technologies. Homeland security will be much more about machine vision, learning and Artificial Intelligence than walls. Â The future of healthcare and its cost will be much more about personalized medicine and CRISPR than trying to defund Obamacare. Do our candidates realize that when it comes to hacking, there are only 2 kinds of Â companies and government agencies, those who have been hacked, and those who don’t know they have been hacked ? And what about our stock markets Â ? Does anyone understand what is going on in the markets and how technology has completely upended companies ability to raise capital publicly and undermined the confidence our citizens have in our markets ? Financial terrorism is more than just a possibility. This isn’t about the age of the candidates. It’s about their knowledge. None has given us any reason to believe they could make a decision on the technology used by a tiny business let alone the country. A theme in this election has been anger. Â Voters are angry at Washington. Â I disagree. Voters have never expected anything from Washington. So the concept of insiders vs outsiders, establishment vs non-establishment is really just headline fodder. I think the real problem is the uncertainty that comes with more than half of the country Â having under 10k in liquid assets and about 35pct having under 1k. I’ve been there. When you don’t have enough to buy Â health insurance, even with subsidies, that is stress. If you are fortunate enough to get insurance and your savings are less than your deductible, thats stress. When you know that one problem with your car and you are carless, that is stress. If you have student loans, add your minimum monthly payment. And each individual has additional items that they will add to this formula. Add it all up and at least half the country is stressed about keeping their heads above water. Tax cuts won’t do it. Â Redistribution of wealth might help in the short term, but won’t solve the problem. The first step is to understand just what the budgets of underwater American families are and to look for ways to provide ways to cut those costs. Hopefully the free market can find answers. Here is what I have asked a couple of Â people to look at. I asked a machine learning company to try to find nutrition databases of readily available, deliverable foods from Amazon and to cross reference those databases against the Amazon delivered price in one urban city. The goal is to create the least cost, Â deliverable daily or weekly menu of food that meets a high level of nutritional requirements for individuals and families. Can we do it ? It is far from certain. Will it work ? Â It should, but that doesn’t mean it will. Will people use it if it does save them money and provide viable menu options ? The odds are firmly against it. Â But there is only one way to find out. Â This isn’t a quick turn project. It will take time. If you have a better idea, tell us. There has never been an investor in the history of investors that has believed a 10 year projection in a business plan. Â Yet for some reason we allow candidates to deliver tax , healthcare and other financial plans over a 10 year period. The only certainty is that they are wrong. Tell the World Please !

This, according to the article, could cause a man-made disaster unfathomable by most. A quote from the article: “If every home in the world had solar panels on their roofs, global temperatures would drop by as much as thirty degrees over 20 years, and the Sun could die out within three hundred to four hundred years.” Again, National Report is a satirical website.Solar panels are not like a vacuum cleaner- they can’t physically suck out the Sun’s energy. The Sun consistently emits solar radiation, regardless of whether we use it or not. It isn’t a feedback system whereby our actions can alter the amount released. It’s a system that we tap into for our benefit; we have no influence over it.Just to give you an idea of how little energy we use compared to what is produced, the Sun puts out 3.8 x 1026 Watts , or Joules per second. The Earth’s population consumes around 15 terawatts of power (one terawatt is 1012 Watts, so this would be 1.5 x 1013 in total). So that’s 380,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 compared with 15,000,000,000,000. But that is still irrelevant because we don’t physically drain it anyway. The Sun is a finite source of energy; it will burn out one day, but that’s not going to happen for a very, very long time ( 5 or so billion years ). So don’t get your knickers in a twist just yet - we’ll be fine.

The disease was unknown in Europe or any other continent, occurring only in North America.White snakeroot is a shade-loving plant found throughout Indiana. It is commonly seen growing on roadsides, in damp open areas, or on the shaded north side of ridges. The plant is also found in western Ohio and the wooded parts of Illinois. These three states probably had the greatest quantity of the weed and probably do so today.By definition, milk sickness is poisoning by milk from cows that have eaten white snakeroot. Many early settlers in the Midwest came into contact with the sickness. In the fall of 1818, Nancy Hanks Lincoln died as milk sickness struck the Little Pigeon Creek settlement.The sickness has been called puking fever, sick stomach, the slows, and the trembles. The illness was most common in dry years when cows wandered from poor pastures to the woods in search of food. In man, the symptoms are loss of appetite, listlessness, weakness, vague pains, muscle stiffness, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, severe constipation, bad breath, and finally coma. Recovery is slow and may never be complete, but more often an attack is fatal, as it was for Nancy Hanks Lincoln. She died on October 5, 1818.While milk sickness usually develops when a person or animal eats the plant, the sickness can also occur if one eats heavily of the flesh of an animal that has died of severe white snakeroot poisoning. Within the present century persons have suffered and died from milk sickness in parts of Indiana, Ohio, and Illinois. It is written that more than half of the deaths that occurred early in the 19th century in Dubois County, Indiana, were caused by milk sickness.In the library of the Surgeon General in Washington, D.C. are some 200 articles pertaining to milk sickness, many of them in medical journals. Until the present century, few people -- including physicians -- knew much of the sickness. Milk sickness or ""trembles"" was more prevalent in late summer and early fall, but records show that many cases occurred in the winter and early summer also. In late summer, when the plant is in full bloom, it is easily recognized, growing to a height of 18 to 48 inches, more woodlands were cleared, cattle had adequate pasture even in dry weather. As a result the incidence of the disease tapered off. The mixing of milk from many cows at the dairy further reduces the chances of milk sickness today.EXPERIENCE YOUR AMERICA""The National Park Service cares for special places saved by the American people so that all may experience our heritage.""

Unproven	['']	http://www.dailymail.co.uk/	http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1342985/Female-Chinese-students-resort-eating-roundworm-eggs-ensure-look-job-interviews.html	2016/02/04	commentsBad diet: Chinese students have been swallowing roundworm eggs which hatch in the stomach. It can cause severe health problemsFemale students in China have been eating roundworm eggs to lose weight for job interviews - because employment is so hard to come by.They hatch in the stomach, allowing those who take them to shed pounds without exercising or dieting in the Xiamen, China.But swallowing the worms is extremely dangerous - and definitely not to be recommended for those wanting to shed the pounds in the New Year.With jobs shortages across the country, women in China are under pressure to appear thin if they are to have any chance of landing a role.Employment stands at 22 per cent - and the size of the labour pool has grown by 112 million people over the last decade to more than one billion people.Other students are staring at pictures for hours on end to suppress their appetite so they can shed excess weight.A student called Xiaomei said that women are using a 'special soap' that helps them with their diets. Some are having up to 10 showers each day.The treatments have no scientific basis and are likely to damage health.In the 1990s Chinese women would take special teas and pills to lose weight. Acupuncture also emerged as a popular choice.But many students struggle to find work as the world's most populous nation faces big unemployment problems with only 780 million labourers in jobs.However, the work problem is largely confined to rural areas. Jobs in cities are being created quickly as China undergoes a rapid urbanisation.'China is facing huge employment pressures at present and for the foreseeable future,' Yi Chengji, spokesman for the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security said.'As China's urbanisation quickens, employment pressures from the many surplus rural labourers are getting bigger and bigger.'Currently there are about 100 million surplus rural workers that need to be transferred (to urban jobs).'The country's urban population will rise to over 700 million people by 2015, outstripping the rural population for the first time.According to an employment paper, there were 9.21 million registered urban jobless in China at the end of 2009, resulting in just a 4.3 per cent urban unemployment rate.Share or comment on this article:Most watched News videos	
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bernie-sanders-loser-meme/	a meme accurately describes the arc of bernie sanders' (financial) life. see example( s )	Mixture	['2016 presidential election', ' bernie sanders']	http://blog.uvm.edu/	http://blog.uvm.edu/uvmsc-specialcollections/?p=152	2016/02/04	Posted on June 16, 2015 by Special CollectionsSince Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination, UVM Special Collections librarians have become much better acquainted with the diverse resources in our Vermont research collection that document Sanders’ life and political career. After receiving an inquiry about his educational filmstrip business, we turned to our reference files, where clippings, brochures and other ephemera frequently provide information about obscure topics.We searched for the name of the company, the American People’s Historical Society, and found a folder where a conscientious predecessor had saved four promotional brochures sent to the library between 1978 and 1980. The brochures provide details about the nonprofit’s goals, products, and staff.Two of the brochures advertise film strips about Vermont history. The organization, originally known as Green Mountain Media, produced a series of six Vermont history filmstrips in 1977 for students in grade 6 and up. A 1978 brochure advertised three additional film strips, presented as “Great Events and People in Vermont History, Part II.” A second 1978 offering promoted a version of the original six filmstrips for third through fifth graders.The topics are standard fare. The original series covered Ethan Allen, the Battle of Bennington, Vermont and the Civil War, Vermont statesmen, Calvin Coolidge, and the 1927 flood. The second series looked at the lives of Vermont-born President Chester A. Arthur, newspaperman Horace Greeley, Wilson “Snowflake” Bentley, women who played important roles in the state’s past, Champlain “discovering” Vermont, the St. Albans Raid, and Admiral Dewey’s victory in the Philippines.The third brochure indicates that the organization expanded its scope to other New England states, adding film strips for Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Addressing the New England educators who might purchase and use the films, director Bernard Sanders explained, “It is our belief that state and regional history has too long been neglected by the audio-visual industry, and we are happy to begin the process of rectifying that situation. We believe that students have the right to learn about the state and region in which they are living.”The six products for Massachusetts featured Thoreau, U.S. presidents from Massachusetts, the abolition movement, maritime history, John Quincy Adams and the Amistad slave ship, and four important Massachusetts women. The three New Hampshire filmstrips profiled John Stark and five great leaders from New Hampshire and examined New Hampshire’s role in the Civil War.The Vermont and New England brochures included a coupon with details about ordering the film strips. The society followed a fairly conventional pricing structure. It offered a 10-day free trial, with discounts for bulk purchases. Individual film strips could be purchased for $18.50. A 10% discount set the price for six strips at $99.90. A bundle of all 15 Vermont film strips was discounted to $155.40, while a set of 15 New England films was available for $225.00.The fourth brochure marks a new direction for the society. Debs, about trade unionist, socialist and presidential candidate Eugene V. Debs, was issued as a color videocassette. In the brochure’s “Dear Educator” section, Sanders announced that Debs was the first documentary in a new series called “The Other Side of American History,” which would “deal with people and ideas that the major profit oriented manufacturers of audio-visual material will not cover because of economic and political reasons.”In his memoir, Outsider in the House, Bernie Sanders remembers that the educational filmstrip business was reasonably successful and “a lot of fun.” It ended when he turned his attention back to the political arena and won the 1981 mayoral election in Burlington, Vermont.Contributed by Prudence Doherty,

It has recently come to the attention of the College that one of the recommended vaccines could possibly be associated with the very rare but serious condition of premature ovarian failure (POF), also known as premature menopause. There have been two case report series (3 cases each) published since 2013 in which post-menarcheal adolescent girls developed laboratory documented POF within weeks to several years of receiving Gardasil, a four-strain human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV4).1,2 Adverse events that occur after vaccines are frequently not caused by the vaccine and there has not been a noticeable rise in POF cases in the last 9 years since HPV4 vaccine has been widely used.Nevertheless there are legitimate concerns that should be addressed: (1) long-term ovarian function was not assessed in either the original rat safety studies3,4 or in the human vaccine trials, (2) most primary care physicians are probably unaware of a possible association between HPV4 and POF and may not consider reporting POF cases or prolonged amenorrhea (missing menstrual periods) to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), (3) potential mechanisms of action have been postulated based on autoimmune associations with the aluminum adjuvant used1 and previously documented ovarian toxicity in rats from another component, polysorbate 80,2 and (4) since licensure of Gardasil® in 2006, there have been about 213 VAERS reports (per the publicly available CDC WONDER VAERS database) involving amenorrhea, POF or premature menopause, 88% of which have been associated with Gardasil®.5 The two-strain HPV2, CervarixTM, was licensed late in 2009 and accounts for 4.7 % of VAERS amenorrhea reports since 2006, and 8.5% of those reports from February 2010 through May 2015. This compares to the pre-HPV vaccine period from 1990 to 2006 during which no cases of POF or premature menopause and 32 cases of amenorrhea were reported to VAERS.Many adolescent females are vaccinated with influenza, meningococcal, and tetanus vaccines without getting Gardasil®, and yet only 5.6% of reports related to ovarian dysfunction since 2006 are associated with such vaccines in the absence of simultaneous Gardasil® administration. The overwhelming majority (76%) of VAERS reports since 2006 with ovarian failure, premature menopause, and/or amenorrhea are associated solely with Gardasil®. When VAERS reports since 2006 are restricted to cases in which amenorrhea occurred for at least 4 months and is not associated with other known causes like polycystic ovary syndrome or pregnancy, 86/89 cases are associated with Gardasil®, 3/89 with CervarixTM, and 0/89 with other vaccines administered independently of an HPV vaccine.5 Using the same criteria, there are only 7 reports of amenorrhea from 1990 through 2005 and no more than 2 of those associated with any one vaccine type.Few other vaccines besides Gardasil® that are administered in adolescence contain polysorbate 80.6 Pre-licensure safety trials for Gardasil® used placebo that contained polysorbate 80 as well as aluminum adjuvant.2,7 Therefore, if such ingredients could cause ovarian dysfunction, an increase in amenorrhea probably would not have been detected in the placebo controlled trials. Furthermore, a large number of girls in the original trials were taking hormonal contraceptives which can mask ovarian dysfunction including amenorrhea and ovarian failure.2 Thus a causal relationship between human papillomavirus vaccines (if not Gardasil® specifically) and ovarian dysfunction cannot be ruled out at this time.Numerous Gardasil safety studies, including one released recently,8 have looked at demyelinating and autoimmune diseases and have not found any significant problems. Unfortunately, none of them except clinical safety pre-licensure studies totaling 11,778 vaccinees9 specifically addressed post-vaccination ovarian dysfunction. While data from those studies do not indicate an increased rate of amenorrhea after vaccination, the essential lack of saline placebos and the majority of participants taking hormonal contraceptives in those studies preclude meaningful data to rule out an effect on ovarian function.A Vaccine Safety Datalink POF study is planned to address an association between these vaccines and POF, but it may be years before results will be determined. Plus, POF within a few years of vaccination could be the tip of the iceberg since ovarian dysfunction manifested by months of amenorrhea may later progress to POF. Meanwhile, the author of this statement has contacted the maker of Gardasil, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to make known the above concerns and request that (1) more rat studies be done to look at long-term ovarian function after HPV4 injections, (2) the 89 VAERS reports identified with at least 4 months amenorrhea be reviewed by the CDC for further clarification since the publicly available WONDER VAERS database only contains initial reports, and (3) primary care providers be notified of a possible association between HPV and amenorrhea. A U.S. Government Representative responded that they “will continue to conduct studies and monitor the safety of HPV vaccines. Should the weight of the evidence from VAERS or VSD and other sources indicate a likely causal association between POF and HPV vaccines, appropriate action will be taken in terms of communication and public health response.”The College is posting this statement so that individuals considering the use of human papillomavirus vaccines could be made aware of these concerns pending further action by the regulatory agencies and manufacturers. While there is no strong evidence of a causal relationship between HPV4 and ovarian dysfunction, this information should be public knowledge for physicians and patients considering these vaccines.Primary author: Scott S.

One set up a national park in Puerto Rico . A second provided respite care for family members helping their relatives through Alzheimer's or other conditions. And two were routine bills to aid 911 victims and responders which were sponsored by the entire NY delegation. Presently she is trying to have the US memorialize the Woodstock fiasco of 40 years ago.Click to expand...Well that is better and more than all of the last Republican controlled House of Representatives did. Actually, this is what Hillary did as a senator:“First termUpon entering the Senate, Clinton maintained a low public profile and built relationships with senators from both parties.[213] She forged alliances with religiously inclined senators by becoming a regular participant in the Senate Prayer Breakfast.[137][214] She served on five Senate committees: Committee on Budget (2001–2002),[215] Committee on Armed Services (2003–2009),[216] Committee on Environment and Public Works (2001–2009),[215] Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (2001–2009)[215] and Special Committee on Aging.[217] She was also a member of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe[218] (2001–2009).[219]Following the September 11, 2001, attacks, Clinton sought to obtain funding for the recovery efforts in New York City and security improvements in her state. Working with New York's senior senator, Charles Schumer, she was instrumental in securing $21 billion in funding for the World Trade Center site's redevelopment.[214][220] She subsequently took a leading role in investigating the health issues faced by 9/11 first responders.[221] Clinton voted for the USA Patriot Act in October 2001. In 2005, when the act was up for renewal, she worked to address some civil liberties concerns with it,[222] before voting in favor of a compromise renewed act in March 2006 that gained large majority support.[223]Clinton strongly supported the 2001 U.S. military action in Afghanistan, saying it was a chance to combat terrorism while improving the lives of Afghan women who suffered under the Taliban government.[224] Clinton voted in favor of the October 2002 Iraq War Resolution, which authorized President George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq.[225]After the Iraq War began, Clinton made trips to Iraq and Afghanistan to visit American troops stationed there. On a visit to Iraq in February 2005, Clinton noted that the insurgency had failed to disrupt the democratic elections held earlier and that parts of the country were functioning well.[226] Observing that war deployments were draining regular and reserve forces, she co-introduced legislation to increase the size of the regular United States Army by 80,000 soldiers to ease the strain.[227] In late 2005, Clinton said that while immediate withdrawal from Iraq would be a mistake, Bush's pledge to stay ""until the job is done"" was also misguided, as it gave Iraqis ""an open-ended invitation not to take care of themselves.""[228] Her stance caused frustration among those in the Democratic Party who favored quick withdrawal.[229] Clinton supported retaining and improving health benefits for veterans and lobbied against the closure of several military bases.[230]Senator Clinton voted against President Bush's two major tax cut packages, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.[231] Clinton voted against the 2005 confirmation of John G. Roberts as Chief Justice of the United States and the 2006 confirmation of Samuel Alito to the United States Supreme Court.[232]In 2005, Clinton called for the Federal Trade Commission to investigate how hidden sex scenes showed up in the controversial video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.[233] Along with Senators Joe Lieberman and Evan Bayh, she introduced the Family Entertainment Protection Act, intended to protect children from inappropriate content found in video games. In 2004 and 2006, Clinton voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment that sought to prohibit same-sex marriage.[231][234]Looking to establish a ""progressive infrastructure"" to rival that of American conservatism, Clinton played a formative role in conversations that led to the 2003 founding of former Clinton administration chief of staff John Podesta's Center for American Progress, shared aides with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, founded in 2003, and advised the Clintons' former antagonist David Brock's Media Matters for America, created in 2004.[235] Following the 2004 Senate elections, she successfully pushed new Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid to create a Senate war room to handle daily political messaging.[236]Second termSenator Clinton listens as Chief of Naval Operations Navy Admiral Mike Mullen responds to a question during his 2007 confirmation hearing with the Senate Armed Services Committee.Clinton opposed the Iraq War troop surge of 2007.[243][nb 9] In March of that year, she voted in favor of a war-spending bill that required President Bush to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq by a deadline; it passed almost completely along party lines[245] but was subsequently vetoed by Bush. In May, a compromise war funding bill that removed withdrawal deadlines but tied funding to progress benchmarks for the Iraqi government passed the Senate by a vote of 80–14 and would be signed by Bush; Clinton was one of those who voted against it.[246] Clinton responded to General David Petraeus's September 2007 Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq by saying, ""I think that the reports that you provide to us really require a willing suspension of disbelief.""[247]In March 2007, in response to the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy, Clinton called on Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to resign.[248] Regarding the high-profile, hotly debated comprehensive immigration reform bill known as the Secure Borders, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Reform Act of 2007, Clinton cast several votes in support of the bill, which eventually failed to gain cloture.[249]As the financial crisis of 2007–2008 reached a peak with the liquidity crisis of September 2008, Clinton supported the proposed bailout of United States financial system, voting in favor of the $700 billion law that created the Troubled Asset Relief Program, saying that it represented the interests of the American people. It passed the Senate 74–25.[250]” http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton#Early_Arkansas_years "

The writer saw nearly a dozen, one after another, soon after the first nomination to the presidency, attempt the task. They put into their pictures the large, rugged features, and strong, prominent lines; they made measurements to obtain exact proportions; they ""petrified"" some single look, but the picture remained hard and cold. Even before these paintings were finished it was plain to see that they were unsatisfactory to the artists themselves, and much more so to the intimate friends of the man this was not he who smiled, spoke, laughed, charmed. The picture was to the man as the grain of sand to the mountain, as the dead to the living. Graphic art was powerless before a face that moved through a thousand delicate gradations of line and contour, light and shade, sparkle of the eye and curve of the lip, in the long gamut of expression from grave to gay, and back again from the rollicking jollity of laughter to that serious, far away look that with prophetic intuitions beheld the awful panorama of war, and heard the cry of oppression and suffering. There are many pictures of Lincoln; there is no portrait of him.""—John George Nicolay , Secretary to President Lincoln, [1]ImageDaguerreotype , quarter plate [2]Library of CongressThis daguerreotype is the earliest confirmed photographic image of Abraham Lincoln . It was reportedly made in 1846 by Nicholas H. Shepherd shortly after Lincoln was elected to the United States House of Representatives . Shepherd's Daguerreotype Miniature Gallery, which he advertised in the Sangamo Journal, was located in Springfield over the drug store of J. Brookie. Shepherd also studied law at the law office of Lincoln and Herndon .

From a photograph owned originally by George Schneider , former editor of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung , the most influential anti-slavery German newspaper of the West. Mr. Schneider first met Mr. Lincoln in 1853, in Springfield. ""He was already a man necessary to know,"" says Mr. Schneider. In 1854 Mr. Lincoln was in Chicago, and Isaac N. Arnold invited Mr. Schneider to dine with Mr. Lincoln. After dinner, as the gentlemen were going down town, they stopped at an itinerant photograph gallery, and Mr. Lincoln had this picture taken for Mr. Schneider.

Lincoln said at the time that he did not know why the boys wanted such a homely face. Joseph Medill went with Mr. Lincoln to have the picture taken. He says that the photographer insisted on smoothing down Lincoln's hair, but Lincoln did not like the result, and ran his fingers through it before sitting.""—H. W. Fay of DeKalb, Illinois, original owner of the photo [8]Lincoln immediately prior to his Senate nomination. The original negative was burned in the Great Chicago Fire .

The photographer Amon T. Joslin owned ""Joslin's Gallery"" located on the second floor of a building adjoining the Woodbury Drug Store, in Danville, IL. This was one of Lincoln's favorite stopping places in Vermilion County, Illinois, while he was a traveling lawyer. Joslin photographed Abraham Lincoln twice at this sitting. Lincoln kept one copy and gave the other to his friend, Thomas J. Hilyard, deputy sheriff of Vermilion County. Today, one original resides in the Illinois State Historical Library. [10]000000001858-01-01-00001858Daguerreotype (?) [11]Benjamin Shapell Family Manuscript Foundation""...the Photo you have of Abraham Lincoln is a copy of a Daguerreotype, that I made in my gallery in this city [Peoria] during the Lincoln and Douglas campaign. I invited him to my gallery to give me a sitting...and when I had my plate ready, he said to me, 'I cannot see why all you artists want a likeness of me unless it is because I am the homeliest man in the State of Illinois.'""—R.M. Cole, July 3, 1905 letter to David McCulloch [12]Lincoln liked this image and often signed photographic prints for admirers. In fact, in 1861, he even gave a copy to his stepmother. The image was extensively employed on campaign ribbons in the 1860 Presidential campaign, and Lincoln ""often signed photographic prints for visitors.""

Maresh collectionA Civil War soldier from Parma, Ohio, was the original owner of this portrait, published in the Cleveland Plain Dealer on February 12, 1942, from a print in the Anthony L. Maresh collection. Possibly it is a photographic copy of one of two daguerreotypes, both now lost, taken in Ohio. [15]000000001858-01-01-00001858 (?)Photographic copy(?)In 1858, Lincoln squared off against Stephen Douglas for Illinois’ Senate seat. The battle sparked seven heated debates on slavery.

On the opening day of court, which was always an interesting occasion, largely because we were curious to see what attorneys from a distance were in attendance...I observed that Mr. Lincoln was among them; and as I looked in his direction, he arose from his seat, and came forward and gave me a cordial hand-shake, accompanying the action with words of congratulation on my election. I mention this fact because the conduct of Mr. Lincoln was so in contrast with that of the other members of the bar that it touched me deeply, and made me, ever afterwards, his steadfast friend.""—C. F. Gunther of Chicago, circa 1896 Letter [21]""One morning I was in the gallery of Mr. Alschuler, when Mr. Lincoln came into the room and said he had been informed that he (Alschuler) wished him to sit for a picture. Alschuler said he had sent such a message to Mr. Lincoln, but he could not take the picture in that coat (referring to a linen duster in which Mr. Lincoln was clad), and asked if he had not a dark coat in which he could sit. Mr. Lincoln said he had not; that this was the only coat he had brought with him from his home. Alschuler said he could wear his coat, and gave it to Mr. Lincoln, who pulled off the duster and put on the artist's coat. Alschuler was a very short man, with short arms, but with a body nearly as large as the body of Mr. Lincoln. The arms of the latter extended through the sleeves of the coat of Alschuler a quarter of a yard, making him quite ludicrous, at which he (Lincoln) laughed immoderately, and sat down for the picture to be taken with an effort at being sober enough for the occasion. The lips in the picture show this.""—Mr. J. O. Cunningham, present when the picture was taken [21]000000001858-07-18-0000July 18, 1858"

Hot Octopuss has created the GuyFi booth to take this habit out of the office and into a more suitable environment designed to give the busy Manhattan man the privacy, and the high-speed Internet connection, he deserves.Hot Octopuss, maker of the world’s first ‘Guybrator’, has been working hard to reduce the stigma around male sex toys as well as advocating the health benefits of masturbation.The company now invites office workers in desperate need of some downtime to visit the GuyFi booth and find out for themselves how a little break can make a big difference to their wellbeing and productivity.Scientists say that male ‘alone time’ reduces depression and stress, as well as increasing self-esteem – all undeniably beneficial for staying healthy in today’s fast paced and stressful work environment. A break for as little as 15 minutes can seriously enhance productivity in the work place.Adam Lewis, Hot Octopuss co-founder and designer of PULSE, the world’s first Guybrator, said:“There’s no denying that working a nine to five job can be stressful on both your mind and body, especially in a non-stop city like Manhattan. It’s really important for guys to look after themselves so that they can stay healthy and focus properly on the task in hand. We’re told time and time again how beneficial it is to have a break away from your desk.”Adam continued:“At Hot Octopuss we are all about looking for new solutions to improve everyday life and we feel we’ve done just that with the new GuyFi booth. We hope the city’s men enjoy using the space we’ve created in whatever way they want. It’s completely free of charge… all that we ask is they thank us when they get their promotion!”Posted in

They used to talk about killing your parents and there were just some other things. There were odes to Satan. You don’t want that stuff coming into your mind. There’s some beat that’s out there that, you know, probably isn’t all that bad, although in one Indian context, they were playing rock music and the person said, ‘Why are you calling on the demons?,’ because that was the kind of music they used to summon demons.”	
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/soldiers-remains-dumped-landfill/	the remains of more than 250 soldiers were dumped in a landfill between 2004 and 2008, a fact that was ignored by the mainstream media. see example( s )	Mixture	['bush', ' cremated', ' landfill', ' soldiers']	http://news.groopspeak.com/	http://news.groopspeak.com/military-dumped-hundreds-of-dead-troops-in-landfills-during-bush-presidency-video/	2016/01/15	Military Dumped Hundreds Of Dead Troops In Landfills During Bush Presidency (VIDEO)One Bush administration policy allowed this to happen.TwitterThis story has been out for a few years now, but it’s hardly made a blip in the mainstream media landscape. While Republicans have had a non-stop stream of rants about how President Obama doesn’t care about the troops, a dirty little secret is haunting the era known as the George W. Bush administration.We’ve known since the start of the two Bush wars that there was a media blackout. Unlike Vietnam before it, the media was not allowed to show the hundreds and thousands of body bags being flown from the Middle East. That blackout could be why it went unnoticed for several years that they were regularly incinerating and throwing the bodies of our troops into a Virginia landfill.The Washington Post picked up the story in 2011, but odds are that most still aren’t aware that at least 274 troops were treated like last night’s chicken bones. Naturally, the families did not know about the dumping. Instead, they were under the impression that their loved ones would be disposed of in a “respectful and dignified manner.”This week, after The Post pressed for information contained in the Dover mortuary’s electronic database, the Air Force produced a tally based on those records. It showed that 976 fragments from 274 military personnel were cremated, incinerated and taken to the landfill between 2004 and 2008.An additional group of 1,762 unidentified remains were collected from the battlefield and disposed of in the same manner, the Air Force said. Those fragments could not undergo DNA testing because they had been badly burned or damaged in explosions. The total number of incinerated fragments dumped in the landfill exceeded 2,700.Here’s the video:There’s no evidence that the President was aware of the practice, but it was done between 2003 and 2008, right-smack in the middle of Bush’s wars and during the Bush administration.The travesty was discovered by three whistle blowers who worked for the mortuary at the Dover Air Force Base. One whistle blower was allegedly fired and the other two faced what they said was retaliation.The Air Force chain of command has taken responsibility, sort of. They were shy of calling the actions “wrongdoing.”To this day, we don’t know how many troops were involved. The Air Force complained that they would have to comb through the records of more than 6,300 troops, to which one Congressman, Rep. Rush Hold (D-NJ) said:“What the hell?” he told the Post. “We spent millions, tens of millions, to find any trace of soldiers killed, and they’re concerned about a ‘massive’ effort to go back and pull out the files and find out how many soldiers were disrespected this way?”“They just don’t want to ask questions or look very hard,” he added, according to the newspaper.Source: US NewsThe three whistle blowers did say, though, that today, things are better than ever and that the troops are being taken care of. Fortunately, in 2009, then newly-elected President Barack Obama lifted the media blackout for military casualties. Now that things are in the open, military heroes are getting the respect they deserve.Featured image via Flickr .

Mostly False	['']	https://www.congress.gov/	https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1314	2016/01/15	"Bill summaries are authored by CRS .Shown Here:Public Law No: 114-74 (11/02/2015)(This measure has not been amended since the Senate agreed to the House amendment to the Senate amendment on October 30, 2015. The summary of that version is repeated here.)Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015TITLE I--BUDGET ENFORCEMENT(Sec. 101) This bill amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to increase the discretionary spending limits for FY2016 and FY2017.The bill revises procedures for implementing the sequester of direct spending, which is required under current law and involves cuts that interact with discretionary spending levels. The bill requires the sequester to take place in FY2016 and FY2017 as if the amendments that this bill makes to the discretionary spending limits have not been made. It also adds an additional year to the sequester in FY2025 and adjusts the cuts required for Medicare.(Direct spending, also known as mandatory spending, is spending provided by laws other than appropriations bills. Sequestration is a process of automatic, usually across-the-board spending reductions under which budgetary resources are permanently cancelled to enforce specific budget policy goals.)The bill requires the discretionary spending limits in FY2016 and FY2017 to be increased by specified amounts for overseas contingency operations.(Sec. 102) The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee must file for publication in the Congressional Record committee allocations, aggregate spending and revenue levels, and levels of revenues and outlays for Social Security consistent with this bill. The chairman may also include reserve funds contained in the FY2016 budget resolution that are extended by one year.The bill provides that the allocations, aggregates, and levels submitted by the chairman are enforceable in the Senate as if they were included in a budget resolution conference agreement. The provisions in this section expire if Congress agrees to a budget resolution for FY2017.TITLE II--AGRICULTURE(Sec. 201) The bill amends the Federal Crop Insurance Act to require the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to renegotiate the Standard Reinsurance Agreement no later than December 31, 2016, and at least once every five years thereafter.(The Standard Reinsurance Agreement is an agreement between USDA and the private companies that administer the federal crop insurance program. It specifies details such as administrative and operating expense reimbursements and risk sharing between USDA and the companies in the operation of the program.)The bill establishes an 8.9% cap on the overall rate of return for insurance providers under the agreement, which is a decrease from the current negotiated rate of approximately 14.5%.TITLE III--COMMERCE(Sec. 301) The bill amends the Communications Act of 1934 to authorize the use of automated telephone equipment to call cellular telephones for the purpose of collecting debts owed to the U.S. government. The Federal Communications Commission must issue regulations implementing this section within nine months of enactment of this bill. The regulations may restrict the number and duration of the calls.TITLE IV--STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE(Sec. 401) The Energy Policy and Conservation Act is amended to revise the requirement that the Department of Energy (DOE) transmit a detailed explanation to Congress regarding a test drawdown and sale or exchange of petroleum products from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).DOE shall notify Congress of the test at least 14 days before the date on which it is conducted, unless an emergency requires the test, in which case DOE must notify Congress as soon as possible.The detailed description of the test DOE is currently required to submit to Congress must be submitted within 180 days after completion of the test.The term ""severe energy supply interruption"" shall now include a national energy supply shortage resulting, or is likely to result, from an act of terrorism.(Sec. 402) DOE shall within 180 days after enactment of this Act:complete a long-range strategic review of the SPR and submit to Congress a proposed action plan and implementation schedule specifying both near- and long-term roles of the SPR relative to U.S. energy and economic security;describe whether existing legal authorities governing SPR policies, configuration, and capabilities are adequate to ensure that the SPR can meet current and future U.S. energy and economic security objectives;identify SPR configuration and performance capabilities;recommend an action plan to achieve the optimal capacity, location, and composition of SPR petroleum products in addition to storage and distributional capabilities; andestimate the resources required to attain and maintain SPR long-term sustainability and operational effectiveness.(Sec. 403) For each of FY2018-FY2025 DOE shall draw down and sell from the SPR specified barrels of crude oil ranging from 5 million (FY2018) to 10 million barrels (FY2025).DOE shall not, however, draw down and sell crude oil in amounts that would limit presidential authority to sell the full amount of petroleum products authorized when necessary to prevent or reduce the adverse impact of severe domestic energy supply interruptions.(Sec. 404) There is established in the Treasury the Energy Security and Infrastructure Modernization Fund for the deposit of SPR crude oil sales proceeds to provide for the construction, maintenance, repair, and replacement of SPR facilities.To protect the U.S. economy from the impacts of emergency product supply disruptions, DOE shall establish an SPR modernization program, for which appropriations are authorized for FY2017-2020.DOE authority to draw down and sell crude oil from the SPR under this section shall expire at the end of FY2020.TITLE V--PENSIONS(Sec. 501) This section amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to increase the annual fixed rate premium payable to the Pension Benefits Guaranty Corporation by a single-employer plan for basic benefits to $69 in plan years beginning in 2017, $74 in plan years beginning in 2018, and $80 in plan years beginning after 2018. The variable rate premium for such plans increases by an additional $3 for plan years beginning in 2017 and by an additional $4 for plan years beginning in 2018 and 2019.(Sec. 502) This section changes the due date for premium payments for plan years beginning in 2025 to the 15th day of the 9th calendar month beginning on or after the 1st day of the premium payment year.(Sec. 503) This section changes criteria for mortality tables used by defined benefit pension plans for plan years beginning after 2015. The determination of whether a plan has credible mortality information shall be made in accordance with established actuarial credibility theory, which is materially different from current mortality rules under ERISA and Revenue Procedure 2007-37. A plan may use mortality tables that are adjusted from tables provided by the Department of the Treasury if such adjustments are based on a plan's experience.(Sec. 504) This section amends the Internal Revenue Code and ERISA to adjust interest rates used to calculate minimum funding contributions to pension plans The tables provide for adjustments to interest rates so that they fall within a range based on average interest rates over a 25-year period. For plan years beginning after 2015, the range variance is 10% through 2020, 15% in 2021, 20% in 2022, 25% in 2023, and 30% in 2024 and subsequent plan years.TITLE VI--HEALTH CARE(Sec. 601) The bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act (SSAct) to: (1) mitigate 2016 increases to Medicare Part B premiums and deductibles for enrollees, and (2) authorize federal funding to offset the corresponding reduction in aggregate monthly premiums.Under current law, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services must annually determine the monthly actuarial rate upon which Part B premiums and deductibles are based. For 2016, the bill revises this methodology, effectively reducing increases to premiums and deductibles for certain enrollees in 2016. (Current law already protects Part B enrollees whose benefits are deducted from their Social Security benefits from premium increases that would result in a smaller net benefit from Social Security.)This methodology shall also apply in 2017 if, as in 2016, there is no increase in monthly Social Security benefits.(Sec. 602) The bill amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the SSAct to require manufacturers of generic drugs to join manufacturers of single-source or innovator drugs in paying rebates to state Medicaid programs for price increases over inflation.(Sec. 603) The bill excludes certain hospital outpatient department services from the prospective payment system in which predetermined amounts form the basis for payment under Medicare. With specified exceptions, services are excluded from this system if they are furnished by a provider's off-campus outpatient department.(Sec. 604) The bill amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to repeal the requirement, established under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, for large employers offering health benefit plans to automatically enroll full-time employees in such a plan. A large employer is one that has more than 200 full-time employees.TITLE VII--JUDICIARYFederal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015(Sec. 701) This title amends the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 to require federal agencies that impose civil monetary penalties subject to inflation adjustments under the Adjustment Act to adjust the penalties for inflation annually instead of at least every four years.The categories of penalties required to be adjusted for inflation under the Adjustment Act are expanded to include civil penalties under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and the Social Security Act.For all civil penalties adjusted for inflation under the Adjustment Act, federal agencies must make an initial adjustment after enactment of this bill by the percentage by which the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for October 2015 exceeds the CPI for the month of October of the calendar year during which the amount of such civil monetary penalty was established or adjusted under a provision of law other than this bill. The increase in penalties from the initial adjustment is prohibited from exceeding 150% of the amount of that penalty on the date of enactment of this bill.An agency may adjust penalties by less than the required amount under an exception that applies to the first adjustment if: (1) the agency determines in a rulemaking with an opportunity for public comment that the adjustment would have a negative economic impact or social costs that outweigh the benefits, and (2) the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) concurs.The annual inflation adjustment in subsequent years must be a cost-of-living adjustment based on any increases in the October CPI each year.Inflation adjustment increases must be rounded to the nearest multiple of $1.This section also requires: (1) the OMB to issue guidance to agencies regarding the implementation of adjustments, (2) agencies to include information about adjustments to civil monetary penalties in agency financial reports, and (3) the Government Accountability Office to submit an annual report assessing agency compliance.(Sec. 702) This section rescinds and permanently cancels $1.5 billion of the funds deposited or available in the Crime Victims Fund under the Victims of Crime Act of 1984.(Sec. 703) This section rescinds and permanently cancels $746 million of the amounts deposited in the Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture Fund.TITLE VIII--SOCIAL SECURITYSocial Security Benefit Protection and Opportunity Enhancement Act of 2015Subtitle A--Ensuring Correct Payments and Reducing Fraud(Sec. 811) The Social Security Administration (SSA) must expand Cooperative Disability Investigations (CDI) Units that investigate suspected fraud before benefits are awarded to cover all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, and American Samoa.(Sec. 812) Title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act is amended to prohibit evidence submitted by unlicensed or sanctioned physicians and health care providers from being considered in making disability determinations.(Sec. 813) A new felony for conspiracy to commit Social Security fraud is created. Penalties for individuals in a position of trust who defraud the SSA are increased. Individuals are disqualified from receiving benefits during a trial work period if they are assessed a civil monetary penalty for concealing work activity.(Sec. 814) Prohibitions and penalties regarding the misuse of symbols, emblems, and names associated with Social Security and Medicare are applied to electronic and internet communications, and each internet viewing is treated as a separate offense.(Sec. 815) The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to revise the permissible uses and amounts of adjustments to discretionary spending limits for program integrity spending. The permissible uses are expanded to include CDI units, Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys who prosecute Social Security fraud, and work-related continuing disability reviews.Subtitle B--Promoting Opportunity for Disability Beneficiaries(Sec. 821) The authority for Disability Insurance (DI) demonstration projects is extended through 2021 and all projects must be terminated by the end of 2022.(Sec. 822) The authority for DI demonstration projects is modified to: (1) revise congressional reporting and review requirements, and (2) require participation in the projects to be voluntary and include informed consent.(Sec. 823) The SSA must carry out a pilot program to test the effect on beneficiary earnings of changes in how earnings are treated for the purpose of ongoing DI benefit eligibility. Under the demonstration, the existing ""cash cliff"" under which beneficiaries lose their entire benefit after exceeding the earnings threshold would be replaced by a benefit offset under which the DI benefit is reduced by $1 for every $2 of earnings in excess of a threshold.(Sec. 824) The SSA may obtain, with beneficiary consent, data on beneficiary earnings from payroll providers through a data exchange. Individuals for whom the SSA obtains earnings data from these sources are exempt from the requirement to report their own earnings.(Sec. 825) The SSA may simplify the process of evaluating a beneficiary's earnings derived from services by presuming that wages and salaries were earned in: (1) the month in which the services were performed for making a determination of initial entitlement on the basis of disability, and (2) the month in which the earnings were paid for any other purpose. These presumptions apply unless information is available that shows when the income was earned.(Sec. 826) The SSA must permit DI beneficiaries to report their earnings electronically, including by telephone and Internet, based on the system that is currently available to Supplemental Security Income recipients.Subtitle C--Protecting Social Security Benefits(Sec. 831) Provisions in the Social Security Act related to deemed filing, dual entitlement, and benefit suspension are amended to prevent individuals from obtaining larger benefits than Congress intended.(Sec. 832) In making an initial determination of disability, the SSA must make every reasonable effort to ensure that a qualified physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist has completed the medical portion of the case review.(Sec. 833) Specified payroll tax revenues are reallocated to the Disability Insurance Trust Fund to pay benefits until 2022.(Sec. 834) The SSA may verify certain financial information when an individual requests a waiver of an overpayment because they are without fault and unable to repay the funds.Subtitle D--Relieving Administrative Burdens and Miscellaneous Provisions(Sec. 841) Under current law, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) must reduce disability payments made to a Federal Employment Retirement (FERS) annuitant who also receives Social Security disability benefits. The bill increases interagency coordination by permitting SSA to repay the OPM the amount of overpaid FERS benefits if the individual is eligible for DI and entitled to an award of past-due benefits. The overpaid amounts are deducted from the past-due Social Security payment.(Sec. 842) The requirement that the SSA make determinations every five years relating to wage credits for military service prior to 1957 is eliminated after the 2010 determination.(Sec. 843) Electronic certification to the Railroad Retirement Board is permitted for benefits payable to a divorced spouse of a railroad worker.(Sec. 844) Technical and conforming changes are made to eliminate obsolete provisions from the Social Security Act.(Sec. 845) The SSA must report to Congress on: (1) fraud prevention activities and improper payments, (2) work-related continuing disability reviews, and (3) overpayment waivers.(Sec. 846) The SSA may request that OPM hold additional examinations for the purpose of hiring Administrative Law Judges as needed.TITLE IX--TEMPORARY EXTENSION OF PUBLIC DEBT LIMIT(Sec. 901) The public debt limit is suspended through March 15, 2017.

The FCC must also identify at least 1 gigahertz within a specified range for such use.TITLE XI--REVENUE PROVISIONS RELATED TO TAX COMPLIANCE(Sec. 1101) This section amends the Internal Revenue Code to revise rules for audits of large for-profit partnerships (partnerships with more than 100 partners). Existing audit rules for such partnerships are repealed and partnerships with fewer than 100 partners are granted an election to opt out of the provisions of this Act.The new audit rules require that: (1) any adjustment to items of partnership income, gain, loss, deductions, or credits be determined at the partnership level, instead of for each individual partner; (2) each partner's return be consistent with the partnership return; (3) each partnership designate a partner or other person with a substantial presence in the United States as the partnership representative to act as the sole authority on behalf of the partnership; and (4) notice be given to the partnership and the partnership representative of any administrative proceeding initiated at the partnership level, of any proposed partnership adjustment resulting from such proceeding, and of any final partnership adjustment resulting from such proceeding.The partnership may file a petition for readjustment of any partnership item within 90 days after the date on which a notice of a final partnership adjustment is mailed to the partnership. The petition may be filed with the U.S. Tax Court, a U.S. district court for the district in which the partnership's principal place of business is located, or the U.S. Court of Claims.The period for making adjustments to a partnership return is limited to the date that is three years (six years in the case of a substantial omission of income) after the latest of the date on which the partnership return was filed, the return due date for the taxable year, or the date on which the partnership filed an administrative adjustment request. No limit applies in the case of a false or fraudulent partnership return or if no return is filed.(Sec. 1102) This section sets forth a rule with respect to partnership interests created by gift to provide that in the case of a capital interest in a partnership in which capital is a material income-producing factor, the determination of whether a person is a partner with respect to such interest is made without regard to whether such interest was derived by gift from any other person. This new rule applies to partnership taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.TITLE XII--DESIGNATION OF SMALL HOUSE ROTUNDAThis title designates the first floor of the area of the House of Representatives wing of the U.S. Capitol known as the small House rotunda as the ""Freedom Foyer.""Site Content"

Keep calm and keep the secrets! The Patronus Charm (Expecto Patronum) is the most famous and one of the most powerful defensive charms known to wizardkind. It is an immensely complicated and extremely difficult spell, that evokes a partially-tangible positive energy force known as a Patronus (pl. Patronuses) or spirit guardian. It is the primary protection against Dementors and Lethifolds, against which there are no other defence. There are two types of Patronuses: corporeal which means a Patronus with a particular shape and form and uncorporeal Patronus. Uncorporeal Patronuses have no particular shape and do not protect against dementors the way corporeal Patronuses do. However, some wizards like Remus Lupin choose to cast uncorporeal Patronuses to hide their identity. It is evident from old woodcuts and scrolls that the Patronus Charm has been used since ancient times. Therefore, it is unknown who created it, or when it was first invented. The charm also has a long association with those fighting for lofty or noble causes (those able to produce corporeal Patronuses were often elected to high office within the Wizengamot and Ministry of Magic). According to legend one of the most famous Patronuses of all time was a lowly mouse, which belonged to a young wizard called Illyius. Illyius cast the Patronus Charm when his village was being attacked by the Dark wizard Raczidian and his army of Dementors. Despite the mouse's diminutive size, it shone with a brilliant light, bringing the Dementors to a halt as it nimbly moved through the ranks of fleeing villagers. Enraged, Raczidian decided to enter the fray himself, and tried to summon a Patronus to ward off Illyius's mouse. However, he failed to remember that only the pure of heart can produce a Patronus, and thus for the first time in history, it was revealed what happens when a competent, but unworthy wizard or witch attempts the spell. Maggots shot out of Raczidian's wand and quickly devoured him as they engulfed his entire body. The villagers hailed Illyius as a hero. Harry Potter took anti-dementor lessons in order to learn the advanced charm and so was one of the youngest to attempt this charm with actual results. During a Quidditch match against Ravenclaw in 1994 he cast his very first corporeal Patronus and again in June when he along with Hermione Granger and Sirius Black were being attacked by over a hundred Dementors, he cast a corporeal Patronus powerful enough to drive them all away. In 1995, Harry cast the charm against a boggart that he thought was a dementor during the third task of the Triwizard Tournament. The following summer he came under attack by two Dementors and managed to drive them away with the charm, leading to him being put on trial for underage magic in an attempt to discredit him. Harry Potter teaching the members of the D.A. Harry also taught the members of Dumbledore's Army the charm and some were even successful in casting it. The charm was used frequently to ward off dementors such as when the trio escaped from the Ministry of Magic after obtaining the Horcrux locket and during the Battle of Hogwarts. Severus Snape also conjured a Patronus to guide Harry to the hiding place of the Sword of Gryffindor. The Order of the Phoenix would send out messages with their Patronuses such as Kingsley Shacklebolt and Arthur Weasley who in 1997 delivered warnings. The Patronus represents that which is hidden, unknown but necessary within the personality. When a human confronted with inhuman evil, such as the Dementor, they must draw upon resources he or she may never have needed, and the Patronus is the awakened secret self that lies dormant until needed, but which must now be brought to light. Patronuses take forms that their casters might not expect, for which they have never felt a particular affinity, or (in rare cases) even recognise. Every Patronus is as unique as its creator and even identical twins have been known to produce very different Patronuses. The unusual witches and wizards who produce a Patronus that takes the form of their favourite animal is an indicator of obsession or eccentricity. Here is a wizard who may not be able to hide their essential self in common life, who may, indeed, parade tendencies that others might prefer to conceal. Whatever the form of their Patronus, you would be well-advised to show respect, and occasionally caution, towards a witch or wizard who produces the Patronus of their choice. The vast majority of witches and wizards are unable to produce any form of Patronus, and to create even an intangible one is generally considered a mark of superior magical ability.Rubeus Hagrid is an example of a wizard that cannot conjure any form of Patronus, as the charm is too difficult for him. Given their long affinity with humans it is perhaps unsurprising that among the most common Patronuses when cast (although it must be remembered that any corporeal Patronus is highly unusual) are dogs, cats, and horses. To successfully cast the spell, one begins by mustering the happiest memory they can think of (the happier the memory, the better the charm will work). Alternatively, one could imagine a scenario that would make for a very happy memory, as Harry did for his D.A.D.A. O.W.L. The next step is to begin drawing circles with their wand so as to increase the power of their spell. They must then say the incantation, Expecto Patronum; the Patronus will come from the tip of the wand and can be directed towards a target by pointing one's wand at said target. It is possible to disguise the form one's Patronus takes, which was done both by Severus Snape to hide his love for Lily Evans, and by Remus Lupin, who felt it would give away his condition. Also some witches and wizards may be unable to produce a Patronus at all until they have undergone some kind of psychic shock. The Patronus Charm is widely regarded as advanced magic, far beyond N.E.W.T.-level; in 1994 Remus Lupin stated that the charm was, in fact ""ridiculously advanced"". This charm was, indeed, so perilous, few wizards/witches could conjure up a true Patronus. It is very complex and many qualified wizards and witches have trouble with it. In fact, Harry Potter is one of the youngest known wizards able to cast a Patronus; he was taught how to do so in early 1994 at the age of thirteen by Remus Lupin. In a Dumbledore's Army lesson, Harry taught the members how to use the charm. Some were even successful in casting a corporeal form, though Harry said this might be because there was no Dementor to make them frightened. However, three members were later able to cast corporeal Patronuses in the presence of Dementors. Being able to cast a patronus, whilst fighting Dementors or not, is not required to graduate from Hogwarts so it is something that is taught under special circumstances. Amelia Bones and potential members of the D.A. were all very impressed when Harry Potter revealed that he could cast not only a Patronus Charm but a corporeal one to boot, which is notably more difficult than casting an incorporeal one. Given that the success of the charm is directly reliant on the caster retaining a particular mental state the Charm is more difficult to cast in emotionally trying circumstances. For instance, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger all had difficulty casting their Patronuses when under the negative influence of Salazar Slytherin's Locket, one of Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes, and after witnessing the death of Fred Weasley in the final battle. This feature of the Charm is particularly unfortunate since the Charm's primary use is to defend against Dementors, Dark creatures specifically equipped to mentally unhinge people (and hence is partly why it is regarded as such advanced, difficult magic). Self-confidence may also play an important role in casting the spell. In 1994 Harry is able to cast the spell successfully, driving off a large number of Dementors (which according to Severus Snape is only achievable by a very powerful wizard) thus saving Sirius and a younger version of himself, seemingly without recalling a happy memory, when he realises that he has already done it, although Harry could have had a 'happy memory' upon realising that he had saved all three of their souls. It is a general belief held by the wizarding world that only those who are pure of heart are able to cast Patronuses; this, however, is untrue, as several characters with negative personality traits are able to cast a fully-fledged Patronus. Although generally Dark witches and wizards will not try to produce a Patronus, not having any need for one, most Dark wizards will be devoured by maggots coming from their wand and consuming the caster. For this reason, Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters were not able to cast a Patronus Charm (not that it was necessary, as they already had the dark creatures under their control via their affinity to darkness, and would have no use for Patronuses). However, some witches and wizards of questionable morals, such as Dolores Umbridge, are able to produce corporeal Patronuses, with Umbridge doing so despite the fact that she was considered an evil person; her wearing of Salazar Slytherin's Locket, which was one of Voldemort's Horcruxes, was what enhanced her strength due to her evil affinity. She was able to produce a corporeal Patronus due to the enhanced strength. Conversely, Draco Malfoy was unable to cast one despite his waning evil. Severus Snape is the only Death Eater capable of casting the charm, his love for Lily Evans being his redeeming point. A successfully conjured Patronus can take two forms: non-corporeal or corporeal, and both types vary greatly in their appearances and strength. An incorporeal Patronus is one which does not resemble any living creature and has few distinguishing features (if any). Incorporeal Patronuses resemble a burst of vapour or smoke without any clearly defined form shooting from the tip of the wand. While they may be partially effective at halting dementors (but not repelling them) and shielding the caster from them, incorporeal Patronuses are not ""fully-fledged"" Patronuses, and are regarded as a more primitive or weaker version of the true Charm. A corporeal Patronus is one that is fully-formed, taking the shape of bright-white, translucent animal. The specific animal forms that corporeal Patronuses take vary from person to person and reflect each individual's innermost personality. Patronus forms, however, are subject to change if the caster goes through an emotional upheaval of some sort, including falling in eternal, unchanging love. For example, Nymphadora Tonks's Patronus changed from its previous form to that of a four-legged creature which others guessed was a wolf because then it would reflect her love of Remus Lupin, himself a werewolf. Another example is Severus Snape, whose Patronus was that of a doe, the same as Lily Evans, though this may have been the case all along rather than a change from its original form, as Snape was in love with Lily for most of his life. Based on the fact that Patronuses are conjured by recalling happy memories, it stands to reason that a Patronus might change its form after one falls in love and the memories used to conjure the Patronus largely revolve around the person the caster is in love with. In addition, it seems that some couples have ""complementary"" Patronuses (male and female forms of the same animal), such as Lily and James Potter. It is, however, unknown if this is a coincidence or not. If a wizard is an Animagus and can summon a corporeal Patronus, the two may take the same form, as was the case for Minerva McGonagall and James Potter. Remus Lupin's Patronus takes the form of a wolf, rather than a werewolf; whether or not all werewolves would generate a similar Patronus is unknown. Most Patronuses take the form of an ordinary animal. Magical creatures, such as Albus Dumbledore's phoenix Patronus, are uncommon. It is extremely rare for Patronuses to take the form of extinct animals.Hedley Fleetwood's woolly mammoth Patronus is a notable exception.Andros the Invincible was the only wizard capable of casting a Patronus the size of a Giant, although whether it was a giant or not is unknown. The corporeal Patronus is also better at repelling Dementors than the non-corporeal form. There are two known uses for the Patronus Charm. The first and main use of the Patronus is to drive off certain Dark creatures, such as Dementors and Lethifolds, and is the only known charm that will work against them. As Dementors feed on happy memories to render humans to drown in sorrow and sadness, the Patronus acts as a shield of sorts, of which the Dementor would try to feed off instead — the Patronus is comprised exclusively of positive feelings and cannot comprehend negative emotion, so the Dementor's influence cannot affect it. The other use was devised by Albus Dumbledore, who invented a way of using the Patronus (corporeal and non) as a means of communication. They can deliver messages, speaking with the voice of the caster. This source of communication is believed to be exclusive to the members of the Order of the Phoenix. Using the Patronus for communication offers great advantages in security, as Patronuses identify the caster and are Dark Arts-proof. A good example of this was when Minerva McGonagall used her feline Patronus to call for help to the other heads of houses, in 1998 when she found out Harry Potter had returned to Hogwarts in search of Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem. Multiple Patronuses can be cast for communication, as McGonagall was able to create three. Another is when Severus Snape used his Patronus to lead Harry Potter to a pool in the Forest of Dean in 1997, where he had laid Godric Gryffindor's Sword for Harry to retrieve. It is unknown if Snape had conjured the Patronus with instructions or if he was hiding and controlling it for this task. Harry's was able to follow both oral and physical commands. They also only remain active whilst the caster is focusing on them. If they are not protecting anyone, Patronuses seem to take on the traits of the creature they resemble and generally follow their caster around. This makes it unsure whether or not they are sentient. Stated on his Chocolate Frog Card as the only wizard to make a Patronus that size. Initially, Illyius's fellow villagers mocked him as they had never seen such a small and weak-looking Patronus, which corresponded to Illyius's timidity and tongue-tiedness. However, when dark wizard Raczidian invaded the village with his army of Dementors, Illyius's mouse Patronus proved to be stronger than the others, making him a hero. In Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, it's recorded that he cast off a Lethifold by performing the Patronus Charm. It says the Lethifold was thrown into the air on the horns of his Patronus. Summoned outside the Hog's Head in an attempt to convince the Death Eaters who had seen Harry's Patronus that they really saw a goat. The bird whose loyalty he earned, Fawkes, was a phoenix. Also he used it in 1995 as a message to Hagrid when Krum was stunned. It was described as ""a ghostly bird that flew off in the direction of Hagrid's house"". He could not yet produce a fully formed corporeal Patronus in Dumbledore's Army, though in the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998, he managed a Patronus in the shape of a fox. An unusual form due to the extreme rarity of extinct Patronuses. Seen in the last Dumbledore's Army meeting in 1996. It is apparently the only spell Hermione has trouble with, as said in 1997 while escaping from the Ministry of Magic. Harry's Patronus is in the shape of his father's Animagus form and Patronus. He learned how to conjure a Patronus at an exceptionally young age. James' Animagus form was also that of a stag. Just before the Battle of Hogwarts, she sent her Patronus out to alert the other Heads of House that Hogwarts Castle would soon be under attack by Lord Voldemort and his followers. While interrogating Muggle-borns at a trial, she had cast a Patronus to ward the Dementors from the prosecutors. Her favourite animal, as shown by the many plates with cats on them in her office. She was able to cast the Patronus due to her affinity with the locket Horcrux's evil influence. Mentioned in conjunction with Snape's Patronus. It was also the female form of her husband's Patronus. Acted as Harry's guide through the woods to where Godric Gryffindor's Sword was hidden. Snape's Patronus mirrored Lily's due to his unspoken love for her that began when they were small children. Cast by Severus Snape to aid Scorpius Malfoy and himself in the alternate reality created by Albus Potter and Scorpius in 2020. An unusual form that was very powerful despite its tiny size. Seen in 1997 when he warned the Order during Bill and Fleur's wedding of the downfall of the Ministry of Magic and Rufus Scrimgeour's death. The form of Tonks' Patronus changed in 1996. It became a wolf due to her love for Remus Lupin. Changes of Patronus are rare and usually caused by devastating life traumas. Occasionally when a witch and a wizard are married, their Patronuses will match each other (most likely because the witch/wizard's happy thought will be that of their spouse). Remus often deliberately disguised the form of his Patronus because he felt that it would give away too much about his condition. First seen when he sent a message about Rufus Scrimgeour's arrival on Harry's seventeenth birthday. Later seen when Arthur sent a Patronus to 12 Grimmauld Place to inform Harry, Ron and Hermione that the Weasley family was safe. Patronus means ""protector"", ""guardian"", or simply ""patron"" in Latin, specifically reflecting the entire role that the Patronus Charm plays. In archaic Latin, it meant ""father"", which is very interesting, considering that Harry Potter's Patronus is the same as his father's Patronus and Animagus form, a stag. The Latin word exspecto or expecto means ""I look out for"" or ""I wait for"", thus the charm's incantation roughly translates into ""I await a protector."" The spell as seen in the third video gamePatronus Charm[Source]. SPSexpecto from SpellShapes.utx from the texture files of the third video game PC version. The Patronuses of James Potter and Minerva McGonagall match their respective Animagi form. These are the only characters whose Patronus and Animagus forms are known. It is uncertain whether all Patronuses will match the form of the Animagus, but so far, an instance of differing forms has not been revealed. Similarly Remus Lupin's Patronus is a wolf, but whether this is a universal among werewolves or not is unknown. Similarly Remus Lupin's Patronus is a wolf, but whether this is a universal among werewolves or not is unknown. In the first chapter of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, a white peacock appears in the gardens of Malfoy Manor. Some fans believed this bird to be Lucius Malfoy's Patronus. However, J. K. Rowling stated that no Death Eater except Severus Snape could (or had a need to) conjure a Patronus, because Death Eaters fight alongside that which Patronuses fight against. This means that the peacock was in fact a living creature. It is stated in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows that the creature was in fact an albino peacock. In the video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, the more moderate Expecto Patronum is a ball of light. In the console versions, it works as a guided-missile that can only be steered left or right, and accelerate. In the PC version, before cast, a white ring goes up Harry's arm and if it reaches top of the wand, Harry has to try the spell again, and it is used only to attack Dementors (it also produces lightning effects). At the climax of the game, a stag (Harry's Patronus) jumps out of the wand to drive away all the Dementors nearby attacking Harry and Sirius, and its during that battle in the console versions, Harry's Patronus changes into a stag with altered controls. In the said video game, the first video game adaption of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, and LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4/5-7 the Patronus Charm appears to push the Dementors away with the first shot, and a second shot kills them. The lecture that Harry gives on Patronuses to Dumbledore's Army in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is extremely similar to the lecture Remus Lupin gave him in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. In the third book when Dementors attack Harry, Hermione and Sirius, Harry's Patronus is very weak and thin (based on how there were tons of Dementors) yet the Dementors were still unable to pass through it. One Dementor was able to make it vanish by gesturing at it though. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, Dolores Umbridge's Patronus seems to emanate a shield that keeps the Dementors separated from everyone in the courtroom. In addition, Kingsley Shacklebolt's Patronus is described in the novel as taking the form of a lynx, however in the film it is depicted as a shimmering comet of light from which springs silvery images of witches and wizards screaming in terror as Kingsley's voice details the death of Scrimgeour and the fall of the Ministry. In LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4, Voldemort, Lucius Malfoy, Walden Macnair, Barty Crouch Jr, and an unnamed Death Eater can all cast the spell, despite the fact that Rowling stated that no Death Eater besides Severus Snape could produce a Patronus. It is most likely that this was simply incorporated for gameplay purposes. According to W.O.M.B.A.T., it is possible that Patronuses vary in strength according to which animal's form they take. Later canon from Wonderbook: Book of Spells, however, stresses that this is not the case and that the form of the animal has no correlation to the strength of the Patronus (see, for instance, Illyius and Symposia Rawle). The Patronus spellbook, owned by Remus Lupin, includes information and instruction on the Patronus Charm. In an interview, J. K. Rowling stated that the happy memory that would produce the strongest Patronus for her would be the births of any of her three children, though a close fourth would be when she learned that Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was going to be published. She has also stated that she'd like for her Patronus to be an otter, like Hermione's, but she has a feeling it might actually be a large dog. However, in a message on Twitter in 2014, she claimed it would be a pine marten. Additionally, in a 2000 interview, she stated that the Patronus Charm was her favourite spell in the series so far. Rowling later revealed that a pine marten was what she had tested as in the initial form of the Patronus test that was later posted on Pottermore. She took the test again in its final form and tested as a heron. Luna Lovegood's hare Patronus is possibly a reference to the moon rabbit, a figure in East Asian mythology. Learning to cast a Patronus is one of the tasks given to the player in the final Chapter of the game Wonderbook: Book of Spells. For learning the incantation and gesture, the player is given the Trophy ""Expecto Patronum!"" On the next page, the player is given the chance to cast a true Patronus, the form of which is apparently chosen randomly. Amongst the possible Patronuses are a bat, a bull, a cat, a goat, a horse, a rabbit, a scorpion and a snake. J.K Rowling has stated the only way that a Patronus is able to change its current form is through eternal unchangable love. Although J. K. Rowling has stated that the plural form is Patronuses and not Patroni, the German translation always translates it as Patroni. J. K. Rowling confirmed on 21 August 2015 on Twitter that Rubeus Hagrid was not able to conjure a Patronus, though he was a member of the Order of the Phoenix. On 22 September, 2016, Pottermore unveiled the long-awaited and discussed option for members of the site to determine their patronus. This takes the form of a quiz of several questions that can only be taken once, at which point the member's patronus is revealed and added to their member profile. When Joanne K. Rowling was asked about the form of Newton Scamander's Patronus, she said that it would be a spoiler to future films of the Fantastic Beasts series. On Pottermore, a horse Patronus can be of several different colours, though all Patronuses are silver. It's unknown how hard the difference is to tell in-universe and all horse Patronuses look the same, or at least very similar, on Pottermore. In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Harry's Patronus physically attacks the Dementors by charging at them, as depicted in the books, with the first successful patronus shield he conjured being used to force a Boggart in the form of a Dementor back into its trunk. Also, Patronuses produced by the members of Dumbledore's Army make noises and are capable of interacting with physical objects, such as Ron's dog Patronus knocking over Neville Longbottom. Also, in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, Umbridge's Patronus was heard hissing. There was a noted change in appearance of Patronuses in general in the Order of the Phoenix movie. In movies 5-8, Patronuses appear to be very wispy and airy, while in the third film they look more substantial, solid and brighter. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, during the infiltration of the Ministry of Magic, Umbridge's Patronus was very clearly seen several times in the same scene and often looked less like a cat and more like a reanimated, feline corpse, with the skeletal features visible. This is odd for a Patronus (they usually look quite 'alive' and well) and its twisted form may be a nod to both Umbridge's nature and the circumstances under which it was cast. In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, the Patronus in its powerful wave-like form emits a deep reverberating sound. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 this effect was also used when Aberforth Dumbledore protected Hogwarts from Dementors. The Harry Potter Wiki has 276 images related to Patronus Charm."	
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/pentagon-spends-powerball-tickets/	the pentagon purchased five million powerball tickets at a cost of $10 million so they could buy more f-35s if they won. see example( s )	false	['actually funny satire', ' duffel blog', ' pentagon', ' powerball']	http://www.duffelblog.com/	http://www.duffelblog.com/2016/01/pentagon-spends-10-million-on-powerball-tickets-with-hopes-of-bolstering-f-35-program/#ixzz3x9EqoAgG	2016/01/13	Share TweetTHE PENTAGON — The Department of Defense announced today that it has purchased five million Powerball tickets at a cost of $2 per ticket, with an aim of providing a funding windfall to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program.“This is a minor fiscal gamble, but the Pentagon is always willing to lay out a few extra bucks in order to ensure we continue to have the most advanced military in the world,” said Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter, flashing a giddy smile. “Daddy needs a new pair of shoes, and a dozen new F-35s for the Navy’s Pacific Fleet.”The F-35 program has been beleaguered by cost overruns, with a projected lifetime program cost of at least $1.5 trillion. The estimated $1.5 billion dollar Powerball jackpot would amount to only one-tenth of one percent of the total program cost, but it’s an important step in the Pentagon’s search for additional sources of revenue in the face of Congressional questions about the program. With the odds of winning the Powerball jackpot standing at 1-in-292,000,000, the five million tickets give the Pentagon a 1-in-58 chance of winning the jackpot.A reporter brought to Carter’s attention that the jackpot only totals $1.5 billion dollar jackpot if the Pentagon elects to take the annuity paid out over 29 years, and the alternative lump sum payment would amount to less than $900 million.“Well, shit,” said Carter. “There’s no sense in taking a 29-year annuity when the F-35 will be obsolete by that time and on the auction block to Iran and Saudi Arabia. But the lump sum payment would still buy three or four F-35s today, I believe.”The reporter then pointed out the IRS would take almost half of the lump sum payout, leaving the Pentagon with around $500 million. They also noted the Navy’s F-35C variant costs $337 million per unit, leaving the Pentagon able to buy less than two F-35s for the Navy.“I don’t understand why you guys would even question this,” said a visibly frustrated Carter. “That would still be two more F-35s than we had previously, with a capital expenditure of only ten million dollars in Powerball tickets. That’s a steal.”Some reporters were critical of the Pentagon gambling taxpayer money in a lottery, leading Carter to become more defensive.“Look, we’ve already wast—er, expended an extraordinary amount of taxpayer money on this program, so a paltry $10 million is a drop in the bucket,” said a defiant Carter. “No one would have ever noticed this program accruing an extra $10 million in costs if we hadn’t announced it. That’s a damn rounding error.”As reporters vied to ask the next question, Carter complained, “Gee, I thought you guys would have been more excited about this announcement,” before throwing his hands in the air in exasperation and walking away from the podium.UPDATE: Duffel Blog has learned that due to a clerical error the Pentagon submitted only five combinations of numbers, with each combination submitted a million times. This has reduced the Pentagon’s chances of winning the Powerball jackpot from 1-in-58 to 1-in-58,000,000. Despite the setback, Carter remains optimistic the Pentagon will now be holding a million winning Powerball tickets.Recommended For You:

Mixture	['animal cruelty', ' animals', ' municipal scams', ' pig', ' pig cage', ' pig farms', ' pig pen']	https://www.aspca.org/	https://www.aspca.org/animal-cruelty/factory-farms/animals-factory-farms	2016/01/13	"A Closer Look at Animals on Factory FarmsChickensThe United States raises and slaughters almost 10 times more birds than any other type of animal. Approximately 8.5 billion chickens are killed for their meat every year, while another 300 million chickens are used in egg production. All birds—egg-laying hens, meat chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese and others—are excluded from all federal animal protection laws. By the numbers, these are the animals most urgently in need of protection. The ASPCA is focused on raising public awareness about the plight of chickens raised for meat and is working actively with companies that buy or raise chickens toward the adoption of better practices .Many people do not realize that the breed of chicken used for modern egg production is different than the breed used for meat production. If you put them next to each other, they look almost nothing alike! Each has been strategically bred for hyper-production: egg-laying hens for high egg volume, and “meat” chickens for maximum breast meat. Both types suffer from severe physical problems brought on by genetic manipulation. Read our report to learn more about the negative impacts of selective breeding in the chicken industry.Expand to read moreChickens Raised for Meat (“Broiler” Chickens)Nearly all meat chickens are raised indoors in large sheds containing 20,000 chickens or more. The chickens live crammed together on the shed floor. Because they live in their own waste, high ammonia levels irritate and burn their eyes, throats and skin.Modern factory-farmed chickens look very little like their wild chicken ancestors. Thanks to selective breeding—combined with low-dose antibiotics, excessive feeding and inadequate exercise—factory-farmed meat chickens grow unnaturally quickly and disproportionately. While their breasts grow large to meet market demand, their skeletons and organs lag behind. Many suffer heart failure, trouble breathing, leg weakness and chronic pain. Some cannot support their own weight and become crippled, unable to reach food and water.To keep them eating and growing, factory farms restrict chickens’ sleep by keeping the lights on almost all the time. As they grow, meat chickens become crowded together, competing for space. This constant interaction makes sleep even harder. As chickens die, their bodies are sometimes left among the living, adding to the stress and unhygienic conditions. Learn much more about this issue in our paper, A Growing Problem .Quick FactsIn 1925, it took 16 weeks to raise a chicken to 2.5 pounds. Today, chickens weigh double that in just six weeks!According to the University of Arkansas, if humans grew at a similar rate, a 6.6-pound newborn baby would weigh 660 pounds after two months.Chickens experience REM sleep, which is associated with dreaming. Unfortunately, on factory farms, lights are kept on almost all day and night to encourage more eating (and growth), which means chickens are chronically sleep-deprived. Progress for ChickensSome companies are developing policies and making commitments to address the effects of fast growth rate. Check out our video explaining the problem with broiler growth rates. Welfare-conscious companies and consumers are committing to certification programs that address the effects of fast growth and also require adequate space, more natural lighting cycles and enrichment for birds. Learn more in our Meat, Eggs and Dairy Label Guide .Because meat chickens represent the most numerous and some of the most abused animals in our food system, please demand change by pledging to Shop With Your Heart .Egg-Laying HensMost egg-laying hens in the U.S. live on factory farms in long, windowless sheds containing rows of stacked “battery cages.” Up to 10 hens are packed together in one wire cage roughly the size of a file drawer. The frustration of living in such tight quarters sometimes leads to fighting. To lessen this problem, factory farms burn or slice off a portion of each hen’s beak (without painkillers). Hens who become sick often do not receive veterinary care or proper euthanasia, and are left to slowly die. This is not surprising given that a single shed may house tens of thousands of birds packed closely together, with many stacked in tiered cages that make them difficult to see and access.Where do egg-laying hens come from? A side-industry exists solely for the purpose of hatching them. Only female chicks will grow up to lay eggs, but half of the chicks born in these hatcheries are male. There is no market for the male chicks, as they are the wrong breed to raise for meat—so shortly after they hatch, they are killed by grinding, gassing, crushing or suffocation.When a hen’s egg production drops due to age, some farms will withhold proper nutrition for up to two weeks to shock the bird’s body into a final laying cycle. Once this “forced molting” phase is over, a hen is “worth” very little. Some are killed on-farm while others are sent to slaughter, their battered bodies used for food scraps.Quick FactsBattery cages provide less floor space per bird than a regular 8.5-by-11"" sheet of paper.A mother hen in a natural environment begins to teach calls to her chicks before they hatch.The European Union banned battery cages in 1999 (allowing a 12-year phase out period, which is now completed).Progress for HensMore than 100 retailers and companies have set policies going 100% cage-free. Welfare-conscious consumers and companies are committing to certifications that ban cages and also address de-beaking and require adequate space, nest boxes and other enrichments. Learn more in our Meat, Eggs and Dairy Label Guide . PigsThe U.S. raises some 100 million pigs for food each year, the vast majority of them on industrial-scale farms known for their crowded, inhumane conditions. At just two to three weeks old, piglets are removed from their mothers and placed in large, windowless sheds without fresh air, sunlight or outdoor access. Their pens are too small and crowded for adequate movement and exercise, and have hard slatted floors that prevent natural behaviors like rooting. Ammonia fumes rise to dangerous, uncomfortable levels due to the pigs’ waste.Expand to read morePigs tend to be extremely curious and intelligent, so their barren surroundings cause them extreme frustration. The tail-biting that sometimes results leads farms to cut off the ends of pigs’ tails, and their teeth, without painkillers.Most female breeding pigs (called sows) in the U.S. spend their reproductive lives confined to a gestation crate. These crates are barely bigger than the sow’s body and prohibit her from turning around. Sows are artificially inseminated and kept in their gestation stalls until a few days before birth; at which time they are moved to equally restrictive farrowing crates to give birth. They remain there while nursing their young, and then are placed back in their gestation crates and re-inseminated. This cycle continues for several years, until the sows are no longer as productive and are sent to slaughter. Quick FactsIn natural environments, about 24 hours before giving birth pregnant pigs will leave their social group to collect branches and soft materials to build a nest. The mother will stay isolated in her nest with her newborns for the first week, which allows her to develop a strong bond with her piglets.Both male and female pigs are raised for food.Pigs are as smart as or smarter than most dogs. They are one of only a few species Americans consider suitable for both keeping as pets and raising for food.Progress for PigsSome states have banned the use of gestation crates. See where your state stands on confinement bans and learn about the historic effort in Massachusetts to help mother pigs and other animals.Dozens of companies have explicitly banned gestation crates from being used by their pork suppliers.​Welfare-conscious consumers and companies are committing to animal welfare certification programs that ban cages and also address certain physical alterations, require more spacious and enriched group housing, and offer pigs adequate bedding and nesting materials. Learn more in our Meat, Eggs and Dairy Label Guide .CattleCattle are raised and processed across several distinct industries, all of which, in the U.S., rely heavily on inhumane factory farming. Expand to read moreBeef CattleCattle raised for meat are the only factory farmed animals still raised largely outdoors. However, this does not mean they have pain-free lives. They are branded, castrated and may have their horns removed without painkillers.Sometime between the ages of six months and one year, most beef cattle are sent to live their last few months in crowded feedlots with hundreds or thousands of others. Without pasture and often without shelter, the cattle must stand in mud, ice, and their own waste.Quick FactsCattle form close friendships and choose to spend much of their time with 2-4 preferred individuals. They also hold grudges for years and may dislike particular individuals.To increase their weight, beef cattle in feedlots are fed an unnatural grain diet that is very hard on their bodies, causing illness, pain and sometimes death.Virtually all beef cattle are “grass-raised” because they begin their lives on grass. “Grass-finished” distinguishes the few that are never sent to a feedlot.Progress for Beef CattleWelfare-conscious consumers and companies are committing to certifications that ban feed lots and require adequate space and better diets. Learn more in our Meat, Eggs and Dairy Label Guide .Dairy CowsMost cows used for dairy production are kept indoors, with some having access to outdoor concrete or dirt paddocks. Many are tethered by chains or other materials around their necks in what are called “tie stalls.” Unnaturally high milk production leads to mastitis, a painful bacterial infection causing a cow’s udder to swell. Dairy cows often have up to two-thirds of their tails removed without painkillers. Many producers believe the udder stays cleaner this way, even though this theory has been disproven. The cows are also dehorned and/or disbudded (have their horns, or developing horn material, cut or burned off), generally without painkillers.Just as with humans, cows only produce milk as a side effect of giving birth. To keep the milk flowing, dairy farms artificially inseminate cows once a year. Their gestation period lasts nine months, so the majority of dairy cows’ lives are spent pregnant. When a calf is born, he or she is removed from the mother—generally that same day—to make the mother’s milk available for collection. This is very traumatic to mother cows and to their calves. Male offspring are often raised for veal, while females become the next generation of dairy cows.While large-scale dairy operations are typically separate from beef cattle operations, these industries are connected. Dairy cows usually meet their ends at beef slaughterhouses when, at just two to five years of age, their milk production has slowed or they are too crippled or ill to continue in the industry. At that point, they are slaughtered for beef.Quick FactsToday’s dairy cows each produce about 100 pounds of milk per day, which is 10 times more than cows living just a few decades ago. This is due to bovine growth hormones, unnatural diets and being bred selectively for massive milk production. 75% of downed animals–animals who cannot stand and walk on their own–are dairy cows.About 9 million cows are being used for milk production in the United States at any given time.Progress for Dairy CowsStates including California, Ohio and Rhode Island have banned tail-docking of dairy cows and we expect more to follow.The American Veterinary Medical Association and the Association of Bovine Practitioners both oppose tail-docking for lack of evidence that it provides benefits.Welfare-conscious consumers and companies are committing to certifications that ban tail docking and tie stalls, require outdoor access, and provide guidance to reduce stress and pain from lameness and weaning. Learn more about these third-party-audited programs in our Meat, Eggs and Dairy Label Guide .Veal CalvesVeal is the meat of young male cattle born to dairy cows. As males, veal calves are of little use to the dairy industry, and as a dairy breed, they are inefficient beef producers.Traditional veal meat was made pale and tender by restricting calves’ diets and keeping them in stalls so small they could barely move. Increasingly, calves are housed in groups beginning at about six weeks old, but they still lack sufficient space, outdoor exercise, solid food and even the fulfillment of a most basic instinct: the need to suckle.At an age when they would normally be nurtured and protected by their mother, veal calves are often forced to live alone with no physical contact with other cattle. And while calves normally explore their world by grazing, playing and socializing, factory-farmed veal calves are generally kept indoors with few if any environmental enrichments.Quick FactsThe veal industry would not exist without the dairy industry. On industrial farms, calves are generally taken from their dairy-cow mothers within a day of birth to be raised for meat.Veal calves’ diets and movements are tightly restricted to keep their muscles from developing, which makes the resulting meat tender. Progress for Veal CalvesThe use of veal crates has dramatically declined since the American Veterinary Medical Association said that calves should be able to turn around and the veal industry's trade group recommended “that the entire veal industry convert to the group housing methodology.”TurkeysApproximately 238 million turkeys are raised for meat in the U.S. annually. Like chickens, most turkeys are housed in groups on the floors of long sheds where they are denied fresh air, sunshine and pasture. They are forced to breathe dangerously high levels of ammonia emanating from their own waste.Expand to read moreModern, factory-farmed turkeys look very little like their wild ancestors. For one, they are disproportionately breast-heavy (a result of genetic selection), reflecting a consumer preference for breast meat, and selective breeding has resulted in extremely accelerated growth. Their unnaturally fast and disproportionate growth causes turkeys extraordinary suffering, including pain and difficulty simply walking or breathing.Turkeys’ bodies have become so unnaturally disproportionate that they can no longer mate with one another. They are bred year-round via artificial insemination, damaging their bodies that were only meant to reproduce once per year.Quick FactsBetween 1965 and 2000, the weight of the average turkey raised for food in the U.S. increased by 57%.Turkeys have the innate urge to perch and fly, but the selectively bred turkeys on factory farms are too large to do so.Unlike the domestic turkey, wild turkeys can fly up to 55 miles per hour and run as fast as 25 miles per hour. Progress for TurkeysWelfare-conscious consumers and companies are committing to certifications that address certain physical alterations as well as the effects of fast growth and require adequate space, better lighting programs and other enrichments.

US tourists filmed UFO/strange orb entering Interdimensional Portal in the sky of Geneva, just over CERN area.The CERN project site is located in Geneva, Switzerland. The CERN functions as a Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the largest and most powerful particle accelerator in the World. A collider is the basic tool of particle physics. You take a stream of particles, accelerate them to really high kinetic energy levels, and initiate a collision to slam them into a target. Depending intensity of the experiment, all sorts of peculiar things can happen.As of in 2015, CERN reached levels of double potency over the 10 Tev barrier of dark matter – the theoretical minimal energy of formation of a ‘bag of strangelets’ and ‘micro-black holes’.More people have become more aware of the CERN project aggressive ambitions to explore the unknown ‘dark universe” many have pointed to signs that have people troubled if not terrified by the parade of symbolism used at the CERN facility itself. At CERN headquarters a symbol of Shiva, the (Hindu God of Destruction) dancing the cosmic dance of death and destruction can be clearly seen at the CERN facility. Is this a Symbolic declaration of CERN’s ultimate intention to bring on a new age of destruction to this planet?“The men who would play God, in searching for the God particle, are truly going to find more than they bargained for as they open the gates of hell” Stephen Quayle warns, “they will find inter-dimensional beings who have a taste for human flesh and humanities destruction. Most scientists, in lacking an understanding of the ‘supernatural entities’ that are going to confront them, are way beyond their ability to comprehend, let alone control, the forces of Pandora’s box that will be released.”Yet, on September 23, 2015, the 70th year of Jubilee, at beginning of the Fall equinox, and after the passage of 70 generations since the great flood that enveloped the whole planet CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC) research facility will initiate a monumental step into the unknown.A massive portal constructed by leading world scientists will be prepared to cause a much more intense particle collision that will rival the moment of the “big bang.” As a result a possible gateway for “dark matter” or alternate inter-dimensions can be perhaps initiated by CERN’s intense particle collision capability. This activity may indeed usher in a new age for all humanity and even this planet.Therefore, despite concerns and warnings from other leading science and theological experts a transcending portal will be left wide open and we have no way of knowing what will come forth from this massive particle collision induced gateway. In regards to the acknowledged revitalization of the CERN project mission to open an inter-dimensional portal many have become concerned, some fearful, others filled with curious intrigue over this date of September 23, 2015. However, only time will tell the significant impact 9/23 will have on humanity or on this planet.Therefore, As Sergio Bertolucci clearly stated publicly CERN is meant to open a gateway for “dark matter” and usher in the possibility of beings from alternate dimensions to emerge from it. These recent revelations about the CERN developments prove to us the scientific community is no longer able to explain ‘reality’ without looking at the ‘supernatural’.Hence, with this pronouncement of CERN’s pending capability to serve as a portal or doorway for “dark matter” humanity must buckle their seat belts for the new age to come by this imposing dabble with darkness.“For as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man” (Matt. 24: 37)Moreover, serious scientists regularly discuss the possibility of other dimensions and “wormholes” in books and on scientific documentaries for TV. In the bestselling book Hyperspace Michio Kaku refers to Flight 19 and the Bermuda Triangle :“Ever since Flight 19, a group of U.S. military torpedo bombers, vanished in the Caribbean 30 years ago, mystery writers too have used higher dimensions as a convenient solution to the puzzle of the Bermuda Triangle, or Devil’s Triangle. Some have conjectured that airplanes and ships disappearing in the Bermuda Triangle actually entered some sort of passageway to another world.”Could UFOS use interdimensional portals opening up above earth ?Watch the VIDEO HERE !Subscribe to Section 51 !

Using multivariable analysis, characteristics associated with not discussing HPV vaccination were examined.RESULTS: Response rates were 82% for pediatricians (364 of 442) and 56% for FP (218 of 387). For 11-12 year-old girls, 60% of pediatricians and 59% of FP strongly recommend HPV vaccine; for boys,52% and 41% ostrongly recommen. More than one-half reported ≥25% of parents deferred HPV vaccination. At the 11-12 year well visit, 84% of pediatricians and 75% of FP frequently/always discuss HPV vaccination. Compared with physicians who frequently/always discuss , those who occasionally/rarely discuss(18%) were more likely to be FP (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.0 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1–3.5), be male (aOR: 1.8 [95% CI: 1.1–3.1]), disagree that parents will accept HPV vaccine if discussed with other vaccines (aOR: 2.3 [95% CI: 1.3–4.2]), report that 25% to 49% (aOR: 2.8 [95% CI: 1.1–6.8]) or ≥50% (aOR: 7.8 [95% CI: 3.4–17.6]) of parents defer, and express concern about waning immunity (aOR: 3.4 [95% CI: 1.8–6.4]).CONCLUSIONS: Addressing physicians’ perceptions about parental acceptance of HPV vaccine, the possible advantages of discussing HPV vaccination with other recommended vaccines, and concerns about waning immunity could lead to increased vaccination rates.Abbreviations:American Academy of Family PhysiciansaOR —human papillomavirusWhat’s Known on This Subject:TheHPV vaccine could prevent thousands of cancers in the United States each year; however, HPV vaccine coverage is lower than for other adolescent vaccines and lower for boys. HPV vaccination is recommended for all 11- to 12-year-olds, but missed opportunities are common.What This Study Adds:Eighteen percent of physicians are not discussing the HPV vaccine at the 11- to 12-year-old well-child visit, likely contributing to missed opportunities. Physicians’ likelihood of initiating a conversation is diminished by an expectation that parents are likely to defer the vaccine.Almost 1 in 4 people in the United States is infected with at least 1 strain of human papillomavirus (HPV), and ∼27 000 cancers are likely caused by HPV each year. 1 , 2 Among these HPV-attributable cancers, 17 600 cases were diagnosed in women, with >10 000 of these cancers occurring in the cervix; 9300 cases were diagnosed in men, with >7000 occurring in the oropharynx. 1 Although cervical cancers are more common, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancers is increasing, and these cancers are 4 times more common in men than in women. 1 , 3 , 4 HPV infection also causes the majority of vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancers among women, and penile and anal cancers among men. 1 , 5The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended the HPV vaccine for routine use in girls in 2006 and for boys in 2011. 6 The committee recommended the vaccine for 11- to 12-year-olds because it is most effective if given before initiation of sexual activity and exposure to HPV and because 2 additional vaccines, the quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine and the tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine, are also recommended at this age. HPV vaccine coverage has remained lower than coverage for the other recommended adolescent vaccines. 7 National data suggest that 60% of 13- to 17-year-old girls have received at least 1 dose of HPV vaccine, and 40% have received all 3 doses. Boys have lower HPV vaccination rates than girls, with 42% coverage for 1 dose and 22% coverage for all 3 doses among 13- to 17-year-olds.Missed opportunities for HPV vaccination at 11 to 12 years of age are common. 8 Several factors, including financial issues, patient and parent refusal or deferral, and health care providers’ practices, likely contribute to these missed opportunities. 9 Because physicians’ practices could be modified to reduce missed opportunities and increase HPV vaccine coverage, the goal of the present study was to understand physicians’ current perspectives and practices related to HPV vaccination for girls and boys. Using a national sample of pediatricians and family physicians (FP), our objectives were to: (1) describe physicians’ self-reported practices regarding recommending and administering the HPV vaccine; (2) estimate how frequently physicians report parental deferral of HPV vaccination for their children in different age groups; and (3) estimate how frequently physicians discuss the HPV vaccine and identify physician and practice characteristics associated with not discussing the HPV vaccine at the 11- to 12-year-old well-child visit.MethodsStudy SettingThe Vaccine Policy Collaborative Initiative, a program designed collaboratively with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to assess primary care physicians’ attitudes regarding vaccine-related issues, administered a survey to a national network of pediatricians and FP. The human subjects review board at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus approved the study as exempt research.PopulationThe survey was conducted among networks of physicians previously recruited from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) to respond to several surveys annually. 10 After obtaining twice the number of recruits needed for each network, a quota strategy was applied to assure the representativeness of the samples. 10 , 11 In a previous evaluation, demographic characteristics, practice attributes, and reported attitudes about vaccination issues were shown to be generally similar between network physicians and physicians of the same specialties randomly sampled from the American Medical Association master physician listing. 10Survey DesignThe survey instrument was developed in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It included 21 questions, most with multiple parts, about characteristics of physicians and practices; physicians’ practices related to administration of, recommendation for, and discussion of the HPV vaccine; reasons for deferring discussion of the HPV vaccine; physicians’ knowledge and attitudes about HPV infection and the HPV vaccine; and physicians’ estimates of how often parents had deferred the HPV vaccine when it had been offered to their child. The survey also included questions about discussion of sexual health issues and barriers to vaccine administration, but these questions were not included in the present analysis. The survey was pretested in an advisory panel of 8 pediatricians and 5 FP from across the country and was pilot-tested among 81 pediatricians and 19 FP.Physicians’ self-reported practices and attitudes about the HPV vaccine and HPV infection were measured by using 4-point Likert scales. Physicians’ knowledge about the HPV vaccine and HPV-related diseases were measured by using statements to which respondents answered “agree,” “disagree,” or “don’t know/not sure.” Finally, physicians’ experience with deferral of the HPV vaccine was measured by asking them to estimate the proportion of parents who had deferred in the following categories: <1%, 1% to 9%, 10% to 24%, 25% to 49%, and ≥50%.Survey AdministrationThe survey was administered between October 2013 and January 2014 by using an Internet version or regular mail based on physicians’ preferences. The Internet survey was administered with a Web-based program (Vovici Corporation, Dulles, Virginia). The Internet group received an initial e-mail with a link to the survey and up to 8 e-mail reminders to complete the survey; the mail group received an initial mailing and up to 2 additional mailed surveys at 2-week intervals. The Internet nonresponders also received up to 2 paper surveys by mail. The physicians received no financial incentives for their participation.Analytic MethodsInternet and mail surveys were pooled for all analyses because provider attitudes have been found to be comparable when obtained by using either method. 12 We compared pediatricians and FP responses by using χ2 tests for questions with dichotomous responses and Mantel-Haenszel tests for questions with Likert scale responses. When responses of the pediatricians and FP were similar, they were combined for subsequent analyses. The Cochran-Armitage test for trend was used to compare the strength of recommendation for HPV vaccination across different age groups, and McNemar’s test was used to compare the strength of recommendation between boys and girls in each age group.A bivariate analysis was also conducted to compare the practice characteristics of physicians who reported experiencing more parental deferral (≥25%) versus physicians who reported less parental deferral (<25%) at the 11- to 12-year-old visit. Because physicians’ reported estimates of parental deferral were not significantly different between 11-to 12-year-old boys and girls overall, 1 deferral variable was created for each physician by choosing the higher estimate of deferral if an individual physician’s response differed for boys and girls.We compared physicians who reported that they rarely/never or occasionally discussed the HPV vaccine at the 11- to 12-year-old well-child visit with physicians who reported that they frequently or almost always/always discussed HPV vaccination at this age. Physicians who indicated that they rarely see 11- to 12-year-old girls or boys were excluded. Predictor variables were chosen based on existing literature and our hypothesis that physicians who had experienced more parental deferral at the 11- to 12-year-old visit would be less likely to discuss HPV vaccination at this visit. We compared physician and practice characteristics, belief that it is necessary to discuss sexual health issues when discussing the HPV vaccine, belief that parents are more likely to accept the HPV vaccine if discussed in the context of other vaccines given at the 11- to 12-year-old visit, knowledge that the antibody response to the HPV vaccine is stronger in younger adolescents compared with adults, concern about waning immunity, and estimates of the proportion of parents who had deferred the HPV vaccine for the discussion outcome; Wilcoxon tests and χ2 tests were used, as appropriate. Predictor variables with a P value ≤.25 were included in a multivariable logistic regression model. Variables were retained in the final model for P < .05.Finally, we conducted multivariable analyses comparing physicians who reported that they strongly recommend the HPV vaccine for 11- to 12-year-olds versus those who do not, with separate analyses for girls and boys. We used the same predictor variables and methods as described earlier for the analysis of discussion of HPV vaccine at the 11- to 12-year-old visit.ResultsResponse Rates and Respondent CharacteristicsThe survey response rate was 70% overall (582 of 829), with 82% of pediatricians (364 of 442) and 56% of FP (218 of 387) responding. Pediatrician responders did not differ from nonresponders in terms of gender, age, practice type, urban versus rural location, or region of the country. Compared with nonresponders, FP responders were more likely to be female and less likely to practice in the southern United States ( Table 1 ).View this table:Physician and Practice CharacteristicsPhysicians’ Current PracticesNinety-nine percent of pediatricians and 87% of FP administer the HPV vaccine to 11- to 18-year-old girls in their practices, whereas 98% of pediatricians and 81% of FP administer the vaccine to boys. Physicians were more likely to strongly recommend the HPV vaccine for older age groups (Mantel-Haenszel χ2 tests, P < .0001 for girls and boys), and in every age group, physicians were more likely to strongly recommend the vaccine for girls than for boys (McNemar’s test, P < .0001 for each age group) ( Table 2 ). Pediatricians were more likely to strongly recommend the HPV vaccine than FP except for 11- to 12-year-old girls (P ≤.0001).View this table:View popupTABLE 2Pediatrician and FP Strength of Recommendation for the HPV Vaccine in Male and Female Subjects According to Age Group (n = 557)Physicians’ Report of Parental Deferral of HPV VaccinationMore than one-half of physicians reported that when they offered the HPV vaccine, ≥25% of parents deferred vaccination for their 11- to 12-year-old children ( Fig 1 ). Physicians reported that parental deferral of the HPV vaccine was more common for 11- to 12-year-olds than for 13- to 15-year-olds (P < .0001 for both genders); frequency of deferral did not differ between 11- to 12-year-old girls and boys (P = .56) but was slightly higher for boys than for girls in the 13- to 15-year-old age group (P < .0001). As shown in Table 3 , being in private practice, in a suburban location, having ≥50% of patients with private insurance, and having ≥50% of patients who are non-Hispanic white were characteristics associated with reporting higher frequency of parental deferral. Eighty-eight percent of pediatricians and 67% of FP reported that they were very likely to bring up HPV vaccination again at a future visit if a parent had previously deferred initiation of the vaccine series; 10% of pediatricians and 23% of FP were somewhat likely to bring it up again; and 2% of pediatricians and 10% of FP were not at all or only a little likely to bring it up again.Download powerpointFIGURE 1Physicians’ report of parental deferral of the HPV vaccine for their boys and girls in different age groups (n = 525).View this table:View popupTABLE 3Practice Characteristics Associated With Physician Report of Parental Deferral of the HPV Vaccine for their 11- to 12-Year-Old Children (n = 543)Physician Discussion of HPV VaccineAs shown in Table 4 , 67% of pediatricians and 50% of FP almost always or always discuss HPV vaccination among 11- to 12-year-olds. Among the 118 pediatricians who did not almost always/always discuss the HPV vaccine at well visits for all age groups, the most commonly reported reasons for not discussing the topic were: “I know the patient is not yet sexually active” (54%), “I think the patient is too young” (38%), “the patient is already getting other vaccines at that visit” (35%), and “I expect the parents to refuse” (29%). Among the 104 FP who did not almost always/always discuss the HPV vaccine, the most commonly reported reasons for not discussing the vaccine were: “I don’t have enough time to discuss” (47%), “I know the patient is not yet sexually active” (35%), “I think the patient is too young” (28%), and “I expect the parents to refuse” (28%).View this table:Pediatrician- and FP-Reported Frequency of Discussion of HPV Vaccine Among Different Age Groups (n = 557)Physician and Practice Characteristics Associated With Discussion and Recommendation of HPV VaccineCompared with physicians who frequently or almost always/always discuss the HPV vaccine at the 11- to 12-year well-child visits for girls and boys (n = 419), those who rarely/never or only occasionally discuss the HPV vaccine (n = 92) were more likely to be FP (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.0 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1–3.5]), be male (aOR: 1.8; 95% CI 1.1–3.1), disagree that parents are more likely to accept the HPV vaccine if discussed in context of other vaccines (aOR: 2.3 [95% CI: 1.3–4.2]), report 25% to 49% (aOR: 2.8 [95% CI: 1.1–6.8]) or ≥50% (aOR: 7.8 [95% CI: 3.4–17.6]) of parents defer the vaccine when offered to their child at 11 to 12 years of age, and express concern about waning immunity (aOR: 3.4 [95% CI: 1.8–6.4]). Practice location, setting, knowledge that the HPV vaccine produces a stronger antibody response in younger adolescents compared with adults, and belief that it is necessary to discuss sexual health issues were not significantly associated with physician discussion of HPV vaccination at 11 to 12 years.In the multivariable analysis comparing physicians who strongly recommend giving the vaccine to girls at 11 to 12 years of age versus physicians who do not strongly recommend the vaccine using the same predictor variables described earlier, significant factors and aORs were similar to those reported except specialty and physician gender were not significant factors. In the multivariable analysis comparing physicians who strongly recommend the vaccine be given to boys at 11 to 12 years of age versus physicians who do not recommend it, results were similar to those reported earlier except physician gender and concern about waning immunity were not significant factors.DiscussionOur survey of a nationally representative sample of pediatricians and FP indicates that although most administer the HPV vaccine, more than one-third are not strongly recommending this vaccine at age 11 to 12 years and are less likely to strongly recommend the vaccine for boys. Similarly, one-third of pediatricians and one-half of FP do not always discuss HPV vaccination at the 11- to 12-year-old visit. FP, physicians who are concerned about waning immunity, physicians who disagree that parents are more likely to accept the HPV vaccine if discussed in the context of other recommended vaccines, and physicians who perceive that parents are likely to defer the vaccine for their children are less likely to discuss HPV vaccination at 11 to 12 years of age.An analysis of data from the 2010 National Immunization Survey–Teen indicated that 31% of parents of teen-aged girls had delayed or refused the HPV vaccine. 13 Compared with girls whose parents had neither delayed nor refused the HPV vaccine, girls whose parents had delayed the vaccine were more likely to be non-Hispanic white, live in a higher income household, and not be Vaccines for Children Program entitled. Although we cannot compare our results regarding physicians’ perceptions of parental delay directly with the data from the National Immunization Survey–Teen, our findings were similar in that physicians in private practice, with a higher percentage of patients with private insurance, and a higher percentage of non-Hispanic white patients were more likely to report parental deferral than other physicians.Physicians’ perceptions of parental attitudes may not always be accurate. A recent study asked parents to rank the importance of several vaccines on a scale of 0 to 10 and then asked health care providers to estimate parental responses. 14 The median ranking from parents for the HPV vaccine was 9.3, which was similar to their rankings for other vaccines. However, the median physician estimate of parental ranking for the HPV vaccine was 5.2, which was considerably lower than physician estimates for other vaccines (mostly >9).Physicians’ perceptions are important for vaccine delivery because physicians who perceive that parents are likely to defer HPV vaccination are less likely to discuss the vaccine at the 11- to 12-year-old visit based on findings from our study and others. 15 , 16 In addition, we found that 12% of pediatricians and 33% of FP were only somewhat likely or unlikely to bring up the HPV vaccine again if parents initially deferred. If physicians do not discuss the vaccine, they have no opportunity to provide a strong recommendation or to understand and address parents’ knowledge gaps or to elicit concerns. Physicians themselves may have knowledge gaps about the prevalence of HPV infection and burden of HPV-attributable cancers. Our finding that physicians were less likely to strongly recommend the HPV vaccine to boys than to girls is concerning given that more than one-third of HPV-attributable cancers occur in men. 1 The lack of a strong recommendation may contribute to missed opportunities for HPV vaccination because it is accepted that a strong recommendation for HPV vaccination from a physician is associated with receipt of the vaccine. 9 , 17 – 19 Qualitative and survey data, as well as some preliminary intervention studies, suggest that many parents may accept the HPV vaccine for their child at 11 to 12 years if their knowledge gaps and concerns are addressed by the physician in conjunction with a strong recommendation for vaccination. 8 , 20 – 24In addition to expecting parents to refuse the HPV vaccine, FP and pediatricians who do not routinely discuss HPV vaccination at the 11- to 12-year-old visit reported patient age and knowing the patient is not sexually active as reasons for deferring discussion. Physicians may defer discussion of HPV vaccination because they perceive that their patient population is likely to return for visits later in adolescence. However, in studies of adolescent visit patterns with mainly white and privately insured patients, preventive care visits declined after the age of 13 to 14 years. 25 , 26 Physicians may perceive that their patient population is unlikely to acquire HPV. Although the average age of sexual debut differs according to gender, race, and ethnic group, approximately one-third of all youth will have had sexual intercourse by 16 years of age, and HPV infection occurs within a few years of becoming sexually active. 6 , 27 Physicians who defer discussion of HPV vaccine may change their practices if they understand these reasons for vaccinating early. In our multivariable analysis, physicians who were concerned about waning immunity were less likely to routinely discuss the HPV vaccine at the 11- to 12-year-old visit. This concern may be partly based on the recommendation for a booster dose of the quadrivalent meningoccocal conjugate vaccine at age 16 years after a prior recommendation for 1 dose at age 11 to 12 years. 28 The data available show no evidence of waning protection for 9 to 10 years’ postvaccination. 6 , 29 Physicians should be provided with this information and updated as new data emerge over time. Because FP are less likely to routinely discuss the HPV vaccine at 11 to 12 years, they should be targeted in education efforts. Finally, physicians who believed that parents are less likely to accept the HPV vaccine if discussed in the context of other adolescent vaccines were less likely to discuss it at the 11- to 12-year-old visit. In contrast, qualitative studies of health care providers’ approaches to HPV vaccination have found that those who recommend all adolescent vaccines together believe this approach leads to higher uptake. 15 , 24Our study has some limitations. Although we have previously shown that the surveyed physicians are generally representative of physicians in the AAP and AAFP with respect to demographic and practice characteristics and locations throughout the United States, those who agreed to be surveyed might have different attitudes and practices than those who chose not to be in the network and those who did not respond to the survey. 10 Physicians’ practices were self-reported and not directly observed, and we did not specifically define what behaviors constituted discussion of HPV vaccine or a “strong recommendation.”ConclusionsMany physicians report experiencing parental deferral of HPV vaccine for their 11- to 12-year-old patients, and this expectation of deferral may cause them to avoid discussing the HPV vaccine. Ongoing public health efforts may promote positive parental attitudes about the HPV vaccine and reduce physicians’ experience with parental deferral. Because some physicians could be overestimating the likelihood of parental deferral, they should be encouraged to rethink their assumptions about parental attitudes regarding the HPV vaccine and strongly recommend it at every 11- to 12-year-old well-child visit. Our results indicate that physicians themselves may need a clearer understanding of the reasons to vaccinate against HPV at 11 to 12 years old versus later in adolescence and the reasons to vaccinate boys. In addition, physicians may need guidance on discussing these reasons with parents. Future research could investigate whether public health efforts directed at parents, education of physicians by professional organizations, and tools from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and professional organizations will increase physicians’ discussion of the HPV vaccine and strength of recommendation for 11- to 12-year-old girls and boys. 30AcknowledgmentsThe authors thank Lynn Olson, PhD, and Karen O’Connor from the Department of Research, AAP, Bellinda Schoof, MHA, at the AAFP, and the leaders of the AAP and AAFP for collaborating in the establishment of the sentinel networks in pediatrics and family medicine.

The 40-year-old father of six has made national news as he's urged ""fellow patriots"" to join him - first to protest the imprisonment of two Burns area ranchers and then, more recently, to help the ""abused"" residents of the county.A quiet and bearded man often wearing flannel and a broad-brimmed hat, Bundy has no criminal record, based on his own accounts and government records. The FBI in his home state of Arizona has said he has not been the target of any investigation there.While the confrontation that made his father, Cliven Bundy, famous was the culmination of Bundy clan clashes with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management stretching over nearly 90 years, the occupation of the reserve is the first high-profile fight that a Bundy has taken up outside the family.Ammon Bundy has struggled in other ventures. A small business owner, he's been late the past two years paying his property taxes and county records show he lost a home to foreclosure in 2012 . He says that the rental home was sold in a short sale.And so far, it's unclear whether Ammon Bundy's mission is a success. The father-and-son ranchers he came to support have distanced themselves from the protest as they work to gain clemency from President Obama. Various patriot groups have disavowed his takeover of the refuge.Bundy's own father has questioned the move, telling Oregon Public Broadcasting at one point that he didn't understand what his son and his supporters planned to accomplish.""I think of it this way,"" Cliven Bundy told the public radio station , ""what business does the Bundy family have in Harney County, Oregon?""The Bundy familyAmmon, named for a famous figure from the Book of Mormon , is soft-spoken and polite, thanking reporters at a Tuesday press conference as he announced his plans to continue occupying the refuge.He noted his own sacrifices, appearing to get choked up as he spoke of missing his wife and children , the youngest of which was born a year ago.Yet he went on to call for other people to join him to help defend the rights of ranchers, loggers, miners and others who have lost their way of life because of the government's purchase of land and varying policies to control grazing on those lands.Bundy, a registered Republican, has leaned more toward Tea Party movements in recent years. He's spoken out on a handful of political issues at gatherings across the country, joined rallies to support American troops and in late 2014 and early 2015, posted several videos complaining that airport Transportation Security Administration agents interrogated him three different times as he attempted to board flights. He worried he had been labeled a domestic terrorist.Still, by his own account, Ammon Bundy's only brush with the law has been a traffic ticket.He also has claimed that federal rangers used a stun gun on him during the standoff at his father's 160-acre ranch in Bunkerville, Nevada.The standoff occurred in April 2014 after Bureau of Land Management rangers came to seize cattle that Cliven Bundy had grazed on federal lands for decades without paying the required federal fees. Hundreds of ranchers came from across the country to support Bundy and held off the rangers, who eventually backed down.While the ranchlands near the famous Bundy standoff in Nevada have been in the immediate family since the late 1940s, the family first planted its roots in Arizona.Cliven Bundy's great-grandfather - a Mormon pioneer - established a deeply conservative sect of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in the Arizona Strip in the early 1900s. The area, north of the Grand Canyon, became known as Bundyville and comprised about 4,000 acres where the family ran cattle.The Bundy family eventually left those lands in the 1930s after a series of Bureau of Land Management decisions regarding cattle grazing and conservation, according to a local TV station, LasVegasNow.com . The NBC news affiliate reported that while the Bundys could have held onto the land, they appeared to have lost necessary water rights.The emerging leaderAmmon Bundy has talked in videos of his time on the family's ranch in Bunkerville, about 80 miles northeast of Las Vegas. Yet records show that Ammon, one of 14 siblings, moved back to Arizona sometime in 2000, following a stint in Utah.Bundy's most recent address is in Laveen, Arizona, a rural enclave on the outskirts of Phoenix, where county records show he and his wife, Lisa Marie, own a peach-colored one-story house on a corner lot.Lisa Marie Bundy, 37, lists herself as a stay-at-home mother on her Facebook page and notes she's from Murray, Utah. Unlike her husband's more political posts, she shows off baby and family pictures, including a shot of Ammon in a tractor pulling their children on a hay ride.""Tonight Ammon and the kids drove the neighborhood in style,"" she wrote, likely referring to their new home in Laveen. ""We met so many wonderful families. That is a good way to break the ice. Happy Fall, friends...""The Maricopa County Tax Assessor's Office reports that Bundy and his wife were late paying a portion of their 2015 property taxes. The couple owe a total of $1,853, half of which was due in October. The county requires the second half - or in this case, the full amount - to be paid in March.Bundy also was late in 2014, blowing both the October and March deadlines. The couple paid that tax bill of $2,082 two weeks ago on Dec. 21, according to the county.Bundy says he fell behind after spending so much time helping his father in Nevada through the spring of 2014.""I spent so much time there trying to defend my family's right there,"" he said. ""I've never really stopped having to defend people's rights.""Records also show that Bundy and his wife lost a home in Maricopa County to foreclosure in April 2012.Bundy says the rental home was under water and that he began working with a company who agreed to help him unload the property, but that he would have to skip a few payments. Bundy said that he believed the property was a short sale, not a foreclosure.Throughout the last few years, records show Bundy has registered numerous businesses with Arizona related to heavy equipment, steel products and fleet management. He's currently listed as manager and owner of Valet Fleet Service , which provides repair and maintenance services to vehicle fleets, and he's pictured smiling alongside a semi-truck on the company's website. He said his company has been successful for 18 years but that it did face tough times during the recession.Though Bundy may not recognize the government's authority when it comes to land ownership, his company benefited from at least one federal program.Valet Fleet Service received a $530,000 loan from the Small Business Administration in 2010. The loan was awarded through a program geared for companies ""unable to obtain financing in the private credit marketplace.""Representatives with the agency could not immediately provide details on the status of the loan or its terms.Bundy shrugs off any criticism over the help.""That's no handout, it's a 6-percent interest loan,"" he said, adding that he's up-to-date on the payments. ""It's not welfare, it's not a grant.""It's a loan.""The standoffAmmon Bundy has said that he and his father received a call for help last year from Dwight and Steven Hammond , the father-son ranchers convicted of arson after a fire they lit damaged federal lands.A judge had strayed from sentencing guidelines in the Hammond case and, after a successful appeal by former U.S. Attorney in Oregon Amanda Marshall, the ranchers were called back to finish the longer term set by federal guidelines.Bundy posted several warnings through the end of the year, calling on others to be prepared to travel to Burns to support the ranchers. He had visited Oregon on several occasions and posted numerous Facebook posts and online videos updating his followers on the situation. In one, he said he'd watched Susie Hammond - Dwight's wife -- cry over the injustices her family had experienced.By November, Ammon wrote that the Hammonds had heard from federal agents and were worried for their safety. They told him they'd have to cut off conversations with Bundy, he wrote, or risk a raid on their home.Larry Matasar, one of the Hammonds' three attorneys, said Bundy never talked to him. Matasar also would not confirm whether the Hammonds were contacted by federal agents about their conversations with Bundy.As the Jan. 4 deadline for the Hammonds' return to federal prison neared, Ammon Bundy spoke into his camera phone yet again, saying God had called him to leave his home and protest on behalf of the Hammonds.""I clearly understood that the Lord was not pleased with what was happening to the Hammonds,"" Ammon said. ""It was exactly like it was happening at the Bundy ranch, when we were guided and directed as to what we were supposed to do ... And I ask you now to come participate in this wonderful thing in Harney County that the Lord is about to accomplish.""Bundy and others joined in a protest Saturday with several patriot groups. However, Bundy, two of his brothers and about 20 other protesters split off from the parade and drove out to the refuge operated by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. One of Bundy's men - LaVoy Finicum, a neighbor of his father's Nevada ranch -- said they found keys to the buildings and let themselves in.""There is no place for intimidation and fear in a community, it shouldn't be allowed and if government is being that fear and intimidation that it needs to be checked and balanced,"" Bundy said Tuesday. ""If other government entities will not do that, then it becomes the responsibility and duty of the people to remove that intimidation and fear so that members of the community can begin living and living in freedom.""Bundy continued that his group has no plans to leave until the 187,000-acre refuge is divvied up and handed over to citizens. Though he has said he comes in peace, members of his group are armed and have said they'll defend themselves if ""attacked"" by law enforcement.Such words struck fear for some in Burns and nearby Hines , where 5,000 residents in the two towns make up the vast majority of the county's population of 7,000. Schools there have remained closed, as well as other public buildings and the refuge, which is a significant economic driver for the county.Law enforcement sources say it's important to note that some of the same self-styled militia members who held federal rangers at bay in Bunkerville are at Bundy's side in Burns. And late Tuesday, Harney County Sheriff Dave Ward said he and others aren't giving militants free reign.""Things are being done,"" he told The Oregonian/OregonLive in an exclusive interview. ""It's not visible to the public.""The sheriff also called Bundy out on his mission.""I believe the Hammonds were exploited by these people.""Carli Brosseau, Fedor Zarkhin and Lynne Palombo contributed to this report.-- Laura Gunderson"	
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/iphone-7-headphone-jack-controversy/	apple is eliminating the headphone jack for iphone 7 in order to force users to purchase expensive bluetooth equipment or proprietary headphones. see example( s )	Mixture	['iphone']	http://bgr.com/	http://bgr.com/2015/11/27/iphone-7-rumor-headphone-jack/	2016/01/06	Most of the time, iPhone rumors promise exciting things. However, the latest iPhone 7 rumor makes me feel very annoyed. Via 9to5Mac, Japanese Apple blog Macotakara claims that Apple has plans to completely remove the 3.5-millimeter headphone jack from the device. This would mean that the only way to connect headphones to the device in the future would be either via Bluetooth or the Lightning port. Here’s why it wouldn’t surprise me if this rumor had some truth to it: Apple showed starting with this year’s new MacBook that it’s on a quest to eliminate unnecessary ports. In fact, the new laptop featured just two ports: A USB Type-C port and a headphone jack. Apple is making a bet that all accessories are going to be wireless in the near future, which will eliminate the need to have so many ports on our devices. So I understand why it would do this but I find myself incredibly annoyed that it’s thinking of dumping the headphone jack all together just to make the iPhone 7 thinner. First of all, the iPhone doesn’t need to be any thinner. I’m actually very happy with the thickness of the iPhone 6s and was actually relieved to see that it’s slightly thicker and heavier than the iPhone 6 was. Second, I really don’t want to have to buy a new set of headphones just to listen to music through my iPhone. (And I swear, if I have to buy a pair of Beats headphones to listen to music on my device, I will go back to Android. At any rate, this is still just a rumor but I don’t think it’s a particularly outlandish one. Let’s hope Apple decides to keep the 3.5-millimeter audio jack going forward and instead focus on improving the iPhone 7’s battery capacity.

What is it? Is it evidence of an advanced civilization or time travel?The tablet was reportedly found earlier this year by archaeologists digging in Fuschl am See, a city in the Austrian state of Salzburg. There’s not much information on what the researchers were digging for in this region but it probably wasn’t cuneiform tablets. Yet that’s what they found. Even more shocking, the tablet strongly resembles the cell phones they were most likely using to take pictures of it.The tablet was dated to around the 13th century BCE. By that time, the Sumerian writing style known as cuneiform had already been around for a few thousand years. Cuneiform tablets aren’t unusual – an estimated 2 million have been excavated. The language was a mystery until the 19th century when its code was deciphered.The cuneiform alphabetHowever, this particular tablet is unusual for a number of reasons. First, it was found in Austria, not Iran or one of the other modern countries that was once Sumer or Mesopotamia. The only cuneiform object found further away from there is the controversial Fuente Magna Bowl , which was discovered in Tiahuanaco in modern-day Bolivia. Since there’s no evidence that the Sumerians visited this ancient pre-Columbian city, how did the bowl or the knowledge of cuneiform get there?The Fuente Magna BowlBy cell phone, of course! A controversial theory proposed by author Zecharia Sitchin is that aliens known as the Anunnaki came from Nibiru (the rumored Planet X beyond Neptune) and created the Sumerian civilization. The tablet looks surprisingly like a modern phone, with the 12 keys, a display and a ‘talk’ button. Could these extraterrestrials have tried to introduce the Sumerians to a phone-like communications device, only to find they weren’t ready for it and dialed them back to a stylus and clay tablets?Is this what they could have had?It would be interesting if some cuneiform expert could translate the characters on the ancient phone (unfortunately, Google translate does not yet recognize cuneiform).Did some Anunnaki accidentally leave his phone in Austria? Probably not. The archaeologists believe the tablet was most likely brought there by traders from Earth.Is the tablet’s resemblance to a modern cell phone just an odd coincidence, a hoax or evidence of time travel or alien contact?

In one photo, Donald Jr. proudly holds a dead elephant tail in one hand and a knife in the other. In another, the brothers are seen standing beside a 12'8"" crocodile hanging from a noose off a tree. Activists obtained the photos and created this video montage of the Trumps' big hunt:“Like all animals, elephants, buffalo, and crocodiles deserve better than to be killed and hacked apart for two young millionaires’ grisly photo opportunity,” a spokesperson from PETA told Hollywood Life . ”If the young Trumps are looking for a thrill, perhaps they should consider skydiving, bungee jumping, or even following in their anti-hunting father’s footsteps and taking down competing businesses—not wild animals. If the Trumps want to help villagers, they have plenty of resources at their disposal.""Responding to the criticism on Twitter , Don Jr. blasted the ""PETA crazies"" and insisted ""the meat was used to feed hungry villagers."" The big game safari was organized through a company called Hunting Legends. The Daily Mail reports that there are trophy fees for the deer-like animal they shot, called the Kudu. The Trumps reportedly paid at least $2,795.00 and another $1,997.00 for the Waterbuck they were pictured with, but Don Jr. says on Twitter, ""the money from hunting fees preserves animals and habitat.""Gothamist is now part of WNYC, a nonprofit organization that relies on its members for support.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/marines-letter-michelle-obama/	after being challenged by michelle obama, a former marine wrote the first lady a scathing letter.	Mixture	['michelle obama', ' u.s. marines']	http://dcgazette.com/	http://dcgazette.com/2015/marines-letter-michelle-obama-marine-tells-like/	2015/12/21	Lori Gluck | 06/19/2015 at 3:21 PM |You tell me one…. just one …. not more then one but one president or first lady that has not been attacked, called names or hated on! Get the hell over your black self it’s NOT ALL RACE! I’ve heard some of the ugliest nastiest hateful names called at the Bush’s and the only difference is they can’t scream “it’s racism” people (especially welfare folks) say the most vile shit about the Bush’s but they be white foke so it’s ok right! But say something against the obama’s and because they be black we white fokes are hating on the blacks. BULLSHIT! we be hating on a bad president that’s black !!! And if your the president of the united states of america (or the first lady) you should not be trying to start a civil war! you should NOT be pitting the blacks against the whites! But they can’t open their mouths any more that they ain’t squawking about how whites hate blacks. These days the racism is more blacks against whites, and maybe you intelligent enough to know it but this country was a lot nicer place to live before the president pitted the races against each other…… it’s sad that one family can set race relations back 60 years poor MLK he died to make our country a better place to live and in six short years obama has destroyed everything he did….AND FYI I did not call the first lady anything unlike ron who attacked me for no reason other then that I do not like the obama’s but yeah typical liberal democrat there’s no way to defend their ignorance so they start using foul language and name calling to intimidate I ain’t intimidated though I know the truth and it ain’t based on raceTerri Didntdoit | 06/19/2015 at 4:17 AM |again, schools make the final decisions as far as menus go. The program that Michele was involved in was not much different then the pyramid chart that has been around most of our lives. In my county in the state of California.. the kids are and do have cupcakes on their birthday, the only stipulation our school district has imposed is they must be store bought.. which has absolutely no connection to the food program.Sgt. A | 06/18/2015 at 11:26 PM |I suppose you think Michael Brown was a sweet innocent kid? There is NOT one case you can identify where the police wrongly gunned down an innocent kid. I challenge you to find a single incident where the person complied with the commands of the police and we’re shot. Kids who fight with and run from the police DO NOT count. You find ONE case where an innocent kid who was being respectful and complying with the police. But I can save you time. You won’t find any such case. The police do not indiscriminately shoot people who comply with their commands and pose no threat. I’ll be waitingron | 06/18/2015 at 2:39 PM |In light of the recent events in South Carolina, I wonder how many soldiers of all nationalities fought and died for their Freedom? These innocent people got killed in a place of worship in the “UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!” What “WAR” was fought to give them freedom and luxuries they have today? This crap has been going on for nearly 3 centuries in this country and there’s not one war fought to prevent any of this from happening. Delusional American Patriots you are a fraud unequivocally beyond any thought imagined!ibelieveinfreedom2 | 06/18/2015 at 12:09 PM |You know, white people face discrimination every day too. We have to deal with being rejected from scholarships and/or school admissions as well as jobs, knowing full well our grades and qualifications are above what is needed to get those positions, and knowing full well someone who doesn’t meet those standards will be rewarded just because they are black. Don’t tell me we don’t understand racism. Racism goes both ways when it comes to color, but politically it’s pretty limited to the democratic party.Well, I’m not proud of what people like the obama’s have done to this country and for the first time in my life I’m ashamed of the POTUS and all that he has done to degrade and destroy this country by aiding and abetting the enemy, totally disregarding our laws, and adding NINE TRILLION IN NEW DEBT. As an American, I am free to speak my mind also. The obamas are classless and embarrassing.ibelieveinfreedom2 | 06/18/2015 at 11:44 AM |Martin Luther King would be so ashamed of what racist democrats have done to the black man. You have been so brain washed that you actually think lowering standards and set-asides are to empower the black man, when the reality is that all this does is insure that the black man never reaches his full potential. What do you think the black man was fighting against in the 1960’s! Certainly it wasn’t so they could have their own clubs etc… it was to PROVE they were equal if given EQUAL FOOTING, not special footing, and not separate footing. Now all you have is a chip on your shoulder and a democrat patting you on the back saying: “there, there little black man, big daddy government is here, I’ll give you what you need, don’t worry.” What they don’t say is that the black man will never get more than what big daddy government is willing to give. Of course they don’t tell you that it’s part of the plan because that way the democrats can always be the black man’s master and the black man will willingly keep it that way because they’ve been brain washed into thinking that they can’t survive on their own. The irony is they don’t realize that the democrats are laughing their @$$3$ off because the black man doesn’t even realize that he’s being called stupid, lazy, and incapable by the democrat’s policies.You just keep thinking you are inferior and you NEED all those special clubs and set-asides.Well, maybe I’m the idiot looking at this all wrong, maybe conservatives are wrong, maybe blacks really are inferior, they keep insisting that they are even when we say they aren’t. Thanks for the advice, I’ll start looking down on the black man from now on, obviously they think I’m superior to them.ron | 06/18/2015 at 11:21 AM |Let’s see I get 4 checks every month. My retirement check for 24 years in the Army as a Master Sergeant, a tax free disability check for being exposed to toxic chemicals, diseases, war and stress of a military life.Moreover, I get 2 more checks for being employed with USPS, 28 dollars a hour! I’m sure you are familiar with the term “double dipping?” LMAOAnd there you go again evading that so troubling question, cuss words are in the American dictionary, get over it.Therefore stop focusing on my potty mouth, it’s an excuse to avoid the question, moreover what taxpayers dollars is spent on has nothing to do with it, paying taxes was started centuries ago and that’s no argument. A vote he seeks has nothing to do with the price of tea in China!I repeat I don’t care about any of that. The author of that letter addressed to Michelle Obama stated American soldiers of all nationalities fought and died so that she and family could have the luxuries and freedom that they have today.AGAIN, what war did American soldiers of all nationalities fought and died in so that African Americans could be free, true freedom, free from racist and bias laws?Just answer the question truthfully proudtexan62, what are you afraid of? That your white american dream is a fraud?Don’t give me there Aliens amongst us, a black President is the antichrist, the USA was perfect and not divided before he took office, there was no such thing of racism before he took office, slavery stories and watch me pull a rabbit out of my hat crap.JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION!!!!!!!ron | 06/18/2015 at 11:20 AM |Whatever, then stop reading them then. Sorry I’m not in the charming business, I’m in the pissing people off business. Me, disgrace to the entire race, oh how I love attention.Thank you so much entire race you gave me the courage I needed to face authority in the face of adversity!ron | 06/18/2015 at 11:13 AM |You would have to ask them whats their excuse, that’s the point, everyone who is white are denying these things are happening to him, just go to President Obama twitter account and see for yourself. It just a matter of fact he is black! Duh!Frodo | 06/18/2015 at 10:14 AM |If you do give a damn, then WHY are you NOT in the streets trying to put a stop to black on black murders.I hear you flapping your lips, BUT i see no action coming out of your community .ALL i see coming out of your black neighbor hoods are COFFINStrevon Martin was a thug,,pure and simple.

PEACE!!!!!!!!!!!Linda Batchelor | 06/18/2015 at 7:50 AM |Thank you Mike Shepard for your service & your eloquent letters to our First Lady & to our politicians! It’s too bad for that the most part they won’t reflect on what you have written as the truth for what they have done to our country! I fear for our country because of what this President & our other elected officials have done in the name of political correctness, to take down this once great country of ours. I too love our country but am ASHAMED of our elected politicians in gov’t! They are giving away all that this country has stood for for over 200 yrs! I am hoping & praying that we get some REAL leaders that will not allow illegal aliens & Sharia law to take over our land. However all I am reading is that the Republicans we elected to correct what has gone wrong have done absolutely NOTHING as far as I can see to help right these wrongs! Again thank you for both your letters & your service!proudtexan62 | 06/18/2015 at 7:08 AM |I have been discriminated against and I am a white person and as funny as it might seem to you, it was by a black man who believed he was twelve feet tall and nationwide. It turned out that he was not an honest person and was breaking the rules and he ended up, after he had already done the damage to my career, being found out for what and who he was. He was fired just as he had caused me to be but that was all that ever happened. He deserved to go to jail but it didn’t happen. He accused me with nothing but contempt in mind. He knew I did nothing to be terminated and my company took the termination record off my file later and offered me my job back, but much later. I think they thought I might sue them for wrongful termination but I’m not that kind of person. I didn’t go because I figured if they wouldn’t support me at the time of the incident, I needed to find a new work home anyway and I did. I never made a big issue of it or did anything to get the man who did it to me fired. He did that all by himself because he targeted another person wrongly and they weren’t so kind to him. That person exposed him for all he was. I didn’t incite a riot, I didn’t organize a protest, I didn’t go burn people’s property and I didn’t try to hurt anybody because of it. I was a divorced single Mom who had a family to support and losing my job wasn’t a good thing. I went out and got another and it turned out to be better than the other one. Divine intervention, I am sure. You people who live in a fog need to get it. Many people are discriminated against and if the Obamas have been, they are no worse for the experience. They have done quite well since being in office. They have traveled the world, spending millions of dollars of American Taxpayer money on vacations. In fact, Michelle Obama, her mother and her daughters are touring Europe right now, spending millions on a personal vacation. She is not an elected official and has no reason to go abroad unless she is accompanying her husband. This is strictly personal and America doesn’t have the money to pay for their personal vacations all the time. Other presidents have never done it but you all think it’s fine if they do. That is reverse discrimination if anything.proudtexan62 | 06/18/2015 at 6:50 AM |You are putting yourself in the same class with Ron and redvirgo. Since when in modern day America and that’s from over 50 years ago have black people been denied inclusion in organizations or whatever you call “practice”?. If that’s the case, I have no idea where you live but everywhere I have worked in my life (71 years of it) and all the organizations I belong to have black people and many other races in them. We call ourselves “Americans”. Keep on sleeping with dogs and you will certainly get fleas.proudtexan62 | 06/18/2015 at 6:45 AM |I’m far from delusional and you come on down and I’ll show you how paranoid I am. I am determined just like all of America is to take this country back from the scum that has almost destroyed it. If you don’t like the program, go with the scum when they leave because there won’t be a place here for you anymore.proudtexan62 | 06/18/2015 at 6:43 AM |Get over yourself. There is not a soul on this discussion that want you anything but GONE. Go away and charm someone else with your gutter mouth and leave the rest of us alone. You think you are making points on your opinions. Your mouth discredits every word you say. You are a disgrace to your entire race.proudtexan62 | 06/18/2015 at 6:39 AM |You don’t RECALL anything except the day of the month that check hits your mailbox. Your blaming everybody else for where you are and what you don’t have is not going to get it for you and believe me, Obama isn’t going to give it to you. That check and those freebies whatever they are is what you will get and Obama isn’t paying the bill, the working American Taxpayers are. All he wants is one more vote from you and then you are history. You are the most disgusting trash mouth I have ever seen on the internet and you are a disgrace and an embarrassment to the entire Black American community.proudtexan62 | 06/18/2015 at 6:07 AM |if you were educated, you would know the KKK was 100% Democrats and don’t tell me NO because I was there, I lived during their heyday and I saw them and heard their voices and I knew who they were with or without the white hoods. I saw crosses burning in people’s yards and I saw the things they did. You would be wise to have the facts before you post comments that make you look like the fool you are. I am 71 years old and I am tired of the people that Obama has made out of you lazy deadbeats who want to sit around and allow the working people of this country to support you. If you want to be somebody or get somewhere in this life, get out there and work for it like I did and millions more like me have done. All you dependent deadbeats want to do is bite the hand that is feeding you and it’s damn sure NOT OBAMA!!!! Nobody hates Obama because of the color of his skin, it is the content of his character that everybody objects to. He is a communist and we fought to keep communism from this country in WWII and many Americans black and white lost their lives to protect us from what and who he is. You need to start listening to the wise, educated and intelligent Black Americans who are an asset to this country and your race and stop listening to Obama and the street thugs that he is using to keep as many of you as he can dependent, dumbed down and in poverty. He does it so you will vote democrat and keep the communists in power. He doesn’t care about you or any more like you just as he cares nothing about any American. Black America will have a president sooner than later and there are several out there now that would do a fine job at it but Obama will never go down in history as this country’s first black president. He will be lucky history will have even one kind word to say about him. You and all those like you are the racists. Someday, you will wise up and realize that and if you chose not to, follow Obama where he will lead you when he leaves. I guarantee you, you won’t like it but some people just have to find out the hard way.Monique Ashley, I only excite those words because it appears everybody gets forgetful when it comes to racism and sexism. Nobody and I mean nobody took in consideration that the Obama’s are victims of racism.It’s everywhere, on Facebook, on TV, in the News, Twitter, threats, etc.Moreover, as soon as the Obama’s speak on it they’re race baiting!Are they? As soon as that family moved into the White House, “not” just politics but also for the color of their skin they were critically judge. They were not demeaning white people, white people were demeaning them!The politics well, it is what it is, however, there’s unequivocally no doubt this is not about the content of their character, but the color of their skin.Now if anyone wants to know what it feels like, then not only will I judge you by your political views I will also judge you by your color and gender.Then when you speak of the name calling I will ignore that I even said it, because there’s nothing worse or demeaning than defending yourself when these so called Patriotic Americans tell you, how dare you, then to suck it up, soldiers fought and died so you can be treated that way!Just like everyone are in denial that there was not one war that gave blacks true freedom, free from racist and bias laws, then there was no war American soldiers fought and died in so that women can’t be called a bitch either.If you attempt to defend it, how dare you! American soldiers fought and died for bitches to get the freedom and luxuries they have today.Frankly, I don’t give a shit, the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was to prove to mankind he didn’t exist! Ya’ll people got the game fucked up, America is a ticking time bomb that started 3 centuries ago. BOOM!!!!! God has no children to come back too!Monique Ashley | 06/18/2015 at 12:23 AM |Ah maybe because they weren’t thugs! What makes Trayvon Martin a thug walking home from the store with a juice and skittles? Please tell me that. White kids walk around every day wearing a hoodie carrying juice and candy and you expect them to make it home safely don’t you? Why shouldn’t we expect the same thing? Do you think we condone the killings and support black black crime, really? And how do you know what our Communities Are Doing About it, When Was The LASt Time You’ve Been To The “Community”? Most of us are just as ougraged as the next person but you cant fathom that as fact. And oh yes we are going to pitch a bitch about our children being gunned down by police who are supposed to protect, you’re damned skippy sir as would you! Yes we are going to hold up signs that say black lives matter, just as all lives matter because somewhere along the way a segment of individuals have forgotten that black boys, men and women are human and deserve to be treated as such. To bad you don’t see it but that is not going to stop us from fighting for it! PeaceMonique Ashley | 06/18/2015 at 12:09 AM |Omg, did you call Trayvon Martin a murderer? Who did he murder? If I’m not mistakened he was murdered by a want to be cop while innocently walking home from the store. Tell me please what he did wrong that we should not support him and his family in seeking justice? I and very educated so you can’t use that line of reasoning on me and yes I wholeheartedly support Trayvon and Michael Brown neither of them were doing anything wrong when they were shot down like dogs in the street. And the fact that you as a human being can’t see the wrong and injustice in that let’s me know that it can only be because of the color of their skin because if it were your child, a white child, you would be screaming at the top of your lungs that it was an injustice that both murderers got off. Who really has “hate inside”? YOU!Monique Ashley | 06/17/2015 at 11:45 PM |Why does she have to be uneducated because she uses the word “fuck”? And I bet there are plenty white people in many parts of the south who eat chicken necks, looking at your picture I’d say you probably haven’t missed many fried chicken meals yourself lol. PeaceMonique Ashley | 06/17/2015 at 11:35 PM |So you’re saying that Nancy Regan, Barbara Bush and stupid son Bush’s wife, I don’t even remember her name, and his drunk unruly kids were all seen wearing the same clothes, really? You know I doubt if you saw them in the media enough to know what the heck they wore and I’m thinking you probably wouldn’t have cared one way or another. But for some reason it’s a concern this time around about how much money is being spent on the first lady and theirs daughters wardrobe, hmm…Monique Ashley | 06/17/2015 at 11:18 PM |How freaking insensitive to call all the children who have been WRONGLY killed by police officers “thugs”! How would you feel if one of those children were your child? You want us to feel for the soldiers who choose to put their lives on the line but you can’t feel for the children, many of whom were doing nothing wrong, who have been gunned down by police officers? WowMonique Ashley | 06/17/2015 at 11:06 PM |That’s the thing, whites are always saying we’re living in the past, but racism and mistreatment due to the color of one’s skin is still prominent today! But it’s so so easy to overlook it and say it’s in the past when it’s not happening to you. We wish we had that luxury of turning a blind eye to it but we don’t. Every single day a black person is pulled over for no other reason than being black possibly driving a nice car or driving in what’s considered a white neighborhood. I’m not telling you what I’ve heard, I’m telling you what I know. There are so many unfortunate stories I could tell you that have happened to myself or someone I know and love but I won’t take the time to break it down because more than likely you will assume they must have done something wrong to be treated that way and in white America that would be true. But suffice it to say everything that Mrs. Obama speaks of has not happened “in the past” as you say, it’s still happening today! But you have to care enough to step outside of your comfort zone and consider what it’s like to walk in someone else’s shoes. Peace

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/arapahoe-school-shooting-stopped-armed-sro/	a december 2015 school shooting in arapahoe county, colorado, was circumvented by an armed school resource officer.	Mixture	['school shooting']	https://en.wikipedia.org/	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arapahoe_High_School_(Colorado)	2015/12/18	"Arapahoe High School is a public high school in Centennial, Colorado, United States. Located in a suburb of Denver, it is the flagship of the Littleton Public Schools District as the largest of three high schools, with an enrollment of 2,229 students. It has been designated a Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education. Arapahoe consistently earns an ""excellent"" rating on Colorado's statewide school accountability report, the only high school in the district to do so. The school is known for its affiliation with the Arapaho tribe of Wind River, Wyoming. Arapahoe High School was built in 1964. 1967: An addition of a pool, classrooms and theater, built by Morse, Dion & Champion, architects; and Webco, general contractor. 1979: An addition of locker rooms, wrestling facilities and a gymnastics gym, built by Allred/Fisher, architects; and Frank Hall & Co., construction management. 1987: An addition of administration and counseling space, by Culbertson & Associates, who served as designer and general contractor. 1997: The school's aging interior library was replaced with classrooms, and a new library and media center were constructed on the north side of the building. Accessibility was improved with the construction of an elevator adjacent to second-floor classrooms and a student-designed east entrance with wheelchair ramps and automated doors, nicknamed ""The Bubble."" 2005: The school underwent significant remodeling. A new gymnasium was added, several classrooms were redesigned and walls were rebuilt to meet fire code standards. 2014: In the aftermath of a school shooting in 2013, in which parts of the library were burned, a remodeled library was constructed in the same space. As of 2013[update], the school has 70 classrooms. On December 13, 2013, a shooting occurred at the school. The gunman, an 18-year-old student, entered the school armed with a shotgun, a machete, three Molotov cocktails, and 125 rounds of ammunition. He requested to see the school librarian, who was also the coach of the school debate team. The shooter's demotion on the team was a contributing motive to the shooting. One student was shot in the head and died eight days later. The shooter attempted to start a fire with one of the devices he had carried with him and then shot himself in the head. The 254,756-square-foot (23,667.6 m2) faacility includes 70 classrooms, two gyms, a weight room, a library, kitchen, a 647-seat theater, a pool, tennis courts, a track and fields for baseball, football, and soccer fields. The school has a unique relationship with the Arapaho tribe. After complaints about the pejorative depiction of Native Americans, principal Ron Booth sought a direct relationship with the tribe by travelling to the tribe's location in Wyoming for a personal meeting with tribal elders. After an extensive process, the tribe and Chief Anthony Sitting Eagle approved a relationship between the school and the tribe, establishing relationship methodology through a specific declaration. The original logo of Arapahoe High School more closely depicted a Pawnee Indian. On September 17, 1993 the Arapaho Nation and Arapahoe High School held the Arapahoe Warrior Assembly. This assembly dedicated the school's new, and current, Warrior mascot, created by Northern Arapaho artist, Wilbur Antelope. Since then, the Northern Arapaho tribe has endorsed the name of the high school (as spelled with an ""e"" at the end) and its use of the current warrior mascot, provided by the tribe. The large gym was refinished and renamed the Sitting Eagle Gymnasium (this is now the Main gym) on December 9, 1993. According to the original agreement made by the school, the mascot is not to be put on the floor (where one could walk on it) or on any article of clothing. However, whether through subsequent agreement or disregard on the part of the school, the mascot can be found on a wide variety of clothing. However, it is not found on any football uniform (where it may be rubbed into the ground), and the school does not portray a Native American Warrior at any sporting event. Tribal members visit the school for important events, speaking every year at graduation, and every two years a larger group will visit the school to perform various traditional dances and speak about Native American culture. Arapahoe is part of the 8-team Centennial League that also includes Cherry Creek, Grandview, Cherokee Trail, Smoky Hill, Eaglecrest, Mullen, and Overland. Arapahoe athletics include baseball, basketball, cheerleading, cross country, dance, football, golf, lacrosse, marching band, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track, volleyball, winter guard, and wrestling. All athletics at Arapahoe are competed at the 5A / world level. Girls' golf won the Colorado State Championship in 2010. The Arapahoe soccer program, known as ABK (Arapahoe Ball Kickers), holds 14 state championships; the girls' program has won nine state titles and the boys' program has five state titles. In 1997 and 1998, members of the ABK and friends formed the Jolly Green Men, supporters of the Colorado Rapids soccer club. The monthly Arapahoe Herald newspaper is produced by journalism students. In 2005, the Arapahoe Herald was named a National Scholastic Press Association Pacemaker Finalist and went on to win a Pacemaker. The National Pacemaker Awards have been called the high school equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize. In 2005, the Arapahoe Herald received the Pacemaker as well as a Silver Crown from Columbia Scholastic Press Association. It is only the sixth high school newspaper in Colorado to win a Pacemaker in the award’s 100+ year history. In 2007 the Arapahoe Herald received the National Scholastic Press Association's All-American rating, and Columbia Scholastic Press Association's Gold Medalist Award. In 2008 the paper placed first in the American Scholastic Press Association's Newspaper Review and Contest. The Arapahoe Herald is also included in the National Scholastic Press Association's Hall of Fame for ten consecutive All-American ratings. To date, the newspaper has earned 14 All American ratings since 1992. The Arapahoe Herald won its second NSPA Pacemaker Award in November 2009. The Herald also received Gold Medal awards from the Columbia Scholastic Press Association in 2008 and in 2010. In 2009, the February issue of the newspaper gained statewide attention for a controversy over articles depicting teenage boys using alcohol to engage in sexual actions with girls, and young women objectifying themselves for attention. Calumet, the Arapahoe yearbook, is produced by journalism students. Muse is Arapahoe's literary arts magazine. In 2007, the Muse placed eighth in the National Scholastic Press Association's Best-in-Show, during the Denver Convention.

Look at the URL for the original story. This was published April 6, 2006. Perhaps they pulled it down early, but I suspect it was pulled a year or two ago because its an OLD article and many small newspapers don't keep online archives indefinitely. Heck, Yahoo!News doesn't even!Comment by mcm on April 1, 2009 at 6:01pmFirst Bill Nye considers himself agnostic not atheist (he is quoted as answering ""You really can't know"" to the God question). Second the Hebrew word for light in Genesis 1:16 is ""ma'owr"" which means luminous, this applies to radiating OR reflecting light. So Genesis 1:16 is factually, scientifically, and theologically correct (sorry Bill).Comment by Johnny on April 1, 2009 at 7:41pmmcm, your first point is irrelevant, the article did not claim that Bill Nye was atheist.For your second, how can you say ""sorry Bill"" (implying he was wrong), when according to your translation he accidentally agreed with the Bible?I'm not an expert on the Hebrew language, but searching Google nets several translations for ""ma'owr."" Including 'lights' 'light' 'moon' 'illuminator' 'luminaries' and 'bright.' And I am unable to find any online Hebrew translator that recognizes the word ""ma'owr."" Additionally, although luminous does have ""reflecting or giving off light"" as a secondary definition, its primary definition is ""emitting light, especially emitting self-generated light.""BUT, you miss the point of the article completely. The point is that Bill Nye stated a scientific fact about the moon reflecting light; and a group of religious people boo'd him because their interpretation of the Bible conflicted with science.Comment"

I have one set of hands and only 24 hours each day, like everyone else. The facts of the fraud have been established and presented. All members of the Bar Associations are liable. We have placed a huge lien on them. See articles #86 and #87 on this page. People all over this country need to be filing claims and going after these corporations. Look up commercial obligation liens and liquidation of corporations guilty of criminal activity-- and see what you will see.URGENT NOTE FROM ANNA:The most urgent thing people need to do besides cleaning up their own political status records is organize their county and state jural assemblies.

Documents This website has been programmed by Paul Stramer of Lincoln County Watch in Montana, so you can get this information all in one place, rather than having to research for days on the Internet to find these articles. This information is the most important I have ever posted on my blog and on this website, because it's the very first time I have been able to present the fully assembled puzzle of fraud and deception that has been used for hundreds of years to rob and plunder America under the color of law by the cabal to finance their evil in the world. Anna von Reitz has a unique perspective by her vocation of legal advisor to the ""Popes"" and her access to much information to which most people in the world just don't have access. As a cradle Catholic, I know she is right on the money when it comes to the temporal power she is talking about. I believe she is also right about the solutions, which are spelled out in her articles. Read them in the order presented to get the whole truth and the big picture. There are no other solutions short of all out civil war on American soil, and I am sure you want to avoid that as much as I do, if at all possible. If you want to read my blog, where there are over 3000 articles on these and other subjects, the address is www.montanablog.us or www.paulstramer.net. That blog is also connected to all my business websites as well, where we sell radio communications gear, silver bullion, PRI fuel preservative, portable solar power products, stun guns, and much more.

An American Affidavit of Probable Cause"" One time donation, you decide the amount. A NOTE FROM JUDGE ANNA about this information: Please post my apologies that I cannot practice law while sitting as a judge and cannot possibly respond to literally millions of foreclosure cases and custody cases and so on. I have one set of hands and only 24 hours each day, like everyone else. The facts of the fraud have been established and presented. All members of the Bar Associations are liable. We have placed a huge lien on them. See articles #86 and #87 on this page. People all over this country need to be filing claims and going after these corporations. Look up commercial obligation liens and liquidation of corporations guilty of criminal activity-- and see what you will see.URGENT NOTE FROM ANNA:The most urgent thing people need to do besides cleaning up their own political status records is organize their county and state jural assemblies. The national level quorum is growing and will soon be able to redress grievances at a national level. HOW TO FIND PEOPLE IN YOUR AREA The National Assembly Thursday night conference call is at nine o'clock p.m., EST, 1-712-770-4160, access code 226823#. First hour is assembly roll call and business. The second hour is general chat and education. For those who have not participated in your county and state assembly but want to participate please send an email to contentmanager1@yahoo.com with your state in the subject line. You will be connected with your state coordinator. The national assembly has a full website and forums packed with history and information. You are welcome to register and participate. National Assembly Website: https://national-assembly.net/
National Assembly Forums: http://forums.national-assembly.net/ DeFacto to DeJure handbook: http://national-assembly.net/index.php/handbook The old website 1stmichiganassembly.net and the hotline phone number are now obsolete and no longer used. The Michigan General Jural Assembly created and supported the national level assembly website and conference call for the people to return to self governing.

Documents This website has been programmed by Paul Stramer of Lincoln County Watch in Montana, so you can get this information all in one place, rather than having to research for days on the Internet to find these articles. This information is the most important I have ever posted on my blog and on this website, because it's the very first time I have been able to present the fully assembled puzzle of fraud and deception that has been used for hundreds of years to rob and plunder America under the color of law by the cabal to finance their evil in the world. Anna von Reitz has a unique perspective by her vocation of legal advisor to the ""Popes"" and her access to much information to which most people in the world just don't have access. As a cradle Catholic, I know she is right on the money when it comes to the temporal power she is talking about. I believe she is also right about the solutions, which are spelled out in her articles. Read them in the order presented to get the whole truth and the big picture. There are no other solutions short of all out civil war on American soil, and I am sure you want to avoid that as much as I do, if at all possible. If you want to read my blog, where there are over 3000 articles on these and other subjects, the address is www.montanablog.us or www.paulstramer.net.

Authorities in all five cities said they had contacted FBI agents. However, The FBI only confirmed it is investigating three of those reports. On Thursday, a television station in Cape Girardeau reported that the FBI was investigating more suspicious phone purchases in Cape Girardeau and Jackson. ABC 17 News reached out to the police departments in both cities to confirm these reports and has not heard back. ABC 17 News confirmed Thursday someone tried to buy a suspicious number of phones at Wal-Mart East in Jefferson City over the weekend as well. ABc 17 News reported Wednesday that 100 prepaid cell phones were also purchased at two Missouri Walmarts over the weekend, and employees reported the incidents to authorities. The Columbia Police Department was notified on Monday of a suspicious purchase at the Walmart on Conley Road. According to the police report, several men bought multiple phones around 9:30 Friday night.ABC 17 New talked to a witness who didn't want to be identified said the men paid with cash.""Right then and there I knew there was not something adding up about this. It's not right, it doesn't make any sense,"" he said. ""Who's going to order 50 phones for Christmas? Who does that?""""I think on the surface that is suspicious,"" said Paul Fennewald, the former Missouri Homeland Security Coordinator. ""If I had seen the same thing, I probably would have called somebody also.""A similar situation also happened hours later at a Walmart in Lebanon, Mo. Police said two men bought about 60 phones. They were taken into custody, but later released because police said they had no legal reason to detain them.Macon police and the sheriff's department also said they are investigating a ""recent suspicious purchase of multiple cell phones"" at their local Wal-Mart.Fennewald said the prepaid phones are used as a way for criminals to communicate without law enforcement tracking them. He said in many past terrorist attacks cell phones have been used to trigger an explosive device.The man who saw the phones being purchased in Columbia said he instantly thought the men were up to no good.""That's the first thing that ran through my mind that something bad could happen,"" he said. ""You know, they could be using these phones for terrorist acts.""Fennewald said the Walmart employees did the right thing by reporting the odd purchase to police. He said everybody should do the same when they see something suspicious.""If we're going to prevent that next terrorist attack, especially the next terrorist attack in Columbia, Missouri, or Boone County, it's not going to be the FBI, it's not going to be law enforcement, it's going to be the viewers of this broadcast that are probably going to be the key to preventing.""ABC 17 News reached out to Walmart Corporate for comment on the incidents in Missouri.""Because this is an ongoing investigation, I'd refer you to law enforcement for any information for your story,"" Betsy Harden, a Walmart spokeswoman, said in an email. Copyright © 2015 KMIZ - The Networks of Mid-Missouri.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/california-banned-45-acp-ammunition/	california has banned a popular type of ammunition, the .45 acp. see example( s )	False	['ammunition', ' california', ' guns']	http://www.sightm1911.com/	http://www.sightm1911.com/Care/45acp.htm	2015/12/11	The .45 ACP CartridgeThe famous .45 ACP cartridge.When you take a look at the large missile-shaped cartridge of your average deer rifle, and better yet, when you put the rifle to your shoulder and fire it, a little alarm ought to go off in your head about pistol cartridges–all pistol cartridges. They are all inadequate in terms of real power. I like Clint Smith’s definition that “a pistol is something you use to fight your way back to your gun.” Pistols have their place due to the ease with which they can be carried and brought into action, but it’s important to recognize their limitations. Notice that no fighting force in history has gone into battle armed with pistols as their primary weapons.Some pistol cartridges are less inadequate than others, and one which comes pretty close to adequate is the .45 ACP. “ACP” stands for “Automatic Colt Pistol.”John Browning is credited with having designed the .45 ACP cartridge. Browning’s .45 ACP ammo was built specifically for the pistol that many of us regard as one of the greatest pistol designs ever, the M1911. However, I’m not at all sure that the M1911 wouldn’t have been chambered for .38 Super had Browning been left to his own devices.The man who pushed the Army into adopting the .45 caliber cartridge was Gen. John T. Thompson, the father of the Thompson submachine gun and a member of the Army Ordnance Board during the time that the M1911 pistol was being developed by John Browning and Colt. After the disastrous showing of the Army’s .38 Long Colt pistols in the Philippines, Gen. Thompson was committed to the idea that the Army should be packing a real man-stopper in its handguns, a big .45 caliber bullet.It was the cartridge tests conducted by Thompson and Major Louis Anatole LaGarde of the Medical Corps in 1904 at the Nelson Morris Company Union Stockyards in Chicago that resulted in the adoption of the .45 caliber as the official U.S. Army handgun cartridge. They tested various calibers on live cattle, deer, and human cadavers to determine the best load. From these tests it was determined that the .45 was the most effective cartridge for a handgun, but with reservations. In their report, they state:“the Board was of the opinion that a bullet, which will have the shock effect and stopping effect at short ranges necessary for a military pistol or revolver, should have a caliber not less than .45”. But they also said, “…soldiers armed with pistols or revolvers should be drilled unremittingly in the accuracy of fire” because most of the human body offered “no hope of stopping an adversary by shock or other immediate results when hit.”In response to the Ordnance Board’s specification, Browning designed the .45 ACP for the pistol he was submitting to the board. Browning’s first loading was a 200 grain bullet running at 900 feet per second, but the Army wanted a larger bullet. Browning responded with the loading we have today, a 230 grain bullet with a muzzle velocity of 830 feet per second.Stopping PowerIt is interesting to observe that we are still arguing this basic question of terminal ballistics which was articulated by Thompson in 1904. The tag-team wrestling match in the terminal ballistics field is currently between Ed Sanow and Evan Marshall in the “small and fast” corner, and Dr. Martin Fackler (backed up by Thompson and LaGarde) in the “big and slow” corner. This discussion quickly degenerates into a lot of arcane mumbles about temporary and permanent crush cavities, energy transfer, hydrostatic shock, and the Miami FBI shoot-out. It’s interesting if you’re a physicist or a forensic pathologist, but it gets kind of academic for the rest of us. “Small and fast” works really well with high-powered rifles when their small 80 grain bullets are traveling at 4000 feet per second, but hand gun cartridges don’t operate at those energy levels. The best of the small and fast pistol rounds is the 125 grain .357 Magnum which has enjoyed an impressive service record in the “one shot stop” statistics. It has also suffered some spectacular failures in which the bad guy was shot multiple times center of mass and remained on his feet.Evan Marshall and Ed Sanow have worked up a set of statistics based on results of actual shootings in which one shot was fired into the torso of the attacker stopping the assault, and from these studies they have developed percentage ratings for “one shot stops” for cartridges from .22 to 12 gauge. The Marshall and Sanow numbers show a tendency for small and fast cartridges to do somewhat better than large and slow ones, i.e., .380’s do slightly better than .38 Specials from 2″ barrels and .357 Magnums do a percentage or so better than the .45 ACP. Understand that controversy still rages about the Marshall and Sanow study, particularly about their methods, sources of data, and the shootings they chose to exclude. Nevertheless, it’s an interesting study.Jim Higginbotham, a 30-year law enforcement veteran and trainer writes the following on the subject of pistol cartridges and failures to stop:While I have come across some lethal encounters that took a lot of rounds to settle they mostly were the result of either poor hits (or complete misses) or lack of penetration. Nearly all of the high round count cases I have reviewed involved 9mms, .38s, .357’s or smaller calibers. This is not to say they do not occur with major caliber rounds. It is to say I have been collecting data for 30 years and have not encountered many cases in which multiple hits (more than three as two or three shots are a fairly normal reflex action) from major caliber cartridges to the center of the chest have not been sufficient, – the single exception being a case involving the .41 Magnum loaded with JSP bullets which did not expand – they did penetrate – it took five hits center mass to stop the attacker – and I have not encountered any with the .45, even with Ball. I have encountered several with 5, 6 or even more hits to the center of the chest with .38, .357, 9mm and .223 rifle rounds failing to stop. Almost every one could be traced to lack of penetration with a couple of exceptions that hit the heart but just did not cause enough damage to be effective quickly. Note I am not talking about “torso” hits. There is a lot of area in the torso in which a hit will seldom produce rapid incapacitation even if hit by a 12 ga. slug or a 30-06 – we simply cannot count such data if we are going to learn anything.My purpose here is not to argue Fackler versus Marshall and Sanow because that’s a book in itself. What is important in all of this is that regardless of which philosophy you choose to accept as true, the .45 ACP comes out well–at or near the top of the effectiveness ratings for both schools of thought.Having established the almost universal agreement that the .45 ACP is an acceptable personal defense cartridge (kind of like proving the ocean is wet), are there negatives? Sure there are. For one thing, the .45 ACP is big and heavy. The same characteristic that makes it so admired by the big hole school also makes it heavy to carry and bulky, resulting in fewer rounds being available in compact handguns. A fully loaded Thompson submachine gun is fairly heavy if you have to lug it around through a hot jungle all day. Some people find the recoil of the .45 ACP punishing although I’m not one of them (I actually prefer the recoil of the .45 ACP over the recoil of the 9mm). The penetration of the .45 ACP 230-grain FMJ bullet is 26″ in ballistic gelatin, making it problematic and dangerous as a personal defense load. The threat of over-penetration with the military round necessitates the use of hollow points for LEO and civilian PDW applications. Some of the older 1911 pistols don’t like hollow point bullets very well and have to be throated and have their feed ramps polished for reliability. And last, there is the cost. The .45 ACP is expensive as pistol cartridges go, often $3-$4 per box more than 9mm or .38 Special.SpecificationsThe specs and behavior of this cartridge are central to its success. Even people who don’t like the 1911-pattern pistol often seek other systems to launch the .45 ACP and every major gun maker builds pistols around the cartridge. Smith and Wesson even builds a revolver for it.Specifications of the original military loading of the .45 ACPDimensions Minimum Maximum

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-military-christmas-ban/	"president obama issued an order banning u.s. military personnel from using the word ""christmas."""	false	['christmas', ' todd starnes']	http://www.foxnews.com/	http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/12/24/army-dont-say-christmas.html	2015/11/16	Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email PrintDon’t say Christmas.That’s the message that was conveyed to a group of soldiers at Camp Shelby by an equal opportunity officer from the Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute, according to a soldier who attended a recent briefing.“It’s unbelievable that the Army would ban ‘Christmas’ like it’s a bad word,” said Michael Berry, an attorney with the Liberty Institute, a legal firm representing the unidentified soldier.Two weeks ago, a routine meeting was held at the Mississippi base with various leaders of the 158th Infantry Brigade. During the meeting, they discussed an upcoming Christmas football tournament. The equal opportunity officer immediately objected to the usage of the word “Christmas.”“Our equal opportunity representative stopped the briefing and told us that we can’t say Christmas,” the soldier told me. “Almost the entire room blew up. Everybody was frustrated. The equal opportunity rep told our commander that not everyone celebrates Christmas and we couldn’t say Christmas celebration. It had to be holiday celebration.”The soldier said there was a brief, but heated discussion about political correctness. At one point, the equal opportunity representative tried to deflect the criticism by pointing out it was the Army’s rules – not hers.“She said an individual can say Christmas, but as an organization in the Army you can’t say Christmas,” the soldier told me.So what does the Army have to say about the DEOMI officer’s edict?“There is no policy at the 158th Infantry Brigade, First Army Division East or First Army that forbids using the word ‘Christmas’,” Public Affairs Chief Amanda Glenn told me.She confirmed that there was a discussion in the meeting about the football tournament. She said it was meant to be a team building event and it had no tie to a specific religious event or holiday celebration.“The Equal Opportunity advisor simply stated that it would be more appropriate to call it a holiday football event,” she said.But Attorney Berry tells me that it was made very clear to the soldiers in the room that the name change was not merely a suggestion.“She stated that the word Christmas had to be replaced with the word holiday,” Berry said.The soldier who contacted me said it was just another instance of the military trying to curtail public expressions of the Christian faith.“Between the Air Force and the Army – it’s like they don’t like Christian values, they don’t like the word Christ or Christmas,” the soldier said. “They don’t like you talking about it.”Berry said it’s a shame that the Army has implemented word police.“Are they going to have the ‘Merry Christmas’ police going around issuing citations to an soldier who slips and says the word?” he wondered. “They’re treating Christmas like it’s pornography. As a matter of fact, the Army actually treats pornography better than it does Christmas.”It’s not the first time Equal Opportunity officers have caused trouble at Camp Shelby. Earlier this year, I reported exclusively about a briefing at Camp Shelby that labeled the American Family Association as a domestic hate group.After my story was published, the Secretary of the Army ordered military leaders to halt all briefings on extremist organizations that labeled Evangelical Christian ministries as domestic hate groups.Todd Starnes is host of Fox News & Commentary.

Wright, News OfficeApril 13, 2005Believe it or not, Monday isn't a holiday because of the Boston Marathon. It's Patriots Day, the day set aside to honor the Battle of Lexington and Concord, which began the Revolutionary War.So this weekend, why not bone up on your American history?Pauline Maier, William R Kenan Professor of History, recommends the books below about life in the young U.S.A.--a little later than the Revolution, but in a formative period. Maier is the author of ""American Scripture: Making the Declaration of Independence"" and ""From Resistance to Revolution: Colonial Radicals and the Development of American Opposition to Britain 1765 to 1776.""Maier, who first picked the books for the November/December 2004 issue of American Heritage magazine, described the list as ""idiosyncratic, favoring titles I have read and loved, that seemed to work well with my students or that my friends and colleagues praise.""Maier recommends several works about prominent historical figures. ""Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation,"" by Joseph J. Ellis, was ""long on the bestseller list and won the Pulitzer Prize for all the right reasons: solid scholarship, full of insight and written with a style leavened by Ellis' un-intrusive sense of humor,"" she said.Already read ""Brothers""? Try Maier's personal favorite, a book on Massachusetts' native son, President John Adams. Ellis' ""Passionate Sage: The Character of John Adams,"" captures the ""endearingly crusty Adams in ways that are missing even in David McCullough's massive 'John Adams,' "" Maier said.Lowell, Massachusetts, just an hour north of Boston, played an instrumental role in the industrial development of New England, and Maier recommends two books on the subject.

Pictures has purchased the live-action feature film rights to Cartoon Network’s half-hour series “Johnny Bravo” as a potential starring vehicle for the Rock. Pic, being developed by Cartoon Network and Warner Bros. Pictures, was optioned from Cartoon Network and “Bravo” creator/writer/director Van Partible. Neal Moritz and Marty Adelstein will produce for Warner Bros. via their Original Film production banner with Van Partible serving as exec producer. As yet, no writer has been hired to pen the script. “When the Rock mentioned to Neal (Moritz) and myself he was a big fan of ‘Johnny Bravo’ and thought it was a great idea for a movie, we thought it was a natural fit and potentially a great role for him to play, so we went aggressively after the property,” said Adelstein. The Rock is repped by Endeavor and managed by Original. Project marks the first live-action motion picture teaming of WB and its fellow company Cartoon Network. Warner Bros. Even though Warner Bros.’ live-action feature “Scooby-Doo” has spawned a new franchise for the studio, Cartoon Network, which broadcasts the original animated TV show on which that movie was based, had no part in the development or production of that feature. Rights to the original show were part of the Hanna-Barbera library, which was acquired by Time Warner through the Turner/Time Warner merger. “Bravo,” a half-hour series that debuted in July 1997, is one of Cartoon Network’s signature original shows, and has been a huge hit for the network. The animated series is about a big-muscled, big haired sweet-talking ladies man who sounds like Elvis, loves his mother and worships himself — and continually proves to be his own worse enemy.

Photos of supporters displayed their hands sporting black dots, standing up for domestic violence victims.Though the Internet campaign was shared by millions – even supported by the likes of television personality Dr. Drew Pinsky, not everyone in the domestic violence community was convinced of the merits of this campaign.Like many others who work with domestic violence victims, Dina Polkinghorne, executive director of Project Sanctuary, weighed in on the project. What she didn’t expect was her comments spreading throughout the Internet, posting not only on Facebook, but reaching BuzzFeed – the massive news and entertainment site.Project Sanctuary was one of several agencies that addressed concerns about the campaign, honoring the intentions of the campaign organizers but suggesting that there are other, better, safer ways for domestic violence victims to reach out.In addition to the Ukiah Daily Journal, Polkinghorne was contacted by a London radio station for an interview. “We had no idea that our comments had gone viral until you contacted us,” Polkinghorne noted.Her comments, as well as the comments of other agencies and domestic violence victims sparked a second wave of interest in the campaign.“The Black Dot campaign is a very well-meaning idea, but a bad idea nonetheless. I believe that the woman who started the campaign is a survivor herself. The campaign is spurring conversations but there are better ways to go,” she explains. On its Twitter feed, Project Sanctuary explained that victims could be putting themselves at risk by drawing something on themselves that their abuser could see. “Another issue with the campaign is that not everyone you flash the black dot to is connected to social media,” she continues.“The campaign is getting a lot of attention, so abusers may also be aware of it. They might question why their partner would have the dot on their hand. A well-meaning family member could also see the dot, and inadvertently compound the violence,” she explains.“The Black Dot was a way to silently tell someone that you are in a domestic violence situation, but when would it be appropriate to use it? At the grocery store? At the doctor’s office? Someone who was being completely controlled would be told by the abuser that they want to be in the exam room, so the victim would not be able to tell their doctor that they were in a domestic violence situation.“Most medical professionals are highly trained to look for cues that might suggest someone was being abused. They would ask the alleged abuser to leave the room to have a confidential conversation, and the black dot would not be necessary.”Polkinghorne suggests that there are many ways for concerned friends and family to help a person whom they suspect might be in an abusive relationship.“If you’re a domestic violence victim and you are alone with a friend, you have an opportunity to say something to them,” Polkinghorne explains. “There are many options available.”“If someone suspects that a friend or family member are being abused, they can call Project Sanctuary. Because services are confidential, people sometimes think that they can’t call us and just talk. All staff have signed confidentiality agreements. We don’t even discuss cases among staff in order to protect the confidentiality of our clients. If people are concerned about local confidentiality, they can call any domestic violence agency or hotline.”In these conversations, says Polkinghorne, staff help the caller assess the problem and what friends and family can do to help. “We receive many calls from mothers who are concerned about their daughters or grandchildren. We discuss the red flags with them and suggest ways to help.”There are many “silent pleas for help,” says Polkinghorne, which, if observed can help caring family members provide support.“General warning signs include a person seeming overly afraid or anxious to please their partner, and going along with everything their partner says or does. Do they seem to check in too often with their partner? Do they constantly have to report their whereabouts and what they’re doing?”Other warning signs include receiving frequent, harassing phone calls from a partner, insufficient excuses for bruises and injuries, or missing school, work or social occasions. “If she’s wearing turtlenecks or other inappropriate clothing in the summer or if she wears sunglasses indoors, she could be covering up bruises or other injuries.”Another concern is if the victim seems to be restricted from socializing with family or friends, if the frequency of socialization has changed dramatically or if the victim rarely goes out without their partner. Limited access to money, cars or credit cards can indicate control issues. “More serious signs include the person appearing depressed, anxious or suicidal, or if their self-esteem has plummeted.”Often, those in abusive relationships are the last to see the warning signs for themselves, Polkinghorne explains.“Do you feel anxious around your partner? Do you try to please him or her to avoid being hurt or to ‘keep the peace?’ Are you criticized in front of others? Are you blamed for everything? Are you expected to report your whereabouts at all times? Are you threatened with harm or violence?”Sexual and physical abuse is probably the most blatant form of abuse. “Physical and sexual abusers threaten to kill you or your children. They force partners to have sex, purposefully make sexual activities painful, hit, push, hold partners down or cause others physical harm,” says Polkinghorne.But all abuse isn’t physical. Polkinghorne stresses that emotional abuse is far more insidious than physical abuse. “I can’t tell you the number of emotionally abused victims who say, ‘I wish he would have just hit me, because then it would have been over.’” The scars from emotional abuse are long-lasting and difficult to overcome.Abusive partners frequently switch between kind and hurtful behavior. They control the finances and make the majority of relationship decisions. They make you wait all the time and make you feel like something is wrong with you for being upset. They are jealous for no reason, make you feel powerless and minimize their abusive comments or behavior.”“If you suspect abuse, ask your friend or family member if something is wrong. Express your concern. Listen and offer your personal or professional help. Support your friend’s decisions and get information for yourself so you can be the best possible advocate.”Polkinghorne says creating a safety plan is one way that family and friends can help the abused person to begin an exit strategy. “It’s very scary to think about leaving an abusive relationship. Statistics bear out that the most dangerous time for people in domestic violence situations is when they leave the relationship. People ask us, ‘Why don’t people just leave the relationship?’ When the abuser holds the credit, the money, the keys, when the abuser’s name is on the lease and the victim has no job and their family lives in New York, what are their options? This is why a safety plan is important. Save money and ask a family member or a friend to hold it for you. Keep copies of important documents. Seek professional help and stay in contact with a trusted friend.”October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month. “Though the Black Dot Campaign may not be the perfect answer to help victims of domestic abuse, there is so much people can do to support their loved ones and help them find a way to a better life,” Polkinghorne concludes.For more information, visit Project Sanctuary on Facebook, on Twitter @p_sanctuary and online at http://www.projectsanctuary.org.

(Courtesy: Brittany Mann)There was no halftime show under the Friday night lights at Mississippi’s Brandon High School — the marching band had been benched.The band was ordered off the field because the Christian hymn “How Great Thou Art” was a part of their halftime show — in violation of a federal court order.Click here to join Todd’s American Dispatch - a MUST-READ for Conservatives! “The Rankin County School Board and District Office are very saddened students will not be able to perform their halftime show they have worked so hard on this summer,” the district wrote in a statement to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.In 2013 a student sued the district over a series of Christian meetings that had been held on school property, the newspaper reported. The district later settled the lawsuit and acknowledged they had violated the student’s First Amendment rights. In July, U.S. District Court Judge Carlton Reeves ruled the district had violated the agreement after a Christian minister delivered a prayer at an awards ceremony. Judge Reeves, who was appointed to the bench by President Obama, came down hard on the school district — ordering them to pay thousands of dollars in fines. He also warned the district that future violations would cost them $10,000.“Defendants are permanently enjoined from including prayer, religious sermons or activities in any school sponsored event including but not limited to assemblies, graduations, award ceremonies, athletic events and any other school event,” the order reads.Word about the band getting benched spread across the town quicker than kudzu. I must have received emails and Facebook messages from nearly the entire state - from Desoto County to Yazoo City. Something must be done to right this wrong, people said. A message had to be sent to the likes of Judge Reeves. Locals gathered in coffee shops and garages to devise their plan. And what they did — would become known as the musical shot heard around the world.During halftime of Friday night’s game - a lone voice began to sing the forbidden song.“Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee,” the singer sang.Brittany Mann was there and she witnessed the entire moment of defiance. “We were just sitting there and then one by one people started to stand,” she told me. “At first, it started out as a hum but the sound got louder and louder.”She said it was a “truly incredible” moment to watch hundreds of people singing together in the stadium. “At that moment I was so proud of my town - coming together and taking a stand for something we believe in,” she said. “It breaks my heart to see where our country is going — getting farther and farther away from the Christian beliefs that our country was founded on.” I suspect Miss Brittany wasn’t the only one who felt a sense of pride in the Magnolia State on that warm summer night. “We may be pictured as toothless, barefoot, uneducated people around the country, but we are far from it,” nearby resident Mandy Miller told me. “I’m from Mississippi and I’m not ashamed to take a stand.” Oh what a sight it must have been — as hundreds and hundreds of people stood together and with one voice — sent a message to Judge Reeves.“This is the kind of thing that makes me proud to be from the South,” Miss Mandy told me. “We are getting tired of being told to sit down and shut up. People are ready to fight back.”Miss Mandy is absolutely right. The time has come to stand up to the secularists.The time has come to put an end to their cultural jihad. I hope the Rankin County School Board will reconsider its decision and allow the marching band to resume performing “How Great Thou Art.” And should Judge Reeves make good on his threat to financially punish the school district, I will personally pay the $10,000 fine. Todd Starnes is host of Fox News & Commentary.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/amelia-bassano-william-shakespeare/	a black woman named amelia bassano has been proved the true (uncredited) author of all of william shakespeare's plays.	False	['amelia bassano', ' bassano', ' literature', ' sonnets', ' william shakespeare', ' william shakespeare plays']	http://njjewishnews.com/	http://njjewishnews.com/njjn.com/022808/ltKosherBard.html	2015/08/20	Special to the NJJNFebruary 28, 2008John Hudson is a man with a mission. Seven years ago, the 54-year-old social theorist embarked on a literary adventure, following a long-nursed hunch about Shakespeare’s true identity.Hudson had spent most of his adult life grappling with complex questions that straddled the fields of social theory and cognitive science, creating high-level strategic redesign for the energy, telecommunications, Internet, and public sectors.“Most of my work involved helping media companies rethink their industries,” says Hudson. “Now I’ve moved on to rethinking the Shakespearean industry.” With his life and plays comprising a billion-dollar global industry, says Hudson, the Bard has managed to secure a sublime place in literary history as well as an omnipresence in pop culture and media. “But, like all industries, it rests on certain assumptions,” says Hudson. It is these very assumptions — primarily about who the author of the plays really was — that Hudson set about to reinvent.Hudson had an uneasy feeling that there was more beneath the plays’ surface than was brought to light by scholars and historians. His search began in earnest after he enrolled in a postgraduate program at the Shakespeare Institute at the University of Birmingham — in Stratford-upon-Avon, naturally — where he spent four years delving into the texts.He gradually devised the latest approach to Shakespearean authorship, the Amelia Bassano Theory — recently recognized by the Shakespearean Authorship Trust as one of the top eight authorship theories.The figure of Amelia Bassano Lanyer had turned up before in Shakespearean scholarship. In 1973, celebrated historian A.L. Rowse identified her as the actual “Dark Lady” of Shakespeare’s famed sonnets. Bassano — known as the first woman in England to have published a book of original poetry (Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum, 1611), which has been interpreted as an early feminist critique of the Christian Gospels — was part of a family of Italian court musicians of Moroccan/Semitic ancestry who lived as clandestine Jews.Hudson explains that the unusual circumstances of Amelia’s upbringing accounted for her extraordinary education and literary sensitivity. By age seven, she was adopted by the Countess of Kent, who provided her with a well-rounded education, including studies in Greek, Latin, and the Bible. By 13, she became mistress to Lord Henry Hunsdon, the man in charge of the English theater and patron of the Lord Chamberlain’s Men — the company that performed Shakespeare’s works.The plays certainly suggest that their author had access to scholarly training as well as exposure to certain specific environments — all of which coincide with Amelia’s biography. The 2,000 musical references, for example, were her birthright; the hundreds of references to plants, law, military life, and falconry could likely be the result of her involvement with Hunsdon. Other subject matter in the plays echoes her childhood experiences.But most important, Hudson discovered her key “literary signatures” — in which Amelia left her name spread across various plays. Her married name Lanier — meaning falcon in French — is spread across the two different versions of The Taming of the Shrew. It is in the form of the central figure who is tamed like a falcon, together with her name Emila; her father’s name, Baptista, and her husband’s name, Alphonso. An Emillius and a Bassianus appear in Titus Andronicus as well. But the most important “signatures” are those created after her husband’s death, between 1622-23, when her full maiden name — Aemilia Johnson Willough(by) Bassanio — was spread across three Shakespearean plays, associated in each case with the standard image of the Renaissance poet. Such a circumstance had little chance of being a mere coincidence. “She so badly wanted us to notice them,” says Hudson, “but nobody ever did.”Something revolutionaryThe next step for Hudson was to bring his case to the theater-going public. The first play he selected as a vehicle for his theory was A Midsummer Night’s Dream; with its staging he intended to present the allegorical plot revealing the key subtextual layers indicative of Bassano’s Jewish authorship. The challenge was to find the right people to do the job and convince them that he was on to something revolutionary.Hudson is British, married to an American, and the couple often shuttles between London and New York. It was there, in the fall of 2006, that he set out to put together a theater group that had both the dramatic training and mental muscle to actualize his theories. After a few months, Hudson had on board Mahayana Landowne, a Yale Drama School-educated director. Next he enrolled in a “Shakespeare Boot Camp” workshop at the New Perspectives Theatre Company, where he befriended Jenny Greeman, an experienced actress and theater educator who was to become his assistant director. “I found his theory compelling,” said Greeman, “and the figure of Amelia Bassano is absolutely fascinating…. She is someone who needs to be spoken about much more. I am thoroughly ready to believe that she could have written these plays….”Translating Hudson’s esoteric theory into concepts and then into practice involved hours of improvisation between actors, directors, and dramaturge (Hudson’s official title). “I was happy to adopt a hands-off management style when it came to staging the plays and leave it to those who truly understood the physicality of the theater,” he said. Yet, when it came to selecting actors for his new troupe, The Dark Lady Players, he made a point of meeting extensively with each actor to ensure that they were willing to think about the plays allegorically and took a proactive role at the dramatic workshops.Lila Dupree, who played Theseus, feels that the DLP achieved a group dynamic unlike any she had experienced before. “It is definitely a struggle at times to condense things so that they will be visually clear and clean. With something this high-concept, you risk alienating the audience, so a lot of our process involves finding ways to break down that fourth wall, so to speak.”Dupree is one of about 15 actors in the troupe, representing an eclectic ‘melting pot’ of theatrical backgrounds. What they all share is Shakespearean training buttressed by a voracious appetite for intellectually rigorous work.The DLP is now testing its version of As You Like It in workshops. Also in the pipeline is Hudson’s biography of Amelia Bassano, as well as a documentary film deal. With all the exciting attention on the horizon, the troupe feels wholly committed to its mission of presenting new and thought-provoking interpretations of Shakespeare’s (or Bassano’s) plays. “We’ve learned a lot from our experience with Midsummer,” says Dupree, “and with As You Like It, we are ready to take it to the next level.”To order a DVD of the Dark Lady Players’ Midsummer Night’s Dream, e-mail Dark Lady Players .Daniela Amini is a New York-based freelance writer specializing in theater, opera, dance, and local news.Comedy as revengeIn staging Midsummer Night’s Dream, John Hudson’s objective was, first and foremost, to reveal the play as a Jewish satire rife with pointed references to Christian idolatry. In other words, “comedy as revenge.”John Hudson carried out a literary adventure and brought it to the stage.In his findings, each character is revealed to have a connection with a character in religious allegory, i.e., a “double” in the Roman/Christian world. Stanford University professor Patricia Parker had already shown that Puck carries the name of two devils, that Bottom represents Jesus (and, in the course of the play, undergoes a kind of “Passion”), and that Thisbe represents the Church. Hudson completed the puzzle to show that Oberon is the figure of Yahweh (God of the Jews), who is embroiled in the Jewish-Roman war against Titus Caesar (embodied by Titania) over the abduction of the true Jewish Messiah (the Iudean or ‘Indian’ boy); the “flower, love in idleness” (a pun on idolatry), represents the Gospels; and the end of the play is a Jewish apocalypse characterized by the distribution of dew — as in the Zohar.The Dark Lady Players debuted Midsummer Night’s Dream in March 2007 at the Abingdon Theatre Arts Complex near Times Square. The staging was never heavy-handed and there were some uproariously funny moments, punctuated by scenes of violent carnage and deep, spiritual pathos. The overall tone was of a promising marriage between strict comedy and strict tragedy.— DANIELA AMINIDark Lady eventsFrom the Dark Lady Players’ A Midsummer Night’s Dream: A Comic Jewish Satire, Kirsta Peterson, top, as Bottom/Pyramus and Megan McGrath, left, and Amanda Bruton as soldiers.

Lee and Thomas J. ""Stonewall"" Jackson. The entire carved surface measures three-acres, larger than a football field and Mount Rushmore. The carving of the three men towers 400 feet above the ground, measures 90 by 190 feet, and is recessed 42 feet into the mountain. The deepest point of the carving is at Lee's elbow, which is 12 feet to the mountain's surface.In 1912 the carving existed only in the imagination of Mrs. C. Helen Plane, charter member of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC). The Venable family, owners of the mountain, deeded the north face of the mountain to the UDC in 1916. The UDC was given 12 years to complete a sizable Civil War monument.Three sculptors worked on the carving during its creation. Gutzon Borglum was hired in 1915 as the carving consultant, and in 1916 he was appointed carving sculptor by the Stone Mountain Monumental Association. Borglum envisioned a carving with seven central figures accompanied by ""an army of thousands."" He was not able to begin work on the carving until 1923 due to funding problems and World War I.After blasting away large portions of the mountain with dynamite, Borglum was able to complete the head of Lee on January 19, 1924. In 1925 a dispute arose between Borglum and the managing association. As a result of the conflict, Borglum left, taking all of his sketches and models with him. Borglum went on to carve the famous Mount Rushmore sculpture in South Dakota.Augustus Lukeman, the second sculptor, resumed work on the project in 1925. Lukeman's carving included the three central figures of the Confederacy on horseback. He removed Borglum's work from the mountain and diligently worked with pneumatic drills, but by 1928 (the original deadline) only Lee's head was complete and funds were depleted. The Venable family reclaimed their property, and the massive granite mountain remained untouched for 36 years.In 1958 the state of Georgia purchased the mountain and the surrounding land. The Georgia General Assembly created the Stone Mountain Memorial Association. In 1960 the Stone Mountain Confederate Memorial Advisory Committee was comprised of six internationally known figures in the world of art. A competition was held, and nine world-renowned sculptors submitted designs for a new sculpture.In 1963, based upon recommendations by the Advisory Committee, the Stone Mountain Memorial Association chose Walker Kirkland Hancock of Gloucester, Massachusetts to complete the carving. Work resumed in 1964, and a new technique utilizing thermo-jet torches was used to carve away the granite. Chief carver Roy Faulkner, a marine veteran with a talent for using the new thermo-jet torch, was able to remove tons of stone in one day. For over eight years Park guests could see and hear the workmen and their jet torches.The figures were completed with the detail of a fine painting. Eyebrows, fingers, buckles and even strands of hair were fine-carved with a small thermo-jet torch.The carving is actually much larger than it appears from Stone Mountain Park's attractions. Workers could easily stand on a horse's ear or inside a horse's mouth to escape a sudden rain shower. A dedication ceremony for the Confederate Memorial Carving was held on May 9, 1970. Finishing touches to the masterpiece were completed in 1972.Planning Your Trip"

However, during the 20th century, environmental exposure to man-made electromagnetic fields has been steadily increasing as growing electricity demand, ever-advancing technologies and changes in social behaviour have created more and more artificial sources. Everyone is exposed to a complex mix of weak electric and magnetic fields, both at home and at work, from the generation and transmission of electricity, domestic appliances and industrial equipment, to telecommunications and broadcasting.Tiny electrical currents exist in the human body due to the chemical reactions that occur as part of the normal bodily functions, even in the absence of external electric fields. For example, nerves relay signals by transmitting electric impulses. Most biochemical reactions from digestion to brain activities go along with the rearrangement of charged particles. Even the heart is electrically active - an activity that your doctor can trace with the help of an electrocardiogram.Low-frequency electric fields influence the human body just as they influence any other material made up of charged particles. When electric fields act on conductive materials, they influence the distribution of electric charges at their surface. They cause current to flow through the body to the ground.Low-frequency magnetic fields induce circulating currents within the human body. The strength of these currents depends on the intensity of the outside magnetic field. If sufficiently large, these currents could cause stimulation of nerves and muscles or affect other biological processes.Both electric and magnetic fields induce voltages and currents in the body but even directly beneath a high voltage transmission line, the induced currents are very small compared to thresholds for producing shock and other electrical effects.Heating is the main biological effect of the electromagnetic fields of radiofrequency fields. In microwave ovens this fact is employed to warm up food. The levels of radiofrequency fields to which people are normally exposed are very much lower than those needed to produce significant heating. The heating effect of radiowaves forms the underlying basis for current guidelines. Scientists are also investigating the possibility that effects below the threshold level for body heating occur as a result of long-term exposure. To date, no adverse health effects from low level, long-term exposure to radiofrequency or power frequency fields have been confirmed, but scientists are actively continuing to research this area.Biological effects or health effects? What is a health hazard?Biological effects are measurable responses to a stimulus or to a change in the environment. These changes are not necessarily harmful to your health. For example, listening to music, reading a book, eating an apple or playing tennis will produce a range of biological effects. Nevertheless, none of these activities is expected to cause health effects. The body has sophisticated mechanisms to adjust to the many and varied influences we encounter in our environment. Ongoing change forms a normal part of our lives. But, of course, the body does not possess adequate compensation mechanisms for all biological effects. Changes that are irreversible and stress the system for long periods of time may constitute a health hazard.An adverse health effect causes detectable impairment of the health of the exposed individual or of his or her offspring; a biological effect, on the other hand, may or may not result in an adverse health effect.It is not disputed that electromagnetic fields above certain levels can trigger biological effects. Experiments with healthy volunteers indicate that short-term exposure at the levels present in the environment or in the home do not cause any apparent detrimental effects. Exposures to higher levels that might be harmful are restricted by national and international guidelines. The current debate is centred on whether long-term low level exposure can evoke biological responses and influence people's well being.Widespread concerns for healthA look at the news headlines of recent years allows some insight into the various areas of public concern. Over the course of the past decade, numerous electromagnetic field sources have become the focus of health concerns, including power lines, microwave ovens, computer and TV screens, security devices, radars and most recently mobile phones and their base stations.The International EMF ProjectIn response to growing public health concerns over possible health effects from exposure to an ever increasing number and diversity of electromagnetic field sources, in 1996 the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a large, multidisciplinary research effort. The International EMF Project brings together current knowledge and available resources of key international and national agencies and scientific institutions.Conclusions from scientific researchIn the area of biological effects and medical applications of non-ionizing radiation approximately 25,000 articles have been published over the past 30 years. Despite the feeling of some people that more research needs to be done, scientific knowledge in this area is now more extensive than for most chemicals. Based on a recent in-depth review of the scientific literature, the WHO concluded that current evidence does not confirm the existence of any health consequences from exposure to low level electromagnetic fields. However, some gaps in knowledge about biological effects exist and need further research.Effects on general healthSome members of the public have attributed a diffuse collection of symptoms to low levels of exposure to electromagnetic fields at home. Reported symptoms include headaches, anxiety, suicide and depression, nausea, fatigue and loss of libido. To date, scientific evidence does not support a link between these symptoms and exposure to electromagnetic fields. At least some of these health problems may be caused by noise or other factors in the environment, or by anxiety related to the presence of new technologies.Effects on pregnancy outcomeMany different sources and exposures to electromagnetic fields in the living and working environment, including computer screens, water beds and electric blankets, radiofrequency welding machines, diathermy equipment and radar, have been evaluated by the WHO and other organizations. The overall weight of evidence shows that exposure to fields at typical environmental levels does not increase the risk of any adverse outcome such as spontaneous abortions, malformations, low birth weight, and congenital diseases. There have been occasional reports of associations between health problems and presumed exposure to electromagnetic fields, such as reports of prematurity and low birth weight in children of workers in the electronics industry, but these have not been regarded by the scientific community as being necessarily caused by the field exposures (as opposed to factors such as exposure to solvents).CataractsGeneral eye irritation and cataracts have sometimes been reported in workers exposed to high levels of radiofrequency and microwave radiation, but animal studies do not support the idea that such forms of eye damage can be produced at levels that are not thermally hazardous. There is no evidence that these effects occur at levels experienced by the general public.Electromagnetic fields and cancerDespite many studies, the evidence for any effect remains highly controversial. However, it is clear that if electromagnetic fields do have an effect on cancer, then any increase in risk will be extremely small. The results to date contain many inconsistencies, but no large increases in risk have been found for any cancer in children or adults.A number of epidemiological studies suggest small increases in risk of childhood leukemia with exposure to low frequency magnetic fields in the home. However, scientists have not generally concluded that these results indicate a cause-effect relation between exposure to the fields and disease (as opposed to artifacts in the study or effects unrelated to field exposure). In part, this conclusion has been reached because animal and laboratory studies fail to demonstrate any reproducible effects that are consistent with the hypothesis that fields cause or promote cancer. Large-scale studies are currently underway in several countries and may help resolve these issues.Electromagnetic hypersensitivity and depressionSome individuals report ""hypersensitivity"" to electric or magnetic fields. They ask whether aches and pains, headaches, depression, lethargy, sleeping disorders, and even convulsions and epileptic seizures could be associated with electromagnetic field exposure.There is little scientific evidence to support the idea of electromagnetic hypersensitivity. Recent Scandinavian studies found that individuals do not show consistent reactions under properly controlled conditions of electromagnetic field exposure. Nor is there any accepted biological mechanism to explain hypersensitivity. Research on this subject is difficult because many other subjective responses may be involved, apart from direct effects of fields themselves. More studies are continuing on the subject.The focus of current and future researchMuch effort is currently being directed towards the study of electromagnetic fields in relation to cancer. Studies in search for possible carcinogenic (cancer-producing) effects of power frequency fields is continuing, although at a reduced level compared to that of the late 1990's.The long-term health effects of mobile telephone use is another topic of much current research. No obvious adverse effect of exposure to low level radiofrequency fields has been discovered. However, given public concerns regarding the safety of cellular telephones, further research aims to determine whether any less obvious effects might occur at very low exposure levels.Key pointsA wide range of environmental influences causes biological effects. 'Biological effect' does not equal 'health hazard'. Special research is needed to identify and measure health hazards.At low frequencies, external electric and magnetic fields induce small circulating currents within the body. In virtually all ordinary environments, the levels of induced currents inside the body are too small to produce obvious effects.The main effect of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields is heating of body tissues.There is no doubt that short-term exposure to very high levels of electromagnetic fields can be harmful to health. Current public concern focuses on possible long-term health effects caused by exposure to electromagnetic fields at levels below those required to trigger acute biological responses.WHO's International EMF Project was launched to provide scientifically sound and objective answers to public concerns about possible hazards of low level electromagnetic fields.Despite extensive research, to date there is no evidence to conclude that exposure to low level electromagnetic fields is harmful to human health.The focus of international research is the investigation of possible links between cancer and electromagnetic fields, at power line and radiofrequencies."

For the next week he worked 12-hour shifts, digging through the rubble trying to find the bodies of missing firefighters, all the while refusing to do interviews or have his picture taken. ""It was a privilege to be able to do it,"" the 45-year-old actor said. ""It was great to connect with the firehouse I used to work with and with some of the guys I worked alongside. And it was enormously helpful for me because while I was working, I didn't really think about it as much, feel it as much. ""It wasn't until I stopped that I really felt the full impact of what had happened. It would have been much harder for me to get through it if I hadn't been able to do that."" Steve Buscemi might have been a senior firefighter by now - if only he had stuck with it. He's still in touch with friends at the New York Fire Department, and went back there for a medal ceremony only recently in honour of a lieutenant who took part in a rescue last year. But Steve Buscemi played his part with ""the bravest"", as America's firemen are known, from 1980 - 1984 and moved on. Yet, he continues to support his firefighter brothers whenever they are in need. Doomed Fire Heroes' Rig Unburied at Ground Zero By ANGELINA CAPPIELLO and WILLIAM NEUMAN Courtesy of The New York PostRecovery crews combing through debris from the north tower at Ground Zero found a firetruck yesterday - buried some 40 below street level. ""I just think it's ironic that it's appearing now [six months after Sept. 11],"" said Robin Freund, whose husband, Peter, a lieutenant, was one of five men killed from Engine Co. 55 in Little Italy. She said members of her husband's company had been out to Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island to look for the company's missing truck - little suspecting it was still buried deep within the wreckage at Ground Zero. The members of Engine 55 parked the truck next to the north tower before rushing in to help rescue the people inside - and when the building collapsed it apparently sucked the empty truck down with it. ""They were one of the first two companies there. That's probably why [the truck was buried so deep],"" said Freund, who is raising the couple's four children. She said her husband's colleagues called her after going to Ground Zero to look at the buried truck and told her it was ""unrecognizable."" But they did manage to remove a door and take it back to the firehouse, where they included it in a memorial to Lt. Freund, 46, and the others who perished with him, firefighters Faustino Apostol, 56, Stephen Russell, 38, Robert Lane, 30, and Christopher Mozzillo, 28. The bodies of all but Mozzillo have been recovered from the rubble. ""We're very happy we found the rig, we just hope we can find our last man,"" said firefighter Rich Cipoletti, at the firehouse. ""We hope we can bring him back home."" Firefighter Paul Acciarito said of the find, ""I'm ecstatic. It's almost like she was waiting for us to find her."" He said having a piece of the truck in the firehouse ""brings back the horrible memories of that day but I'm glad its back. A part of our heart came back."" Songs of Freedom/Tears of RemembranceThe following is an excerpt from a five-part journal detailing one man's crusade to bring healing to a New York firehouse after Sept. 11, and in doing so, heal himself. Barrington stockbroker Joe Cantafio is on a year-long concert tour to raise money for the widows and bereaved families of Engine Company 55, who lost five men at the World Trade Center on Sept. 11. In July 2002, Cantafio went to New York City to spend a week with Engine 55 and raise money with several club appearances. Daily Herald staff writer Jim Fuller and photographer Mark Welsh went along. They stayed in the firehouse in Little Italy, sleeping and eating alongside the men of Engine 55. Fuller kept a journal of that extraordinary week. In part one, they arrive in New York, meet the firefighters and see ground zero for the first time. At night, it's show time. Joe plays his first show at an Irish tavern called ""Molly Wee,"" where many of the Chicago rescue crews would go for a break after digging. It's not a neighborhood bar. Salt and pepper shakers sit on the tables and the waiters wear shirts and ties. Waiting inside is a face from Engine 55's past. Steve Buscemi was with Engine 55 before Hollywood came calling. His face is recognizable to millions, but tonight he's just a firefighter again. At one point he blends in so well that a woman asks him to watch the men's room door for her while she goes in to use the facilities instead of the crowded ladies room. He's not dressed for the red carpet tonight with black pants and a short-sleeve, deep-orange, button-up shirt. But tonight, class has no position. Some Budweiser reps show up in their suits and ties, but they mix right in with the jean shorts and sandals and start buying beer for everyone. Buscemi put on his gear and dug at ground zero with the rest of them. Tonight, he sings almost every song from ""We Won't Get Fooled Again"" to ""Born to Run."" There are smiles again. As they sing, footage of Sept. 11 plays on MSNBC during a story about the attacks. The firefighters don't see it - the television is over their heads. It is an odd mix of tragedy and recovery. Joe does a four-hour set, without a break, finally wrapping up close to 1 a.m. Buscemi walks over to Joe and hugs him at the end. ""I didn't get it before, but now I do. This is a great thing you're doing for New York."" Firefighters: Show Us The MoneyBy William Murphy, Vera Haller and Mike October 11, 2002 A relentless rain did little to dampen the mood of thousands of firefighters rallying for higher wages in Central Park Friday, their anger stoked by a profanity-laced speech from bad-boy comedian Denis Leary. “Take the 11 percent and stick it ... , Mr. Mayor,” Leary said, delighting the soaked crowd. “I’m tired of presidents, governors, senators, politicians, getting your pictures taken at —— wakes and funerals. Actions speak louder than words, ” he said. The firefighters union Thursday rejected of a contract offering an 11.5 percent raise over 30 months. The union’s executive board had approved the agreement in August of last year — before the World Trade Center attack the following month that left 343 members of the fire service dead. Leary, who lost his cousin, firefighter Jerry Lucey, in a warehouse fire in Worcester, Mass., in 1999, said the public did not understand how underpaid firefighters were. “These guys shouldn’t have to worry about second and third jobs and their kids’ tuition, and they should be able to see their kids,” Leary said. The rally was a prelude to Saturday’s memorial service for fallen firefighters at Madison Square Garden, expected to draw emergency workers from around the nation. While the East Meadow was a sea of umbrellas and rain slickers, the rally clearly fell short of the turnout expected by the Uniformed Firefighters Association. “This is just a little water,” said the Stephen Cassidy, president of the union. “We’ve been through much more. Let’s get a raise.”Many of the protesters carried placards, including one that read “I’m a New York City firefighter. I can’t afford an umbrella.” Another sign read, “A million thanks won’t pay a mortgage.”Speakers included politicians, widows and celebrities. Actor Steve Buscemi, who once worked at Engine 55 in Manhattan, got a particularly warm welcome. “We could never thank you enough,” Buscemi yelled to the crowd from a podium inside the park at 98th and Fifth Avenue. “We can never pay you enough.”Firefighters, who after five years on the job make about $59,000 annually including overtime and some benefits, said they just wanted to be compensated fairly. “I’m out here because we need a raise,” said Frank Doherty of Ladder Company 162 in Queens. “The city always has excuses why not to give us one. We’re out here to tell them the excuses are over.”Marian Fontana, the widow of firefighter David Fontana and president of the Sept. 11 Widow and Victims Family Association, told the crowd how she and her husband struggled to survive on a firefighter’s salary. She drew rousing applause when she called New York City’s firefighters “the underpaid soldiers on the front line” in the war against terrorism. The city’s deepening fiscal crisis — which has even included talk of possibly closing select fire companies — may make any resolution tough to come by. Cassidy said he would reopen talks with the city, but a spokesman for Mayor Michael Bloomberg held out little hope that anything would change. “We will continue to negotiate in good faith, but the city’s fiscal crisis really limits what we can afford,” mayoral spokesman Jerry Russo said Friday. Copyright © 2003, Newsday, Inc. Excerpt from Salon.com InterviewYou were once a fireman in Manhattan. Were you also acting during that time? I was a fireman for four years, from 1980 to '84. My first year on the job, I didn't do any acting, even though I had gone to school for acting and had done some stand-up comedy before I took the job. But after I had been on the job for about a year, I started going back to acting classes. It was around that time that I met Mark Boone and we started doing our own work. And then I started working with the theater group Willem Dafoe was with. I was constantly doing theater, and the first couple of films I did, I was still with the fire department -- Engine 55, in Little Italy. I was in the engine company, which means we were responsible for getting in there with the hose and putting out the fire. Were there any situations that were particularly hairy? Well, they're all frightening. Any time you go into a burning building, there's the potential for disaster. I never had any real close calls, though there's no such thing as a routine fire. Why did you become a firefighter? My dad had encouraged me to take the civil service test when I was 18. So I did, and I kind of forgot about it until my name came up on the list four years later. By then I was living in Manhattan, working as a furniture mover during the day, doing stand-up comedy at night and looking for a change. I liked the job -- the guys I worked with and the nature of the work. I think I would have been happy doing it if I hadn't had a greater passion for acting.

Watch these Amazing color photos. A single carefully-planned and well-executed stroke removed the United States Navy’s battleship force as a possible threat to the Japanese Empire’s southward expansion. America, unprepared and now considerably weakened, was abruptly brought into the Second World War as a full combatant.Just before 8 a.m. on December 7, 1941, hundreds of Japanese fighter planes attacked the American naval base at Pearl Harbor near Honolulu, Hawaii. The barrage lasted just two hours, but it was devastating: The Japanese managed to destroy nearly 20 American naval vessels, including eight enormous battleships, and almost 200 airplanes. More than 2,000 Americans soldiers and sailors died in the attack, and another 1,000 were wounded. The day after the assault, President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked Congress to declare war on Japan; Congress approved his declaration with just one dissenting vote. Three days later, Japanese allies Germany and Italy also declared war on the United States, and again Congress reciprocated. More than two years into the conflict, America had finally joined World War II.Next 1 of 6	
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/double-trouble/	a video clip shows a man being struck by lightning twice.	False	['accidents']	https://www.canada.ca/	https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/lightning/safety/dangers.html	2015/05/03	Lightning safetyDangers of lightningWhen we think of how lightning can hurt us, we often think of a direct strike which can injure or kill the person struck. However, it has been shown that a direct hit from lightning is responsible for only a small percentage of lightning-related injuries, compared to other causes.Lightning dangers can also be caused by ground current , side flash , contact (to an object struck by lightning), upward leaders , direct strike and blunt trauma (shockwave). This chart shows the six ways a lightning strike can kill or injure a person.Here’s the way it works: a lightning strike that hits the ground typically hits a primary object and then the current disperses through the ground until it dissipates. Research shows that a lightning strike that hits the ground is hazardous out to 10 metres. Some people have been injured 15 to 30 metres away from where a lightning strike has hit the ground. Lightning danger definitionsGround CurrentLightning enters the earth, travels through it and voltages are set up in the ground. One part of your body contacts one voltage, and another part of your body contacts a different voltage. The difference in voltage is what drives the current through your body. See also surface arc lightning .Side FlashWhen lightning that has hit an object travels partly down the object before jumping to a nearby victim. Never seek shelter near a lone tree or other tall object, as a side flash can splash lightning from these tall objects onto a nearby object to reach the ground. ContactThe person is touching or holding onto an object which lightning attaches itself to, such as wire fencing, telephones poles, etc. When inside a house, either a corded telephone or water pipe such as a faucet can also cause this.Upward LeadersOr streamers, are currents of positive charges that start growing upward from the ground from elevated objects. They are produced in response to the step leaders coming down from the cloud base. If a downward step leader and a streamer meet, a conductive path will be formed and a lightning stroke will occur. Other streamers in the area of the main stroke still carry a charge. This charge is much smaller than the main stroke but still large enough to cause injury or death to humans.Direct strikeIs when lightning attaches directly to the victim. Only three to five per cent of lightning fatalities result from a direct strike.Blunt traumaThis often occurs when a shock wave on the ground throws a person up to two metres away (10 feet) which results in bodily harm/injury. Blunt trauma can also occur from injuries related to fire, explosions, or falling objects, that are caused by a result of the lightning strike.Surface ArcHigh current surface arcs are associated with ground currents. They appear in photographs as bright arcs of light radiating from a strike point like spokes of a wheel, in the air just above the ground’s surface.The graphic below illustrates some of these phenomena. Ultimately it is two types of lightning strikes (ground current and side flash) that account for 60 to 80 per cent of all the lightning strikes that see people being killed or injured.

The massive operation to invade Nazi-occupied western Europe was known as Operation Overlord and was to last eleven months – eventually taking the allied forces all the way to Berlin, and Hitler’s secret bunker.The invasion of Normandy (itself known as Operation Neptune) began at 6.30am on the morning of June 6th, and the attacks were spread across five main beaches, codenamed Juno , Gold , Sword , Utah and Omaha which are spread out along an 80km stretch of France’s northern coast. 6,000 vessels joined the attack supported by over 11,000 planes. On D-Day itself troops from Canada, the United Kingdom and the U.S. were all deployed on foot.The situations at each the beaches were quite different, but the worst casualties were suffered at Omaha Beach – the horrors of which are familiar to many of us through the depiction of the landings in movies and TV shows such as Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers . Today the beach itself gives away nothing of its bloody history.It was the U.S. army who were charged with taking Omaha Beach, and due to the unexpectedly strong defences combined with landing difficulties, at least 2,499 U.S. soldiers died here. Today there are several memorials around the beach at Omaha, including the Normandy American Cemetery Memorial , where there are a total of 9,387 graves.A temporary cemetery was first established near here on June 8, 1944, and after the war, today’s permanent memorial was established just to the east of the original site. It was here that the opening and end of Saving Private Ryan were shot, and two of the four brothers on whom the film was based are buried here.From Street View we can also see the 1st Infantry Division monument , an obelisk inscribed with the names of U.S. 1st Infantry Division soldiers who died between June 6th and 24th, 1944.To the west of the beach is the Pointe du Hoc Ranger Monument , a simple granite pylon positioned on top of a German concrete bunker, that was erected by the French to honour the American Second Ranger Battalion who scaled the cliffs here. To the south of the monument lies an area littered with bomb craters that has been preserved almost exactly as it was nearly 70 years ago.By the end of D-Day the allies had put 156,000 troops ashore in Normandy, at a cost of around 10,000 allied troops, and between 4,000 and 9,000 German soldiers who were killed or injured. There are memorials all over the area to the men and women who died here, such as the Utah Beach American Memorial and the Juno Beach Centre .Today also marks the tenth anniversary of the opening of the National D-Day Memorial in Bedford, Virginia. Some 70,000 people visit the memorial each year, which features an “English garden”, a life-size statue of General Eisenhower, 13.5 metre (44 foot) tall granite arch, and most importantly, plaques listing the name of every one of the 4,413 allied soldiers who died in the invasion, the most complete list of its kind anywhere in the world.The foundation behind the memorial are currently engaged in an attempt to compile a list of the names of every service member that participated in Operations Overlord and Neptune.Wikipedia has a range of articles covering different aspects of D-Day, so why not lose yourself in some history for a while, starting here . Alternatively, read some of the first-hand accounts of the landings available on the 6 Juin 1944 website.Share	
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/grape-i-scream/	the fda has banned the sale of grape-flavored ice cream in the u.s. due to pet-related hazards. see example( s )	False	['asp article', ' odd ingredients']	http://emtoast.com/	http://emtoast.com/?p=4020	2015/04/14	"There is no such thing as grape ice cream. The reason? It has a lot to do with dogs, girls, the 1876 World’s Fair, pharmaceutical companies, and it’s more complicated than you think. After his successful invention of the ice cream soda in 1874, Philadelphia’s Robert Green began to tackle a request from his customers. Green boldly stated, in an 1876 interview with the Pennsylvania Inquirer, ""The people are tired of vanilla and chocolate. They want something more. When the children come up from the mines, they are not satisfied with the plain flavors anymore. I will give them grape. The world’s fair is coming. The world will have grape ice cream. This I decree."" What Green did not know, is that grapes contain a special molecule Anthocyanin that prevents freezing. Green’s every attempt to create grape ice cream only produced one outcome – grape milk. He was destined to fail, but in all the excitement with the fair, no one noticed. Until the 1970’s the mystery of Grape Ice cream remained unsolved. Baskin Robbins tried it, and failed. Carvel couldn’t do it. Dairy Queen, didn’t dare. However, in 1976 Ben Cohen, of ice cream duo Ben and Jerry took on the challenge This was actually 2 years before they opened their first ice cream parlor, but Ben was already a hardcore ice cream flavor creator. Ben told People Magazine in a 1984 interview, ""I had the biggest crush on Jerry’s sister (Becky). He knew it and didn’t want me near her. I think he’s still pissed about this one. Anyway, one day I was boasting to his sister that I would create a new ice cream flavor especially for her. Any flavor she wanted, but she had to go out with me. Becky was a real ball buster, so she says to me, ‘yeah okay GRAPE!’ She knew from Jerry that nobody could do it. They had been talking about it. Jerry always thought it was funny, but though grape was gross but I was determined to do it. I can’t even taste a damn grape, but I would do it anyway."" See my taste buds don’t work. That’s why all our flavors are lumpy so I can tell the flavors apart. Like everyone else before me, I couldn’t get the (grape) ice cream to freeze. At that stage, I was just using Welch’s grape juice and I was having difficulty with my test results because I couldn’t tell which group had the flavor, how much flavor was added, and so on. So to help myself with the testing, I started adding the grape skins. Something I could feel, to know what was what. We didn’t know it back then, but grapes contain Anthocyanin molecules. These are a form of anti-freeze. They keep the ice cream in lquid form — but if you increase the Anthocyanin level to a highly concentrated level, then you get the creamiest freeze you can imagine. An ice cream makers dream. You can only get the levels that high when you add the skins. They have more of those molecules than the rest of the grape – including the seed. That was the secret why the Germans were able to make rum raisin ice cream back in WWII. The damn Anthoycyanin levels in the raisin’s were perfect because the raisins had the skin, not the juice. I had no idea why it worked back then though. I just stumbled upon the discovery because of my tongue. Becky was impressed. We were at her house, alone. I gave her the scoop – on a cone. I was really getting somewhere. She was laughing and happy. She couldn’t believe I did it. I’ll never forget what happened next. Becky jokingly gave her dog a lick from the cone. He liked it and took a couple licks. Then he just gasped and dropped dead. He flipped down onto the floor and was just gone. I had no idea that Grapes are toxic to dogs. Specifically the Anthoycyanin. Becky was devastated. I had invented deadly dog poison, and I definitely wasn’t’ getting anywhere with her now. This grape thing was no good. You can’t have dog poison this toxic in the house. My creation was dead. I didn’t care about it anyway so I gave it to the pharmaceutical companies to figure out. I don’t remember who even gave me that idea, but I hear they’re still using grape flavored pills to put down dogs with at a lot of the old kill shelters. It’s my greatest mistake. The pharm. companies figured it out about the molecules. I gave up on it. I don’t think anybody else even tried. You can make the stuff at home as long as you don’t have a dog, but nobody is going to sell the stuff."" Shortly after Ben provided his formulas to the pharmaceutical industry, FDA banned the sale or research of any grape flavored ice creams or sherbets, natural or artificial due to pet related hazards. This ban is in effect until 2028. That’s why you never see grape flavored ice cream anywhere."

Many recognize the distinctiveness of Texas's experience—its revolt against Mexico, its life as an independent republic, and finally, its voluntary surrender of nationhood. But the causes and consequences of its unique course are less well understood.After gaining independence from Spain in the 1820s, Mexico welcomed foreign settlers to sparsely populated Texas. Promised land on generous terms, some twenty thousand to twenty-five thousand Americans migrated there within a decade, far outnumbering the resident Mexicans (Tejanos). These immigrants clustered in relatively autonomous colonies along the lower Brazos and Colorado rivers and in the east. Alarmed at their reluctance to assimilate, Mexico passed laws in 1830 to slow American immigration. But rent by conflict between federalists and conservative centralists, the government could not enforce them. The regulations succeeded only in angering both settlers and those Tejanos interested in economic development.Yet these laws were as much symptom as cause of friction. Some immigrants had never been reconciled to Mexican rule, citing putative U.S. claims to Texas by virtue of the Louisiana Purchase. Speculators counted on American annexation to raise the value of their land. Many Texans balked when earlier privileges, such as exemption from import duties, began to be withdrawn. The status of slavery rankled, too. The national government and the state government of Coahuila and Texas (in which Texans had little influence) passed various emancipation measures and banned the import of American slaves. Slaveholding Texans won exemption from some of these laws and evaded the others, and by 1835 slaves represented 10 to 15 percent of the non-Indian population. Though the laws did little except slow the immigration of slaveholders, they clearly worried those who believed rich but labor-scarce Texas could prosper only through slave cultivation of staple crops.Mexico's ability to offend Texans without effectively regulating their behavior bespoke more general sources of trouble. The Mexican government presumed it could mold economic, social, even religious life in Texas. It allowed the military to intrude upon what Americans took to be civil affairs—trade, legal proceedings, the master-slave relationship. Yet this same government could not with any regularity provide such seeming fundamentals as speedy justice or trial by jury. Immigrants from Jacksonian America had certain expectations of republican government, expectations that involved government neither claiming so much nor delivering so little.This failure of government to behave in accustomed ways provoked a crisis in 1835. Developments in Mexico had overshadowed political and legal reforms Texans had won in 1833 and 1834. Political turmoil allowed Gen. Antonio López de Santa Anna to amass an increasingly authoritarian power. Like colonists in prerevolutionary America, Texans perceived in the prospect of more strictly governed relations with the central government larger threats to their liberties and property. Santa Anna's triumph seemed also to dash the hopes of Tejanos for a democratic, decentralized Mexico. The coincidence of renewed trouble with the Mexican garrison at Anahuac and Santa Anna's march against various opponents in northern Mexico catalyzed resistance in the summer of 1835. A ""war party"" had been agitating for separation for some time, but the insistence of Mexican authorities that troublemakers be turned over to the military and, finally, an influx of Mexican troops in September convinced even the traditionally conciliatory Stephen Austin that ""war is our only resource.""A chaotic rebellion ensued. Significant military action occurred well before the rebels officially declared for independence. A provisional government, established in November, called only for separate statehood within Mexico and the federalist constitution of 1824, hoping to win the aid of liberal Mexicans elsewhere. That government could barely rally support within its own ranks, however, as the governor and council vied for authority. No single, effective military authority existed either. Volunteers held the Alamo, for instance, despite orders to the contrary. The creation of a new government and a consolidated military command after Texas declared independence in early March 1836 did not immediately bring order. The fall of the Alamo and the retreat of Sam Houston's forces eastward provoked panic and mass flight among civilians. Perhaps only the overconfidence this bred in Santa Anna—and the anger of Texan volunteers over the massacres at the Alamo and Goliad—saved the day. In late April, Houston's men surprised a Mexican force at San Jacinto. Houston's victory and the capture of Santa Anna suddenly ended Mexico's effort to subdue Texas.But apparently, independence was not what many Texans really desired. Voters elected Houston president, but also overwhelmingly endorsed union with the United States. The Jackson and Van Buren administrations spurned annexation, however. They feared both diplomatic trouble and the political consequences of pressing for the admission of a territory in which slavery, now constitutionally protected, was growing rapidly. A contributing factor to the Revolution, slavery had become the paramount consideration in annexation. As a result, the new republic struggled on alone. Presidents Houston, Mirabeau Lamar, and Anson Jones pursued various policies as to Mexican and Indian relations and the mounting debt, but none of them rendered Texas secure or solvent.By 1844, American caution about issues that might divide national parties along sectional lines had diminished. Some hoped the increased enthusiasm for territorial expansion, or anxiety over possible European machinations in Texas, might eclipse northern concerns over slavery. Many southerners, eager to secure and expand America's slaveholding territory, worried that Britain intended to promote abolition in Texas. For Secretary of State John C. Calhoun, the well-being of the South overrode any commitment to the existing party system. The health of that system did not overly concern President John Tyler either. Having alienated both parties, he vainly hoped the Texas issue might win him a new following.Initially, the traditional restraint regarding sectional issues seemed to prevail. The front-runners for the 1844 presidential nominations, Democrat Martin Van Buren and Whig Henry Clay, announced against immediate annexation. A treaty admitting Texas as a territory failed to win a majority in the Senate, much less the required two-thirds. But southern Democrats blocked Van Buren's nomination, opening the way for dark horse James Polk who campaigned for the acquisition of both Texas and Oregon (which presumably would remain free territory). Clay's subsequent equivocations on Texas may well have hastened the defection of antislavery Whigs to the Liberty party, a defection that probably cost him the election. Annexationists heralded Polk's narrow victory as a mandate. In early 1845 Congress, employing its power to admit new states, simply annexed Texas by a majority vote. Texan leaders who had been coy on annexation, hoping to prod either Europe into guaranteeing Texas independence or America into admitting Texas on the most favorable terms, likewise yielded to public sentiment. In June 1845 the republic's Congress accepted U.S. statehood.James Buchanan would later compare Texas to the Trojan horse. Its admission hastened the unraveling of the national parties. Many Van Buren Democrats, convinced that southerners had ridden roughshod over them in 1844, found their way into the Free-Soil or even the Republican movements. Annexation helped provoke war with Mexico, bringing America additional southwestern territory and fatally linking the politics of slavery and expansion.Robert Calvert and Arnoldo De León, The History of Texas (1990); Andreas Reichstein, Rise of the Lone Star: The Making of Texas (1989).Patrick G.

After more than two decades following a “no testing on animals” policy, cosmetics giants Avon, Mary Kay, and Estee Lauder have resumed the practice without letting consumers know. In the late 1980s, PETA’s “Avon Killing” campaign eventually led to the company banning animal testing for their products, with Mary Kay and Estée Lauder following suit.According to a press release from Rush PR, the news was broken after animal rights organization PETA removed the companies from their cruelty-free list after discovering that they had returned to using testing on animals for their products. The three companies began the tests again in order to satisfy regulations from the Chinese government so they could sell their products in China. However, PETA contends that there are alternative testing methods that are just as effective and widely used in the US.Kathy Guillermo, the Vice President of PETA’s Laboratory Investigations was saddened by the move: “Avon, Estée Lauder, and Mary Kay have regressed a generation: Their products are once again being dripped into rabbits’ eyes and smeared onto animals’ abraded skin.” She’s urging customers to choose cruelty-free products instead.Avon spokeswoman Reese Witherspoon may be upset to learn about the new animal testing as well. Late last year she was “dismayed” to learn a bag she was spotted with was made from real python skin and agreed to throw it away. But perhaps she can use her star power to influence Avon to go back to their animal-friendly ways.Keep You Up To Date On All Our Doggie News!Join our mailing list to receive the latest news and updates from Dog Files.SUBMIT!Thank you so much for subscribing to Dog Files!Share:

While there is some debate as to how Queen Xenomorphs are created, one possible route involves a Royal Facehugger impregnating a host with a Queen Chestburster . Notably, Royal Facehuggers are capable of implanting more than one embryo into multiple hosts before they die, typically in the form of a second, regular Xenomorph embryo, which it is thought serves to act as a ""guard"" for the infant Queen. [2]Contents[ show ]CharacteristicsRoyal Facehuggers, like all other Facehuggers, come from Eggs laid by Queens, although they are somewhat larger and possess armor and a bladed tail to help them protect the unborn Queen they carry inside. They also have webbed digits and a dark brown coloration though the one that impregnated Adams was described being lighter in color and only have webbed digits in the front and back digits, size remains larger than normal however [1]Most notably, a Royal Facehugger is capable of impregnating at least two separate victims with Chestbursters (one with an infant Queen, the other with a typical Xenomorph) and the Facehugger does not die until both of these embryos have been implanted. Exactly how long a Royal Facehugger can survive after impregnating its first host is not known; however, the specimen on Fiorina ""Fury"" 161 survived for some time between impregnating Ellen Ripley aboard the USS Sulaco and attacking Babe the ox on the planet's surface. [2]Behind the ScenesThe Royal Facehugger has only appeared once on-screen, and very briefly, in the Special Edition of Alien3; it is only seen for a few seconds on-screen when Murphy finds the dead creature alongside Babe 's corpse when the latter is taken to the prison slaughterhouse.In the special features included on the Alien3 DVD and Blu-ray, Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff, Jr. discuss this ""Super Facehugger"" and point out that they had taken design inspiration for the creature from the Xenomorph Queen. They also consider it to be the creature that implanted the Queen embryo inside Ripley. [1] The Royal Facehugger model was sculpted by effects artist Chris Halls . [3]However, when Alien3 was released in cinemas, the scene featuring the Royal Facehugger was completely removed, and a regular Facehugger was used in the film in its stead. This left it unclear how two Xenomorphs came to be on the planet, as only one Egg is seen and traditionally Facehuggers have died as soon as their job of implanting a Xenomorph embryo is complete, and also rendered the canon status of the alternate Facehugger debatable. However, the Royal Facehugger reappeared in the novel Alien: Sea of Sorrows , its appearance described as akin to that created for Alien3. [4]ComicsThe Queen Facehugger's appearance in the comics is very different to the one in Alien3, likely because the Special Edition of the film featuring the creature had yet to be released. Royal Facehuggers in the comic have the same color as normal Facehuggers but possess spines on their backs and have spots on their air bladders. They have appeared in several comic books including Aliens vs. Predator: Deadliest of the Species , but all share the same appearance.TriviaA Queen Facehugger Seen in an AvP comicBeing a ""Super"" Facehugger, it is presumably stronger and more resilient than regular Facehuggers, and is likely more intelligent (evidenced by its ability to stay concealed for some time between impregnating hosts in Alien3).Royal Facehuggers are able to impregnate at least two hosts, presumably to provide the fledgling Queen with an immediate ""bodyguard"" in the form of a normal Xenomorph Drone .Notably, the Royal Facehugger does not appear in Stasis Interrupted , which recreates the beginning of Alien3, including Ripley being impregnated aboard the Sulaco (by a regular Facehugger).In the Aliens novel series and the AvP games, a Drone / Warrior is capable of molting into a Queen if there is no Queen currently alive (examples include Specimen 6 ). [5] This change has alternately been shown as direct or involving an intermediate Praetorian stage. This method of Queen creation bypasses the need for a Royal Facehugger and Queen embryo altogether. The Predalien in Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem is also shown molting, however it remains unclear if it was a Drone/Warrior before molting or if it was a Queen from ""birth"", like the Chestburster inside Ripley in Alien3.The book Alien: The Weyland-Yutani Report theorizes that, in absence of a Royal Facehugger, a typical Facehugger can instead develop the means to implant a royal embryo.The Aliens toyline by Kenner features a Queen Face Hugger , referred to as a Giant Face Hugger Alien in the accompanying mini-comic, Aliens: Terrordome .Appearances"	
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/heaven-dissent/	alex malarkey, protagonist of the book the boy who came back from heaven: a true story, actually visited heaven.

According to sources, Lifeway intends to pull this book from it’s bookstore! Warren Throckmorton has the story , but the gist is that in response to Throckmorton’s questions, “Martin King, Director of Communications at Lifeway issued a statement saying the stores are pulling the book:“LifeWay was informed this week that Alex Malarkey has retracted his testimony about visiting heaven as told in the book “The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven.” Therefore, we are returning to the publisher the few copies we have in our Stores.”We have commentary on this and will be posting a fuller update tomorrow morning. UPDATE 3! Emails Suggest Lifeway President Knew of Heaven Scam, Chose Not to Act Lifeway has been selling The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven for many years now. It is part of the trifecta of books on “heavenly tourism” that Lifeway has sold and has promoted, along with 90 Minutes in Heaven and Heaven is for Real. The co-author of The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven – the boy himself – has written an open letter to Lifeway and admonished them for not holding to the sufficiency of Scripture, and has recanted his tale. For those who may not be familiar with of The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven, the publisher’s description is as follows:“In 2004, Kevin Malarkey and his six-year-old son, Alex, suffered an horrific car accident. The impact from the crash paralyzed Alex–and medically speaking, it was unlikely that he could survive. ‘I think Alex has gone to be with Jesus,’ a friend told the stricken dad. But two months later, Alex awoke from a coma with an incredible story to share. Of events at the accident scene and in the hospital while he was unconscious. Of the angels that took him through the gates of heaven itself. Of the unearthly music that sounded just ‘terrible’ to a six-year-old. And, most amazing of all . . . Of meeting and talking to Jesus. ‘The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven’ is the true story of an ordinary boy’s most extraordinary journey. As you see heaven and earth through Alex’s eyes, you’ll come away with new insights on miracles, life beyond this world, and the power of a father’s love.”It’s in this context- the context of Lifeway selling this book and making money off of it for years- that Alex Malarkey, the co-author of the book, has reached out to us. [Update: Many people have asked if this is the first time Alex has spoken out directly. Although Alex’s mother has tried to speak out and contacted book-sellers and has been flatly ignored, going back to at least December 2012, on her blog and in other places, I believe this is the first time Alex has himself spoken out in such a direct way in his own…except for posting a comment relaying this information on the Alex Malarkey fan page on Facebook, after which the comment was deleted by moderators and he was blocked from the group. It doesn’t matter that we are or are not the first. That point is utterly irrelevant. What is relevant is that God willing we will be the last, and that we’re able to provide Alex with a wider audience that he had received the first few go-arounds to get people’s attention.Alex and his mother are well aware of the #the15 and supports the mission of those who are tired of being marginalized and written-off by those considered to be Christian leaders for bringing up legitimate concerns. We saw an example of Beth reaching out to Christian leaders over a month ago when Thom Rainer, president of Lifeway Christian Resources and one who has become the object of much exhorting and beseeching about these issues, was contacted by Alex Malarkey’s mother, Beth. Alex’s mother communicated to Rainer that her son Alex was against the book that purported to be his story.Unfortunately, Thom Rainer has taken no apparent action as result of Beth’s comments. Perhaps he plans to, I don’t know. I do know that, so far, due to the pressure and pleas from the Pulpit and Pen and others, that three of the books that we have taken aim at and labelled “the worst books Lifeway sells” have been pulled from their online store. We’re going for a fourth…not because we’re upset and just want to cause a scene, but out of love and care for our neighbors who might read this. Sadly, messengers to the SBC in 2014 passed a resolution against such books, but Rainer continues to proudly display heavenly tourism on the shelves at the SBC-owned Lifeway bookstores.Also, we are publishing this story because Christian publishers and retailers should have known better. They should have had the spiritual discernment, wisdom, compassion, and intestinal fortitude to not sell a book which contains, along with all books like it, deep theological problems. It also doesn’t help that in what is purported to be a “TRUE STORY” that there are vivid descriptions like which test the limits of how far we are willing to go outside the realm of scripture and accept as having been from God.“The devil’s mouth is funny looking, with only a few moldy teeth. And I’ve never noticed any ears. His body has a human form, with two bony arms and two bony legs. He has no flesh on his body, only some moldy stuff. His robes are torn and dirty. I don’t know about the color of the skin or robes—it’s all just too scary to concentrate on these things!” With that said, we offer up Alex’s letter. It is directed to the Christian bookstores that sell his book for profit. While I’ve no doubt that Lifeway will see this and will more than likely pull it off their shelves and online store, [UPDATE II. As of 7:30am EST on January 15, the book has not been pulled] I would ask and pray that anyone reading this would contact other major Christian bookstores and organizations and send them this link, so that they too would pull it down. We thank Alex for trusting Pulpit & Pen to release his letter.From Alex:“An Open Letter to Lifeway and Other Sellers, Buyers, and Marketers of Heaven Tourism, by the Boy Who Did Not Come Back From Heaven.”Please forgive the brevity, but because of my limitations I have to keep this short.I did not die. I did not go to Heaven.I said I went to heaven because I thought it would get me attention. When I made the claims that I did, I had never read the Bible. People have profited from lies, and continue to. They should read the Bible, which is enough. The Bible is the only source of truth. Anything written by man cannot be infallible.It is only through repentance of your sins and a belief in Jesus as the Son of God, who died for your sins (even though he committed none of his own) so that you can be forgiven may you learn of Heaven outside of what is written in the Bible…not by reading a work of man. I want the whole world to know that the Bible is sufficient. Those who market these materials must be called to repent and hold the Bible as enough.In Christ,	
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/california-wines-contain-dangerous-levels-arsenic/	california wine contains dangerous levels of arsenic.	Unproven	['arsenic', ' food safety', ' wine']	http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/	http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2015/03/19/your-favorite-wine-might-be-laced-with-arsenic-according-to-suit/	2015/03/21	(CBS SF) — There may be a reason to think twice before you sip – a lawsuit filed in California Thursday contends some top-selling wines contain high levels of arsenic. Kevin Hicks is the man behind BeverageGrades, a Denver lab that analyzes wine. Before launching the lab, Hicks spent 15 years in the wine business. Because there are very few federal labeling requirements telling you what’s in the wine you drink, Hicks decided to test some brands himself. His results are shocking. He tested more than 1,300 bottles of wine and found almost a quarter contained levels of arsenic higher than the Environmental Protection Agency’s maximum limit for drinking water of 10 parts per billion. In some cases he says the wines contained up to four and five times that amount. So far there is no theory on why this might be happening but Hicks’ tests showed an interesting pattern. “The lower the price of wine on a per-liter basis, the higher the amount of arsenic,” he said. Hicks’ list of low-priced, high-arsenic wines includes Trader Joe’s famous Two-Buck Chuck White Zinfandel which tested at three times the limit. A bottle of Menage a Trois Moscato was four times the limit and a Franzia Blush had five time the EPA limit for drinking water. Not surprisingly, Hicks said the wine companies he approached were not happy with him or the tests. Then he took the results to a law firm. Attorney Brian Kabateck says they took Hicks’ original test results to two separate labs and they “absolutely” stand up. And that’s what they argue in the class action lawsuit. They’re accusing more than 24 California winemakers and sellers of misrepresenting their wines as safe. So how bad is it? CBS News took the results to epidemiologist Allan Smith, associate director of the Arsenic Health Effects research program at UC Berkeley. Smith said the alleged 50 parts per billion arsenic wines, the highest level found in Hicks’ test, could be deadly over time. Even though “parts per billion” seems like a very tiny amount, Smith said, “Arsenic is highly toxic, it’s astonishing. Keep in mind the tests were based on limits set for drinking water, that’s the only beverage with an arsenic limit set by the United States government. In response, the Wine Group, one of the companies named in the suit told CBS News, “It would not be accurate or responsible to use the water standard as the baseline” because people drink more water than wine. Two other companies named in the suit responded to CBS News’ request for comment. Treasury Wine estates said its “brands are fully compliant with all relevant federal and state guidelines,” and Trader Joes, which sells Two-Buck Chuck said, “the concerns raised in your inquiry are serious and are being treated as such. But the attorney behind the suit says they want accountability.

Towards the end of section 2 it says plainly that "" The ratio of the diameter and circumference is as five-fourths to four ,"" which means pi is 3.2. The section goes on the criticize (ungenerously, I'd say) past values of pi as ""wholly wanting and misleading."" Click here to return to ""Indiana Pi."" ENGROSSED HOUSE BILL No. 246A Bill for an act introducing a new mathematical truth and offered as a contribution to education to be used only by the State of Indiana free of cost by paying any royalties whatever on the same, provided it is accepted and adopted by the official action of the Legislature of 1897. Section 1Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Indiana: It has been found that a circular area is to the square on a line equal to the quadrant of the circumference, as the area of an equilateral rectangle is to the square on one side. The diameter employed as the linear unit according to the present rule in computing the circle's area is entirely wrong, as it represents the circle's area one and one-fifth times the area of a square whose perimeter is equal to the circumference of the circle. This is because one fifth of the diameter fails to be represented four times in the circle's circumference. For example: if we multiply the perimeter of a square by one-fourth of any line one-fifth greater than one side, we can in like manner make the square's area to appear one-fifth greater than the fact, as is done by taking the diameter for the linear unit instead of the quadrant of the circle's circumference. Section 2 It is impossible to compute the area of a circle on the diameter as the linear unit without trespassing upon the area outside of the circle to the extent of including one-fifth more area than is contained within the circle's circumference, because the square on the diameter produces the side of a square which equals nine when the arc of ninety degrees equals eight. By taking the quadrant of the circle's circumference for the linear unit, we fulfill the requirements of both quadrature and rectification of the circle's circumference. Furthermore, it has revealed the ratio of the chord and arc of ninety degrees, which is as seven to eight, and also the ratio of the diagonal and one side of a square which is as ten to seven, disclosing the fourth important fact, that the ratio of the diameter and circumference is as five-fourths to four ; and because of these facts and the further fact that the rule in present use fails to work both ways mathematically, it should be discarded as wholly wanting and misleading in its practical applications. Section 3 In further proof of the value of the author's proposed contribution to education and offered as a gift to the State of Indiana, is the fact of his solutions of the trisection of the angle, duplication of the cube and quadrature of the circle having been already accepted as contributions to science by the American Mathematical Monthly, the leading exponent of mathematical thought in this country. And be it remembered that these noted problems had been long since given up by scientific bodies as insolvable mysteries and above man's ability to comprehend. LEGISLATIVE HISTORY"

This peter guy who was purportedly a follower, he wrote to affirm it, Luke wrote his accounts based on eye witness accounts, secular texts and by secular i mean official letters not having religious prejudices being written on official matters of the state from the time period indicate that the Romans in the area were aware that the tomb was empty but blamed it on the followers of Jesus. Jewish writings also deal with the issue in the same way. The point is not was the tomb empty, anyone still arguing this is still in the elementary school of thought; the point is how it became so. Now the true skeptic can begin his work because everything up to this point can be believed and explained as either natural phenomenon misinterpreted or simply misrepresented. Jesus is an incontrovertible historical figure. That much is clear. That he said what he was attributed to say is also easily proven. I have no problems with that. The thing we have to ask is if he was who and what he said he was, namely the incarnated god that all people have a vague idea exists in some form. If that can be proven then we must accept all other facts about him since they ultimately pale in comparison to this claim. A genuine self resurrection from a state of lifelessness would be a first in the history of man. If Jesus managed that then great, I have my opinions after careful research but I wont foist them on anyone who won’t listen to reason.

First, I shall thank you, the gentlemen of the Colony of Virginia, for bringing me here. I am here to help you solve some of your problems with slaves. Your invitation reached me on my modest plantation in the West Indies where I have experimented with some of the newest and still the oldest methods for control of slaves. Ancient Rome would envy us if my program is implemented. As our boat sailed south on the James River, named for our illustrious King, whose version of the Bible we cherish, I saw enough to know that your problem is not unique. While Rome used cords of wood as crosses for standing human bodies along its old highways in great numbers you are here using the tree and the rope on occassion. I caught a whiff of a dead slave hanging from a tree a couple of miles back. You are not only losing valuable stock by hangings, you are having uprisings, slaves are running away, your crops are sometimes left in the fields too long for maximum profit, you suffer occasional fires, your animals are killed. Gentlemen, you know what your problems are; I do not need to elaborate. I am not here to enumerate your problems, I am here to introduce you to a method of solving them. In my bag here, I have a fool proof method for controlling your Black slaves. I guarantee everyone of you that if installed correctly it will control the slaves for at least 300 years. My method is simple. Any member of your family or your overseer can use it. I have outlined a number of differences among the slaves; and I take these differences and make them bigger. I use fear, distrust, and envy for control purposes. These methods have worked on my modest plantation in the West Indies and it will work throughout the South. Take this simple little list of differences, and think about them. On top of my list is ""Age"", the second is ""Color"" or shade, there is intelligence, size, sex, size of plantations, status on plantation, attitude of owners, whether the slaves live in the valley, on a hill, East, West, North, South, have fine hair or coarse hair, or is tall or short. Now that you have a list of differences, I shall give you an outline of action- but before that I shall assure you that distrust is stronger than adulation; respect or admiration. The Black slave after receiving this indoctrination shall carry on and will become self re-fueling and self-generating for hundreds of years, maybe thousands. Don't forget you must pitch the old Black vs. the young Black male, and the young Black male against the old Black male. You must use the dark skin slave vs. the light skin slaves and the light skin slaves vs. the dark skin slaves. You must use the female vs. the male, and the male vs. the female. You must also have your White servants and overseers distrust all Blacks, but it is necessary that your slaves trust and depend on us. They must love, respect, and trust only us. Gentlemen, these Kits are your Keys to control. Use them. Have your wives and children use them, never miss opportunity. If used intensely for one year, the slaves themselves will remain perpetually distrustful.

In the great journal of things happening under the sun, we, the American People, find our account running, under date of the nineteenth century of the Christian era.--We find ourselves in the peaceful possession, of the fairest portion of the earth, as regards extent of territory, fertility of soil, and salubrity of climate. We find ourselves under the government of a system of political institutions, conducing more essentially to the ends of civil and religious liberty, than any of which the history of former times tells us. We, when mounting the stage of existence, found ourselves the legal inheritors of these fundamental blessings. We toiled not in the acquirement or establishment of them--they are a legacy bequeathed us, by a once hardy, brave, and patriotic, but now lamented and departed race of ancestors. Their's was the task (and nobly they performed it) to possess themselves, and through themselves, us, of this goodly land; and to uprear upon its hills and its valleys, a political edifice of liberty and equal rights; 'tis ours only, to transmit these, the former, unprofaned by the foot of an invader; the latter, undecayed by the lapse of time and untorn by usurpation, to the latest generation that fate shall permit the world to know. This task gratitude to our fathers, justice to ourselves, duty to posterity, and love for our species in general, all imperatively require us faithfully to perform. How then shall we perform it?--At what point shall we expect the approach of danger? By what means shall we fortify against it?-- Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant, to step the Ocean, and crush us at a blow? Never!--All the armies of Europe, Asia and Africa combined, with all the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in their military chest; with a Buonaparte for a commander, could not by force, take a drink from the Ohio, or make a track on the Blue Ridge, in a trial of a thousand years. At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer, if it ever reach us, it must spring up amongst us. It cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die by suicide. I hope I am over wary; but if I am not, there is, even now, something of ill-omen, amongst us. I mean the increasing disregard for law which pervades the country; the growing disposition to substitute the wild and furious passions, in lieu of the sober judgment of Courts; and the worse than savage mobs, for the executive ministers of justice. This disposition is awfully fearful in any community; and that it now exists in ours, though grating to our feelings to admit, it would be a violation of truth, and an insult to our intelligence, to deny. Accounts of outrages committed by mobs, form the every-day news of the times. They have pervaded the country, from New England to Louisiana;--they are neither peculiar to the eternal snows of the former, nor the burning suns of the latter;--they are not the creature of climate-- neither are they confined to the slave-holding, or the non-slave- holding States. Alike, they spring up among the pleasure hunting masters of Southern slaves, and the order loving citizens of the land of steady habits.--Whatever, then, their cause may be, it is common to the whole country. It would be tedious, as well as useless, to recount the horrors of all of them. Those happening in the State of Mississippi, and at St. Louis, are, perhaps, the most dangerous in example and revolting to humanity. In the Mississippi case, they first commenced by hanging the regular gamblers; a set of men, certainly not following for a livelihood, a very useful, or very honest occupation; but one which, so far from being forbidden by the laws, was actually licensed by an act of the Legislature, passed but a single year before. Next, negroes, suspected of conspiring to raise an insurrection, were caught up and hanged in all parts of the State: then, white men, supposed to be leagued with the negroes; and finally, strangers, from neighboring States, going thither on business, were, in many instances subjected to the same fate. Thus went on this process of hanging, from gamblers to negroes, from negroes to white citizens, and from these to strangers; till, dead men were seen literally dangling from the boughs of trees upon every road side; and in numbers almost sufficient, to rival the native Spanish moss of the country, as a drapery of the forest. Turn, then, to that horror-striking scene at St. Louis. A single victim was only sacrificed there. His story is very short; and is, perhaps, the most highly tragic, if anything of its length, that has ever been witnessed in real life. A mulatto man, by the name of McIntosh, was seized in the street, dragged to the suburbs of the city, chained to a tree, and actually burned to death; and all within a single hour from the time he had been a freeman, attending to his own business, and at peace with the world. Such are the effects of mob law; and such as the scenes, becoming more and more frequent in this land so lately famed for love of law and order; and the stories of which, have even now grown too familiar, to attract any thing more, than an idle remark.1

Greeted by an ecstatic audience, Reagan gave his former vice president and successor, George Bush, a welcome boost by endorsing him for re-election at the 1992 Republican convention.Audio: Quicktime PlayerThank you, Paul for that kind introduction. And Mr. Chairman, delegates, friends, fellow Americans, thank you so very much for that welcome. You've given Nancy and me so many wonderful memories, so much of your warmth and affection, we cannot thank you enough for the honor of your friendship.Over the years, I've addressed this convention as a private citizen, as a governor, as a presidential candidate, as a president and now, once again tonight, as private citizen Ronald Reagan.Tonight is a very special night for me. Of course, at my age, every night's a very special night. After all, I was born in 1911. Indeed, according to the experts, I have exceeded my life expectancy by quite a few years. Now this a source of great annoyance to some, especially those in the Democratic party.But, here's the remarkable thing about being born in 1911. In my life's journey over these past eight decades, I have seen the human race through a period of unparalleled tumult and triumph. I have seen the birth of communism and the death of communism. I have witnessed the bloody futility of two World Wars, Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf. I have seen Germany united, divided and united again. I have seen television grow from a parlor novelty to become the most powerful vehicle of communication in history. As a boy I saw streets filled with model-Ts; as a man I have met men who walked on the moon.I have not only seen, but lived the marvels of what historians have called the ""American Century."" Yet, tonight is not a time to look backward. For while I take inspiration from the past, like most Americans, I live for the future. So this evening, for just a few minutes, I hope you will let me talk about a country that is forever young.There was a time when empires were defined by land mass, subjugated peoples, and military might. But the United States is unique because we are an empire of ideals. For two hundred years we have been set apart by our faith in the ideals of democracy, of free men and free markets, and of the extraordinary possibilities that lie within seemingly ordinary men and women. We believe that no power of government is as formidable a force for good as the creativity and entrepreneurial drive of the American people.Those are the ideals that invented revolutionary technologies and a culture envied by people everywhere. This powerful sense of energy has made America synonymous for opportunity the world over. And after generations of struggle, America is the moral force that defeated communism and all those who would put the human soul itself into bondage.Within a few short years, we Americans have experienced the most sweeping changes of this century: the fall of the Soviet Union and the rise of the global economy. No transition is without its problems, but as uncomfortable as it may feel at the moment, the changes of the 1990's will leave America more dynamic and less in danger than at any time in my life.A fellow named James Allen once wrote in his diary, ""many thinking people believe America has seen its best days."" He wrote that July 26, 1775. There are still those who believe America is weakening; that our glory was the brief flash of time called the 20th Century; that ours was a burst of greatness too bright and brilliant to sustain; that America's purpose is past.My friends, I utterly reject those views. That's not the America we know. We were meant to be masters of destiny, not victims of fate. Who among us would trade America's future for that of any other country in the world? And who could possibly have so little faith in our America that they would trade our tomorrows for our yesterdays?I'll give you a hint. They put on quite a production in New York a few weeks ago. You might even call it slick. A stone's throw from Broadway it was, and how appropriate. Over and over they told us they are not the party they were. They kept telling us with straight faces that they're for family values, they're for a strong America, they're for less intrusive government.And they call me an actor.To hear them talk, you'd never know that the nightmare of nuclear annihilation has been lifted from our sleep. You'd never know that our standard of living remains the highest in the world. You'd never know that our air is cleaner than it was 20 years ago. You'd never know that we remain the one nation the rest of the world looks to for leadership.It wasn't always this way. We mustn't forget--even if they would like to-- the very different America that existed just 12 years ago; an America with 21 percent interest rates and back to back years of double digit inflation; an America where mortgage payments doubled, paychecks plunged, and motorists sat in gas lines; an America whose leaders told us it was our own fault; that ours was a future of scarcity and sacrifice; and that what we really needed was another good dose of government control and higher taxes.It wasn't so long ago that the world was a far more dangerous place as well. It was a world where aggressive Soviet communism was on the rise and American strength was in decline. It was a world where our children came of age under the threat of nuclear holocaust. It was a world where our leaders told us that standing up to aggressors was dangerous -- that American might and determination were somehow obstacles to peace.But we stood tall and proclaimed that communism was destined for the ash heap of history. We never heard so much ridicule from our liberal friends. The only thing that got them more upset was two simple words: ""Evil Empire.""But we knew then what the liberal Democrat leaders just couldn't figure out: the sky would not fall if America restored her strength and resolve. The sky would not fall if an American president spoke the truth. The only thing that would fall was the Berlin Wall.I heard those speakers at that other convention saying ""we won the Cold War"" -- and I couldn't help wondering, just who exactly do they mean by ""we""? And to top it off, they even tried to portray themselves as sharing the same fundamental values of our party! What they truly don't understand is the principle so eloquently stated by Abraham Lincoln: ""You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong. You cannot help the wage-earner by pulling down the wage-payer. You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich. You cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they could and should do for themselves.""If we ever hear the Democrats quoting that passage by Lincoln and acting like they mean it, then, my friends, we will know that the opposition has really changed.Until then, we see all that rhetorical smoke, billowing out from the Democrats, well ladies and gentlemen, I'd follow the example of their nominee. Don't inhale.This fellow they've nominated claims he's the new Thomas Jefferson. Well, let me tell you something. I knew Thomas Jefferson. He was a friend of mine. And governor, you're no Thomas Jefferson.Now let's not dismiss our current troubles, but where they see only problems, I see possibilities -- as vast and diverse as the American family itself. Even as we meet, the rest of the world is astounded by the pundits and finger pointers who are so down on us as a nation.Well I've said it before and I'll say it again -- America's best days are yet to come. Our proudest moments are yet to be. Our most glorious achievements are just ahead. America remains what Emerson called her 150 years ago, ""the country of tomorrow."" What a wonderful description and how true. And yet tomorrow might never have happened had we lacked the courage in the 1980's to chart a course of strength and honor.All the more reason no one should underestimate the importance of this campaign and what the outcome will mean. The stakes are high. The presidency is serious business. We cannot afford to take a chance. We need a man of serious purpose, unmatched experience, knowledge and ability. A man who understands government, who understands our country and who understands the world. A man who has been at the table with Gorbachev and Yeltsin. A man whose performance as commander-in-chief of the bravest and most effective fighting force in history left the world in awe and the people of Kuwait free of foreign tyranny. A man who has devoted more than half of his life to serving his country. A man of decency, integrity and honor.And tonight I come to tell you that I -- warmly, genuinely, wholeheartedly support the re-election of George Bush as president United States.We know President Bush. By his own admission, he is a quiet man, not a showman. He is a trustworthy and levelheaded leader who is respected around the world. His is a steady hand on the tiller through the choppy waters of the '90s, which is exactly what we need.We need George Bush! Yes, we need Bush.We also need another fighter, a man who happens to be with us this evening, someone who has repeatedly stood up for his deepest convictions. We need our vice president, Dan Quayle.Now it's true: a lot of liberal democrats are saying it's time for a change; and they're right; the only trouble is they're pointing to the wrong end of Pennsylvania Avenue. What we should change is a Democratic congress that wastes precious time on partisan matters of absolutely no relevance to the needs of the average American. So to all the entrenched interests along the Potomac -- the gavel-wielding chairmen, the bloated staffs, the taxers and takers and congressional rule makers, we have a simple slogan for november 1992: clean house!For you see, my fellow Republicans, we are the change! For 50 of the last 60 years the Democrats have controlled the Senate. And they've had the House of Representatives for 56 of the last 60 years.It's time to clean house. Clean out the privileges and perks. Clean out the arrogance and the big egos. Clean out the scandals, the corner-cutting and the foot-dragging.What kind of job do you think they've done during all those years they've been running the Congress?You know, I used to say to some of those Democrats who chair every committee in the House: ""You need to balance the government's checkbook the same way you balance your own."" Then I learned how they ran the House bank, and I realized that was exactly what they had been doing!Now, just imagine what they would do controlled the executive branch, too!This is the 21st presidential election in my lifetime, the 16th in which I will cast a ballot. Each of those elections had its shifting moods of the moment, its headlines of one day that were forgotten the next. There have been a few more twists and turns this year than in others, a little more shouting about who was up or down, in or out, as we went about selecting our candidates. But now we have arrived, as we always do, at the moment of truth -- the serious business of selecting a president.Now is the time for choosing.As it did 12 years ago, and as we have seen many times in history, our country now stands at a crossroads. There is widespread doubt about our public institutions and profound concern, not merely about the economy but about the overall direction of this great country.And as they did then, the American people are clamoring for change and sweeping reform. The question we had to ask 12 years ago is the question we ask today: What kind of change can we Republicans offer the American people?Some might believe that the things we have talked about tonight are irrelevant to the choice. These new isolationists claim that the American people don't care about how or why we prevailed in the great defining struggle of our age -- the victory of liberty over our adversaries. They insist that our triumph is yesterday's news, part of a past that holds no lessons for the future.Well nothing could be more tragic, after having come all this way on the journey of renewal we began 12 years ago, than if America herself forgot the lessons of individual liberty that she has taught to a grateful world.Emerson was right. We are the country of tomorrow. Our revolution did not end at Yorktown. More than two centuries later, America remains on a voyage of discovery, a land that has never become, but is always in the act of becoming.But just as we have led the crusade for democracy beyond our shores, we have a great task to do together in our own home. Now, I would appeal to you to invigorate democracy in your own neighborhoods.Whether we come from poverty or wealth; whether we are Afro-American or Irish-American; Christian or Jewish, from big cities or small towns, we are all equal in the eyes of God. But as Americans that is not enough we must be equal in the eyes of each other. We can no longer judge each other on the basis of what we are, but must, instead, start finding out who we are. In America, our origins matter less than our destinations and that is what democracy is all about.A decade after we summoned America to a new beginning, we are beginning still. Every day brings fresh challenges and opportunities to match. With each sunrise we are reminded that millions of our citizens have yet to share in the abundance of American prosperity. Many languish in neighborhoods riddled with drugs and bereft of hope. Still others hesitate to venture out on the streets for fear of criminal violence. Let us pledge ourselves to a new beginning for them.Let us apply our ingenuity and remarkable spirit to revolutionize education in America so that everyone among us will have the mental tools to build a better life. And while we do so, let's remember that the most profound education begins in the home.And let us harness the competitive energy that built America, into rebuilding our inner cities so that real jobs can be created for those who live there and real hope can rise out of despair.Let us strengthen our health care system so that Americans of all ages can be secure in their futures without the fear of financial ruin.And my friends, once and for all, let us get control of the federal deficit through a Balanced Budget Amendment and line item veto.And let us all renew our commitment. Renew our pledge to day by day, person by person, make our country and the world a better place to live. Then when the nations of the world turn to us and say, ""America, you are the model of freedom and prosperity."" We can turn to them and say, ""you ain't seen nothing, yet!""For me, tonight is the latest chapter in a story that began a quarter of a century ago, when the people of California entrusted me with the stewardship of their dreams.My fellow citizens -- those of you here in this hall and those of you at home -- I want you to know that I have always had the highest respect for you, for your common sense and intelligence and for your decency. I have always believed in you and in what you could accomplish for yourselves and for others.And whatever else history may say about me when I'm gone, I hope it will record that I appealed to your best hopes, not your worst fears, to your confidence rather than your doubts. My dream is that you will travel the road ahead with liberty's lamp guiding your steps and opportunity's arm steadying your way.My fondest hope for each one of you -- and especially for the young people here -- is that you will love your country, not for her power or wealth, but for her selflessness and her idealism. May each of you have the heart to conceive, the understanding to direct, and the hand to execute works that will make the world a little better for your having been here.May all of you as Americans never forget your heroic origins, never fail to seek divine guidance, and never lose your natural, God-given optimism.And finally, my fellow Americans, may every dawn be a great new beginning for America and every evening bring us closer to that shining city upon a hill.Before I go, I would like to ask the person who has made my life's journey so meaningful, someone I have been so proud of through the years, to join me. Nancy ...My fellow Americans, on behalf of both of us, goodbye, and God bless each and every one of you, and God bless this country we love."

False	['mike huckabee', ' not necessarily the news']	http://www.nakedauthors.com/	http://www.nakedauthors.com/2006/07/senior-year.html	2015/02/06	A cop, a Brit, a deb, a B-school grad, a guy with good hair, and a wisecracking lawyer wrestle with the naked truth about literature and life.Tuesday, July 18, 2006Senior YearBy CorneliaTomorrow I’m flying to New York for the second annual Backspace Writer’s Conference. I still have a lot of laundry to do, and packing, and thinking, and all the usual stuff that backed up over the last few days while I was at the Book Passage Mystery Writers Conference out here in Corte Madera, California. Plus, I am supposed to be cooking dinner right now.I remember the first day I attended the Book Passage Conference in 2002. It seemed as though there were over a thousand people there, all of them more knowledgeable about writing and publishing than I was. Everything was blurry and overwhelming, like the cafeteria on the first day of high school. I clutched the hand of my friend Charles King, from writing group in Berkeley.I took a seat in the store’s events room, notepad ready to write down pearls of wisdom during the introductory session. All the writers were sitting along a high window seat as Book Passage founder Elaine Petrocelli got up to get things rolling.I was in complete awe, and couldn’t imagine that I’d ever get to be one of those people on the other side of the podium, or even that I’d ever get up the nerve to talk to one any of them: Tony Broadbent, David Corbett, Claire Johnson, Ridley Pearson, Jan Burke, Camille Minichino, Laurie King, Rhys Bowen, Cara Black, Michael Connelly, Sheldon Siegel, George Pelecanos, Ayelet Waldman…Judy Greber (who writes as Gillian Roberts) and Marilyn Wallace had started this annual gathering of mystery authors, students, and publishing professionals some years earlier. I was in awe of them more than anyone. They were funny and kind and smart and welcoming to one and all.I had a “finished” manuscript, and had just started querying agents--hoping to get rejection letters that were personalized enough to let me know why they were turning me down, at best. I was generally terrified of everything, and pretty damn certain I’d never be published.That was four years ago, and I’ve attended this conference every summer since. I can honestly say it changed my life, and if you are interested in writing mysteries, you should try to go even if you have to hitchhike from Pascagoula.Last week I got to be on the faculty for the very first time, and I hope I’ll be invited back again. I still didn’t sit on the window seat, but took a place on the floor down at one end. It seemed fitting, since I still feel as much like a student as I do one of The Authors.This summer was my senior year, if you’ll bear with me for continuing the high school metaphor. I think it’s an apt one. I mean, remember what seniors looked like when you were fourteen? They had things like drivers’ licenses and facial hair and stuff. They were often tall. They all knew each other.Seniors looked, let’s face it, like GROWNUPS. And it’s only when you come back yourself for that final September at your alma mater, aged all of eighteen or so, that you realize maybe they didn’t actually FEEL like grownups, at least all the time.In real life, I am now old enough to know that most of my teachers in high school probably didn’t feel like grownups MOST of the time. And I also know that those people who were sitting up on the Book Passage window seat behind that dais in the summer of 2002 are actually people, and that just sitting amongst them doesn’t make you feel like An Author, all the time, because nobody does.You’d implode. It’s a law of nature.One thing I worried about at Book Passage this year, though, was that people might figure I now knew the Secret Handshake. I wish I did. I wish there were some incantation, some combination of newt eyes and baking powder and gum Arabic you bake at 375 for twenty minutes and voila, you’re published. And happy about it. Because I would like that for EVERYONE who came to the conference, and everyone who wants to get published. Hell, I’d like it for me and my second book.Here’s the thing: there is no Secret Handshake, and everybody’s nervous. God knows I still am.And maybe the best thing I heard over those four days this year was something Denise Mina said: we’re all terrified, and if you’re not terrified, you’re not writing as well as you could be. She didn’t mean you have to be leaning over to barf on your shoes every five minutes or so as you type, but that you have to honor your craft and your work--and the people you hope will read that work--with a sense of awe at the responsibility.I liked that, and I think what she said really is the Secret Handshake of writing. You have to take risks. You have to try harder than you ever thought you’d try at anything. You have to go back again and again to make it better. You have to take criticism gladly. And even if you do all of that, you can’t know how it will turn out.It’s scary. It should be scary.It’s also wonderful, and it should be that too.I got to hang out with amazing people for four days—writers and people who love writing, including Our Jacqueline. Old friends and new friends.It was nourishment for the soul, and I wanted to bring everyone home with me (except maybe for David Corbett when he read that limerick at the reception, but that’s another story). It was really like getting to be a senior in high school, in the very coolest way.It reminded me of the Kerouac quote on my high school yearbook page (Class of '81):The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn, like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars....But the main thing about getting to be a senior in high school is, if you’re lucky, that you get to be a freshman again at college the following fall.And it’s funny how all those seniors in college look like such GROWNUPS, you know? Especially Denise Mina.Posted by

I'll not give mine at this time. I'm just wanting to get a general feel of the public at large.Update: I am glad to see that many aren't fooled by the antics of PETA. It just galls me when I see movie stars and the like, giving millions to PETA. I wonder if they even know what PETA is about, or if they just know what P.E.T.A stands for but not what the organization stands for. More later.Update 2: For those that are for PETA, do you realize that they want to see your pets euthanized? That they want to see domestic cats extinct?!

Of course I don't anyway, I don't even bring a crate to the show, she is by my side 100% of the time.1 followingAre you sure you want to delete this answer?YesSorry, something has gone wrong.Trending NowRating Newest OldestBest Answer: I'm all about animal rights but PETA goes overboard. I don't believe that most people realize just how extreme PETA is about animal rights. They believe that an ant's life is no more valuable than a dog's life and I'm sorry but I strongly disagree. I also believe that we should use rodents for necessary medical testing to find cures for diseases such as cancer as long as it is in the most humane manner and the animal suffers as little as possible. I know that sounds horrible but I just think it's worth finding a cure for childhood cancer if it means experimenting on a mouse. I don't think we should test on other animals though which I know may not make sense to a lot of people. We all have our own opinions! I always tell animal rights activists that if their child was really dying of cancer and there was a drug out there that was developed by testing on animals that would cure him would they rather have the child die just to stick to their beliefs? I don't think so. I DO STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD FIND ALTERNATIVES TO ANIMAL RESEARCH SUCH AS HARVESTING HUMAN STEM CELLS AND USING MODERN TECHNOLOGY! I also won't buy make-up that has been tested on animals which PETA encourages. I also don't believe in fur coats which we all know PETA is strongly against! I think it's fine that PETA protests but when it comes to throwing red paint on people's furs that is crossing the line. ONCE AGAIN, I DO NOT BELEIVE THAT MOST PEOPLE KNOW WHAT PETA IS ALL ABOUT! They also believe that we should not keep animals as pets EVEN DOGS! That is what PETA truly believes although I know most people don't know that. They just think they are against animal testing and fur coats and not eating meat! I respect everyone's opinons although I may not agree with them. I think it's stupid that PETA doesn't think we should have cats and dogs as pets! I bet Pamela Anderson (their big celebrity supporter) has pets and they don't say anything about it! I also think a lot of people get into PETA 'cause they think it's cool and not so much because they truly believe in what PETA is all about. Sorry about going on and on. Animal rights is something I think about a lot so you got me going, lol! I do love animals though! Here's PETA's website so people can read more about them.http://www.peta.org/Don't get me wrong. Some of what they believe in and have helped stop (like using many animals in circuses) is wonderful. It's just that they are way too extreme for what I believe in. They are even against horseshows and used to love showing my horses and my horses enjoyed it as well!GOOD QUESTION! YOU GET A STAR!edit- I just read more of what you wrote and it sounds like you and I think a lot alike which is good!Source(s): ANIMAL LOVER

That government salary covered a period that began before her latest disclosure report, spanning from November 2008 through September 2010.Get Fast Forward in your inbox:Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email.Sign UpThank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters hereThose numbers were not required to be in her financial disclosure report but were provided by her campaign.Warren’s compensation puts her in the top echelon of American earners.A Democrat, Warren has pitched her campaign as a fight for the middle class, which she says has been left behind in the recession while the financial industry has been protected. Her salary and net worth have been a constant theme in Republican attacks against her.Brown’s campaign argued yesterday that her high salary makes her “an elitist hypocrite.’’AdvertisementWithin Warren’s $700,000 in teaching and consulting fees is a $43,938 payment she earned in 2010 as a consultant for Travelers Insurance company for cases involving asbestos victims.“She is firmly entrenched in the same ‘1 percent’ she rails against, and she is more than happy to make tens of thousands of dollars defending powerful insurance companies against middle-class victims,’’ said Jim Barnett, a spokesman for Brown.“Despite her claims, you don’t need to be a Harvard professor to know that insurance companies don’t hire bigtime lawyers because of their interest in protecting the little guy.’’ But Warren’s campaign said her work for Travelers was intended to make sure victims got a “fair shake’’ in compensation claims.Democrats argue that Warren’s high salary does not detract from her conviction that the system needs change to protect the middle class.“Elizabeth went from a maintenance man’s daughter to a Harvard law professor through hard work and determination,’’ said Kyle Sullivan, a Warren spokesman. “She’s made her life’s work understanding the pressures facing families like hers, standing up to the big banks and credit card companies.’’AdvertisementWarren has also railed at inequities in the tax laws that favor multinational corporations over average wage-earners.“A big company like GE pays nothing in taxes and we’re asking college students to take on even more debt to get an education,’’ she has said.Warren’s financial disclosure form shows she owns stock and other investments worth more than $3 million, including between $100,000 and $250,000 in IBM stock. IBM is listed along with GE and 10 other major US companies that relied on loopholes to pay significantly less than the standard corporate rate between 2008 and 2010, according to a report from Citizens for Tax Justice, a politically liberal group.The report said IBM effectively paid an estimated 3.8 percent in taxes over that period, legally avoiding the full 35 percent rate. The group contended that GE’s effective rate was negative 61.3 percent over that period.“Elizabeth has been clear and unequivocal that large corporations should pay their fair share of taxes - IBM included,’’ Sullivan said in an e-mail.Warren’s newest financial disclosure form was filed late last month, a requirement of seeking office. In a previous disclosure, she reported earning $349,375 at Harvard in 2009, in addition to about $182,000 in royalties and consulting fees.The newest disclosure data from Warren were first reported by the Associated Press.Brown was most recently required to file in the spring. It showed he earned a $700,000 advance for his memoir, “Against All Odds.’’ He earns $174,000 annually as a US senator.He will not be required to file again until May 15.Warren’s form also showed that her house in Cambridge, owned with her husband, Harvard professor Bruce Mann, is worth between $1 million and $5 million. She did not have to disclose Mann’s salary. He is also a tenured professor at Harvard.Brown and his wife, Gail Huff, have assets worth between about $1 million and $2.3 million - including their home in Wrentham and three Boston rental condos - according to the Associated Press, citing an analysis from the Center for Responsive Politics.Noah Bierman can be reached at nbierman@globe.comLoading comments...

Sometimes you just have to go MacGyver and solve common problems by using the resources you have on hand – combined with a little ingenuity, of course. I’ve always said that the ability to improvise is one of the most important survival skills.This article is a collection (not all my own I’ll admit) of a few, creative, makeshift lighting solutions you may have to deploy as a last resort if the grid goes down. You just never know when one of these innovative ideas might shed some light into your darkness one day.Shining SardinesSardines are an excellent survival food. They have a long shelf-life and are full of protein and fats. Maybe you have some sardines packed in your emergency food storage. If not, consider them.On a different note, oil lamps have been used for hundreds of years. From rendered whale blubber to modern kerosene lanterns, oil lamps are excellent “off-grid” lighting solutions. What do sardines and oil lamps have to do with each other? Quite a lot, actually, if your sardines are packed in olive oil.Once you’re done smashing those tasty bites of fish, place a natural fiber wick into the remaining oil and slightly over the edge of the sardine container. The wick, in this case a cotton string from a mop head, will absorb the oil. Once the wick is fully soaked, simply light the end. A sardine lamp with just a little bit of oil will burn for many hours. Sure, it’ll smell like fish, but that’s what you get for not including emergency candles in your “bug in” supplies. Running low on oil? No problem, just top it off with some more olive oil from the pantry – or any cooking oil for that matter.Cotton Fiber Mop HeadCotton Fiber Wick Soaking Up Olive OilSardine Olive Oil LampGlowing CrayolasGames and toys are excellent items to pack in an emergency kit – especially if you have small children. Simple toys such as crayons and coloring books can help keep their mind off of the misfortune that caused the lights to go out in the first place.But if you’ve focused only on toys and no essentials, like candles and flashlights, then you may have to sacrifice some of their least favorite crayon colors and make some Crayndles. I made that word up. Crayons are basically colored wax. If you’re in a hurry, just break the point off and light the paper label at the end of the crayon. As the wax melts, the paper becomes a wick and one crayndle will last about 30 minutes. Not too bad.You can also get a little more creative and sandwich a natural fiber wick (like a shred of t-shirt material) between three crayons that have been stripped of their labels. Bind everything together with two short pieces of wire. Paper clips work well. Then, simply light the wick. I got one of these to burn about an hour. Not too bad for a 10-second makeshift crayndle.Three crayons – No Paper – With Cotton Fiber WickCotton Fiber Wick in Middle of Three Paperless CrayonsThree Crayons – No Paper – Wired tight around cotton fiber wickBlazing BottlesIf you’ve listened to anything I said in “Build the Perfect Bug Out Bag,” then I know you at least have a headlamp packed in your 72-hour disaster kit.Yet as nice as headlamps are, they aren’t always the perfect lighting solution. Ever tried having dinner or playing cards across the table with someone who’s wearing a headlamp flashlight? It’s really annoying and gets really old, really fast. You get blinded every time they look at you.Instead, set a relaxing mood perfect for cards and a sardine dinner using a headlamp and a water-filled clear plastic milk jug (or any clear container filled with water). Invert the headlamp around the bottle so that the light shines toward the CENTER of the bottle. The water diffuses and diverts the light – making a nice, mellow, glowing lamp that will help set a perfect mood during any disaster “bug in.”Headlamp Bottle Lamp Beaconing BaconIf you’re like my mom, then you have a jar in the cupboard where you pour and keep excess bacon grease. This grease makes the perfect improvised survival candle. Jam in a natural fiber wick and light. It’ll burn as long as any comparable sized candle. See this post here about how to make a BACON GREASE CANDLE.No bacon grease? No problem. If the electricity is out, then the bacon in the fridge is going to go bad anyway, so you might as well use it for something. Tear off the fatty pieces and jam them in a jar around a natural fiber wick, and this will burn like a candle as well. The fatty bacon pieces will melt just like wax. Mmmmm, smells like bacon. TIP: Smear the wick with bacon fat first!Smashed Bacon Candle Kindling CriscoBut what if the electricity is off for more than 30 days straight and you need a light source that will shine for at least a month?No problem, Crisco’s got your back.Press a natural fiber wick (like a cotton t-shirt shred or a mop strand) using a forked stick to the bottom of a can of Crisco and you’ve got one of the longest burning emergency candles on the planet. Yum, doesn’t that make you hungry? Fried chicken anyone? We’re testing it right now but I’ve heard reports of these burning for more than 30 days straight!!!???Note: Smear the top of the wick with Crisco to get it to burn better.Forked Stick Positioned to Jam in Cotton Fiber WickRemoving Stick after Pushing in WickCotton Fiber Wick – Trimmed ConclusionWhat’s the lesson here? Make sure you have non-electric lighting solutions in place just in case the grid goes down. If your solutions are battery powered, you will also need extra batteries as well. Oil lamps, flashlights, candles and glow sticks are great emergency light sources. Don’t resort to smashing bacon fat into a jar with your bare hands unless you absolutely have to.Note: Candles have a bad reputation of causing house fires. Makeshift improvised candles are even more dangerous. Use only as a last resort, burn only on a noncombustible surface and keep close watch on any makeshift candle. A house fire can turn a “bug in” scenario into a “bug out” scenario really fast.Remember, it’s not IF but WHEN.Creek recommends these posts!

There were street demonstrations and flag-burnings in the Middle East. Libya joined Saudi Arabia in withdrawing its ambassador from Copenhagen. Islamic governments and organisations, including the Muslim Council of Britain, issued denunciations and a boycott of Danish goods took hold across the Muslim world. NI_MPU('middle');The Danish Government warned its citizens about travelling to Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Syria, and withdrew aid workers from the Gaza Strip. Last night EU foreign ministers issued a statement in support of Denmark, and the European Commission threatened to report any government backing the boycott to the World Trade Organisation. The fury echoed the outcry that followed the publication in 1988 of the Salman Rushdie novel The Satanic Verses. The trigger for the latest clash of cultures was the publication by the Danish newspaper Jyllends-Posten on September 30 of 12 cartoons of Muhammad. A biographer of the prophet had complained that no one would dare to illustrate his book, and the newspaper challenged cartoonists to draw pictures of the prophet in a self-declared battle for freedom of speech. One submission showed Muhammad wearing a bomb-shaped turban; in another he tells dead suicide bombers that he has run out of virgins with which to reward them. Any portrayal of Muhammad is blasphemous in Islam, lest it encourages idolatry. In October ambassadors from ten Muslim countries complained to Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the Danish Prime Minister, who refused to interfere with the presss freedom. But the issue began to boil this month after the cartoons appeared in Magazinet, a Christian newspaper in Norway, and on the website of the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet. Imams denounced Denmark from their pulpits, the Arab press inflamed pent-up Muslim anger at the West and last Friday the Saudi Government recalled its ambassador, but still Mr Rasmussen refused to apologise. He condemned attempts to demonise people because of religious beliefs, but argued: The Government can in no way influence the media. By yesterday governments across the Arab world were responding to public outrage. Libya closed its embassy in Denmark and the Egyptian parliament demanded that its Government follow suit. The Kuwaiti and Jordanian governments called for explanations from their Danish ambassadors. President Lahoud of Lebanon condemned the cartoons, saying his country cannot accept any insult to any religion. The Justice Minister of the United Arab Emirates said: This is cultural terrorism, not freedom of expression. In Gaza, gunmen briefly occupied the EU office in Gaza and warned Danes and Norwegians to stay away. Palestinians in the West Bank burnt Danish flags. The Islamic groups Hamas and Hezbollah and the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood demanded an apology. Supermarkets in Algeria, Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Qatar, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen all removed Danish produce from their shelves. Arla Foods, a Danish company with annual sales of about $430 million in the Middle East, said that the boycott was almost total and suspended production in Saudi Arabia. The Muslim Council of Britain, whose leaders are to meet the Danish ambassador tomorrow, deplored the newspapers refusal to apologise for printing sacrilegious cartoons vilifying the Prophet Muhammad. Bill Clinton, the former US President, added his voice, telling a conference in Qatar that he feared anti-Semitism would be replaced with anti-Islamic prejudice. He condemned these totally outrageous cartoons against Islam. Per Stig Moeller, Denmarks Foreign Minister, insisted in Brussels last night: We condemn blasphemy. We want respect for religions. But we cannot intervene. We have sent explanations but, as we have said before, freedom of expression is a matter for the courts, not for the Government. A spokesman for Peter Mandelson, the EU Trade Commissioner, said that if the Saudi Government had encouraged the boycott of Danish goods, Mr Mandelson would take the matter to the WTO. Carsten Juste, editor-in-chief of Jyllends-Posten, which has hired extra security after staff received death threats, said that the drawings were not in violation of Danish law but have offended many Muslims, which we would like to apologise for. He added that the drawings were sober and were not meant to be offensive to Muslims.

It holds a doctrine or theology ""built on esoteric truths of the ancient past"", which, ""concealed from the average man, provide insight into nature, the physical universe and the spiritual realm."" Rosicrucianism is symbolized by the Rosy (Rose) Cross which is also found in certain rituals beyond ""Craft"" or ""Blue Lodge"" Freemasonry .Between 1607 and 1616, two anonymous manifestos were published, first in Germany and later throughout Europe. These were Fama Fraternitatis RC (The Fame of the Brotherhood of RC) and Confessio Fraternitatis (The Confession of the Brotherhood of RC). The influence of these documents, presenting a ""most laudable Order"" of mystic-philosopher-doctors and promoting a ""Universal Reformation of Mankind"", gave rise to an enthusiasm called by its historian Dame Frances Yates the ""Rosicrucian Enlightenment"".Rosicrucianism was more closely associated with Protestantism than Roman Catholicism and in particular, was most closely associated with Lutheranism. According to historian David Stevenson, it was also influential to Freemasonry as it was emerging in Scotland. In later centuries, many esoteric societies have claimed to derive their doctrines, in whole or in part, from the original Rosicrucians.The Rosicrucian Order is viewed among earlier and many modern Rosicrucianists as an inner worlds Order, comprised of great ""Adepts."" When compared to human beings, the consciousness of these Adepts is like that of demi-gods. This ""College of Invisibles"" is regarded as the source permanently behind the development of the Rosicrucian movement.Several modern societies have been formed for the study of Rosicrucianism and allied subjects. However, many researchers on the history of Rosicrucianism argue that modern Rosicrucians are in no sense directly derived from the ""Brethren of the Rosy Cross"" of the 17th century. Instead, they are considered to be keen followers. Moreover, some have viewed the 17th century order as a literary hoax or prank, rather than an operative society. Others contend that history shows them to be the genesis of later operative and functional societies.OriginsAccording to a legend published in the 17th century Rosicrucian manifestos, the Rosicrucian Order was founded in 1407 (the early 15th century) by a German pilgrim named Christian Rosenkreuz (1378 - 1484), who studied in the Middle East under various occult masters. During his lifetime, the Order was alleged to be small, consisting of no more than eight members.When Rosenkreuz died in 1484, the Order disappeared, only to be ""reborn"" in the early 17th century. Most modern Rosicrucians accept this legend to varying degrees. Some accept it as literal truth, others see it as a parable, and yet others believe Rosenkreuz to be a pseudonym for a more famous historical figure, usually Francis Bacon.According to a lesser known legend found in Masonic literature, the Rosicrucian Order was created in year 46 when an Alexandrian Gnostic sage named Ormus and his six followers were converted by one of Jesus' disciples, Mark. From this conversion, Rosicrucianism was born by fusing early Christianity with Egyptian mysteries. By this account, rather than being its founder, Rosenkreuz would have been initiated into and become the Grand Master of an already existing Order.According to Emile Dantinne (1884-1969), the origins of the Rosicrucians may have an Islamic connection. As told in their first manifesto Fama Fraternitatis (1614) (early 17th century) Christian Rosenkreuz started his pilgrimage at the age of sixteen.This led him to Arabia, Egypt and Morocco, where he was put into contact with the sages of the East, who revealed to him the universal harmonic science. After learning Arabic philosophy in Jerusalem, he was led to Damcar.This place remains a mystery - it did not become Damascus, but it is somewhere not too far from Jerusalem. Then he went to Egypt, where he did not stay for long.Soon afterwards he embarked to Fes, a center of philosophical and occultist studies, such as the alchemy of Abu-Abdallah, Gabir ben Hayan, and Imam Jafar al Sadiq, the astrology and magic of Ali-ash-Shabramallishi, and the esoteric science of Abdarrahman ben Abdallah al Iskari.However, Dantinne states that Rosenkreuz may have found his secrets amongst the ""Brethren of Purity,"" a society of philosophers that had formed in Basra (Iraq) during the first half of the fourth century.Their doctrine had its source in the study of the ancient Greek philosophers, but it became more pronounced in a neo-Pythagorean direction.They adopted the Pythagorean tradition of envisioning objects and ideas in terms of their numeric aspects. Their theurgy taught the divine and angelic names, conjurations, the Kabbalah, exorcisms, and other related subjects.The ""Brethren of Purity"" and the Sufis were united in many points of doctrine. They both were mystical orders deriving from Koranic theology, where dogma is supplanted by faith in the ""Divine Reality."" Many similarities with the Rosicrucian way were expressed in the manifestos and the ""Brethen of Purity"" ways of life as well.Neither group wore special clothing, both practiced abstinence, they healed the sick, and they offered their teachings free of charge. Similarities also were evident in the doctrinal elements of their theurgy and the story of Creation in terms of emanationism.The curious legend in which the fabulous origin of the so-called society was established was so improbable, though ingenious, that the genesis of the Rosicrucians was generally overlooked or ignored in the writings of the time.Christian Rosenkreuz had discovered and learned the Secret Wisdom on a pilgrimage to the East in the 15th century. The metaphorical quality of these legends lends to the nebulous nature of the origins of Rosicrucianism. For example, the opening of Rosenkreuz's tomb is thought to be only a way of referring to the cycles in nature and to cosmic events.HistoryIt is on the foundation of these teachings that Rosenkreuz conceived the plan for simultaneous and universal religious, philosophic, scientific, political, and artistic reform. For the realization of this plan, he united with several disciples (seven at first, according to Fama Fraternitatis), to whom he gave the name of Rose-Croix.The founder of the Order of the Rose-Croix belonged, as affirmed by historians, to a noble family, but there is no document that allows us to affirm this peremptorily.However, it is certain that he was an orientalist and a great traveler.What was known in the early 17th century as the ""Fraternity of the Rose Cross"" seems to have been a number of isolated individuals who held certain views in common, which apparently was their only bond of union.These views were regarding hermetic knowledge, related to the higher nature of man, and also with common philosophical conceptions towards the foundation of a more perfected human society.There is no trace of a Fraternity or secret society which held meetings, or had officers or leaders. So far, as many works are concerned, it is evident that the writers who posed as Rosicrucians were moral and religious reformers, and utilized the technicalities of chemistry (alchemy), and the sciences generally, as media through which to publicize their opinions and beliefs.Their writings included a hint of mysticism or occultism, promoting inquiry and suggesting hidden meanings discernible or discoverable only by ""Adepts.""The publications of Fama Fraternitatis Rosae Crucis (1614), Confessio Fraternitatis (1615), and Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz (1616) caused immense excitement throughout Europe.These works declared the existence of a secret brotherhood of alchemists and sages who were interpreted as preparing to transform the arts, sciences, religion, political, and intellectual landscape of Europe while wars of politics and religion ravaged the continent.Not only did these works lead to many re-issues, but they were followed by numerous pamphlets, favourable and otherwise, whose authors generally knew little of the real aims of the original author and often amused themselves at the public's expense.According to historical records, it is probable that the first work was circulated in manuscript form about 1610, even though there was no mention of the order before that decade. In fact, research indicates that all three documents probably were the creation of Lutheran theologian Johann Valentin Andreae (1586-1654).However, his authorship only is confirmed for the Chymical Wedding, which he subsequently described as a Ludibrium. The authors of the Rosicrucian works generally favoured Lutheranism as opposed to Roman Catholicism.Around 1530, more than eighty years before the publication of the first manifesto, documented evidence of the cross and the rose already existed in Portugal in the Convent of the Order of Christ, home of the Knights Templar, which later was renamed Order of Christ.Three bocetes were, and still are, on the abboda of the initiations' room. In these cases, the rose can clearly be seen at the center of the cross.At the same time, a minor writing by Paracelsus called Prognosticatio Eximii Doctoris Paracelsi (1530) contained the image of a double cross over an open rose, along with a written reference to it. The occultist Stanislas de Guaita, ""Au seuil du Mystre"" (1886), used Paracelsus' writing, and other examples, to prove the ""Fraternity of the Rose Cross"" existed far earlier than 1614.It is evident that the first Rosicrucian manifesto, Fama Fraternitatis (1614), was influenced by the work of the respected hermetic philosopher Heinrich Khunrath, of Hamburg. He was author of the Amphitheatrum Sapientiae Aeternae (1609), and was in turn strongly influenced by the work of the mysterious philosopher and alchemist John Dee, author of the Monas Hieroglyphica (1564).The legend and ideas presented in the first two manifestos and in the ""Chymical Wedding"" originated a variety of controversial issues and works of Rosicrucianists inspiration.Among these, are the works of Michael Maier (1568-1622) of Germany, Robert Fludd (1574-1637) and Elias Ashmole (1617-1692) of England and many others, such as Teophilus Schweighardt, Gotthardus Arthusius, Julius Sperber, Henricus Madathanus, Gabriel Naud, Thomas Vaughan. Some later works with an impact on Rosicrucianism, were the Opus magocabalisticum et theosophicum by George von Welling (1719), of alchemical and paracelsian inspiration, and the Aureum Vellus oder Goldenes Vliess by Hermann Fictuld in 1749.Michael Maier (1568-1622), a philosopher, alchemist, practical chemist, and a doctor in medicine, was ennobled with the title Pfalzgraf (Count Palatine) by Rudolph II, Emperor and King of Hungary and King of Bohemia. He also was one of the most prominent apologists and defenders of the Rosicrucians, clearly transmitting details about the ""Brothers of the Rose Cross"" in his writings.Maier made the firm statement that the Brothers of R.C. actually exist to advance inspired arts and sciences, including Alchemy. The researchers of Maiers' writings point out that he never stated, in an objective way, that he had produced gold. Neither Heinrich Khunrath nor any of the other Rosicrucianists ever said as well.Their writings point toward a highly symbolic and spiritual Alchemy, more than an operative one. In both direct and veiled styles, these writings conveyed the nine stages of the involutive-evolutive transmutation of the threefold body of the human being, the threefold soul and the threefold spirit, among other esoteric knowledge related to the ""Path of Initiation"".Isaac Newton (1642-1727), one of the most important geniuses of mathematics, also possessed many famous and old treatises of Alchemy. He also made manuscript copies of alchemical works, found today at the Yale University's Library.One of these many works in his collection is the Themis Aurea by Michael Maier, to which he made references and comments about notes relating to hermetic philosophy.In the 1618 manifesto, Pia et Utilissima Admonitio de Fratribus Rosae Crucis, Henrichus Neuhusius, presented the conception that the Rosicrucians left to the East, due to the instability in Europe at the time of the Thirty Years' War, 1618-1648.In 1710 Samuel Ritcher, and later on Ren Gunon, 1886-1951, also presented this idea in some of their works. However, another eminent author on the Rosicrucians, Arthur Edward Waite (1857-1942), presents motifs which contradict this idea.It was in this fertile field of discourse, and filling the vacuum left by the original Rosicrucians, that many societies said to be ""Rosicrucianists"" arose. They were based on the occult tradition and inspired by the mystery of this ""College of Invisibles."" However, it is possible only a few of them may have something in common with the true Rosicrucian Order, other than the name.Influence on Freemasonry""18Ą Knight of the Rose Croix"" (Masonic's Scottish Rite)[18=9=Closure of Flower of Life in Time - The Masonic Program]According to Jean Pierre Bayard, two rites of Rosicrucian inspiration emerged from the end of 18th century. One was the Rectified Scottish Rite, which was widespread in Central Europe where there was a strong presence of the ""Golden and Rosy Cross"".The other was the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, practiced in France.During the 18th century, there were several rites practiced in Freemasonry based on the Renaissance universe of hermeticism and alchemy, which was created by the Rosicrucians of 17th century or earlier.Although many serious research attempts were made to learn about the change from the operative Masonry to the speculative Masonry, no concrete answer has yet been found, other than it occurred between the end of 16th century and the beginning of the 17th century.Two of the first speculative Masons were Sir Robert Moray (1600-1675) and Elias Ashmole (1617-1692), of a Masonic lodge meeting in Warrington, Lancashire.There is no documented evidence for Chistopher McIntosh's speculation that Robert Fludd (1574-1637) may have been a Mason. Neither is there any documented evidence to suport Arthur Edward Waite (1857-1942) speculating that Fludd may have introduced a Rosicrucian influence into Freemasonry.However Robert Vanloo states that earlier 17th century Rosicrucianism had a considerable influence on Anglo-Saxon Masonry.Hans Schick sees in the Rosicrucian works of Comenius (1592-1670) the ideal of the newly born English Masonry before the foundation of the Grand Lodge in 1717.Comenius was in England during 1641.A point of similarity between the two groups, in continental Europe, is found during the 18th century.The Masonic circle ""Gold und Rosenkreuzer"" (Golden and Rosy Cross), published the Geheime Figuren or ""The Secret Symbols of the 16th and 17th century Rosicrucians"" in 1785 and 1788.This circle, oriented by Hermann Fictuld from 1777 along Masonic lines, had important branches in Russia, which may have introduced Freemasonry and Martinism into that region.Rose CrossAlchemy and Divine Sciences of Healing and AstronomyThe alchemy in the laboratory (the ancestor of modern chemistry), where the ultimate goal was understanding of the laws of Nature in order to aid the individual's quest for perfection, recalls another type of alchemy, the one called spiritual. The true alchemists, or philosophers of the fire, often make reference in their works to the blowers, meaning all those who were just interested the creation of gold and the material aspects of alchemy.In his laboratory, the alchemist works on the materia prima and surrounds himself, among other tools to accomplish the operations, of a furnace with a peculiar form, called athanor.In the point of view of the Spiritual Alchemy, the materia prima is the human soul, and about the athanor, it is constituted by the physical body and the subtle bodies. These last ones maintain the life of the most dense one and assure the connection with the soul.The laboratory is the human existence during which the soul has the possibility of accomplishing the learning needed to perfect itself, operating the transmutation of the vices and defects of the vil metal into spiritual, that is, into related virtues and qualities.The first Rosicrucians practiced the operative alchemy, in vogue at that epoch, of interest even to the higher ranks of popes and kings.The Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz is a major written work which clearly makes reference, through its title, to this work on the matter, in the laboratory.Current-day Rosicrucians (like modern Freemasons, who do not construct cathedrals anymore) direct their concentration toward the work ofspiritual alchemy.According to the early Manifestoes, the Rosicrucians were a ""secret"" Order. Their members believed or could ""demonstrate"" healing powers that were believed to be a gift from God: Spiritual Healing.In other Orders these powers were explained by Egyptian mysteries and again, differently in the Hermetic Order. [ Hermes ]Members were admitted on this basis alone and the ""membership"" was very selective. The writers, philosophers and people of the time became curious and infuriated because they were denied entrance into these secret meetings. Most of the writings of the time are biased or speculative for this reason. Many modern Rosicrucian organizations hold the belief that these God given powers may be used to help others.Some interpretations are described as being Rosicrucian. They are used as an idea or icon by persons or groups either Gnostic Christian or simultaneously Christian and trans-Christian. An example would be a cult that centers around the Virgin Mary yet openly or secretly identifies her to the Virgo constellation of the Zodiac.A large majority of modern Rosicrucians believe in the study of Spiritual Astrology as a key to the Spirit, designed toward spiritual development and self-knowledge, as well as an aid to healing through Astro-Diagnosis.A way through which the alchemical work on the ""Path of Initiation"" has been expressed to the world, according to occultists as Corinne Heline (1882-1975), is through some of the great compositions of classical music. To wit, the nine symphonies of Beethoven (1770-1827) were divided into two groups.The first, the third, the fifth, and the seventh are vigorous, powerful and of command, representing the intellect. The second, the fourth, the sixth and the eighth are elegant, ternurent, gracious and beautiful, representing the heart (intuition).They culminate in the symphony with human voices, the ninth symphony, in which the equilibrium between mind and heart or the ""Chymical Wedding"" ritual, where the Christ Within Đ the Adept Đ is born (""consumatun est""). Johan Herde speaks of Beethoven as ""... God acts on earth through evolved men..."" and Beethoven speaks of himself as ""... I do not have friends, that is why I must live alone, but I know from the deepest of my heart, that God is closer to me than to others. I come close to Him without fear, because I have always known Him..."".Occultists also point out that many of the works of William Shakespeare (1564-1616), such as the music-dramas of Wagner, Goethe's Faust, Dante's Divine Comedy or Camoens's epic Lusiads, and a few other books of comparable rank, are designed for esoteric as well as exoteric reading. In Shakespeare's works, specific signatures, cryptically conveyed, also are presented.In Love's Labour's Lost a whole scene is devoted to revealing, in an ingenious way to those possessing the keys, the Rosicrucian connection. The scene closes with a remark addressed to Goodman Dull, a representative of the unperceiving multitude, that during the entire scene he has not spoken a word. ""No,"" comes his response, ""nor understood none neither.""The ManifestosIf one abstracts from the symbolic associations of the rose and the cross, which have been visioned by many since ancient epochs, it is known that three treatises or manifestos which gave rise to this movement were published in the German language between 1614 and 1616:1614: Fama Fraternitatis1615: Confessio Fraternitatis1616: Chymical Wedding of Christian RosenkreutzBetween 1614 and 1620, about 400 manuscripts and books were published which discussed the Rose-Croix documents.The peak of the so-called ""Rosicrucianism furor"" was reached when two mysterious posters appeared in the walls of Paris in 1622 within few days from each other.The first one started with the saying ""We, the Deputies of the Higher College of the Rose-Croix, do make our stay, visibly and invisibly, in this city (...)"" and the second one ended with the words ""The thoughts attached to the real desire of the seeker will lead us to him and him to us"".The following lines can be found in The Muses' Threnodie by H. Adamson (Perth, 1638): ""For what we do presage is riot in grosse, for we are brethren of the Rosie Crosse; We have the Mason Word and second sight, Things for to come we can foretell aright.""The Rosicrucians took the union of the rose and the cross for their symbol because this union embodies the meaning of their effort and emphasizes the fact that that effort must be made by all men, as the aim of humanity on earth is to attain divine wisdom.Only two ways lead to this divine wisdom: knowledge and love.By the rose blooming in the middle of the cross, the whole meaning of the universe is explained: in order to realize its possibilities and become perfect, mankind must develop the capacity for love to the point of loving all creatures and all forms perceptible to the senses; it must enlarge the capacity for knowledge and understanding to the point of comprehending the laws that govern the worlds, and of being able to proceed, through intuition and the loving intelligence of the heart, from every effect to every cause.Modern GroupsDuring the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, various groups styled themselves Rosicrucian. Almost all claimed to be authentic heirs to a historical Rosicrucian tradition. These include the Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis (AMORC), the Confraternity of the Rose Cross (CR+C), Fraternitas Rosae Crucis, the Rosicrucian Fellowship, the Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship, Societas Rosicruciana, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia, and others as well.Esoteric Christianity groups vs. Para-Masonic groupsThese diverse groups can be divided into two categories: the para-Masonic groups and the Esoteric Christianity groups. There has never been any connection between these two streams.Para-Masonic groups may be defined as being late heirs of the alchemy and hermetic knowledge created by the original 15th or 17th century ""College of Invisibles"". The inner structure of these groups is based upon Masonic lines, such as grades, initiations and titles.The Esoteric Christianity groups regard themselves as representing a ""rebirth"" in the New World of the inner worlds as described by the original Rosicrucian Order. Their mission is to prepare the whole world for a new phase in Religion during the next six centuries toward the Age of Aquarius."

False	['not necessarily the news']	http://boston.cbslocal.com/	http://boston.cbslocal.com/2013/04/19/report-boston-marathon-bombing-suspect-in-custody-second-at-large/	2015/01/21	BOSTON (CBS) – One Boston Marathon bombing suspect is dead and the other – his brother – was taken into custody in Watertown Friday night. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, was found hiding in a boat in the backyard of a home. The homeowner reported seeing blood on the wrap of the boat, and police quickly descended on the area. The suspect sustained unknown injuries during a gunfight with police early Friday morning. His brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, is the other suspect. He was killed by police overnight in Watertown. CBS News correspondent John Miller says Tamerlan threw a pressure cooker bomb at police before he was shot and killed. The men are originally from Russia in the region near Chechnya. SWAT teams searched dozens of Watertown homes Friday but did not find Tsarnaev. CBS News correspondent Bob Orr reported the brothers were believed to be living legally in the U.S., but they were not here as students. The network reported Friday afternoon that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev became an American citizen on Sept. 11, 2012. Orr said the FBI used State Department records to match the names to photos of the men at the marathon finish line Monday. On Friday morning, authorities asked everyone in Boston, Watertown, Newton, Waltham, Belmont and Cambridge to stay indoors while heavily armed officers searched for Tsarnaev. All MBTA public transportation was also shut down. Despite not having a suspect in custody, Governor Deval Patrick lifted the stay-in order shortly after 6p.m. Friday evening and MBTA service was restored. The bomber’s father, Anzor Tsarnaev spoke from his home in the Russian city of Makhachkala Friday afternoon. “My sons have been set up,” Anzor Tsarnaev said in Russian. “Dzhokhar is a second-year medical student in the U.S. He is such an intelligent boy,” he told the AP. The suspects’ uncle, Ruslan Tsarni of Montgomery Village, Maryland, told WBZ-TV the brothers came to America in 2000 or 2001 and have lived in Cambridge since then. Tsarni said he had not seen them since December 2005. Dzhokhar was a student at UMass-Dartmouth, which was evacuated Friday after the news broke. Two other students said they had seen him on campus after the bombings – once on Tuesday, and once on Wednesday. A friend of the brothers told WBZ-TV that both attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin Academy, where they wrestled and boxed in high school. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, known as suspect number one in the black hat in the FBI photos, was wounded in a pursuit. He was captured and rushed to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, where he died at 1:35 a.m. Doctors said he had gunshot wounds and a blast injury. The wounds were throughout the trunk of his body. Boston Police released a surveillance image of Dzhokhar around 4:20 a.m. Friday. He is the man with the white baseball hat in the FBI photos released Thursday in connection with the bombings probe. “We believe this to be a terrorist,” Boston Police commissioner Ed Davis told reporters. The chaotic turn of events in the investigation began late Thursday night. At 10:30 p.m. MIT campus police officer Sean Collier was found shot multiple times in his car in the area of Vassar and Main streets. He was rushed to Massachusetts General Hospital where he died. According to WBZ-TV Chief Correspondent Joe Shortsleeve, the brothers ambushed Collier, shot him five or six times and once in the head. Collier never drew his weapon. His gun was found in his holster. Five 9 mm shells were found at the scene. It is unclear what led up to the shooting. Police originally believed the brothers may have held up a convenience store in the area, but later stated that was not the case. Massachusetts State Police said the brothers did stop at a 7-11 to purchase gas. They spent the night in a Honda Civic (originally reported to be a CRV) and used it to carjack a Mercedes SUV in the area of Third Street in Cambridge. One of the brothers stayed with the carjacking victim for a few minutes and then let him go at a gas station on Memorial Drive. He was not injured. Police said one brother drove away in the Civic, and the other one drove away in the Mercedes. One then abandoned the Civic in Cambridge and joined up with his brother again in the Mercedes. According to Shortsleeve, MBTA transit police intercepted the Mercedes in Cambridge and followed it. A source told Shortsleeve the brothers lost control of the car and crashed it. A gunfight with police erupted and an MBTA police officer was shot and seriously wounded. Miller reported that Tamerlan Tsarnaev threw a bomb at police as he approached them and that’s when officers shot and killed him. This bomb is reported to be a pressure cooker bomb, the same that was used in the Boston Marathon attack. Miller says the lid of the pressure cooker came off before it exploded, so it was not as severe of a blast. State Police say numerous pieces of evidence is being recovered from several Watertown scenes including evidence of homemade explosives, including pipe bombs and the pressure cooker, as well as more than 200 spent rounds. Shortsleeve’s source said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev then jumped back in the Mercedes, drove over his brother’s body, threw bombs at police and crashed again. He ran off and that sparked the massive manhunt in Watertown. Sources indicated to Shortsleeve the theory is the brothers were robbing people in order to get cash to escape the area. It’s not clear why the brothers allegedly killed the MIT officer, but the theory is the brothers may have seen him on his cell phone and they thought he was calling them in. The FBI released new enhanced photos of the two Boston Marathon bombing suspects on its website around 2 a.m. Friday, as the chaotic series of events erupted overnight outside of the city. WBZ-TV released video of a man laid out on a street in Watertown overnight, with his arms spread out over his head on the ground as police surrounded him. The man was then apparently ordered to remove his clothes or had his clothes removed before he was handcuffed and put in the back of a police cruiser. There’s no official word yet on who this man is or why he was taken into custody. It was later revealed that the man is not believed to be involved in the incidents. All Boston hospitals have been placed in lockdown as a precaution. Several private schools and colleges have been closed for the day. Public schools in Massachusetts were already closed this week for April vacation. Amtrak service between Boston and New York has also been suspended.

Christians and Muslims alike broke into grateful tears. De Gaulle understands us! What more do we need?Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) has yet to attain that level of oracular ambiguity, but his bestseller The Audacity of Hope shows this wordsmith’s facility at eloquently restating the views of both his liberal supporters and his conservative opponents, leaving implicit the suggestion that all we require to resolve these wearying Washington disputes is to find a man who understands usa reasonable man, a man very much like, say, Obamaand turn power over to him. The politician has elicited such fervor among many white voters that Slate.com’s Timothy Noah runs a regular feature entitled “The Obama Messiah Watch” quoting “gratuitously adoring” articles. (Blacks have tended to be relatively more level-headed about him.)Early in his run for the U.S. Senate in 2004, Obama’s pollsters discovered that women loved him, especially nice white ladies who like personalities more than politics and definitely don’t like political arguments. Why can’t we all just get along?Obama has molded himself into the male Oprah Winfrey, the crown prince of niceness, bravely denouncing divisiveness, condemning controversy, eulogizing unity, and retelling his feel-good life story about how he, the child of a black scholar from Kenya and a white mother from Kansas, grew up to be editor of the Harvard Law Review.Gaullism worked out fairly well in France, and so might Obamaism in America. His opposition in 2002 to invading Iraq was sensible and forcibly stated. And Obama was a broadly respected Illinois state legislator from 1997-2005 because he searched out minor good government issues and forged bipartisan alliances with technocrats in the Republican ranks. But a president can’t pick and choose his issues with the exquisite selectivity Obama displayed as a backbencherespecially not with judicial nominees. So his record as chief executive would likely prove far more liberal.As we’ve seen with George W. Bush, however, pre-election platforms, such as Bush’s promise to pursue a “humble” foreign policy, matter less than the inner man. Obama is a particularly complicated personality, so he, and the country, deserve a more frank analysis than he has received thus far at the hands of a starstruck press.Beneath this bland Good Obama lies a more interesting character, one that I like far betterthe Bad Obama, a close student of other people’s weaknesses, a literary artist of considerable power in plumbing his deep reservoirs of self-pity and resentment, an unfunny Evelyn Waugh consumed by indignation toward his own mother’s people. He has been hiding out on the bestseller lists for the last two years in his enormously revealing, but little understood, 1995 “autobiography”a more accurate term might be “autobiographical novel”Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance.When Obama briefly surfaced in the media in 1990 as the first African-American editor of the Harvard Law Review, Random House handed him a book contract. Originally, he intended to write a disquisition on race relations, but the puerility of his theorizing discouraged him. He turned instead to writing about what he finds truly fascinating: his relatives and himself.Obama’s gift for restructuring the past into emotionally and aesthetically satisfying patterns made for an uneasy hybrid of fact and fiction, with composite characters, clearly made-up dialogue, and even preposterous dream sequences. Recently, the Los Angeles Times revealed that the tale of his one triumph during his four years as a young ethnic activist in Chicagogetting asbestos removed from a public housing projectexcluded all mention of the veteran local agitator, Hazel Johnson, who might deserve more of the credit.Nonetheless, Dreams is an impressive book. The abstract lessons he claims to draw from his life aren’t memorable, sapped as they are by the pervasive insincerity about race that America demands of its intellectuals, but Obama has a depressive’s fine eye for the disillusioning detail. His characters, real or synthetic, are vivid, and he has an accurate ear for how different kinds of people speak. The book’s chief weakness is that its main characterObama himselfis a bit of a drip, a humor-impaired Holden Caulfield whose preppie angst is fueled by racial regret. (Obama has a knack for irony, but of a strangely humorless flavor.)Why haven’t many grasped the book’s essence? First, Obama’s elegant, carefully wrought prose style makes Dreams a frustratingly slow read, which may explain why the book was remaindered in 1995, and why so few of the many who have purchased it following his famous keynote address at the 2004 Democratic convention appear to have read much of it.Second, the plot isn’t that interesting: his first three decades are too lacking in incident to make a page-turning story. Obama has led a fairly pleasant existence, with most of its suffering and conflict taking place within his own head as he tries to turn himself into an authentic angry black man.Third, there is the confusing contrast between the confident, suave master politician we see on television and the tormented narrator of Dreams, who is an updated Black Pride version of the old “tragic mulatto” stereotype found in “Show Boat” and “Imitation of Life.”Which Obama is real? Or is that a naïve question to ask of such a formidable identity artist? William Finnegan wrote in the New Yorker of Obama’s campaigning: “… it was possible to see him slipping subtly into the idiom of his interlocutorthe blushing, polysyllabic grad student, the hefty black church-pillar lady, the hip-hop autoshop guy.” Like Madonna or David Bowie, he has spent his life trying on different personalities, but while theirs are, in Camille Paglia’s phrase, sexual personae, his specialty is racial personae.Fourth, his is “a story of race and inheritance,” two closely linked topics upon which American elites have intellectually disarmed themselves. In an era when fashionable thinkers claim that race is just a social construct, Obama’s subtitle is subversive. Although his expensive educationprep school, an Ivy League bachelor’s degree, and then a Harvard professional diplomahas not equipped him with a conceptual vocabulary adequate for articulating the meaning behind his life’s story, the details deliver a message that white intellectuals have all but forgotten: the many-faceted importance of who your relatives are.A racial group is a large extended family, and Obama’s book is primarily about his rejection of his supportive white maternal extended family in favor of his unknown black paternal extended family.For the few willing to read all 442 pages, he offers important testimony about the enduring glamour of anti-white anger. It’s a bitter counterweight to the sunny hopes so widely invested in his candidacy as the man whose election as president would somehow help America finally “transcend race.”In reality, Obama provides a disturbing test of the best-case scenario of whether America can indeed move beyond race. He inherited his father’s penetrating intelligence; was raised mostly by his loving liberal white grandparents in multiracial, laid-back Hawaii, where America’s normal race rules never applied; and received a superb private school education. And yet, at least through age 33 when he wrote Dreams from My Father, he found solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against his mother’s race.Even his celebrated acceptance of Christianity in his mid-20s turns out to be an affirmation of African-American emotional separatism. As I was reading Dreams, I assumed that his ending would be adapted from the favorite book of his youth, The Autobiography of Malcolm X, which climaxes with Malcolm’s visit to Mecca and heartwarming conversion from the racism of the Black Muslims to the universalism of orthodox Islam. I expected that Obama would analogously forgive whites and ask forgiveness for his own racial antagonism as he accepts Jesus.Instead, Obama falls under the spell of a leftist black nationalist preacher, Jeremiah A. Wright, who preaches African-American unity through antipathy toward whites. Reverend Wright remains a major influence on the presidential candidate. (The title of Obama’s second book, The Audacity of Hope, is borrowed from one of Wright’s sermons.) Ben Wallace-Wells notes in Rolling Stone: “This is as openly radical a background as any significant American political figure has ever emerged from, as much Malcolm X as Martin Luther King Jr.”The happy ending to Dreams is that Obama’s hard-drinking half-brother Roy“Actually, now we call him Abongo, his Luo name, for two years ago he decided to reassert his African heritage”converts to teetotaling Islam.Although the biracial Obama is frequently lumped with the multiracial golfer Tiger Woods as evidence of the socially healing power of interracial marriage, their attitudes are quite different. Woods turned down Nike’s suggestion that because African-American celebrities are so popular today, he should identify himself solely as black. He didn’t want to disown his mother. Woods instead calls himself black and Thai, or, at times, “Caublinasian,” in tribute to his Caucasian, black, American Indian, and Asian ancestors.From the age of ten onward, though, Obama desperately wants to be black: “I was trying to raise myself to be a black man in America, and beyond the given of my appearance, no one around me seemed to know exactly what that meant.” Honolulu’s paucity of African-Americans means he has to learn to be black from the media: “TV, movies, the radio; those were places to start. Pop culture was color-coded, after all, an arcade of images from which you could cop a walk, a talk, a step, a style.”He cherishes every cause for complaint he can discern against white folks. He is constantly distressed at being half-white. Obama says he “ceased to advertise my mother’s race at the age of twelve or thirteen, when I began to suspect that by doing so I was ingratiating myself to whites,” even though he surely realizes that his media-sensation status stems from how much white people love highly accomplished blacks who speak with white accents. He wouldn’t be a serious candidate for president at age 45 if he weren’t part black.Obama’s teenage self-consciousness is perpetually crucified by contact with stereotypes about blacks. When his grandmother wants a ride to work because the day before, while awaiting the bus, she was threatened by a black panhandler, he is outragedat his grandparents. “And yet I knew that men who might easily have been my brothers could still inspire their rawest fears.” In high school, he gets upset when “a white girl mentioned in the middle of conversation how much she liked Stevie Wonder; or when a woman in the supermarket asked me if I played basketball; or when the school principal told me I was cool.”The great irony of the book is that so many of the stereotypes about African-Americans and Africans turn out, in his troubling experience, to be truewhich doesn’t make Obama happy at all: “I did like Stevie Wonder, I did love basketball, and I tried my best to be cool at all times. So why did such comments always set me on edge?” (When he moves to the South Side of Chicago, he eventually discovers that, like his grandmother, he’s sometimes scared of black males on the street, too.)Even the seemingly unique marriage of Obama’s parents turns out to be a stereotype, one that was eerily paralleled in John Updike’s 1978 novel about a hyper-intellectual African dictator, The Coup.The year before Obama’s birth in 1961, his Kansas-born mother Ann Dunham, an 18-year-old student at the University of Hawaii, may have wed fellow student Barack Hussein Obama Sr. Just like Updike’s narrator, Felix Ellellou, who bigamously marries a white Midwestern co-ed at their American college in 1959, the senior Obama already had a wife back home in an African village. Obama writes, “In fact, how and when the marriage occurred remains a bit murky, a bill of particulars that I’ve never had the courage to explore.”Upon graduation, his father was offered a generous scholarship by the New School for Social Research in New York City that would have paid for his family to come with him. Instead, wanting the most famous diploma, he chose Harvard’s scholarship offer, even though it provided only for him. And so he abandoned the little boy who would grow up idolizing him from afar.Just as Updike’s Ellellou returned from America to embark on a governmental career in Africa, where he added two more wives to his collection, Obama’s polygamous pop went back to Kenya. Obama Sr. took up again with his first wife, married another white American woman, and added a mistress, eventually siring approximately eight children by four women. (The precise number of his offspring remains uncertain as some of his potential heirs long litigated each other’s true paternity in probate court.)Obama’s mother married an Indonesian student, and when he was six, they moved to Jakarta. In his account, she was shocked to discover how her new husband reverted to chauvinist Indonesian ways as soon as he left America and that Indonesia was a nasty right-wing dictatorship (although the latter doesn’t jibe with her spending much of the rest of her life in that country). She divorced and sent 10-year-old Barack to live with her parents in Honolulu, while she and his half-sister stayed, off-and-on, in Indonesia.Despite Obama’s relentless efforts to mold himself into an African-American, his overwhelmingly white upbringing is apparent in his coolly analytical depiction of his mother, a portrait that most black men would find disrespectful. To Obama, his mother is a Kumbaya-era liberal. I suspect he feels that she messed up her life due to naïve faith in Third World countries and Third World men; but if she had been wiser, where would he be? This is one of life’s conundrums that’s hopeless but not serious, and yet Obama can’t help being serious about himself.Years later, when he’s working on Wall Street, he’s creeped out by his visiting mother’s insistence on seeing her favorite film, the 1959 Brazilian art-house classic “Black Orpheus.” He belatedly realizes that his very fair-skinned mother is sexually attracted to dark men. He pompously intones, “The emotions between the races could never be pure; even love was tarnished by the desire to find in the other some element that was missing in ourselves. Whether we sought out our demons or salvation, the other race would always remain just that: menacing, alien, and apart.”Wallace-Wells mentions in Rolling Stone:There is an amazingly candid moment in Obama’s autobiography when he writes of his childhood discomfort at the way his mother would sexualize African-American men. ‘More than once,’ he recalls, ‘my mother would point out: “Harry Belafonte is the best-looking man on the planet.”’ What the focus groups his advisers conducted revealed was that Obama’s political career now depends, in some measure, upon a tamer version of this same feeling, on the complicated dynamics of how white women respond to a charismatic black man.My late mom was also a big fan of Harry Belafonte and Sidney Poitier back in the 1960s. To her, they embodied an admirable combination of black masculine charm and white gentlemanliness. (In contrast, she thought Muhammad Ali, who is now the more popular representative of 1960s black manhood, an uncultured blowhard.) It sorely disappointed her when blacks burned down Watts in 1965. They were not following the fine example for their race set by Harry and Sidney. She would have liked Barack Obama, too, and for the same reasons.Nobody uses the term “example for his race” anymore. Today, we say “role model.” Even so, what many whites hope, deep down, to accomplish by electing the well-mannered Obama as president is to make him the supreme role model for all African Americans, eclipsing such deplorable bad examples as Al Sharpton, Snoop Dogg, and 50 Cent. Stuart Taylor Jr., a white critic of affirmative action, exulted in The Atlantic: “The ascent of Obama is the best hope for focusing the attention of black Americans on the opportunities that await them instead of on the oppression of their ancestors.”The message much of white America hopes to send to black America by electing Obama is: Don’t Be So Black. Act More Barack. Perhaps this explains why blacks haven’t been all that enthusiastic.But will the man from Honolulu, who has always worried whether blacks think him black enough, tirelessly demand that African-Americans reform their behavior? And would it make any difference if he did? Few now remember that Jesse Jackson devoted the 1970s to preaching moral self-improvement to blacks, with little evident impact, before moving on to the more lucrative business of denouncing whites in the 1980s.Back in Hawaii, Obama’s grandparents enrolled the fifth grader in the famous Punahou prep school (current tuition $14,725). With 3,750 students from K-12, it enrolls a high proportion of all the young elites in Hawaii. Illustrative of its financial resources, Sports Illustrated ranks it as having the fourth-best high-school sports program in America.In Obama’s book, Punahou was a nightmare of racial insensitivity, with one of his fellow students even asking to touch his hair. What he doesn’t reveal is that Punahou was quite possibly the most racially diverse prep school in America. It officially opened its doors to all races in 1851. Sun Yat-sen, the first president of China, attended it in the 1880s.In Obama’s eighth grade class picture, at least seven and perhaps as many as ten of the 21 students are non-white. Brian Charlton of the AP threw some cold water on Obama’s adolescent alienation fantasies: “He was known as Barry Obama, and with his dark complexion and mini-Afro, he was one of the few blacks at the privileged Hawaiian school overlooking the Pacific. Yet that hardly made him stand out. Diversity was the norm at the Punahou School, one of the state’s top private schools.” His classmates say he was a popular and cheerful figure, the opposite of the tortured personality described in Dreams, in which he rationalizes his teenage drug use as “something that could push questions of who I was out of my mind . . .”When Barack was in high school in the later 1970s, no whites held Hawaii’s top elected jobs as U.S. senator or governor. Indeed, as his father pointed out in a 1963 newspaper interview, whites were sometimes the victims of discrimination in Hawaii. Obama also fails to note the charming local custom of calling the last day of school “Kill Haole Day.”Like Obama, many Hawaiian residents are the products of mixed marriages: in 1956-57, interracial marriage rates ranged from 22.0 percent for professionals to 43.5 percent for farm workers. There’s not much of a one-drop-of-blood rule for defining racial membership in Hawaii that mandated that Obama call himself black and only black.Why was Obama so insistent upon rejecting the white race?Perhaps because we all (especially young men) want to belong to something we see as bigger and stronger than us, a winning team. And conquest, who rules whom, is the ultimate team sport.From adolescence onward, Obama wanted a race to belong to, a team whose accomplishments would reflect well upon him. Of course, it was unthinkable in his liberal white family to take pride in the achievements of his mother’s race, so Obama gloried in being part of his absent father’s race.Obama was accepted into posh Occidental College in Los Angeles, which then had a black mayor, Tom Bradley. But Oxy wasn’t black enough, so in search of a community to belong to, he transferred to Harlem … well, to be precise, to that prestigious university on the edge of Harlem, Columbia. (A recurrent theme in Obama’s career is Power to the People gestures and Ivy League results.)After graduation, he moved to Chicago in 1983, finally finding a home where at least some whites reciprocated his antagonism. He worked as an ethnic activist, helping the impoverished black community wring more money and services from the government. That government money was wrecking the morals of the housing-project residents seems obvious from his book, but Obama never comes out and says it. Numerous white moderates assume that a man of Obama’s superlative intelligence must be kidding when he espouses his cast-iron liberalism on race-related policies, but they don’t understand the emotional imperative of racial loyalty to him.Even his one triumph, mau-mauing lazy Chicago Housing Authority bureaucrats into removing asbestos from Altgeld Gardens, is tinged with irony. The timeservers at the CHA are all black, and asbestos would fall comically low on any list of problems plaguing inner city African-Americans.After four years there, the South Side is worse than ever, with youth violence ratcheting upwards. Obama applies to Harvard Law School (and eventually becomes a discrimination lawyer). Upon acceptance, he makes his first visit to Kenya, where Dreams from My Father finally achieves a frankness worthy of its artistry.Obama immediately appreciates the sweetness of African life in the bosom of his newfound family“For family seemed to be everywhere … all of them fussing and fretting over Obama’s long-lost son”but soon discovers its discontents, including how polygamy generates convoluted conflicts too intricate for even the longest-running soap opera. The rival families of his late fatherwho died in a drunken car crash a half decade beforeare still suing each other over his meager estate.He begins to notice that the intense family ties he’d longed for are not an unmixed blessing for Kenya since they corrupt its culture. Updike makes the same point when the dictator Ellellou visits the French colonial villa that his most traditional wife had seized and which was now populated by an entire village of his extended family from the Salu tribe:Nephews, daughters-in-law, totem brothers, sisters by second wives of half-uncles greeted Ellellou, and all in that ironical jubilant voice implying what a fine rich joke, he, a Salu, had imposed upon the alien tribes in becoming the chief of this nation imagined by the white men, and thereby potentially appropriating all its spoils to their family use. For there lay no doubt, in the faces of these his relatives … that nothing the world could offer Ellellou to drink, no nectar nor elixir, would compare with the love he had siphoned from their pool of common blood.Most authors who write about African-Americans’ social problems appear to know nothingand don’t seem to want to learn anythingabout Africans. Our pundits and academics assume that the social history of black Americans traces to that day in 1619 when the first slaves were herded on to that dock in Virginia, but no farther back. We could call it the Black Blank Slate theory.In refreshing contrast, in Obama’s account of race and inheritance, the continuities between Africa and African-America are clear. Kenya seems like an incipient Chicago housing project, preserved only by its inability to afford the welfare state that has ruined the inner city. His aunt’s Nairobi home is “just like the apartments in Altgeld, I realized. The same chain of mothers and daughters and children. … The same absence of men.”Unless they can bribe their way into a prestigious office job, most of Obama’s male relatives work as little as possible, relying on their womenfolk for food and shelter. And the women are looking for what the author’s grandfather and uncle Sayid both call a “big man” to ease their burdens with funds extracted from the government. Obama’s father, it turns out, had grabbed for the brass ring but wound up a failed Big Man, undone by President Jomo Kenyatta’s discrimination against his Luo tribe and by his own alcoholism. Even when impoverished, Obama Sr. pathetically kept playing the Big Man, dispensing gifts he couldn’t afford to his relatives and hangers-on.Now, Obama Jr. is running for the biggest job of all.On his trip to Kenya last year, he began by lecturing the frustrated audiences not to expect his prominence in Washington to change their lives“My time is not my own. Don’t expect me to come back here very often.” But in the slum of Kibera, the crowd’s adulation overcame his intellectual defenses and he began shouting joyously, “You are all my brothers and sisters!”In his head, Obama surely knows that his becoming the world’s biggest man would be bad for the work ethic of Kenyans, some of whom would assume America would support them. But in his heart, none of that matters.For Americans wondering about his fitness to be president, his latest Kenyan trip symbolizes the inner duality beneath his dapper exterior. He possesses one of the finest minds of any politician, but his personal passions routinely war against his acknowledging unwelcome truths, even to himself.Whether his head or heart would prove stronger in the White House remains unknown, perhaps even to Barack Obama. __________________________________________Steve Sailer is TAC’s film critic and VDARE.com’s Monday morning columnist.March 26, 2007 Issue

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bar-code-origin-point/	the first three digits of a bar code indicate a product's country of origin.	Mixture	['bar codes']	http://www.adams1.com/	http://www.adams1.com/upccode.html#countrycode	2014/11/26	"The Universal Product Code or UPC barcode was the first bar code symbology widely adopted. Its birth is usually set at April 3, 1973, when the grocery industry formally established UPC as the standard bar code symbology for product marking. Foreign interest in UPC led to the adoption of the EAN code format, similar to UPC, in December 1976. 2005 Sunrise and the Global Trade Item Number initiatives from the UCC will begin on January 1, 2005. This is the ""fourteen digit U.P.C."" that everyone is talking about. There are quite a few misconceptions and considerable misinformation about the effect of this change. In a nutshell, if you are a manufacturer of a product that has an existing 8 or 12-digit UPC barcode, don't worry. You do not have to change anything. However, if you are a retailer or wholesaler with scanners, you potentially are affected. You will need to ensure that scanners are able to decode 8, 12, 13 and 14-digit barcodes (most scanners sold for the last 5 years can do this) and that database systems can handle the extra digits. Gregg London was kind enough to share an excellent white paper on the subject. Once January 1, 2005 comes, both EAN and UPC labels should scan properly worldwide. There are now five versions of UPC and two versions of EAN. The Japanese Article Numbering (JAN) code has a single version identical to one of the EAN versions with the flag characters set to ``49''. UPC and EAN symbols are fixed in length, can only encode numbers, and are continuous symbologies using four element widths. UPC version A symbols have 10 digits plus two overhead digits while EAN symbols have 12 digits and one overhead digit. The first overhead digit of a UPC version A symbol is a number related to the type of product while an EAN symbol uses the first two characters to designate the country of the EAN International organization issuing the number. UPC is in fact a subset of the more general EAN code. Scanners equipped to read EAN symbols can read UPC symbols as well. However, UPC scanners will not necessarily read EAN symbols. The UPC symbology was designed to make it ideal for coding products. UPC can be printed on packages using a variety of printing processes. The format allows the symbol to be scanned with any package orientation. Omnidirectional scanning allows any package orientation provided the symbol faces the scanner. The UPC format can be scanned by hand-held wands and can be printed by equipment in the store. Version A of the symbology has a First Pass Read Rate of 99% using a fixed laser scanner and has a substitution error rate of less than 1 error in 10,000 scanned symbols. Nominal X dimension is 13 mils. A magnification factor of 0.8 to 2.0 is allowed and, as a result, makes a printable range of X dimension values of 10.4 to 24 mils. In other words, the nominal size of a UPC symbol is 1.469"" wide x 1.02"" high. The minimum recommended size is 80% of the nominal size or 1.175"" wide x .816"" high. The maximum recommended size is 200% of the nominal size or 2.938"" wide x 2.04"" high. Larger UPC's scan better. Smaller UPC's do not scan as well or not at all. The UPC format can be printed using a variety of printing techniques because it allows for different ink spreading. The amount of ink spreading depends on printing press conditions, amount and viscosity of ink and other factors which are difficult to precisely control. The UPC symbol is decoded by measuring the distance from leading edges to leading edge of bars, trailing edge to trailing edge of bars and leading edge to leading edge of characters. Since relative distances are measured for decoding, uniform ink spread will not affect the symbol's readability. However, excessive ink spread will make the spaces very small to the point that the reader will be unable to resolve them. Since UPC is a continuous code with exacting tolerances, it is more difficult to print on any equipment except printing presses. How Do I Get A List Of All The Product Codes And Their Respective Manufacturers? Do I Have To Pay To Use Barcodes For Internal Uses Like Inventory? UPC version A is the basic version of UPC and is usually the version seen on grocery store items. The symbology is used to encode the 10 digit Universal Product Code. An eleventh digit indicates the type of product, and a twelfth digit is a modulo check digit. The symbol is divided into two halves, each containing 5 digits. The two six-digit patterns are surrounded by left, center and right guard patterns. The left six digits use odd parity encodation while the right six digits use even parity encodation.. The first digit is the UPC number system digit related to the type of product (0 for groceries, 3 for drugs, etc.). The next 5 digits are the UPC manufacturer's code. The first five digits of the right half are the product code. The final digit is the check digit. Although UPC A is continuous, the left and right halves of the symbol can be independently decoded. A digit is coded as a sequence of two bars and two spaces within a space 7 modules wide. Bar and space widths may be 12, 3, or 4 modules wide. This results in 20 possible bar-space combinations. Ten of these patterns are used for the left odd parity digits and ten are used for the right even parity digits. The left digits always start with a space, while the right digits always start with a bar. A typical UPC Version A symbol has center guard bars in the center of the symbol which are longer than the other bars. This divides the symbol into a right and left half. This division allows the symbol to scan in any orientation. The moving beam laser bar code reader in grocery stores produces orthogonal scanning beams either in a cross, starburst, or figure-eight. At least one beam will then pass through each half of the symbol, since the symbol's height is at least equal to half of the length of the symbol. The height of the symbol should be at least half the length of the symbol. Sometimes the symbol's height is shortened to fit into the design of the package. This truncation of symbol height affects the ability to scan the symbol in any orientation, and will generally reduce the First Pass Read Rate. The Quiet Zone should be 9 modules on the left and right of the symbol. Version A may include either a 2 digit or a 5 digit supplemental encodation. These extra digits are primarily used on periodicals and books. More information about Version A is available here. UPC version E is the next most common version of UPC. It is a zero suppression version of UPC. It is intended to be used on packaging which would be otherwise too small to use one of the other versions. The code is smaller because it drops out zeros which would otherwise occur in a symbol. For example, the code 59300-00066 would be encoded as 593663. The last digit (3 in the example) indicates the type of compression. Guard bars precede and follow the data (no middle guard bars). The digits are coded following the parity pattern EVEN, EVEN, ODD, ODD, EVEN, ODD. The data is enclosed between two left-hand guard bars and three right-hand guard bars. The six digit number is always preceded by a 0 and followed by the check digit. The way the check digit is computed is by expanding the type E to a type A, then doing the regular check. More information about Version E along with a converter is available here. There is a good explanation of Zero Suppression at the Infinity Graphics site with a table that shows how a Version A number may be reduced to Version E if the Numbering System Character is ""0"". There are three other versions of UPC. These other versions are not in wide use. UPC version B is a special version originally developed to handle the National Drug Code and National Health Related Items Code. It allows for 11 digits plus one product type code. This version does not have any modulo check digit. UPC version C is a special code designed to promote industry-wide compatibility. The code is 12 digits long with a product type digit and a modulo check sum digit. UPC version D is a variable message length version of UPC. The symbol must contain at least 12 digits. The first digit is a product type code. This is followed by 10 information carrying digits. The twelfth digit is a modulo check sum, and this is followed by a variable number of digits. There is a good explanation of the UPC Shipping Container Symbol (SCS) at the Infinity Graphics site. The EAN Article Numbering System (EAN),the Japanese Article Numbering (JAN) System and the International Article Numbering System (IAN) are identical to UPC except for the number of digits. The Japanese Article Numbering (JAN) System (JAN) codes are the same as the EAN codes, with the flag characters set to ``49''. There are two principal EAN versions. Standard EAN (sometimes called EAN-13 or DUN-13) has 10 numeric characters, 2 or 3 ""flag"" characters which are usually a code for the country of the EAN International organization issuing the number , and a check digit. In all other respects, it is identical to UPC version A. JAN is the same as EAN-13. For compatibility with UPC, flags 00, 01, 03, 04, and 06 through 13 are assigned to the United States. Lots of people have requested the codes. Here is a partial list. Remember, it indicates the country that issued the code, NOT THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN OF THE PRODUCT. The abbreviation ""MO"" stands for Member Organization. The meaning of the prefixes """"020-029"", ""040-049"" and ""200-299"" are set by the GS1 administration in a given country. GS1-US has defined these prefixes as for internal use in, for example, warehouses. The authoritativelist is here. More information about EAN-13 is available here. EAN-8 has a left-hand guard pattern, four odd parity digits, a center guard pattern, four even parity digits, and a right-hand guard pattern. An EAN-8 bar code has two flag digits, five data digits, and one check digit. There is additional information about EAN-8 here. Information about Bookland EAN and ISBN numbering of books can be found at BarCode 1's Bookland EAN and ISBN Page. There is a good explanation of Bookland EAN bar code symbols used by the publishing industry at the Infinity Graphics site. There is also a very good explanation about Bookland EAN Add-On Code, used for storing the price of a book or magazine. Put the number you want to determine the check digit for in cell A1. The value that appears in cell C1 is the check digit. George J. Laurer is the developer of UPC in 1973 and EAN later. There is a history at his site. GS1-US (formally called Uniform Code Council) has a home page that provides a catalog of information they sell and an electronic version of their newsletter. There is also a step-by-step guide about how to join and get a manufacturer's code to produce barcodes here. GS1 (formarly called EAN International) is is the organization that manages the EAN system worldwide, currently there are national organizations in 92 countries on the 5 continents. (can be slow to access from North America). They also have a complete list of the addresses and phone numbers of the local EAN organizations by country. This list also has links to on-line sites of EAN organizations in some countries. There is much more very good information at the EAN site. The site is a must visit for information about EAN. There is another site which provides product descriptions. It's called the Internet UPC Database, an on-line database for Universal Product Codes (UPC). There is a new resource for searching EAN barcode numbers at www.ean-search.org. You can search for EAN codes or browse through the database of over 500.000 EANs. A very good explanation about UPC/EAN-128 Coupon Extended Code for cents-off coupons can be found at the Infinity Graphics site. There is also more information about coupon codes here and there is still more about coupon codes here."

False	['disease']	http://www.kccb.or.ke/	http://www.kccb.or.ke/home/news-2/press-statement-5/	2014/11/18	PRESS STATEMENTin News — October 7, 2014PRESS STATEMENT BY THE CATHOLIC HEALTH COMMISSION OF KENYA – KENYA CONFERENCE OF CATHOLIC BISHOPS ON THE NATIONAL TETANUS VACCINATION CAMPAIGN SCHEDULED FOR 13TH – 19TH OCTOBER 2014Health service delivery forms an integral part of evangelization for the Catholic Church. As such, the role played through the Church’s health Apostolate in Kenya cannot be understated.The Church has an extensive network of health facilities that include 58 hospitals, 83 health centers, 311 dispensaries and 17 medical training institutions. Our health facilities offer a wide range preventive and curative health services, including vaccination. The Catholic Church coordinates these services through the Catholic Health Commission of Kenya – Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops (KCCB).The Catholic Health Commission of Kenya, currently meeting at St Patrick’s Pastoral Center Kabula in Bungoma, with health facility managers from 24 Catholic Dioceses are deeply concerned about the following issues regarding the Tetanus vaccination campaign scheduled for of 13th – 19th October 2014:There has not been adequate stakeholder engagement for consultation both in the preparation for the campaign. The Catholic Church has not been engaged as members and participants of the Health Sector Coordinating Committee and in the respective Technical Working Group. This is despite previous promises by the Ministry of Health to be engaged as a key stakeholder.There has been limited public awareness unlike other related campaigns like Polio vaccination.There has been limited public information on the rationale with a background that has informed the initiative since we raised an issue in March 2014.We are still keen on having the Ministry of Health give Kenyans adequate responses to the following key pertinent questions:Is there a tetanus crisis in Kenya? If this is so, why has it not been declared?Why does the campaign target women of 14 – 49years?Why has the campaign left out young girls, boys and men even if they are all prone to tetanus?In the midst of so many life threatening diseases in Kenya, why has tetanus been prioritized?We are not convinced that the government has taken adequate responsibility to ensure that Tetanus Toxoid vaccine (TT) laced with Beta human chorionic gonadotropin (b-HCG) sub unit is not being used by the sponsoring development partners. This has previously been used by the same partners in Philippines, Nicaragua and Mexico to vaccinate women against future pregnancy. Beta HCG sub unit is a hormone necessary for pregnancy.When injected as a vaccine to a non-pregnant woman, this Beta HCG sub unit combined with tetanus toxoid develops antibodies against tetanus and HCG so that if a woman’s egg becomes fertilized, her own natural HCG will be destroyed rendering her permanently infertile. In this situation tetanus vaccination has been used as a birth control method.We retain that the tetanus vaccination campaign bears the hallmarks of the programmes that were carried out in Philippines, Mexico and Nicaragua. We would want to participate in ensuring that the vaccines to be administered are free of this hormone.The Catholic Church acknowledges that maternal and neonatal care is imperative in prevention of death; the Church therefore maintains that adequate and clear information is provided to the general public to avoid misinformation and propaganda in regard to the vaccine. The sanctity of Life and the dignity of the human person must always be priorities in health care and the Catholic Church, in the absence of proper and adequate information will not shy away from raising moral questions on matters affecting human life. Rt. Rev. Paul Kariuki NjiruChairman, Catholic Health Commission of Kenya – KCCB

The lawsuit was filed against the Charles County Public Schools, the Board of Education, and the Principal and Vice-Principal of La Plata High School located in La Plata, Maryland.The Woods’ daughter was forced to profess and to write out the Shahada in worksheets and quizzes. The Shahada is the Islamic Creed, “There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.” For non-Muslims, reciting the statement is sufficient to convert one to Islam. Moreover, the second part of the statement, “Muhammad is the messenger of Allah,” signifies the person has accepted Muhammad as their spiritual leader. The teenager was also required to memorize and recite the Five Pillars of Islam. Charles County Public Schools disparaged Christianity by teaching its 11th grade students, including the Woods’ daughter, that: “Most Muslims’ faith is stronger than the average Christian.”The Charles County Public Schools also taught the following:“Islam, at heart, is a peaceful”“To Muslims, Allah is the same God that is worshiped in Christianity and Judaism.”The Koran states, “Men are the managers of the affairs of women” and “Righteous women are therefore obedient.”Read the two exhibits containing Student worksheets here.The sugarcoated version of Islam taught at La Plata High School did not mention that the Koran explicitly instructs Muslims “to kill the unbelievers wherever you find them.” (Sura 9-5)When John Kevin Wood discovered the Islamic propaganda and indoctrination of his daughter, he was rightfully outraged. He immediately contacted the school to voice his objections and to obtain an alternative assignment for his daughter.The Woods, as Christians, believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God and our Savior, that Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins, and that following the teachings of Jesus Christ is the only path to eternal salvation. The Woods believe that it is a sin to profess commitment in word or writing to any god other than the Christian God. Thus, they object to their daughter being forced to deny the Christian God and to her high school promoting Islam over other religions. The school ultimately refused to allow the Woods’ daughter to opt-out of the assignments, forcing her to either violate her faith by pledging to Allah or receive zeros for the assignments. Together, John Kevin Wood, Melissa Wood, and their daughter chose to remain faithful to God and refused to complete the assignments, even though failing grades would harm her future admission to college and her opportunities to obtain college scholarships.Adding insult to injury, in an effort to silence all pro-Christian speech in her school, La Plata’s principal, without a hearing or any opportunity to refute the false allegations against him, issued a “No Trespass” notice against John Kevin Wood denying him any access to school grounds. Wood served 8 years in the Marine Corps. He was deployed in Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm and lost friends to Islamic extremists. A few years later, Wood responded as a firefighter to the 9-11 Islamic terrorist attack on the Pentagon. Wood witnessed firsthand the destruction created in the name of Allah and knows that Islam is not “a religion of peace.” The school prevented John Kevin Wood from defending his daughter’s Christian beliefs against Islamic indoctrination, even though as a Marine, he stood in harm’s way to defend our nation, and the Charles County Public Schools.Richard Thompson, President and Chief Counsel of the Thomas More Law Center, commented: “Defendants forced Wood’s daughter to disparage her Christian faith by reciting the Shahada, and acknowledging Mohammed as her spiritual leader. Her World History class spent one day on Christianity and two weeks immersed in Islam. Such discriminatory treatment of Christianity is an unconstitutional promotion of one religion over another.”Thompson added, “The course also taught false statements such as “Allah is the same God worshipped by Christians, and Islam as a “religion of peace. Parents must be ever vigilant to the Islamic indoctrination of their children under the guise of teaching history and multiculturalism. This is happening in public schools across the country. And they must take action to stop it.” The Woods’ lawsuit seeks a court declaration that Defendants violated their constitutional and statutory rights, a temporary and permanent injunction barring Defendants from endorsing Islam or favoring Islam over Christianity and other religions, and from enforcing the no trespassing order issued against John Kevin Wood.Read entire Federal Complaint here.Share this:

False	['freakish fatalities']	http://web.archive.org/	http://web.archive.org/web/20040624065333/http://www.legends.org.za/arthur/cleanfaq.htm	2014/06/16	"South Africa's most infamous urban legendFrequently Asked QuestionsLast updated November 19 1996 (author of legendary headline identified)1. Introduction""For several months, our nurses have been baffled to find a dead patient in the same bed every Friday morning"" a spokeswoman for the Pelonomi Hospital (Free State, South Africa) told reporters. ""There was no apparent cause for any of the deaths, and extensive checks on the air conditioning system, and a search for possible bacterial infection, failed to reveal any clues.""""However, further inquiries have now revealed the cause of these deaths. It seems that every Friday morning a cleaner would enter the ward, remove the plug that powered the patient's life support system, plug her floor polisher into the vacant socket, then go about her business. When she had finished her chores, she would plug the life support machine back in and leave, unaware that the patient was now dead. She could not, after all, hear the screams and eventual death rattle over the whirring of her polisher.""We are sorry, and have sent a strong letter to the cleaner in question. Further, the Free State Health and Welfare Department is arranging for an electrician to fit an extra socket, so there should be no repetition of this incident. The enquiry is now closed.""from (Cape Times, 6/13/96)BTW, the headline of the newspaper story was, ""Cleaner Polishes Off Patients.""This is the way the world was introduced, in July 1996, to the story of South Africa's most careless cleaner. There was little reason to disbelieve the tale, as it not only cited a credible source (the Cape Times) and a date of appearance, but also quoted officials confirming the tale quite categorically, even down to the wonderful detail of an electrician fitting an extra socket.Problem one: the story as it appeared throughout the world bore little resemblance to the original Cape Times story, and the original Cape Times story bore little resemblance to the story's first mention in print.Problem two: life support systems not only have battery backups, but include alarm systems to alert staff if anything goes wrong, as well as monitoring equipment that would reveal an interruption in the information flow.2. So what are you saying: this never happened?No; I'm saying that there is no evidence it ever happened. I'm also saying that it is an urban legend, believed by many people around the world, including newspaper editors, who are contributing to its further spread.3. But newspapers require evidence before they report such things, don't they?No; they require a credible source, which is not quite the same thing.4. So what was the source of this story?For most news media that carried it, the Cape Times report was regarded as sufficiently credible source, as it is a highly reputable and respected newspaper.5. But you say they didn't report the Cape Times version of the story. How was their version different from the one above?This is how the story ran on page 1 of the Cape Times on June 13 1996:Cleaner polishes off patientBy Lindiz van ZillaBLOEMFONTEIN: Health authorities are investigating a series of deaths of patients who all died mysteriously in the same hospital bed over a period of several weeks.Staff at the Pelonomi Hospital here were baffled when each Friday, they would come across another dead patient. Checks on the air-conditioning system and the position of the bed in relation to the windows failed to provide any clues about the deaths, which occurred two years ago.The ""killer disease"" was uncovered when staff came across a cleaner who had unknowingly unplugged the life-support system to plug in her floor polisher. Every Friday she would enter the ward, plus her polisher into the socket meant for the life-support system and calmly go about her business.Upon completing her chores she would reconnect the life-support system, leaving no trace as to the cause of the patient's death.Despite reports of several deaths in this way, only one is being investigated by the Free State Health and Welfare Department.A hospital spokesperson said he did not know about the incident.6. That sounds vaguely conclusive. But it doesn't quite hang together, does it?That's partly because of space constraints that force most South African newspapers to compress stories that they do not consider of vital importance. In this case, one key sentence was left out of the original report. It went like this:Yesterday, a department [of Health and Welfare] spokesman, Mr Victor Litlhakanyane, said: ""Hospital staff haven't yet confirmed the incident, and we are still investigating it.""Combined with a hospital spokesperson not knowing of the incident, it would have set alarm bells ringing. With that little detail, it becomes clear that the rest of the story, at that stage, remained in the realm of rumour, speculation and hearsay.7. Whoa! That's a pretty detailed story for mere speculation. On the other hand, it's still frustratingly vague. Could it be that the Cape Times picked it up from another source, and then merely made a few phone calls to confirm that it hadn't been made up by a rival source?It could be, and it is the way it happened. The Cape Times' deputy news editor, Sybrand Mostert, spotted the story in Cape Town's Afrikaans-language daily newspaper, Die Burger (literally, ""The Citizen""). The story went like this (as found in Die Burger's online archive ):Page 811 June 1996Pasient sterf glo na werker masjien uitpropBLOEMFONTEIN. Familie van 'n pasient wat in een van die waaksale van die Pelonomi Hospitaal hier gesterf het nadat 'n skoonmaker glo die masjiene wat die pasient aan die lewe moes hou, uitgeprop het, word versoek om na vore te kom. Die skoonmaker het glo die kragprop van haar vloerpoleerder by die muursok ingeprop.Dr. Craig Househam, Vrystaatse adjunk-direkteur-generaal van Gesondheid en Welsyn, het gese hy weet van die voorval van meer as 2 jaar gelede. Hy kon nie se of tugstappe teen die werker gedoen en of die familie van die pasient in die beweerde voorval vergoeding ontvang het nie.Aanvanklike gerugte het gelui meer as een pasient is binne 'n paar agtereenvolgende weke elke Vrydag in dieselfde bed oorlede. Toe personeel begin onraad vermoed, het hulle op die werker afgekom wat Vrydae haar vloerpoleerder inprop by die muursok wat vir die lewensnoodsaaklike masjiene bedoel is.Translation:Patient believed to have died after worker unplugged machineBloemfontein: Family of a patient who died in one of the intensive care wards of the Pelonomi Hospital after a cleaner is understood to have unplugged the life support machine, have been requested to come forward. The cleaner presumably plugged her floor polisher into the wall power socket.Dr Craig Househam, the Free State's deputy director general of Health and Welfare, said he had known about the incident for the past two years. He could not say whether disciplinary steps had been taken against the cleaner or whether the family of the patient in the alleged incident had received any compensation.Initial rumours suggested that more than one patient had died in the same bed every Friday for consecutive weeks. When staff began suspecting something amiss, they discovered the worker who, every Friday, plugged her floor polisher into the wall socket intended for the life support machine.Keep an eye on two key phrase there: aanvankilike gerugte"" and ""beweerde voorval"", which I've translated as ""initial rumours"" and ""alleged incident"".It was assumed at the Cape Times that Die Burger had picked up the story from its sister newspaper in Bloemfontein, Die Volksblad, the only daily newspaper serving the whole Free State province. According to Judith Soal, one of the most Internet-savvy sub-editors (that's the South African equivalent of a copy editor) at the Cape Times, Mostert ""found it interesting, wasn't sure whether or not to believe it, decided to put a reporter on it"".8. So what did the reporter find? Did he speak to Die Volksblad? And did he believe the story?""I never got around to speaking to anyone at the Volksblad,"" Lindiz van Zilla advised me by e-mail. ""I did however phone Pelonomi Hospital and spoke to a medical superintendent on duty who informed me of the ongoing investigation. The hospital did not indicate any knowledge of unusual deaths, but said they too had become aware of rumours - they were basing their investigation on these rumours... I personally don't believe the story - a 'genuine' urban legend.""9. The Cape Times couldn't have been too charmed. Did they then just decide to run with the story and forget about the facts?A part-time sub-editor, who does not want to be named, edited the story. He wasn't sure whether to believe it or not, but was told that it had been discussed and the decision had been made to use it.Judith takes up the story, although she wasn't on duty that night:""I think what made them decide to run it was that the hospital had said it was investigating, giving some credibility to the story... The story was much discussed, and it was decided to run it as a lightish thing, not shock horror, because it couldn't be verified... we gave it a fair amount of prominence because of the newsworthiness of the fact that such a story had got so far, and the bizzareness of it all. The original headline was quite straight - along the lines of 'xx die in hospital', and the revise sub [the senior copy editor who makes final revisions of sub-editors' work] changed it.The revise sub, Don Mallett, takes up the story:""Actually I didn't sub or revise the story. However, I did hear my colleagues discussing it and I read it. When I heard someone sing out a headline about it later, I suggested the headline that eventually appeared. Someone else suggested something about ""patients being unplugged"" and the night editor asked the subs' room which we should use and they went for mine.""I realised fully that the headline was insensitive and in poor taste, but felt this would be considerably cushioned by the facts that the story was a couple of years old, no patients or families were identified, and anyone affected would be far from the Cape Times area of circulation.""Judith continues: ""The weird thing is that Pam, another sub here, was sent an e-mail weeks later, with a much-changed version of the story, but the original Cape Times headline.""10. Did Pam get the version I think she did?Yep, word for word as recorded at the beginning of this document. Pam Sykes sent me a copy of the e-mail, which she had received at the beginning of August, from a contact in Montana, USA. By that time, obviously, it was already feverishly circulating on the Internet. At the time of writing this FAQ, the version circulating on the Internet remains word-for-word identical to the first modified version Pam received.11. Okay, so that's how the Cape Times got the blame. Or is it? How did the story change so dramatically?That is the first structural evidence that it is an urban legend. The attribution of spurious quotes to unnamed authorities, the radical transformation of the story in its re-telling, and then the rapid spread of the story as a result of its shock appeal, are all classic hallmarks of urban legend proliferation. It is impossible to trace the moment of transformation unless the individual responsible for the rewriting confesses.12. How could other media fall for the rewritten story? It even looks made up, aside from the Cape Times reference.That reference was crucial. It was responsible for the next step up the ladder of credibility, when it came to the attention of John Hoyland, editor of the lighthearted Feedback column in the respected British popular science magazine New Scientist . He checked with the Cape Times, first speaking to an archivist, and ""she was very emphatic the story was true"". So he ran the story in Feedback - except that it was the Internet-modified version of the tale. For the sake of completeness, this is how it looked when it left his computer:SOME readers may already have seen this story, which appeared originally in South Africa's Cape Times this summer, and is apparently true. We are passing it on for the unenlightened so that they may reflect on the fickleness of the hand of fate that shapes our destinies.""For several months, our nurses have been baffled to find a dead patient in the same bed every Friday morning,"" a spokeswoman for the Pelonomi Hospital (Free State, South Africa) told reporters. ""There was no apparent cause for any of the deaths, and extensive checks on the air conditioning system, and a search for possible bacterial infection, failed to reveal any clues.""However, further inquiries have now revealed the cause of these deaths. It seems that every Friday morning, a cleaner would enter the ward, remove the plug that powered the patient's life support system, plug her floor polisher into the vacant socket, then go about her business. When she had finished her chores, she would plug the life support machine back in and leave, unaware that the patient was now dead. She could not, after all, hear the screams and eventual death rattle over the whirring of her polisher.""We are sorry, and have sent a strong letter to the cleaner in question. Further, the Free State Health and Welfare Department is arranging for an electrician to fit an extra socket, so there should be no repetition of this incident.""The inquiry is now closed.""Says John: ""Apart from the intro, it's word for word what we got off the Net. The reason for saying 'some readers may have already seen this story' is that the story was apparently run earlier in Private Eye magazine, though I never saw it.""Since then, he says, a colleague had talked to the Cape Times again and, once more, they had ""confirmed"" the story - but this time faxed their original article to New Scientist. And lo and behold, it was a rather different story, at least in terms of attributions and confirmations.""I don't mind admitting that I've been had,"" says John, who cooperated warmly in the construction of this FAQ.12. But he didn't start it, did he? You mentioned Die Volksblad - what does that mean, for starters? And did they run the story first? And has anyone confessed to being the original perpetrator?No, the People's Paper, yes, and yes. One of the people of the people's paper is an investigative journalist who was then their medical correspondent, Andreij Horn. On 11 June 1996, his name appeared under the headline:Inligting gesoek oor gerug dat pasient dood is weens skoonmaker se optredeTranslation:Information sought regarding rumour that patient died due to cleaner's actionsNow that doesn't have quite the same ring as ""Cleaner polishes off patients"", but then Die Volksblad had good reason to play this one low key. The story ran like this (original Afrikaans version is available - note that the simultaneous version from Die Burger was obviously lifted from here, and note too the subtle differences between the opening paragraphs, that gave the version from Die Burger an edge of added credibility and removed the powerful shadow of doubt that hangs over the original version):Family of a patient who died in one of the intensive care wards of the Pelonomi Hospital after a cleaner is understood to have unplugged the life support machine, have been requested to come forward. The cleaner allegedly plugged her floor polisher into the wall power socket.Dr Craig Househam, the Free State's deputy director general of Health and Welfare, had earlier told Die Volksblad he knew about the incident, but that it had happened two-and-a-half years ago, and that Die Volksblad had already reported it.He could not say whether disciplinary steps had been taken against the cleaner or whether the family of the patient in the alleged incident had received any compensation. He first wanted to consult the records, since it had happened under the previous management.Die Volksblad could find no reference to the alleged incident in its own records.This follows repeated tip-offs from various sources over the past month that such an incident had in fact taken place at Pelonomi, and had been hushed up. Initial rumours suggested that more than one patient died in the same bed every Friday in consecutive weeks. When staff began suspecting something amiss, they discovered the worker who, every Friday, plugged her floor polisher into the wall socket intended for the life support machine.Yesterday the Department said that no record of such an incident could be traced. Ms Elke Grobler, public relations officer of the department, said the department knew that such rumours were doing the rounds.""The department requests the family of the patient that allegedly died, or anyone who knew something about this, to come forward, so that the allegations can be properly investigated.""Anyone with information can phone the department on (051) 405-4818.The word ""allegedly"" in the second sentence is translated from the Afrikaans phrase ""na bewering"", which Die Volksblad used in its report. Die Burger changed the word to ""glo"", which is a far softer word for ""allegedly"" and is closer to ""believed to have"" or ""presumed to have"", which removes the slight edge of incredulity that ""allegedly"" imparts to the story. In the eyes of health authorities, however, the story is identical, and they would have had no reason to reject the subsequent interpretation by Die Burger when approached by the Cape Times.13. There's a real, live phone number in there somewhere. Did anyone then phone the Department with more information?No.14. You don't think I'm just going to leave it at that, do you? What about the reporter who started the whole thing?Andreij Horn? Definitely the hero in this epic drama. Not least because he was willing and ready to expand on his role. Had the Department of Health and Welfare not made a specific appeal to the public, he says, he would have dropped the story. It was obvious, he says, that it was an urban legend. Had anyone bothered to ask him, it would never have reached the stage where the world demanded a FAQ. He is extremely happy to recount his role, however, and is most polite about the whole fuss. In a telephonic interview from Bloemfontein on November 12 1996, he said (translated from Afrikaans):""When I first came across these rumours, I thought to myself this looks exactly like an urban legend. I approached the report from the point of view that it was an urban legend, but then the department said that, while they had no information about the incident, they wanted to hear from people who did. Nothing came of their appeal, but that was the angle that resulted in it becoming a worldwide urban legend.""In investigating the story, I went to the top - the Department of Health and Welfare. I did not contact the hospital, because that is not the way the channels work here. The hospital is required to report any unusual incidents. If someone died under such circumstances, a judicial hearing would have to be held.""Even if there had been a conspiracy to hush it up, it is such a sensational story that it could never in a million years be kept quiet. I have no doubt in my mind that, if the department has no record of an investigation into possible malpractice, it is an urban legend.""To tell the truth, it was the department's commitment to transparency [an open approach] that gave momentum to the urban legend. They could have dismissed it as a fairy tale, but were prepared to allow the public to assist with the investigation. Had they not done that, my report would never have appeared. The fact that they took it semi-seriously gave momentum to the spread of the urban legend.""Horn then kindly faxed through a copy of the original story.15. But where did he get the story? How long had it been around before he wrote about it? Where did the whole thing start?Sheesh. It's expensive phoning Bloemfontein all the time with your suspicions. Okay then, this was from a follow-up interview on November 13 1996:""We had been receiving calls for quite some time, I'd say two to three months, from people who asked us why we didn't write about this incident that they had heard happened at Pelonomi Hospital. When it reached my news editor for the second or third time, he said it might be worthwhile investigating the matter. Dr Househam was a classic example of how the story developed in people's heads: he had it in the back of his mind that it had happened more than two years ago, but during the previous administration, so he had no personal knowledge about it, and he thought he had read about it in Die Volksblad.""You have to understand here that Die Volksblad is the most important news and information source in the Free State, and when people think they knew about something because they read it in the newspaper - the way people often retell urban legends - then in the Free State they assume they read it in Die Volksblad.""We went to great lengths to try to track down a report of such an incident in our newspaper. All our stories are pasted on pages, which we went through carefully, and we have a card reference system that includes every story that has appeared in the paper since 1954. If it wasn't in that system, then it definitely had not appeared in our newspaper.""I would estimate that I heard my first version of the story about three months before I wrote the report. I should have reacted sooner, but it was such an unlikely story to me, that I had no faith in the rumour whatsoever. Every version was precisely the same, except for the number of patients that had died. Sometimes it was just one, in other versions people said it had carried on for weeks, and in others up to 14 people had died. The more the bodies, the more indignant people were about how many people had to die before the authorities realised there was a problem.""I cannot imagine such a thing happening in a South African hospital - that people can die in such a fixed pattern without the authorities investigating - no matter how cynical we become about the possible lowering of standards. It simply does not make sense. And I must add that the fact that the Free State health authorities were so willing to respond instantly was an indication to me of how seriously they take their responsibilities and their image. They are extremely conscientious.""16. Okay, I buy it. We're talking urban legend. But does it behave like other urban legends? Are there variations on this theme? Aside from the different versions of the Pelonomi tale? Are their regional variations, for instance?Sure there are.During August 1996 it took on another necessary characteristics of an urban legend (no, they didn't lynch the cleaning lady). Firstly, the story was told by a caller to the Johannesburg-based radio station 702 as having happened at Baragwanath Hospital (listed in the 1997 Guinness Book of Records as the largest hospital in the world) near Soweto. Ironically and tragically, life imitated UL a few weeks later when two babies died at Baragwanath after a power failure during which the emergency generators also failed due to running out of fuel - but this was the subject of a high-level investigation, officially confirmed, and is not an urban legend.Secondly, in subsequent weeks I heard the story told as word-of-mouth, but having happened at the Johannesburg Hospital. It seems, however, that the Pelonomi version then took a firm grip on the public consciousness - partly thanks to the Internet - and all subsequent versions reverted to the original tale from Bloemfontein.17. So it's an authentic, indigenous South African urban legend?I didn't say that. It is likely that it has been around for decades. Take, for instance, this posting from Christopher Becke to the alt.folklore.urban newsgroup on November 11 1996:On HBO on Sunday morning was a movie starring George Wendt (of Cheers Fame) in some sort of Teacher role. The movie was called Plain Clothes (1988). In it, one of the characters is telling the other about the untimely demise of the husband (or was it the father) of another character. Apparently, the gentleman was hooked up in an iron lung, and the cleaning woman knocked out the plug with the vacuum cleaner. Although it wasn't a case of unplugging the one to plug in the other, I thought it may have provided a source for the now famous UL.18. Ha! We've found the true origin! Haven't we?Afraid not. I've been told that the story was circulating in Wales in the early 1980s. It is also used as an example in debates among Jewish religious scholars about the acceptability of taking people off life support and allowing them to die naturally. The broadly accepted view is that, while one is not obliged to place someone on life support and can allow them to die naturally if there is little hope of saving them, the picture changes once someone is actually on life support.According to the argument, it is unacceptable for any human being to cut off the life support machine - intentionally - regardless of how hopeless the situation may be, since a decision to end a life may only be taken by God. However, and this is exactly as it was put to me by one scholar, should ""a cleaner accidentally unplug the machine to plug in a cleaning machine, you are not obliged to switch the machine back on again"". Of course, this is a completely theoretical argument, as many of these theological arguments are, and the example is used merely to advance a hypothesis.It is even possible that such hypothetical debates may have sparked the legend, but I have no evidence for that, either.19. So that's where you're going to leave it?Of course not. Anyone with variations on any of the above stories is urged to contact me by e-mail on arthurg@is.co.za , with any material or interpretations that may be added to future versions of this FAQ.20. What do they get out of it?Fame, immortality, half-price entry to my free web site, and a mention in the credits.

A copy of the report is attached. The IRS report, Reducing the Federal Tax Gap: A Report on Improving Voluntary Compliance, details steps currently being taken by the IRS, as well as those under development, to address key elements of the “tax gap.” The report builds on the seven components of the Comprehensive Strategy for Reducing the Tax Gap, which the Treasury Department released in September 2006. Those components are:Reducing Opportunities for EvasionMaking a Multi-Year Commitment to ResearchContinuing Improvements in Information TechnologyImproving Compliance ActivitiesEnhancing Taxpayer ServiceReforming and Simplifying the Tax LawCoordinating with Partners and StakeholdersIn each of these areas, the report sets out compliance objectives and initiatives, along with targeted completion dates, that the IRS is implementing to improve tax compliance over the next several years. Detailed information is provided on each step currently being taken to reduce opportunities for tax evasion, leverage technology and support legislative proposals that, as implemented, will improve compliance. At the same time, the report reaffirms that taxpayer rights must be respected and burdens on compliant taxpayers must be minimized. The report also presents an outreach approach to ensure all taxpayers understand their tax obligations. Additionally, it recognizes the importance of having a multi-year research program that will assist in understanding both the scope of and reasons for noncompliance. Full implementation of the initiatives outlined in the report will have a positive effect on the rate of voluntary compliance. The report reflects the commitment of the IRS to apply its resources where they are of most value in reducing noncompliance while ensuring fairness, observing taxpayer rights, and minimizing the burden on taxpayers who comply.

The report reflects the commitment of the IRS to apply its resources where they are of most value in reducing noncompliance while ensuring fairness, observing taxpayer rights, and minimizing the burden on taxpayers who comply. The overall compliance rate achieved under the U.S. revenue system is quite high. For the 2001 tax year, the IRS estimates that over 86 percent of tax liabilities were collected, after factoring in late payments and recoveries from IRS enforcement activities. Nevertheless, an unacceptable amount of the tax that should be paid every year is not, short-changing the vast majority of Americans who pay their taxes accurately and giving rise to the tax gap. The gross tax gap was estimated to be $345 billion in 2001. After enforcement effects and late payments, this number was reduced to a net tax gap of approximately $290 billion.

For more information, please see the full notice .The Treaty of Portsmouth and the Russo-Japanese War, 1904–1905The Treaty of Portsmouth formally ended the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05. The negotiations took place in August in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and were brokered in part by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt. The final agreement was signed in September of 1905, and it affirmed the Japanese presence in south Manchuria and Korea and ceded the southern half of the island of Sakhalin to Japan.Photograph from the Russo-Japanese WarBy 1904, Russia and Japan had endured several years of disputes over control of Manchuria. The Russians had entered the region during the Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95 and, along with Germany and France, was a part of the “Triple Intervention” that forced Japan to give up its demands for ports in South Manchuria and the Liaodong Peninsula in the wake of its victory in China. Instead, Russia moved into the area and took control of Port Arthur, a warm water port with strategic and commercial significance. A Japanese attempt to stage a coup in adjacent Korea was thwarted in part by the Russian presence in the region, and the two nations’ divergent interests appeared more and more likely to clash.In 1904, the Japanese attacked the Russian fleet at Port Arthur before the formal declaration of war was received in Moscow, surprising the Russian navy and earning an early victory. Over the course of the next year, the two forces clashed in Korea and the Sea of Japan, with the Japanese scoring significant, but costly, victories. War casualties were high on both sides. At the battle over Mukden, the Russians lost 60,000 soldiers and the Japanese lost 41,000 soldiers. The military costs were high as well. A Russian fleet made the long trip from the Baltic Sea around Africa and India, only to be half destroyed by the Japanese upon its arrival in Northeast Asia. By 1905, the combination of these losses and the economic cost of financing the war led both countries to seek an end to the war.Photograph of Attack on Port ArthurThe Japanese asked U.S. President Roosevelt to negotiate a peace agreement, and representatives of the two nations met in Portsmouth, New Hampshire in 1905. For the sake of maintaining the balance of power and equal economic opportunity in the region, Roosevelt preferred that the war end on terms that left both Russia and Japan a role to play in Northeast China. Though excited by the Japanese military victories, Roosevelt worried about the consequences to American interests if Japan managed to drive Russia out entirely.The negotiations centered on access to ports and territories in Manchuria and Korea, control of Sakhalin Island, and the question of who was responsible for paying war costs. The chief aims of the Japanese negotiator included first control in Korea and South Manchuria, then the negotiation of an indemnity and control of Sakhalin Island. The Russians wanted to maintain Sakhalin Island, refused to pay a war costs indemnity to the Japanese, and hoped to maintain their fleet in the Pacific. The indemnity issue, along with the dispensation of Sakhalin Island, were the major sticking points in the negotiation, although given its financial straits in 1905, Russia was likely unable to pay an indemnity even if required by a treaty to do so.When negotiations reached an impasse, Roosevelt stepped in with the proposal that Russia “buy back” the northern part of Sakhalin from Japanese control. The Russians were adamant that they would not pay any amount of money, which would act as a disguised indemnity, when the territory ought to be theirs. After long internal debate, Japan eventually agreed to take only the southern half of the island, without any kind of payment. Theirs had not been a decisive enough victory to force the point.The Treaty ultimately gave Japan control of Korea and much of South Manchuria, including Port Arthur and the railway that connected it with the rest of the region, along with the southern half of Sakhalin Island; Russian power was curtailed in the region, but it was not required to pay Japan’s war costs. Because neither nation was in a strong financial position to continue the war easily, both were forced to compromise in the terms of the peace. Still, the Japanese public felt they had won the war, and they considered the lack of an indemnity to be an affront. There was a brief outbreak of protests and rioting in Tokyo when the terms of the agreement were made public. Similarly, the Russian people were also dissatisfied, angry about giving up half of Sakhalin.Individuals gathered to work out what became the Treaty of PortsmouthThroughout the war and the peace talks, American public opinion largely sided with Japan. Believing that the Japanese were fighting a “just war” against Russian aggression, and that the island nation was equally committed to the Open Door and the territorial integrity of China, the American people were anxious to support it. This sense did not really change over the course of the negotiations, in spite of the best efforts of the Russian negotiator to improve the press coverage of his nation’s position. The final decision of the Japanese to forgo an indemnity only served to strengthen U.S. approval of Japan’s actions throughout the conflict. The anti-treaty and, at times, anti-American demonstrations in Tokyo that followed the ratification of the treaty caught many Americans off-guard.The Treaty of Portsmouth marked the last real event in an era of U.S.-Japanese cooperation that began with the Meiji Restoration in 1868. Instead, competition between the two nations in the Pacific grew over the years that followed. Conversely, Japanese relations with Russia improved in the wake of the treaty. Although the actual importance of Roosevelt’s mediation and personal pressure on the leadership in Moscow and Tokyo to the final agreement is unclear, he won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in moderating the talks and pushing toward peace.Table of Contents

The Black Death: Bubonic Plague In the early 1330s an outbreak of deadly bubonic plague occurred in China. Plague mainly affects rodents, but fleas can transmit the disease to people. Once people are infected, they infect others very rapidly. Plague causes fever and a painful swelling of the lymph glands called buboes, which is how it gets its name. The disease also causes spots on the skin that are red at first andthen turn black. Since China was one of the busiest of the world's trading nations, it was only a matter of time before the outbreak of plague in China spread to western Asia and Europe. In October of 1347, several Italian merchant ships returned from a trip to the Black Sea, one of the key links in trade with China. When the ships docked in Sicily, many of those on board were already dying of plague. Within days the disease spread to the city and the surrounding countryside. An eyewitness tells what happened: ""Realizing what a deadly disaster had come to them, the people quickly drove the Italians fromtheir city. But the disease remained, and soon death was everywhere. Fathers abandoned their sicksons. Lawyers refused to come and make out wills for the dying. Friars and nuns were left to carefor the sick, and monasteries and convents were soon deserted, as they were stricken, too. Bodieswere left in empty houses, and there was no one to give them a Christian burial."" The disease struck and killed people with terrible speed. The Italian writer Boccaccio said its victims often ""ate lunch with their friends and dinner with their ancestors in paradise."" By the following August, the plague had spread as far north as England, where people called it ""The Black Death"" because of the black spots it produced on the skin. A terrible killer was loose across Europe, and Medieval medicine had nothing to combat it. In winter the disease seemed to disappear, but only because fleas--which were now helping to carry it from person to person--are dormant then. Each spring, the plague attacked again, killing new victims. After five years 25 million people were dead--one-third of Europe's people. Even when the worst was over, smaller outbreaks continued, not just for years, but for centuries. The survivors lived in constant fear of the plague's return, and the disease did not disappear until the 1600s. Medieval society never recovered from the results of the plague. So many people had died that there were serious labor shortages all over Europe. This led workers to demand higher wages, but landlords refused those demands. By the end of the 1300s peasant revolts broke out in England, France, Belgium and Italy. The disease took its toll on the church as well. People throughout Christendom had prayed devoutly for deliverance from the plague. Why hadn't those prayers been answered? A new period of political turmoil and philosophical questioning lay ahead.

Note that Deja News offers a choice of two databases: Current or Old. ""Current"" contains the most recent few weeks of articles; ""Old"" goes back to the start of the archive in March 1995.) (2) questions that can be answered by simple reference to a dictionary. (3) generalities. If you make a statement like: ""Here in the U.S. we NEVER say 'different to'"", ""Retroflex 'r' is ONLY used in North America"", or ""'Eh' ALWAYS rhymes with 'pay'"", chances are that someone will pounce on you with a counterexample. (4) assertions that one variety of English is ""true English"". (5) sloppy writing (as distinct from simple slips like typing errors, or errors from someone whose native language is not English). Keep in mind that the regulars on alt.usage.english are probably less willing than the general population to suffer sloppy writers gladly; and that each article is written by one person, but read perhaps by thousands, so the convenience of the readers really ought to have priority over the convenience of the writer. Again, this is *not* to discourage non-native speakers from posting; readers will be able to detect that you're writing in a foreign language, and will make allowances for this. (6) expressions of exasperation. In the course of debate, you may encounter positions based on premises radically different from yours and perhaps surprisingly novel to you. Saying things like ""Oh, please"", ""That's absurd"", ""Give me a break"", or ""Go teach your grandmother to suck eggs, my man"" is unlikely to win your opponent over. You really *are* welcome to post here! Don't let the impatient tone of this FAQ frighten you off. Related newsgroups ------------------ There are other newsgroups that also discuss the English language. bit.listserv.words-l (which is a redistribution of a BITNET mailing list -- not all machines on Usenet carry these) is also billed as being for ""English language discussion"", but its participants engage in a lot more socializing and general chitchat than we do. There is a mailing list for copy-editors. To subscribe, send e-mail with the text ""SUBSCRIBE COPYEDITING-L Your Name"" to listproc@cornell.edu . sci.lang is where most of the professional linguists hang out. Discussions tend to be about linguistic methodology (rather than about *particular* words and phrases), and prescription is severely frowned upon there. Newbies post many things there that would better be posted here. alt.flame.spelling (which fewer sites carry than carry alt.usage.english ) is the place to criticize other people's spelling. We try to avoid doing that here (although some of us do get provoked if you spell language terms wrong. It's ""consensus"", not ""concensus""; ""diphthong"", not ""dipthong""; ""grammar"", not ""grammer""; ""guttural"", not ""gutteral""; and ""pronunciation"", not ""pronounciation""). alt.usage.english.neologism is described as being for ""meaningless words coined by psychotics"". Fewer sites carry it, and it gets little traffic; the people who do post to it are generally not negative about neologisms. rec.puzzles is a better place than here to ask questions like ""What English words end in '-gry' or '-endous'?"", ""What words contain 'vv'?"", ""What words have 'e' pronounced as /I/?"", ""What Pig Latin words are also words?"", or ""How do you punctuate 'John where Bill had had had had had had had had had had had the approval of the teacher' or 'That that is is that that is not is not that that is not is not that that is is that it it is' to get comprehensible text?"" But, before you post such a question there, make sure it's not answered in the rec.puzzles archive, available at < http://xraysgi.ims.uconn.edu:8080/ > The ""-gry"" answer is now also to be found below in this FAQ. Wordplay for its own sake (anagrams, palindromes, etc.) belongs in alt.anagrams . There are also long lists of such things in the rec.puzzles archive. ""The Word Gamer's Paradise"" at < http://fun2play.com/ > may also be of interest. misc.education.language.english is a newsgroup devoted to the teaching of English (especially as a second language). comp.edu.languages.natural is devoted to software for assisting language instruction. misc.writing is devoted to writing, and especially to the concerns of people trying to establish themselves as professional writers. alt.quotations is the place to ask about origins of quotations (although there is no firm dividing line between those and phrase origins, which belong here). You can access the 1901 edition of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations at: < http://www.columbia.edu/acis/bartleby/bartlett/ > Language features peculiar to the U.K. get discussed in soc.culture.british as well as here. Before posting to either newsgroup on this subject, you should look at Jeremy Smith's British-American dictionary, available on the WWW at: < http://www.peak.org/~jeremy/dictionary/dict.html > If you have a (language-related or other) peeve that you want to mention but don't particularly want to justify, you can try alt.peeves . (""What is your pet peeve?"" is *not* a frequently asked question in alt.usage.english , although we frequently get unsolicited answers to it. If you're new to this group, chances are excellent that your particular pet peeve is something that has already been discussed to death by the regulars.) If you're interested in the peculiarities of language as used by computer users, get the Jargon File, by anonymous ftp from prep.ai.mit.edu (18.71.0.38) under pub/gnu, or on the WWW: < http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon.html > (also available in paperback form as _The New Hacker's Dictionary_, ed. Eric S. Raymond, 3rd edition, MIT Press, 1996, ISBN 0-262-68092-0). Words you encounter on the Net that you can't find in general English dictionaries (""automagic"", ""bogon"", ""emoticon"", ""mudding"", the prefix ""Ob-"" as in ""ObAUE"", ""prepend"") you may well find in the Jargon File. You can discuss hacker language further in the newsgroup alt.folklore.computers , or in the moderated newsgroup comp.society.folklore . Two newsgroups that don't deal with the English language but that people often need directing to are: sci.classics (now preferably humanities.classics ), for questions about Latin and ancient Greek; and comp.fonts , for questions about typography. ==================================================================== RECOMMENDED BOOKS ----------------- Dictionaries ------------ The Oxford English Dictionary (OED), 2nd ed. (OED2) (Oxford University Press, 1989, 20 vols.; compact edition, 1991 ISBN 0-19-861258-3; additions series, 2 vols., 1993, ISBN 0-19-861292-3 and 0-19-861299-0), has no rivals as a historical dictionary of the English language. It is too large for the editors to keep all of it up to date, and hence should not be relied on for precise definitions of technical terms, or for consistent usage labels. Webster's Third New International Dictionary (Merriam-Webster, 1961, ISBN 0-87779-201-1) (W3) is the unabridged dictionary to check for 20th-century U.S. citations of word use, and for precise definitions of technical terms too rare to appear in college dictionaries. People sometimes cite W3 with a later date. These later dates refer to the addenda section at the front, *not* to the body of the dictionary, which is unchanged since 1961. W3 was widely criticized by schoolteachers and others for its lack of usage labels; e.g., it gives ""imply"" as one of the meanings of ""infer"" and ""flout"" as one of the meanings of ""flaunt"", without indicating that these are disputed usage. Others have defended the lack of usage labels. An anthology devoted to the controversy is _Dictionaries and THAT Dictionary: A Case Book of the Aims of Lexicographers and the Targets of Reviewers_, ed. James Sledd and Wilma R. Ebbitt (Scott Foresman, 1962); a more recent book, _The Story of Webster's Third : Philip Gove's Controversial Dictionary and Its Critics_ by Herbert C. Morton (Cambridge University Press, 1995, ISBN 0-521-46146-4) is heavily biased in favour of W3. Merriam-Webster is working on a 4th edition, with completion expected around the year 2000. Please don't refer to any dictionary simply as ""Webster's"". _Books in Print_ has 5 columns of book titles beginning with ""Webster's"", from many different publishers! One-volume 8""x10"" dictionaries are popularly known as ""collegiate dictionaries"", but they should be called ""college dictionaries"" or ""quarto dictionaries"", since ""Collegiate"" is a trademark of Merriam- Webster. The college dictionary most frequently cited here is Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition (Merriam- Webster, 1994, ISBN 0-87779-712-9) (MWCD10). Merriam-Webster publishes sub-editions of its Collegiate dictionaries, so look at the copyright date to see exactly what you have. The most comprehensive British college dictionary is Collins English Dictionary (3rd edition, HarperCollins, updated 1994, ISBN 0-00-470678-1). Our British posters seem to refer more often to The Concise Oxford Dictionary (9th Edition, Oxford University Press, 1995, 0-19-861319-9) (COD9) and The Chambers Dictionary (Chambers, 1994, ISBN 0-550-10256-6). Some of us believe that the editorial standard of the Concise Oxford has declined since H. W. Fowler and F. G. Fowler brought out the first few editions; some of the partisans of COD9 seem to have bought it COD9 simply because it said ""Oxford"" on the cover, and not compared it with other dictionaries. If you're interested in etymology, get The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (3rd edition, Houghton Mifflin, 1992, ISBN 0-395-44895-6) (AHD3) or Webster's New World College Dictionary (3rd edition, Macmillan, 1996, ISBN 0-02-860333-8). These are two of the few dictionaries that trace words back to their reconstructed Indo-European (Aryan) roots. AHD3 is particularly useful because it lists the etyma all together in an appendix. Because the appendix was pared in the third edition, _The American Heritage Dictionary of Indo-European Roots_, by Calvert Watkins (Houghton Mifflin, 1985), although out of print, is not obsolete. Although AHD3 looks larger than a college dictionary, its word count puts it in the college range. If you want an up-to-date dictionary that is larger than a college dictionary, get the Random House Unabridged Dictionary (2nd edition, Random House, revised 1993, ISBN 0-679-42917-4) (RHUD2). Online dictionaries ------------------- You *cannot* access the OED online, unless you or your institution has paid to do so. The second edition is copyright, and allowing public access to it would be *illegal*. A public-access version of the first edition is conceivable, but I don't know of one. The OED is available on CD-ROM for PCs, and server-style for UNIX systems. For info on obtaining the UNIX version in North America, phone the Open Text Corporation in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada: e-mail "" info@opentext.com "". Don't ask us where to buy the CD-ROM version: your local bookshop can order it for you. If you want to submit citations for the next edition of the OED, you can contact the OED staff directly at "" oed3@oup.co.uk "". The online OED is encoded with the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), which is ISO 8879:1986 and is discussed in obscure detail on the comp.text.sgml newsgroup. The funny-looking escape codes beginning with ""&"" are known as ""text entity references"". The ISO has defined a slew of such for use with SGML: publishing symbols, math and scientific symbols, and so on. A good place to start learning about SGML is ""A Gentle Introduction to SGML"" at < http://etext.virginia.edu/bin/tei-tocs?div=DIV1&id=SG >. There's also the book _Industrial-Strength SGML: An Introduction to Enterprise Publishing_ by Truly Donovan (Prentice Hall, 1996, ISBN 0-13-216243-1). Merriam-Webster's MWCD10 is publicly accessible at < http://www.m-w.com >. Project Gutenberg has put out two versions of an unabridged dictionary published early in this century by the company that is now Merriam-Webster. One version is in HTML format and comes to 45 Mb when unZIPed. The other is plain text and comes in several ZIP files with names such as pgwXX04.ZIP, where the XX are the initial letters of words included. All are available in < ftp://uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu/pub/etext/gutenberg/etext96 >. They're also on the Web at < http://promo.net/pg/ >. Any ""Webster"" dictionary that you find anywhere else on the Net is probably an out-of-date bootleg. Keep in mind that any dictionary containing such words as ""beat.nik"" and ""tran.sis.tor"" is too recent to be in the public domain. The Macquarie dictionary is accessible online at < http://www.dict.mq.edu.au >. Roget's Thesaurus (1911 version, out of copyright) is available from: < http://web.cs.city.ac.uk/text/roget/thesaurus > The Oxford Text Archive at: < http://sable.ox.ac.uk/ > has Collins English Dictionary (1st edition) converted to a Prolog fact base; the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary; and the MRC Psycholinguistic Database (150,837 word forms, expanded from the headwords in the Shorter Oxford, with info about 26 different linguistic properties). Read the conditions of use for the Oxford Text Archive materials before using; most texts are available for scholarly use and research only. The best ""Word of the Day"" service is the one run by Merriam-Webster at < http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/mwwod.pl >; it can also be subscribed to by e-mail.

General reference ----------------- _The Oxford Companion to the English Language_ (ed. Tom McArthur, Oxford University Press, 1992, ISBN 0-19-214183-X) is an encyclopaedia with a wealth of information on various dialects, on lexicography, and almost everything else except individual words and expressions. _Success With Words_ (Reader's Digest, 1983, ISBN 0-88850-117-X) is especially suitable for beginners.

Among conservative prescriptivists, the most highly respected usage book is the Dictionary of Modern English Usage, by H. W. Fowler -- 1st edition, 1926 (MEU); a facsimile of the original edition was published by Wordsworth Reference in 1994 (ISBN 1-85326-318-4). The 2nd edition (MEU2), revised by Sir Ernest Gowers (Oxford University Press, 1965, ISBN 0-19-281389-7) is generally respected, although not idolized, by Fowler's devotees. A ""third edition"", _The New Fowler's Modern English Usage_ (MEU3), by Robert Burchfield (who edited the OED supplement), appeared in 1996 after a long wait (Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-869126-2). It retains virtually none of Fowler's original text, is a sharp philosophical departure from Fowler, and has many errors, although it does contain some information not to be found elsewhere. Oxford University Press has announced that it will keep MEU2 in print as a paperback. (What was initially announced as an independent revision of MEU by the late Sir Kingsley Amis has turned out to be ""not a revision of Fowler in any way, but rather a from-scratch usage book of the discursive-paragraph sort"": _The King's English: A Guide to Modern Usage_, HarperCollins, 1997, ISBN 0-00-255681-2). _The Elements of Style_ by William Strunk and E. B. White (Macmillan, 3rd ed. 1979, ISBN 0-02-418190-0) and Wilson Follett's _Modern American Usage_ (Hill and Wang, 1966, ISBN 0-8090-0139-X) have their partisans here, although they aren't as *widely* respected as Fowler. Liberals most often refer to the Dictionary of Contemporary American Usage, by Bergen Evans and Cornelia Evans (Random House, 1957, ISBN 0-8022-0973-4 -- out of print). Online usage guides ------------------- Jack Lynch ( jlynch@english.upenn.edu ) has a style guide that he originally wrote for business writers and modified for an English Literature course that he teaches at the University of Pennsylvania: < http://www.english.upenn.edu/~jlynch/grammar.html > Some topics that some people expect to be covered in this FAQ file, such as ""affect"" vs ""effect"", ""compose"" vs ""comprise"", and ""i.e."" vs ""e.g."", actually belong in a list of things that writers need to be cautioned about; you'll find them in Jack's guide.

From time to time, we get threads in which each post mentions *one* of these differences. Because such a thread can go on for ever, it's helpful to delimit the topic more narrowly. The books to get are _The Hutchinson British/American Dictionary_ by Norman Moss (Arrow, 1990, ISBN 0-09-978230-8); _British English, A to Zed_ by Norman W.

Books on phrase origins ----------------------- Be warned that every book on phrase origins so far published has etymologies that are more speculative and less rigorous than those in general dictionaries. Christine Ammer _Have a Nice Day -- No Problem! : A Dictionary of Cliches_ Plume Penguin, 1992, ISBN 0-452-27004-9 Robert Hendrickson _The Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins_ Facts on File, 1987, ISBN 0-86237-122-7 (The paperback reprint, _The Henry Holt Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins_, is no longer available.)

K. Ogden in 1929. Look at < http://web.marshallnet.com/~manor/basiceng/basiceng.html > if you're interested. (We're not.) E-prime ------- E-prime is a subset of standard idiomatic English that eschews all forms of the verb ""to be"" (e.g., you can't say ""You are an ass"" or ""You an ass"", but you can say ""You act like an ass""). The original reference is D. David Bourland, Jr., ""A linguistic note: write in E-prime"" _General Semantics Bulletin_, 1965/1966, 32 and 33, 60-61. Albert Ellis wrote a book in E-prime (_Sex and the Liberated Man_). You can also look at the April 1992 issue of the _Atlantic_ if you're interested. (We're not.) The following book contains articles both pro and con on E-Prime: _To Be or Not: An E-Prime Anthology_, ed. D. David Bourland and Paul D. Johnston, International Society for General Semantics, 1991, ISBN 0-918970-38-5. The most pertinent Web page seems to be < http://www.crl.com/~isgs/speak_e.htm >. ==================================================================== PRONUNCIATION ------------- How to represent pronunciation in ASCII --------------------------------------- Beware of using ad hoc methods to indicate pronunciation. The problem with ad hoc methods is that they often wrongly assume your dialect to have certain features in common with the readers' dialect. You may pronounce ""bother"" to rhyme with ""father""; some of the readers here don't. You may pronounce ""cot"" and ""caught"" alike; some of the readers here don't. You may pronounce ""caught"" and ""court"" alike; some of the readers here don't. The standard way to represent pronunciation (used in the latest British Dictionaries and by linguists worldwide) is the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). For a complete guide to the IPA, see _Phonetic Symbol Guide_ by Geoffrey K. Pullum and William A. Ladusaw (University of Chicago Press, 1986, ISBN 0-226-68532-2). IPA uses many special symbols; on the Net, where we're restricted to ASCII symbols, we must find a way to make do. The following scheme is due to Evan Kirshenbaum ( kirshenbaum@hpl.hp.com ). The complete scheme can be accessed on the WWW at: < http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Evan_Kirshenbaum/IPA/ > I show here only examples for the sounds most often referred to in this newsgroup. Where there are two columns, the left column shows British Received Pronunciation (RP), and the right column shows a rhotic pronunciation used by at least some U.S. speakers. (There's a WWW page that shows what the IPA symbols look like: < http://www.unil.ch/ling/phonetique/api2.html >.) The IPA itself has a home page: < http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/IPA/ipa.html >. The consonant symbols [b], [d], [f], [h], [k], [l], [m], [n], [p], [r], [s], [t], [v], [w], and [z] have their usual English values. [A] = [<script a>] as in: ""ah"" /A:/ /A:/ ""cart"" /kA:t/ /kArt/ ""father"" /'fA:D@/ /'fA:D@r/ ""farther"" /'fA:D@/ /'fArD@r/ and French _bas_ /bA/. This sound requires opening your mouth wide and feeling resonance at the back of your mouth. [A.] = [<turned script a>] as in British: ""bother"" /'bA.D@/ ""cot"" /kA.t/ ""hot"" /hA.t/ ""sorry"" /'sA.rI/ This symbol (for the sound traditionally called ""short o"") is not much used to transcribe U.S. pronunciation. [A] or [O] is used instead, according to which vowels the speaker merges; but the sound *used* by *many* such speakers will certainly be *heard* by Britons as [A.]. The sound is intermediate between [A] and [O], but typically of shorter duration than either. Imagine Patrick Stewart saying ""Tea, Earl Grey, hot."" [a] as in French _ami_ /a'mi/, German _Mann_ /man/, Italian _pasta_ /'pasta/, Chicago ""pop"" /pap/, Boston ""park"" /pa:k/. Also in diphthongs: ""dive"" /daIv/ (yes, folks, the sound traditionally called ""long i"" is actually a diphthong!), ""out"" /aUt/. Typically, [a] is not distinguished phonemically from [A]; but if you use in ""ask"" a vowel distinct both from the one in ""cat"" and the one in ""father"", then [a] is what it is. [C] = [<c cedilla>] as in German (Hochdeutsch) _ich_ /IC/ [D] = [<edh>] as in ""this"" /DIs/ [E] = [<epsilon>] as in: ""end"" /End/ /End/ ""get"" /gEt/ /gEt/ ""Mary"" /'mE@rI/ /'mE@ri/ ""merry"" /'mErI/ /'mEri/ Some U.S. speakers do not distinguish between ""Mary"", ""merry"", and ""marry"". [e] as in: ""eight"" /eIt/ /eIt/ ""chaos"" /'keA.s/ /'keAs/ [g] as in ""get"" /gEt/ [I] = [<iota>] as in ""it"" /It/ [I.] = [<small capital y>] as in German _Gl""uck_ /glI.k/. Round your lips for [U] and try to say [I]. [i] as in ""eat"" /i:t/ [j] as in ""yes"" /jEs/ [N] = [<eng>] as in ""hang"" /h&N/ [O] = [<open o>] as in: ""all"" /O:l/ /O:l/ ""caught"" /kO:t/ /kO:t/ ""court"" /kO:t/ /kOrt/ ""oil"" /OIl/ /OIl/ The [O] sound requires rounded lips, but lips making a a bigger circle than for [o]. If you do not use the same vowel sound in ""caught"" as in ""court"", then you are one of the North American speakers who use [O] only before [r]: you do not round your lips for ""all"" and ""caught"", and you should use some other symbol, such as [A] or [a], to transcribe the vowel. [o] as in U.S.: ""no"" /noU/ ""old"" /oUld/ ""omit"" /oU'mIt/ The pure sound is heard in French _beau_ /bo/. British Received Pronunciation does not use this sound, substituting the diphthong /@U/ (/n@U/, /@Uld/, /@U'mIt/). If you are one of the few speakers who distinguish such pairs as ""aural"" and ""oral"", ""for"" and ""four"", ""for"" and ""fore"", ""horse"" and ""hoarse"", ""or"" and ""oar"", ""or"" and ""ore"", then you use [O] for the first and [o] for the second word in each pair; otherwise, you use [O] for both. [R] = [<right-hook schwa>], equivalent to /@r/, /r-/, or even /V""r/ [S] = [<esh>] as in ""ship"" /SIp/ [T] = [<theta>] as in ""thin"" /TIn/ [t!] = [<turned t>] as in ""tsk-tsk"" or ""tut-tut"" /t! t!/ [U] = [<upsilon>] as in ""pull"" /pUl/ [u] as in ""ooze"" /u:z/ [V] = [<turned v>] as in British RP: ""hurry"" /'hVrI/ ""shun"" /SVn/ ""up"" /Vp/ U.S. speakers tend not to use [V] in words (such as ""hurry"") where the following sound is [r]: they would say /'h@ri/. And some U.S. speakers, especially in the eastern U.S., substitute [@] for [V] in all contexts. If you do not distinguish ""mention"" /'mEn S@n/ from ""men shun"" /'mEn SVn/, then you should use [@] and not [V] to transcribe your speech. [V""] = [<reversed epsilon>] as in: ""fern"" /fV"":n/ /fV""rn/ ""hurl"" /hV"":l/ /hV""rl/ Many U.S. speakers substitute [@] for [V""], so they would say /f@rn/, /h@rl/. Many other U.S. speakers pronounce ""fern"" with no vowel at all: /fr:n/, /hr:l/. If you are one of the few speakers who distinguish such pairs as ""pearl"" and ""purl"" (using a lower, more retracted vowel in ""purl""), then you can transcribe ""pearl"" /p@rl/ and ""purl"" /pV""rl/. [W] = [<o-e ligature>] as in French _heure_ /Wr/, German _K""opfe_ /'kWpf@/. Round your lips for [O] and try to say [E]. [x] as in Scots ""loch"" /lA.x/, German _Bach_ /bax/ [Y] = [<slashed o>] as in French _peu_ /pY/, German _sch""on_ /SYn/, Scots ""guidwillie"" /gYd'wIli/. Round your lips for [o] and try to say [e]. [y] as in French _lune_ /lyn/, German _m""ude_ /'myd@/. Round your lips for [u] and try to say [i]. [Z] = [<yogh>] as in ""beige"" /beIZ/ [&] = [<ash>] as in: ""ash"" /&S/ /&S/ ""cat"" /k&t/ /k&t/ ""marry"" /'m&rI/ /'m&ri/ [@] = [<schwa>] as in ""lemon"" /'lEm@n/ [?] = [<glottal>] as in ""uh-oh"" /V?oU/ [*] = [<fish-hook r>], a short tap of the tongue use by some U.S. speakers in ""pedal"", ""petal"", and by Scots speakers in ""pearl"": all /pE*@l/. If you are a U.S. speaker but distinguish ""pedal"" from ""petal"", then you do not use this sound. - previous consonant syllabic as in ""bundle"" /'bVnd@l/ or /'bVndl-/, ""button"" /bVt@n/ or /bVtn-/ ~ previous sound nasalized : previous sound lengthened ; previous sound palatalized <h> previous sound aspirated ' following syllable has primary stress , following syllable has secondary stress Here is the scheme compared with the transcriptions in 4 U.S. dictionaries.

Look in ""/user/ai/areas/nlp/corpora/pron"" and ""/user/ai/areas/speech/database/britpron"". rhotic vs non-rhotic, intrusive ""r"" ----------------------------------- A rhotic speaker is one who pronounces as a consonant postvocalic ""r"", i.e. the ""r"" after a vowel in words like ""world"" /wV""rld/. A nonrhotic speaker either does not pronounce the ""r"" at all /wV""ld/ or pronounces it as a schwa /wV""@ld/. British Received Pronunciation (RP) and many other dialects of English are nonrhotic. Many nonrhotic speakers (including RP speakers, but excluding most nonrhotic speakers in the southern U.S.) use a ""linking r"": they don't pronounce ""r"" in ""for"" by itself /fO:/, but they do pronounce the first ""r"" in ""for ever"" /fO: 'rEv@/. Linking ""r"" differs from French liaison in that the former happens in any phonetically appropriate context, whereas the latter also needs the right syntactic context. A further development of ""linking r"" is ""intrusive r"". Intrusive-r speakers, because the vowels in ""law"" (which they pronounce the same as ""lore"") and ""idea"" (which they pronounce to rhyme with ""fear"") are identical for them to vowels spelled with ""r"", intrude an r in such phrases as ""law [r]and order"" and ""The idea [r]of it!"" They do NOT intrude an [r] after vowels that are never spelled with an ""r"". Some people blanch at intrusive r, but most RP speakers now use it. How do Americans pronounce ""dog""? --------------------------------- Those who round their lips when they say it would probably transcribe it /dOg/; those who don't round their lips, /dAg/. Very few people in North America distinguish all three vowels /A/, /A./, and /O/. Speakers in Eastern and Southern U.S. merge /A./ and /A/, so that ""bother"" and ""father"" rhyme. Speakers in Western U.S. and in Canada merge /A./ and /O/, so that ""cot"" and ""caught"", ""Don"" and ""Dawn"" are pronounced alike. Some speakers merge all three vowels. The Oxford Companion to the English Language says: ""The merger of vowels in _tot_ and _taught_ begins in a narrow band in central Pennsylvania and spreads north and south to influence the West, where the merger is universal. [...] In New England, where the merger is beginning to occur, speakers select the first vowel; in the Midland and West, the second vowel is used for both."" Although /A./ is seldom used to transcribe American pronunciation, the vowel transcribed /O/ may sound like /A./ to non-American speakers, or it may sound like /O/. There is a further complication with ""dog"": U.S. dictionaries give the pronunciations /dOg/, /dAg/ in that order (and similarly with some other words ending in ""-og"", although which ones varies from dictionary to dictionary). ""Dawg"", the name of the family dog in the comic strip ""Hi and Lois"", may be intended to convey the pronunciation /dOg/ to (or from) people who usually pronounce the word /dAg/; or it may be intended as how a child in a community where /A./ and /O/ are merged might misspell ""dog"". Words pronounced differently according to context ------------------------------------------------- There is a general tendency in English whereby when a word with a stressed final syllable is followed by another word without a pause, the stress moves forward: ""kangaROO"", but ""KANGaroo court""; ""afterNOON"", but ""AFTernoon nap""; ""above BOARD"", but ""an aBOVEboard deal"". This happens chiefly in noun phrases, but not exclusively so (""acquiESCE"" versus ""ACquiesce readily""). Consider also ""Chinese"" and all numbers ending in ""-teen"". When ""have to"" means ""must"", the [v] in ""have"" becomes an [f]. Similarly, in ""has to"", [z] becomes [s]. When ""used to"" and ""supposed to"" are used in their senses of ""formerly"" and ""ought"", the ""-sed"" is pronounced /st/; when they're used in other senses, it's /zd/. In many dialects, ""the"" is pronounced /D@/ before a consonant, and /DI/ before a vowel sound. Many foreigners learning English are taught this rule explicitly. Native English-speakers are also taught this rule when we sing in choirs. (We do it instinctively in rapid speech; but in the slower pace of singing, it has to be brought to our conscious attention.) Words that have different pronunciations for specialized meanings include the noun ""address"" (often stressed on the first syllable when denoting a location, but stressed on the second syllable when denoting an oration) ""contrary"" (often stressed on the second syllable when the meaning is ""perverse""); the verb ""discount"" (stressed on the first syllable when the meaning is ""to reduce in price"", but on the second syllable when the meaning is ""to disbelieve""); the verb ""process"" (stressed on the second syllable when the meaning is ""to go in procession""); the noun ""recess"" (stressed on the first syllable when it means ""a break from working"", but on the second syllable when it means ""a secluded part""); the verb ""relay"" (stressed on the first syllable when it means ""to pass on radio or TV signals"", but on the second syllable when it means ""to pass on something that was said""); and the verb ""second"" (stressed on the first syllable when it means ""to endorse a motion"", but on the second syllable when it means ""to temporarily re-assign an employee"". ""Offence"" and ""defence"", usually stressed on the second syllable, are often in North America stressed on the first syllable when the context is team sports. (In the U.S., of course, they are spelled with -se .) Words whose spelling has influenced their pronunciation ------------------------------------------------------- ""Cocaine"" used to be pronounced /'coU cA: in/ (3 syllables). ""Waistcoat"" used to be pronounced /'wEskIt/. ""Humble"" and ""human"" were borrowed from French with no [h] in their pronunciation. ""Forte"" in the sense ""strong point"" comes from French _fort_= ""strong, strong point""; the English spelling is what the OED calls an ""ignorant"" substitution of the feminine form of the adjective for the masculine noun. But even in the French feminine form _forte_, the ""e"" is not pronounced. ""Zoo"" is an abbreviation of ""zoological garden"". The (popular but stigmatized) pronunciation of ""zoological"" as /zu:@'lA.dZIk@l/ (as opposed to /zoU@'lA.dZIk@l/) is due to the influence of ""zoo"". ""Elephant"" was ""olifaunt"" in Middle English, but its spelling was restored to reflect the Latin ""elephantus"". Similarly, ""crocodile"" was ""cokedrill"". ""Golf"" is Scots. The traditional Scots pronunciation is /gof/. ""Ralph"" was traditionally pronounced /reIf/ in Britain -- Gilbert and Sullivan rhymed it with ""waif"" in _H.M.S. Pinafore_; that's how the composer Ralph Vaughan Williams pronounced his name; and even today actor Ralph Fiennes (of _Schindler's List_ fame) is said to pronounce his name /reIf faInz/. ""Medicine"" and ""regiment"" were two-syllable words in the 19th century: /'mEdsIn/ and /'rEdZm@nt/. /'mEdsIn/ can still be heard in RP. In 19th-century England, ""university"" was pronounced /,ju:nIv'A:sItI/ and ""laundry"" was pronounced /'lA:ndrI/. King Arthur would have pronounced his name /'artur/. The h's in ""Arthur"" (now universally reflected in the pronunciation) and ""Anthony"" (reflected in the U.S. pronunciation) were added in the 15th century -- ornamentally or, in the case of ""Anthony"", because of a false connection with Greek _anthos_=""flower"". The new pronunciations in such cases are called ""spelling pronunciations"". The ""speak-as-you-spell movement"" is described in the MEU2 article on ""pronunciation"". ==================================================================== USAGE DISPUTES -------------- ""acronym"" --------- Strictly, an acronym is a string of initial letters pronounceable as a word, such as ""NATO"". Abbreviations like ""NBC"" have been variously designated ""alphabetisms"" and ""initialisms"", although some people do call them acronyms. WDEU says, ""Dictionaries, however, do not make this distinction [between acronyms and initialisms] because writers in general do not""; but two of the best known books on acronyms are titled _Acronyms, Initialisms and Abbreviations Dictionary_ (19th ed., Gale, 1993) and _Concise Dictionary of Acronyms and Initialisms_ (Facts on File, 1988). The Network Dictionary of Acronyms is available through World Wide Web (< http://www.ucc.ie/info/net/acronyms/acro.html >) or by e-mail (send the word ""help"" to freetext@iruccvax.ucc.ie ). ""all ... not"" ------------- ""All ... not"" cannot be condemned on the grounds of novelty, as ""All that glitters is not gold"" and ""All is not lost"" show. ""All that glitters is not gold"" is from _Parabolae_, a book of poems written circa 1175 by Alanus de Insulis, a French monk: _Non teneas aurum totum quod splendet ut aurum_ = ""Do not hold as gold all that shines like gold"". It was Englished by Chaucer in the _Canterbury Tales_ (1389) as: ""But al thyng which that shyneth as the gold / Nis nat gold, as that I have herd it told."" (Shakespeare used the wording ""All that glisters is not gold"" in _The Merchant of Venice_; ""glister"", an archaic variant of ""glisten"", is still sometimes heard in allusion to this.) ""All is not lost"" occurs in Milton's _Paradise Lost_ (1667). The Oxford Dictionary of English Proverbs gives the proverbs ""All truths are not to be told"" (1350), ""All things fit not all persons"" (1532), ""All feet tread not in one shoe"" (1640), ""All are not saints that go to church"" (1659), and ""All Stuarts are not sib to the king"" (1857). It gives no proverbs at all beginning ""Not all"". ""All ... not"" can, however, be condemned on the grounds of potential ambiguity. When I proposed the sentence ""All the people who used the bathtub did not clean it afterwards"" as ambiguous, many people vigorously disputed that it was ambiguous. But they were about evenly split on what it did mean! (John Lawler writes: ""There's a very large literature on quantifier ambiguities. Guy Carden did the definitive early studies in the '60s and '70s, and many others have contributed since then."") ""Not all the people who used the bathtub cleaned it afterwards"" (or, if the other meaning is intended, ""None of the people who used the bathtub cleaned it afterwards"") is free of this ambiguity. (""Not all"" can also be used rhetorically to mean ""not even all"", but only in an exalted style incompatible with bathtubs: ""Not all the water in the rough rude sea / Can wash the balm from an anointed king"" -- Shakespeare, _Richard II_, 1595.) Fowler quoted a correspondent who urged him to prescribe ""not all"", and commented: ""This gentleman has logic on his side, logic has time on its side, and probably the only thing needed for his gratification is that he should live long enough."" ""alot"" ------ This misspelling of ""a lot"" is frequently mentioned as a pet peeve. It rarely appears in print, but is often found in the U.S. in informal writing and on Usenet. There does not seem to be a corresponding ""alittle"". ""alright"" --------- The spelling ""alright"" is recorded from 1887. It was defended by Fowler (in one of the Society for Pure English tracts, not in MEU), on the analogy of ""almighty"" and ""altogether"", and on the grounds that ""The answers are alright"" (= ""The answers are O.K."") is less ambiguous than ""The answers are all right"" (which could mean ""All the answers are right""). But it is still widely condemned. ""between you and I"" ------------------- The prescriptive rule is to use ""you and I"" in the same contexts as ""I"" (i.e., as a subject), and ""you and me"" in the same contexts as ""me"" (i.e., as an object). In ""between you and me"", since ""you and me"" is the object of the preposition ""between"", ""me"" is the only correct form. But English-speakers have a tendency to regard compounds joined with ""and"" as units, so that some speakers use ""you and me"" exclusively, and others use ""you and I"" exclusively, although such practices ""have no place in modern edited prose"" (WDEU). ""Between you and I"" was used by Shakespeare in _The Merchant of Venice_. Since this antedates the teaching of English grammar, it is probably *not* ""hypercorrection"". (This is mentioned merely to caution against the hypercorrection theory, not to defend the phrase.) Shakespeare also used ""between you and me"". ""company is"" vs ""company are"" ----------------------------- Use of a plural verb after a singular noun denoting a group of persons (known as a noun of multitude) is commoner in the U.K. than in the U.S. Fowler wrote: ""_The Cabinet _is_ divided_ is better, because in the order of thought a whole must precede division; and _The Cabinet _are_ agreed_ is better, because it takes two or more to agree."" ""could care less"" ----------------- The idiom ""couldn't care less"", meaning ""doesn't care at all"" (the meaning in full is ""cares so little that he couldn't possibly care less""), originated in Britain around 1940. ""Could care less"", which is used with the same meaning, developed in the U.S. around 1960. We get disputes about whether the latter was originally a mis-hearing of the former; whether it was originally ironic; or whether it arose from uses where the negative element was separated from ""could"" (""None of these writers could care less...""). Henry Churchyard believes that this sentence by Jane Austen may be pertinent: ""You know nothing and you care less, as people say."" (_Mansfield Park_ (1815), Chapter 29) Meaning-saving elaborations have also been suggested: ""As if I could care less!""; ""I could care less, but I'd have to try""; ""If I cared even one iota -- which I don't --, then I could care less."" Recently encountered has been ""could give a damn"", used in the sense ""couldn't give a damn"". An earlier transition in which ""not"" was dropped was the one that gave us ""but"" in the sense of ""only"". ""I will not say but one word"", where ""but"" meant ""(anything) except"", became ""I will say but one word."" Other idioms that say the opposite of what they mean include: ""head over heels"" (which could mean turning cartwheels, i.e. ""head over heels over head over heels"", but is also used to mean ""upside- down"", i.e. ""heels over head""); ""Don't sneeze more than you can help"" (meaning ""more than you cannot help""; ""help"" here means ""prevent""); ""It's hard to open, much less acknowledge, the letters"" (where ""less"" means ""harder"", i.e. ""more""); ""I shouldn't wonder if it didn't rain""; ""I miss not seeing you""; and ""I turned my life around 360 degrees"" -- not to mention undisputedly ironic phrases such as ""fat chance"", ""Thanks a *lot*"", and ""I should worry"". ""could of"" ---------- We get frequent complaints about the occurrence of ""of"" in unedited prose where the meaning is ""have"". ""Have"" contracts to ""'ve"", so ""could've"", ""might've"", ""must've"", ""should've"", ""would've"", etc. (and their negatives, ""couldn't've"", etc.), should be so spelled. People have testified that it's got beyond a spelling mistake: they've heard ""would of"" spoken with a clear pause between the words. WDEU says: ""The OED Supplement dates the naive (or ignorant) use of _of_ back to 1837. [...Y]ou had better avoid it in your own writing. [...] Bernstein 1977 allows that a schoolchild cannot be blamed for _could of_ -- once."" ""different to"", ""different than"" -------------------------------- ""Different from"" is the construction that no one will object to. ""Different to"" is fairly common informally in the U.K., but rare in the U.S. ""Different than"" is sometimes used to avoid the cumbersome ""different from that which"", etc. (e.g., ""a very different Pamela than I used to leave all company and pleasure for"" -- Samuel Richardson). Some U.S. speakers use ""different than"" exclusively. Some people have insisted on ""different from"" on the grounds that ""from"" is required after ""to differ"". But Fowler points out that there are many other adjectives that do not conform to the construction of their parent verbs (e.g., ""accords with"", but ""according to""; ""derogates from"", but ""derogatory to""). The Collins Cobuild Bank of English shows choice of preposition after ""different"" to be distributed as follows: ""from"" ""to"" ""than"" ----- ---- ------ U.K. writing 87.6 10.8 1.5 U.K. speech 68.8 27.3 3.9 U.S. writing 92.7 0.3 7.0 U.S. speech 69.3 0.6 30.1 ""done""=""finished"" ----------------- The OED's first citation for ""done"" in the sense of ""finished"" is from 1300, and it has been in continuous use since then. It was used in the 1549 Book of Common Prayer (""When the Clerkes have dooen syngyng""); by Francis Bacon (""Dinner being done, the Tirsan retireth"", 1611); by John Donne (""And having done that, Thou haste done, I have no more"", 1623); by Dryden (""Now the Chime of Poetry is done"", 1697); and by Dickens (""when the reading of this document is done"", 1859). According to The Oxford Dictionary of English Proverbs (OUP, 3rd ed., 1970, ISBN 0-19-869118-1), the proverb ""Man's work lasts till set of sun; woman's work is never done"" is first recorded with the words ""is never done"" in 1721. In the early 20th century, for some reason objections to the use of ""done"" in the sense of ""finished"" arose in the U.S. It became regarded as colloquial, and in 1969 only 53% of AHD's usage panel approved of it in writing. Although these objections have now subsided, one should still beware that the two senses of ""done"" may cause ambiguity: does ""The work will be done next month"" mean ""The work will get done next month"" or ""The work will be done by next month""? The use of ""be done"" with a personal subject, meaning ""have finished"", is described by the OED as ""chiefly Irish, Sc., U.S., and dial."" The first citation is dated 1766, and is from Thomas Amory, a British writer of Irish descent: ""I was done with love for ever."" American users have included Thomas Jefferson (""One farther favor and I am done"", 1771); Mark Twain (""I am done with official life for the present"", 1872); and Robert Frost (""But I am done with apple- picking now"", 1914). Users in the British Isles have included Robert Louis Stevenson (""We were no sooner done eating than Clumsy brought out an old, thumbed greasy pack of cards"", 1886) and George Bernard Shaw (""You can't be done: you've eaten nothing"", 1898). ""Be finished"" is also used in the sense of ""have finished"". Jespersen's first citation is from Oliver Goldsmith (""When we were finished for the day"", 1766). English-speakers should be careful not to render this construction literally into other languages: Partridge recounts the story of an Englishman who in a French restaurant said _Je suis fini_ to the waiter, who looked at the ""finished"" customer with some concern. Any of ""be done"", ""be finished"", ""have done"", and ""have finished"" may be followed either with a gerund, or with ""with"" plus any noun phrase. If ""with"" is not used and the noun phrase is not a gerund, then only ""have finished"" may be used (""have done"" would not have the sense ""have finished"" here). Use of ""with"" changes the meaning: ""I have finished construction of the building"" means that the building is fully constructed, whereas ""I have finished with construction of the building"" means merely that *my* part is over. These uses of ""be done"" and ""be finished"" are examples of what Fowler called the ""intransitive past participle"", where, instead of the more usual transformation: ""A {transitive verb}s B"" -> ""B is {transitive verb}ed"" we see the transformation: ""A {intransitive verb}s"" -> ""A is {intransitive verb}ed"" Fowler gives the examples: fallen angels, the risen sun, a vanished hand, past times, the newly arrived guest, a grown girl, absconded debtors, escaped prisoners, the deceased lady, the dear departed, coalesced stems, a collapsed lorry, we are agreed, a couched lion, an eloped pair, an expired lease. double ""is"" ----------- Double ""is"", as in ""The reason is, is that..."" is a recent U.S. development, much decried. According to MEU3, it was first noticed in 1971 and had spread to the U.K. by 1987. Of course, ""What this is is..."" is undisputedly correct. ""due to"" -------- ""Due to"" meaning ""caused by"" is undisputedly correct in contexts where ""due"" can be construed as an adjective (e.g., ""failure due to carelessness""). Its use in contexts where ""due"" is an adverb (""He failed due to carelessness"") has been disputed. Fowler says that ""_due to_ is often used by the illiterate as though it had passed, like _owing to_, into a mere compound preposition"". But Fowler was writing in 1926; what hadn't happened then may well have happened by now. ""functionality"" --------------- ""Functionality"" is often attacked as a needless long variant of ""function"". But they are differentiated in meaning. ""The function of a screwdriver is to turn screws. Its functionality includes prying open paint cans, stirring paint, scraping paint, and acting as a chisel. The function is what it is designed to do. The functionality is what you can do with it."" -- Evan Kirshenbaum. A thing's functionality includes its functions if and only if it does what it was designed to do. This specialized meaning of ""functionality"" is not yet in most dictionaries. The earliest citation we have was found by Fred Shapiro in the June 1977 issue of Fortune: ""The way to grow, an I.B.M. maxim says, is to 'increase the functionality of the system,' or, in plain English, to give the customer the capacity to do more than he wants to do in the knowledge that he inevitably will."" Mark Odegard suggests a similar distinction between ""mode"" and ""modality"": ""A 'mode' is a way of doing something. A 'modality' is doing something according to a protocol."" Outside technical contexts, the word ""functionality"" may well strike some readers as jargonistic. Thought may be needed to find a substitute that works in the context. ""Utility"" is sometimes suggested, but consider: ""The utility of mainframe computers has declined sharply over the past decade; their functionality has remained the same."" Here, ""their capabilities have remained the same"" might be the best solution. Gender-neutral pronouns ----------------------- ""Singular 'they'"" is the name generally given to the use of ""they"", ""them"", ""their"", or ""theirs"" with a singular antecedent such as ""someone"" or ""everyone"", as in ""Everyone was blowing their nose."" (It does not refer to the use of singular verbs in such mock- illiterate sentences as ""Them's the breaks"" and ""Them as has, gets."" Any verb agreeing with a singular ""they"" is plural: ""Someone killed him, and they are going to pay for it."") Singular ""they"" has been used in English since the time of Chaucer. Prescriptive grammarians have traditionally (since 1746, although the actual practice goes right back to 1200) prescribed ""he"": ""Everyone was blowing his nose."" In 1926, Fowler wrote that singular ""they"" had an ""old-fashioned sound [...]; few good modern writers would flout the grammarians so conspicuously."" But in recent decades, singular ""they"" has gained popularity as a result of the move towards gender-neutral language. For a defence of singular ""they"", with examples from Shakespeare, Jane Austen, and others, see Henry Churchyard's page at < http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~churchh/austheir.html >. But note that not all of us are as keen on singular ""they"" as Henry is. Asked to fill in the blank in sentences such as ""A patient who doesn't accurately report ___ sexual history to the doctor runs the risk of misdiagnosis"", only 3% of AHD3's usage panel chose ""their"". AHD3's usage note says: ""this solution ignores a persistent intuition that expressions such as _everyone_ and _each student_ should in fact be treated as grammatically singular."" An example from Fowler wittily demonstrates how singular ""they"" never seems to agree perfectly: ""Everyone was blowing their nose""? ""Everyone was blowing their noses""? ""Everyone were blowing their noses""? Proposals for other gender-neutral pronouns get made from time to time, and some can be found in actual use (""sie"" and ""hir"" are the ones most frequently found on Usenet). Cecil Adams, in _Return of the Straight Dope_ (Ballantine, 1994, ISBN 0-345-38111-4), says that some eighty such terms have been proposed, the first of them in the 1850s. John Chao ( chao@hoss.ee.udel.edu ) was constructing a long FAQ on this topic: < http://www.lumina.net/OLD/gfp/ >. Discussions about gender-neutral pronouns tend to go round and round and never reach a conclusion. Please refrain. (We also get disputes about the use of the word ""gender"" in the sense of ""sex"", i.e., of whether a human being is male or female. This also dates from the 14th century. By 1900 it was restricted to jocular use, but it has now been revived because of the ""sexual relations"" sense of ""sex"".) ""God rest you merry, gentlemen"" ------------------------------- First of all, ""God rest you merry, gentlemen"" is correct, not ""God rest you, merry gentlemen."" The verb ""rest"" is used here in the way now most familiar from the phrase ""rest assured"". In earlier English it was used with a variety of other complements: the OED has ""rest thee merry"" from 1400; ""rest you well"" from 1420; ""God rest you merry"", ""rest you fair"", and ""rest you happy"", and ""rest myself content"" from Shakespeare; ""rest thee tranquil"" from Shelley, and ""rest thee sure"" from Tennyson. The nouns ""rest""=""repose"" and ""rest""=""remainder"" are etymologically unconnected: the former is from Germanic (whence German _Ruhe_); the latter is from Old French _rester_ from Latin _restare_ from _re-_=""back"" + _stare_=""stand"". Some dictionaries connect ""rest"" as in ""rest you merry"" with ""rest""=""remainder"" rather than ""rest""=""repose"". So ""God rest you merry"" would mean ""May God keep you (or make you and keep you) merry."" Semantic leakage from ""rest""=""repose"" would explain why we never see uses like ""rest agitated"" or ""rest you sad."" People sometimes wonder whether ""rest you merry"" should be ""rest you merrily"". Rest assuredly that it shouldn't. :-) The song is now widely misunderstood as being addressed to ""merry gentlemen"", first because this use of ""rest"" is now obsolete except in the phrases ""rest assured"" and ""rest easy"", and secondly because the familiar tune supports that stress pattern. A tune ""once ubiquitous in the West Country"" of England and that better supports the stress pattern of ""God rest you merry, gentlemen"" is given in _The Oxford Book of Carols_ (by Percy Darmer et al., Oxford, 1928) and can be heard in _The Carol Album_, conducted by Andrew Parrott (EMI, 1990, 0777-7-49809-2-0). The other dispute about this phrase is whether the pronoun should be ""you"" or ""ye"". In the references to the song retrieved by AltaVista, ""ye"" outnumbers ""you"" by 5 to 1. Traditional grammarians would prefer ""you"", since the pronoun is the object of the verb ""rest"" and hence should be in the accusative. Although there was some historical use of ""ye"" in the accusative (e.g., Thomas Ford's madrigal ""Since first I saw your face I resolved / To honour and renown ye""), in the prestigious English of the King James Version of the Bible, ""ye"" was always nominative and ""you"" was always accusative. (This is counter-mnemonic, since ""thou"" was nominative and ""thee"" was accusative.) The Oxford Book of Carols quotes the words from a broadsheet published circa 1800 as: ""God rest you merry gentlemen"". In _A Christmas Carol_ (1843), Charles Dickens wrote: ""The owner of one scant young nose [...] stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol: but at the first sound of 'God bless you, merry gentleman! May nothing you dismay!' Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action, that the singer fled in terror [...]"". ""hopefully"", ""thankfully"" ------------------------- The traditional, undisputed senses of these words are active: ""in a hopeful manner"", ""in a thankful manner"". The OED's first citation for ""hopefully"" in the passive sense (= ""It is to be hoped that"") is from 1932, but no unmistakable citation has been found between then and 1954. (WDEU has three ambiguous citations dated 1941, 1951, and 1954.) WDEU's first citation for the passive sense of ""thankfully"" (= ""We can be thankful that"") is from 1963. These uses became popular in the early '60s, and have been widely criticized on the grounds that they should have been ""hopably"" and ""thankably"" (on the analogy of ""arguably"", ""predictably"", ""regrettably"", ""inexplicably"", etc.), and on the grounds that ""I hope"" is more direct. The disputed, passive use of ""hopefully"" is often referred to as ""sentence-modifying""; but it can also modify a single word, as is hopefully clear from this example. :-) Most adverbs that can modify sentences -- including ""apparently"", ""clearly"", ""curiously"", ""evidently"", ""fortunately"", ""ironically"", ""mercifully"", ""sadly"", and the ""-ably"" examples above -- can be converted into ""It is apparent that"", etc. But a few adverbs are used in a way that instead must be construed with an ellipsis of ""to speak"" or ""speaking"". These include ""briefly"" (the OED has citations of ""briefly"" used in this way from 1514 on, including one from Shakespeare), ""seriously"" (1644; used by Fowler in his article DIDACTICISM in MEU), ""strictly"" (1680), ""roughly"" (1841), ""frankly"" (1847), ""honestly"" (1898), ""hopefully"", and ""thankfully"". Acquisition of such a use is far from automatic; for example, no one uses ""fearfully"" in a manner analogous to ""hopefully"". AHD3 says: ""It might have been expected that the flurry of objections to _hopefully_ would have subsided once the usage became well established. Instead, increased currency of the usage appears only to have made the critics more adamant. In the 1969 Usage Panel survey the usage was acceptable to 44 percent of the Panel; in the most recent survey [1992] it was acceptable to only 27 percent. [...] Yet the Panel has not shown any signs of becoming generally more conservative: in the very same survey panelists were disposed to accept once-vilified usages such as the employment of _contact_ and _host_ as verbs."" AHD3 quotes William Safire as saying: ""The word 'hopefully' has become the litmus test to determine whether one is a language snob or a language slob."" Discussions about ""hopefully"" and ""thankfully"" go round and round for ever without reaching a conclusion. We advise you to refrain. ""if I was"" vs ""if I were"" ------------------------- See under ""Subjunctive"" below. The following pair of sentences shows the traditional and useful distinction: ""If I was a hopeless cad, I apologize."" ""If I were a hopeless cad, I would never apologize."" ""impact""=""to affect"" -------------------- ""Impact"", which comes from Latin _impactus_, past participle of _impingere_ = ""to push against"", is first recorded in English in 1601 in the form of the past participle, ""impacted"". The verb ""to impact"", meaning ""to press closely into or in something"", dates from 1791. The noun ""impact"" dates from 1781. The (undisputed) expression ""impacted wisdom tooth"" dates from 1876. There is another English verb derived from Latin _impingere_: ""to impinge"", first recorded in 1605. ""To impinge on"" shares with ""to impact"" the sense ""to come sharply in contact with"", and some people consider it stylistically preferable. Unlike ""to impact"", ""to impinge on"" has acquired the figurative sense ""to encroach on"", possibly through confusion with ""to infringe"". This sense is attested from 1758 on. The usage dispute centres on the use of the verb ""to impact (on)"" in the sense ""to affect, to have an effect on, to influence"". The OED's earliest citations where this is clearly the sense are: for ""impact on"", 1951; and for transitive ""impact"", 1963. Opposition to these uses is widespread. 84% of AHD3's Usage Panel disapproved of ""social pathologies [...] that impact heavily on such a community""; and 95% disapproved of ""a potential for impacting our health"". Among the objections to such use of ""impact"" are that it sounds pretentious and bureaucratic, and that it may connote to the reader violence that the author did not intend. The latter objection can apply also to ""impact"" the noun. Kenneth Hudson, in _The Dictionary of Diseased English_ (Macmillan, 1977), noted: ""'Yves St. Laurent's Triangles give even more design impact to your bed' (Washington Star, 17.10.76) is not the happiest of sentences. 'Make a nice bed look even better' would have been more reassuring."" ""It needs cleaned"" ------------------ is not standard English, although ""It needs to be cleaned"", ""It needs cleaning"", and ""I need it cleaned"" all are. ""It needs cleaned"" is common informally in some parts of the U.S., and in Scotland, where it may have originated. ""It's me"" vs ""It is I"" ---------------------- (freely adapted from an article by Roger Lustig) Fowler says: ""_me_ is technically wrong in _It wasn't me_ etc.; but the phrase being of its very nature colloquial, such a lapse is of no importance"". The rule for what he and others consider technically right is *not* (as is commonly misstated) that the nominative should *always* be used after ""to be"". Rather, it is that ""to be"" should link two noun phrases of the same case, whether this be nominative or accusative: I believe that he is I. Who do you believe that he is? I believe him to be me. Whom do you believe him to be? According to the traditional grammar being used here, ""to be"" is not a transitive verb, but a *copulative* verb. When you say that A is B, you don't imply that A, by being B, is doing something to B. (After all, B is also doing it to A.) Other verbs considered copulative are ""to become"", ""to remain"", ""to seem"", and ""to look"". Sometimes in English, though, ""to be"" does seem to have the force of a transitive verb; e.g., in Gelett Burgess's: I never saw a Purple Cow, I never hope to see one; But I can tell you, anyhow, I'd rather see than be one. The occurrence of ""It's me"", etc., is no doubt partly due to this perceived transitive force. In the French _C'est moi_, often cited as analogous, _moi_ is not in the accusative, but a special form known as the ""disjunctive"", used for emphasis. If _etre_ were a transitive verb in French, _C'est moi_ would be _Ce m'est_. In languages such as German and Latin that inflect between the nominative and the accusative, B in ""A is B"" is nominative just like A. In English, no nouns and only a few personal pronouns (""I"", ""we"", ""thou"", ""he"", ""she"", ""they"" and ""who"") inflect between the nominative and the accusative. In other words, we've gotten out of the habit, for the most part. Also, in English we derive meaning from word position, far more than one would in Latin, somewhat more than in German, even. In those languages, one can rearrange sentences drastically for rhetorical or other purposes without confusion (heh) because inflections (endings, etc.) tell you how the words relate to one another. In English, ""The dog ate the cat"" and ""The cat ate the dog"" are utterly different in meaning, and if we wish to have the former meaning with ""cat"" prior to ""dog"" in the sentence, we have to say ""The cat was eaten by the dog"" (change of voice) or ""It is the cat that the dog ate."" In German, one can reverse the meaning by inflecting the word (or its article): _Der Hund frass die Katze_ and _Den Hund frass die Katze_ reverse the meaning of who ate whom. In Latin, things are even more flexible: almost any word order will do: Feles edit canem Feles canem edit Canem edit feles Canem feles edit Edit canem feles Edit feles canem all mean the same, the choice of word order being made perhaps for rhetorical or poetic purpose. English is pretty much the opposite of that: hardly any inflection, great emphasis on order. As a result, things have gotten a little irregular with the personal pronouns. And there's uncertainty as to how to use them; the usual rules aren't there, because the usual word needs no rules, being the same for nominative and accusative. The final factor is the traditional use of Latin grammatical concepts to teach English grammar. This historical quirk dates to the 17th century, and has never quite left us. From this we get the Latin-derived rule, which Fowler still acknowledges. And we *do* follow that rule to some extent: ""Who are they?"" (not ""Who are them?"" or ""Whom are they?"") ""We are they!"" (in response to the preceding) ""It is I who am at fault."" ""That's the man who he is."" But not always. ""It is me"" is attested since the 16th Century. (Speakers who would substitute ""me"" for ""I"" in the ""It is I who am at fault"" example would also sacrifice the agreement of person, and substitute ""is"" for ""am"".) ""less"" vs ""fewer"" ---------------- The rule usually encountered is: use ""fewer"" for things you count (individually), and ""less"" for things you measure: ""fewer apples"", ""less water"". Since ""less"" is also used as an adverb (""less successful""), ""fewer"" helps to distinguish ""fewer successful professionals"" (fewer professionals who are successful) from ""less successful professionals"" (professionals who are less successful). (No such distinction is possible with ""more"", which serves as the antonym of both ""less"" and ""fewer"".) ""Less"" has been used in the sense of ""fewer"" since the time of King Alfred the Great (9th century), and is still common in that sense, especially informally in the U.S.; but in British English it became so rare that the 1st edition of the OED (in a section prepared in 1902) gave no citation more recent than 1579 and gave the usage label ""Now regarded as incorrect."" The 2nd edition of the OED added two 19th-century citations, and changed the usage label to ""Frequently found but generally regarded as incorrect."" Fowler mentioned it only in passing, and cited no real examples. In a section whose main intent was to disparage ""less"" in the sense ""smaller"" or ""lower"", he wrote: ""It is true that _less_ and _lesser_ were once ordinary comparatives of _little_ [...] and that therefore they were roughly equivalent in sense to our _smaller_ [...]. The modern tendency is so to restrict _less_ that it means not _smaller_, but _a smaller amount of_, is the comparative rather of _a little_ than of _little_, and is consequently applied only to things that are measured by amount and not by size or quality or number, nouns with which _much_ and _little_, not _great_ and _small_, nor _high_ and _low_, nor _many_ and _few_, are the appropriate contrasted epithets: _less butter, courage_; but _a smaller army, table_; _a lower price, degree_; _fewer opportunities, people_. Plurals, and singulars with _a_ or _an_, will naturally not take _less_; _less tonnage_, but _fewer ships_; _less manpower_, but _fewer men_ [...]; though a few plurals like _clothes_ and _troops_, really equivalent to singulars of indefinite amount, are exceptions: _could do with less troops_ or _clothes_."" Webster's New International Dictionary, 2nd ed. (1934), gave the usage label ""now incorrect, according to strict usage, except with a collective; as, to wear _less_ clothes."" Of the panelists for The Harper Dictionary of Contemporary Usage (1975), 76% said that they observed ""less""/""fewer"" distinction in speech, and 85% in writing. The editors noted: ""even those panelists who have not observed the distinction in the past now regard it as a useful precept to bear in mind in the future."" Partisans of ""fewer"" use ""one car fewer"" rather than ""one fewer car"", and ""far fewer"" rather than ""much fewer"". ""like"" vs ""as"" -------------- For making comparisons (i.e., asserting that one thing is similar to another), the prescribed choices are: 1. A is like B. 2. A behaves like B. 3. A behaves as B does. 4. A behaves as in an earlier situation. In 1 and 2, ""like"" governs a noun (or a pronoun or a noun phrase). In 3, ""as"" introduces a clause with a noun and a verb. In 4, ""as"" introduces a prepositional phrase. Look at what the word introduces, and you will know which to use. In informal English, ""like"" is often used in place of ""as"" in sentences of type 3 and 4. ""Like"" has been been used in the sense of ""as if"" since the 14th century, and in the sense of ""as"" since the 15th century, but such use was fairly rare until the 19th century, and ""a writer who uses the construction in formal style risks being accused of illiteracy or worse"" (AHD3). ""Like"" in 1 and 2 is a preposition; ""as""/""like"" in 3 or 4 and ""as if"" are conjunctions. Fowler put ""_Like_ as conjunction"" first in his list of ""ILLITERACIES"" (he defined ""illiteracy"" as ""offence against the literary idiom""). In some sentences of type of 3, ""as"" may sound too formal: ""Pronounce it as you spell it."" To avoid both this formality and the stigma of ""like"" here, you may use ""the way"": ""Pronounce it the way you spell it."" But this solution is available only if you are specifying a single way; it doesn't work, for example, in ""Play it as it's never been played before."" (""Play it in a way..."" might work here, but lacks the connotations of enthusiasm and excellence that ""play it as"" has.) The most famous use of ""like"" as a conjunction was in the 1950s slogan for Winston Cigarettes: ""Winston tastes good, like a cigarette should."" The New Yorker wrote that ""it would pain [Sir Winston Churchill] dreadfully"", but in fact conjunctive ""like"" was used by Churchill himself in informal speech: ""We are overrun by them, like the Australians are by rabbits."" ""Like"" in the sense of ""as if"" was, until recently, more often heard in the Southern U.S. than elsewhere, and was perceived by Britons as an Americanism. When used in this sense, it is never now followed by the inflected past subjunctive: people say ""like it is"" or ""like it was"", not ""like it were"". Sometimes, ""as"" introduces a noun phrase with no following verb. When it does, it does not signify a qualitative comparison, but rather may: a) indicate a role being played. ""They fell on the supplies as men starving"" means that they were actually starving men; in ""They fell on the supplies like men starving"", one is *comparing* them to starving men. ""You're acting as a fool"" might be appropriate if you obtained the job of court jester; ""You're acting like a fool"" expresses the more usual meaning. b) introduce examples. (""Some animals, as the fox and the squirrel, have bushy tails."") ""Such as"" and ""like"" are more common in this use. For the use of ""like"" here, see the next entry. c) be short for ""as ... as"": ""He's deaf as a post"" means ""He's as deaf as a post"" (a quantitative comparison). ""like"" vs ""such as"" ------------------- The Little, Brown Handbook (6th ed., HarperCollins, 1995) says: ""Strictly, _such as_ precedes an example that represents a larger subject, whereas _like_ indicates that two subjects are comparable. _Steve has recordings of many great saxophonists such as Ben Webster and Lee Konitz._ _Steve wants to be a great jazz saxophonist like Ben Webster and Lee Konitz._"" Nobody would use ""such as"" in the second sentence; the disputed usage is ""like"" in the first sentence. Opposing it are: earlier editions of The Little, Brown Handbook (which did not use the hedge ""strictly""); the _Random House English Language Desk Reference_ (1995); _The Globe and Mail Style Book_ (Penguin, 1995); _Webster's Dictionary & Thesaurus_ (Shooting Star Press, 1995); _Fine Print: Reflections on the Writing Art_ by James Kilpatrick (Andrews and McMeel, 1993); _The Wordwatcher's Guide to Good Writing and Grammar_ by Morton S. Freeman (Writer's Digest, 1990); _Word Perfect: A Dictionary of Current English Usage_ by John O. E. Clark (Harrap, 1987); and _Keeping Up the Style_ by Leslie Sellers (Pitman, 1975). The OED, first edition, in its entry on ""like"" (which is in a section prepared in 1903), said that ""in modern use"", ""like"" ""often = 'such as', introducing a particular example of a class respecting which something is predicated"". Merriam-Webster Editorial Department unearthed the following 19th-century citations for me: ""Good sense, like hers, will always act when really called upon"", Jane Austen, _Mansfield Park_, 1814; ""A straight-forward, open-hearted man, like Weston, and a rational unaffected woman, like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to their own concerns"", Jane Austen, _Emma_, 1816; ""[...] to argue that because a well-stocked island, like Great Britain, has not, as far as is known [...]"", Charles Darwin, _Origin of the Species_, 1859. Fowler apparently saw nothing wrong with ""like"" in this sense: in the Concise Oxford Dictionary, he gave ""resembling, such as"" without a usage label as one its meanings, and gave the example ""a critic like you"", which he explained as ""of the class that you exemplify"". And he used it himself in the passage quoted under ""'less' vs 'fewer'"" above. More commonly, though, he wrote ""such ... as"" when using examples to define the set (""such bower-birds' treasures as _au pied de la lettre_, _a` merveille_, [...] and _sauter aux yeux_""), and ""as"" or ""such as"" when the words preceding the examples sufficed to define the set (""familiar words in -o, as _halo_ and _dado_""; ""simple narrative poems in short stanzas, such as _Chevy Chase_""). This is the same restrictive vs nonrestrictive mentioned under ""'that' vs 'which'"": ""Ballads, such as Chevy Chase, can be danced to"" would imply that all ballads can be danced to, whereas ""Such ballads as Chevy Chase can be danced to"" would not. ""Such ... as"" is now confined to formal use, and for informal restrictive uses where the example is not introduced merely for the sake of example, but is the actual topic of the sentence, ""like"" is now obligatory: ""I'm so glad to have a friend like Paul."" _Guide to Canadian English Usage_ by Margery Fee and Janice McAlpine (Oxford, 1997, ISBN 0-19-540841-1) rightly points out that ""such as"" would not be idiomatic here. _Modern American Usage_ by Wilson Follett (Hill and Wang, 1966) says: ""_Such as_ is close in meaning to _like_ and may often be interchanged with it. The shade of difference between them is that _such as_ leads the mind to imagine an indefinite group of objects [...]. The other comparing word _like_ suggests a closer resemblance among the things compared [...]. [...P]urists object to phrases of the type _a writer like Shakespeare_, _a leader like Lincoln_. No writer, say these critics, _is_ like Shakespeare; and in this they are wrong; writers are alike in many things and the context usually makes clear what the comparison proposes to our attention. _Such as Shakespeare_ may sound less impertinent, but if Shakespeare were totally incomparable _such as_ would be open to the same objection as _like_."" Bernstein, in _Miss Thistlebottom's Hobgoblins_ (Farrar, 1971), agrees, calling those who object to ""German composers like Beethoven"" ""nit-pickers"". ""more/most/very unique"" ----------------------- Fowler and other conservatives urge restricting the meaning of ""unique"" to ""having no like or equal"". (OED says ""in this sense, readopted from French at the end of the 18th Century and regarded as a foreign word down to the middle of the 19th."") Used in this sense, it is an incomparable: either something is ""unique"" or it isn't, and there can be no degrees of uniqueness. Those who use phrases like ""more unique"", ""most unique"", and ""very unique"" are using ""unique"" in the weaker sense of ""unusual, distinctive"". ""mouses"" vs ""mice"" ------------------ _Wired Style: Principles of English Usage in the Digital Age_ (ed. Constance Hale, HardWired, 1996, ISBN 1-888869-01-1) says: ""What's the plural of that small, rolling pointing device invented by Douglas Engelbart in 1964? We prefer ~mouses~. ~Mice~ is just too suggestive of furry little creatures. But both terms are common, so take your pick. We actually emailed Engelbart to see what he'd say. His answer? 'Haven't given the matter much thought.' ""In fact, Engelbart shared credit for the name with 'a small group in my lab at SRI.' Nobody among his colleagues seems to remember who first nicknamed the device, but all agree that the name was given because the cord ('tail') initially came out the 'back' of the device. 'Very soon we realised that the connecting wire should be brought out the ""front"" instead of the back,' Engelbart notes, but by then the name had stuck."" _The Microsoft(R) Manual of Style for Technical Publications_ (ed. Amanda Clark, Microsoft Press, 1995, ISBN 1-55615-939-0) says: ""Avoid using the plural _mice_; if you need to refer to more than one mouse, use _mouse devices_."" Markus Laker reports from the U.K.: ""In the early eighties, a few people did selfconsciously say 'mouses', but the traditional plural 'mice' gained ground rapidly and is now more or less universal here."" ""near miss"" ----------- A near miss is a near-hit. ""none is"" vs ""none are"" ----------------------- With mass nouns, you have to use the singular. (""None of the wheat is..."") With count nouns, you can use either the singular or the plural. (""None of the books is..."" or ""None of the books are..."") Usually, the plural sounds more natural, unless you're trying to emphasize the idea of ""not one"", or if the words that follow work better in the singular. The fullest (prescriptive) treatment is in Eric Partridge's book _Usage and Abusage_ (Penguin, 1970, 0-14-051024-9). In the original edition Partridge had prescribed the singular in certain cases, but a rather long-winded letter from a correspondent persuaded him to retract. Plurals of Latin/Greek words ---------------------------- Not all Latin words ending in ""-us"" had plurals in ""-i"". ""Apparatus"", ""cantus"", ""coitus"", ""hiatus"", ""impetus"", ""Jesus"", ""lapsus linguae"", ""nexus"", ""plexus"", ""prospectus"", ""sinus"", and ""status"" were 4th declension in Latin, and had plurals in ""-us"" with ""genus"", and ""opus"" were 3rd declension, with plurals ""corpora"", ""genera"", and ""opera"". ""Virus"" is not attested in the plural in Latin, and is of a rare form (2nd declension neuter in -us) that makes it debatable what the Latin plural would have been; the only plural in English is ""viruses"". ""Omnibus"" and ""rebus"" were not nominative nouns in Latin. ""Ignoramus"" was not a noun in Latin. Not all classical words ending in ""-a"" had plurals in ""-ae"". ""Anathema"", ""aroma"", ""bema"", ""carcinoma"", ""charisma"", ""diploma"", ""dogma"", ""drama"", ""edema"", ""enema"", ""enigma"", ""lemma"", ""lymphoma"", ""magma"", ""melisma"", ""miasma"", ""sarcoma"", ""schema"", ""soma"", ""stigma"", ""stoma"", and ""trauma"" are from Greek, where they had plurals in ""-ata"". ""Quota"" was not a noun in Latin. (It comes from the Latin expression _quota pars_, where _quota_ is the feminine form of an interrogative pronoun meaning ""what number"". In *that* use, it did have plural _quotae_, but in English the only plural is ""quotas"".) Not all classical-sounding words ending in ""-um"" have plurals in ""-a"". ""Factotum"", ""nostrum"", ""quorum"", and ""variorum"" were not nouns in Latin. (_Totus_ = ""everything"" and _noster_ = ""our"" were conjugated like nouns in Latin; but ""factotum"" comes from _fac totum_ = ""do everything"", and ""nostrum"" comes from _nostrum remedium_ = ""our remedy"".) ""Conundrum"", ""panjandrum"", ""tantrum"", and ""vellum"" are not Latin words. If in doubt, consult a dictionary (or use the English plural in ""-s"" or ""-es""). One plural that you *will* find in U.S. dictionaries, ""octopi"", raises the ire of purists (the Greek plural is ""octopodes""). The classical-style plurals of ""penis"" and ""clitoris"" are ""penes"" /'pi:ni:z/ and ""clitorides"" /klI'tOrIdi:z/. The Latin plural of ""curriculum vitae"" is ""curricula vitae"". Some people who know a little Latin think it should be ""curricula vitarum"" (since _vitae_ means ""of a life"" and _vitarum_ means ""of lives""); but to an ancient Roman, ""curricula vitarum"" would suggest that each document described more than one life. This is a feature of the Latin genitive of content, which differs in this regard from the more common Latin genitive of possession. Foreign plurals => English singulars ------------------------------------ Some uses of classical plurals as singulars in English are undisputed: ""opera"", ""stamina"", ""aspidistra"". (""Opera"", still used as the plural of ""opus"", became singular in Vulgar Latin, and then in Italian acquired the sense ""musical drama"", giving rise to the English word.) ""Agenda"" once excited controversy but is now accepted. Others are the subject of current controversy: ""data"" (used by Winston Churchill!), ""erotica"", ""insignia"", ""media"", ""regalia"", ""trivia"". Yet others are still widely stigmatized: ""bacteria"", ""candelabra"", ""criteria"", ""curricula"", ""memorabilia"", ""phenomena"", ""strata"". ""Bona fides"", ""kudos"", and ""minutia"" are singulars in Latin or Greek. ""Graffiti"" (plural in Italian) is disputed in English. But ""zucchini"" (also plural in Italian) is the invariable singular form in English (the English plural is ""zucchini"" or ""zucchinis""). ""Biscotti"" seems to be going the same way. The names of types of pasta (cannelloni, cappelletti, ditali, fusilli, gnocchi, maccheroni, manicotti, ravioli, rigatoni, spaghetti, spaghettini, taglierini, tortellini, vermicelli, ziti, which are masculine plural in Italian; and conchiglie, farfalle, fettuccine, linguine, rotelle, which are feminine plural; some of the -e words are often spelled with -i in English; _maccheroni_ is ""macaroni"" in English) are treated as mass nouns in English: they take singular verbs, but plurals are not made from them. (Many of the words listed as disputed above are also treated as mass nouns when they are used as singulars.) Preposition at end ------------------ Yes, yes, we've all heard the following anecdotes: (1) Winston Churchill was editing a proof of one of his books, when he noticed that an editor had clumsily rearranged one of Churchill's sentences so that it wouldn't end with a preposition. Churchill scribbled in the margin, ""This is the sort of English up with which I will not put."" (This is often quoted with ""arrant nonsense"" substituted for ""English"", or with other variations. The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations cites Sir Ernest Gowers' _Plain Words_ (1948), where the anecdote begins, ""It is said that Churchill...""; so we don't know exactly what Churchill wrote. According to the Oxford Companion to the English Language, Churchill's words were ""bloody nonsense"" and the variants are euphemisms.) (2) The Guinness Book of (World) Records used to have a category for ""most prepositions at end"". The incumbent record was a sentence put into the mouth of a boy who didn't want to be read excerpts from a book about Australia as a bedtime story: ""What did you bring that book that I don't want to be read to from out of about 'Down Under' up for?"" Mark Brader ( msb@sq.com -- all this is to the best of his recollection; he didn't save the letter, and doesn't have access to the British editions) wrote to Guinness, asking: ""What did you say that the sentence with the most prepositions at the end was 'What did you bring that book that I don't want to be read to from out of about ""Down Under"" up for?' for? The preceding sentence has one more."" Norris McWhirter replied, promising to include this improvement in the next British edition; but actually it seems that Guinness, no doubt eventually realising that this could be done recursively, dropped the category. (3) ""Excuse me, where is the library at?"" ""Here at Hahvahd, we never end a sentence with a preposition."" ""O.K. Excuse me, where is the library at, *asshole*?"" Fowler and nearly every other respected prescriptivist see NOTHING wrong with ending a clause with a preposition; Fowler calls it a ""superstition"". (""Never end a sentence with a preposition"" is how the superstition is usually stated, although it would ""naturally"" extend to any placement of a preposition later than the noun or pronoun it governs.) Indeed, Fowler considers ""a good land to live in"" grammatically superior to ""a good land in which to live"", since one cannot say *""a good land which to inhabit"". ""quality"" --------- The attributive use of ""quality"", as in ""quality workmanship"", is sometimes questioned. The alternative that nobody will object to is ""high-quality"" (for which OED's first citation is from 1910). OED's first citation of ""quality"" in the sense ""high quality, excellence"" is from Shakespeare (1606): ""The Grecian youths are full of qualitie, Their loving well composed, with guift of nature."" (Troilus and Cressida, IV iv). It seems to have been in steady use since then. The proverb ""Quality is better than quantity"" is first recorded in 1604 in the form ""The gravest wits [...] The qualitie, not quantitie, respect."" The attributive use of ""quality"" is another matter. OED has a citation of ""quality air"" from 1701; but there is only scattered evidence between then and the following note in _A Manual for Writers_, by John Matthews Manly and John Arthur Powell (University of Chicago Press, 2nd ed., 1915): ""~Quality~ is grossly misused as an adjective; fortunately the misuse is confined almost entirely to advertisements, where all sorts of violence are done to the language: 'Quality clothes! Built (!) from the most exclusive (!) designs.'"" The next dictionary evidence after the OED's citation is the listing in Webster's New International Dictionary, 2nd ed. (1934), which labels it ""colloquial, chiefly U.S."". Chamber's Twentieth Century Dictionary, 1959 edition, calls it ""vulgar"". Modern dictionaries do not give it a usage label. It is attacked by Morton S. Freeman (_A Handbook of Problem Words and Phrases_, ISI, 1987) and by James Kilpatrick (_Fine Print: Reflections on the Writing Art_, Andrews and McMeel, 1993), and prohibited by _The Globe and Mail Style Book_ (Penguin, 1995). It is defended by Theodore Bernstein (_Dos, Don'ts, and Maybes of English Usage_, Barnes & Noble, 1977). _Bloomsbury Good Word Guide_ (Bloomsbury, 1988) and _Harper Dictionary of Contemporary Usage_ (Harper & Row, 1975 & 1985) note that some people object to it. The term ""quality time"", meaning ""time spent in social interaction with another person, especially one's young child"", dates from 1980. It is widely derided as faddish. ""High-quality time"" is not used. In England, up-market, broadsheet newspapers have been called ""the quality papers"" since 1961. Other words that have acquired similarly specialized meanings are: ""fortune"" meaning ""good fortune"" (dates from 1390, and had precedent in Latin); ""luck"" meaning ""good luck"" (1480); ""behave"" meaning ""to behave properly"" (1691); ""criticize"" meaning ""to criticize unfavourably"" (1704); ""temper"" meaning ""ill-temper, short temper"" (1828); ""class"" meaning ""high class, elegance"" (1874; informal; originally a sports term; the term ""class act"" dates from 1976); ""temperature"" meaning ""feverish temperature"" (1898; informal; an ironic development, since ""temperature"" once meant to be in temper, to be free from the distemper that fever indicates); and ""attitude"" meaning ""hostile attitude"" (1962; U.S. informal; probably from such phrases as ""You'd better change your attitude"" and ""I don't like your attitude""). Context usually indicates the specialized meaning, e.g., in ""He has a temper""; one would have no occasion to want to say, ""He has a temper, but I'm not going to tell you whether it's long or short or anything else about it."" Repeated words after abbreviations ---------------------------------- Disputes occur about the legitimacy of placing after an acronym/ initialism the last word that is abbreviated in it, e.g., ""AC current"", ""the HIV virus"". ""AC"" and ""HIV"" by themselves will certainly suffice in most contexts. But such collocations tend to become regarded as irreducible and uninterpretable words. ""The SNOBOL language"" and ""BASIC code"" are as good as ""the BASIC language"" and ""SNOBOL code""; and why should ""an LED display"" (Light Emitting Diode display) be reasonable, but not ""an LCD display"" (Liquid Crystal Display display)? The extra word may guard against ambiguity; e.g., ""I've forgotten my PIN"" might be mistaken in speech as being about sewing, whereas ""I've forgotten my PIN number"" identifies the context as ATMs. It cannot be denied, though, that many such repetitions stem from ignorance. The more familiar someone is with computer memory, the less likely he is to say ""ROM memory"" or ""RAM memory"". ""Scotch"" -------- Scots' preferred adjective for Scotland and for themselves is ""Scots"". ""Scottish"" is also acceptable. But ""Scotch"" (although used by Robert Burns and Sir Walter Scott, and still used by some Americans of Scots descent) is now considered offensive by many Scots. Certain Scots hold that only three things can be ""Scotch"": ""Scotch whisky"", ""Scotch egg"", and ""Scotch mist"". They are not interested in considering additions to this list, although many other terms containing ""Scotch"" can be found in dictionaries. The term ""Scotch tape"" (a trademark for clear sticky tape made by the 3M company, based in Minnesota) was originally a reference to the stereotype of Scots miserliness. 3M at one time made a tape with no adhesive along the middle. The tape was intended as a masking tape for painting cars (masking off areas that you didn't want to paint), so 3M thought it didn't need a full sticky coating; but customers were not impressed. ""shall"" vs ""will"", ""should"" vs ""would"" -------------------------------------- The traditional rules for using these (based on the usage of educated Southern Englishmen in the 18th and 19th centuries) are quite intricate, and require some choices (""Should you like to see London?""; ""The doctor thought I should die"") that are no longer idiomatically reasonable. But if you're dead set on learning them, you can access the relevant section of _The King's English_ at < http://www.columbia.edu/acis/bartleby/fowler/213.html >. Usage outside England has always been different, although the historical prevalence of ""shall"" in the U.S. is sometimes underestimated: Benjamin Franklin said, ""We must all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately""; and the Shaker hymn ""Simple Gifts"" has ""To bow and to bend we shan't be ashamed."" The old joke, where the Irishman cries for help: ""I will drown and no one shall save me"" and the Englishman mistakes this for a suicide resolution, is contrived, in that an Irishman would far more likely say ""no one will save me."" split infinitive ---------------- Sir Ernest Gowers wrote in _The Complete Plain Words_ (HMSO, 1954): ""The well-known [...] rule against splitting an infinitive means that nothing must come between 'to' and the infinitive. It is a bad name, as was pointed out by Jespersen [...] 'because we have many infinitives without _to_, as ""I made him go"". _To_ therefore is no more an essential part of the infinitive than the definite article is an essential part of a substantive, and no one would think of calling _the good man_ a split substantive.' It is a bad rule too; it increases the difficulty of writing clearly [...]."" The split infinitive construction goes back to the 13th century, but was relatively rare until the 19th. No split infinitives are to be found in the works of Shakespeare, Spenser, Pope, or Dryden, or in the King James Version of the Bible. Fowler wrote (in the article POSITION OF ADVERBS, in MEU) that ""to"" + infinitive is ""a definitely enough recognized verb-form to make the clinging together of its parts the natural and normal thing""; ""there is, however, no sacrosanctity about that arrangement"". There are many considerations that should govern placement of adverbs: there are other sentence elements, he said, such as the verb and its object, that have a *stronger* affinity for each other; but only avoidance of the split infinitive ""has become a fetish"". Thus, although in ""I quickly hid it"", the most natural place for ""quickly"" is before ""hid"", ""I am going to hide it quickly"" is slightly more natural than ""I am going to quickly hide it"". But ""I am going to quickly hide it"" is itself preferable to ""I am going quickly to hide it"" (splitting ""going to"" changes the meaning from indicating futurity to meaning physically moving somewhere), or to ""I am going to hide quickly it"" (separation of the verb from its object). And even separating the verb from its object may become the preferred place for the adverb if ""it"" is replaced by a long noun phrase (""I am going to hide quickly any trace of our ever having been here""). Phrases consisting of ""to be"" or ""to have"" followed by an adverb and a participle are *not* split infinitives, and constitute the natural word order. ""To generally be accepted"" and ""to always have thought"" are split infinitives; ""to be generally accepted"" and ""to have always thought"" are not. Certain kinds of adverbs are characteristically placed before ""to"". These include negative and restrictive adverbs: ""not"" (""To be, or not to be""), ""never"", ""hardly"", ""scarcely"", ""merely"", ""just""; and conjunctive adverbs: ""rather"", ""preferably"", ""moreover"", ""alternatively"". But placing adverbs of manner in this position is now considered good style only in legal English (""It is his duty faithfully to execute the provisions...""). Clumsy avoidance of split infinitives often leads to ambiguity: does ""You fail completely to recognise"" mean ""You completely fail to recognise"", or ""You fail to completely recognise""? Ambiguous split infinitives are much rarer, but do exist: does ""to further cement trade relations"" mean ""to cement trade relations further"", or ""to promote relations with the cement trade""? The most frequently cited split infinitive is from the opening voice-over of _Star Trek_: ""to boldly go where no man has gone before"". (_Star Trek: The Next Generation_ had ""one"" in place of ""man"".) Here, ""boldly"" modifies the entire verb phrase: the meaning is ""to have the boldness that the unprecedentedness of the destinations requires"". If ""boldly"" were placed after ""go"", it would modify only ""go"", changing the meaning to ""to go where no man has gone before, and by the way, to go there boldly"". Hardly any serious commentator believes that infinitives should never be split. The dispute is between those who believe that split infinitives should be avoided when this can be done with no sacrifice of clarity or naturalness, and those who believe that no effort whatever should be made to avoid them. ""that"" vs ""which"" ----------------- In ""The family that prays together stays together"", the clause ""that prays together"" is called a RESTRICTIVE CLAUSE because it restricts the main statement to a limited class of family. In ""The family, which is the basic unit of human society, is weakening"", ""which ... society"" is called a NONRESTRICTIVE CLAUSE because it makes an additional assertion about the family without restricting the main statement. It is generally agreed that nonrestrictive clauses should be set off by commas; restrictive clauses, not. Nonrestrictive clauses are now nearly always introduced by ""which"" or ""who"" (although ""that"" was common in earlier centuries). Fowler encourages us to introduce restrictive clauses with ""that""; but this is not a binding rule (although some copy-editors do go on ""which hunts""), and indeed is not possible if a preposition is to precede the relative pronoun. ""Which"" seem to have more ""weight"" than ""that""; the weight often just adds starch, but it can be of use when the relative pronoun is separated from the antecedent: ""This is the only book in my personal library which I haven't read."" Often, too, euphony favours one or the other. Object relative pronouns can be omitted altogether (""the book that I read"" or ""the book I read""); in standard English, subject relative pronouns cannot be omitted, although in some varieties of informal spoken English, they are (""There's a man came into the office the other day""). Robert Sigley ( Robert.Sigley@vuw.ac.nz ) is writing a Ph.D. thesis on relative pronoun choice. ""that kind of a thing"" ---------------------- The forms you're likely to encounter, in roughly decreasing order of formality, are ""that kind of thing"", ""those kinds of things"", ""those kind of things"", and ""that kind of a thing"". Sir Ernest Gowers wrote: ""it is as well to humour the purists by writing _things of that kind_."" the the ""hoi polloi"" debate --------------------------- Yes, ""hoi"" means ""the"" in Greek, but the first 5 citations in the OED, and the most famous use of this phrase in English (in Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta _Iolanthe_), put ""the"" in front of ""hoi"". This is not a unique case: words like ""alchemy"", ""alcohol"", ""algebra"", ""alligator"", and ""lacrosse"" incorporate articles from other languages, but can still be prefixed in English with ""the"". ""The El Alamein battle"" (which occurred in Egypt during World War II), sometimes proffered as a phrase with three articles, actually contains only two: _alamein_ is Arabic for ""two flags"" (which is appropriate for a town on the border between Egypt and Libya), and does not contain the Arabic article _al_. ""true fact"" ----------- Many phrases often criticized as ""redundant"" are redundant in most contexts, but not in all. ""Small in size"" is redundant in most contexts, but not in ""Although small in size, the ship was large in glory."" ""Consensus of opinion"" is redundant in most contexts, but not in ""Some of the committee members were coerced into voting in favour of the motion, so although the motion represents a consensus of votes, it does not represent a consensus of opinion."" Context can negate part of the definition of a word. ""Artificial light"" is light that is artificial (= ""man-made""), but ""artificial flowers"" are not flowers (i.e., genuine spermatophyte reproductive orders) that are artificial. In the latter phrase, ""artificial"" negates part of the definition of ""flower"". The bats known as ""false vampires"" do not feed on blood: ""false"" negates part of the definition of ""vampire"". The ordinary definition of ""fact"" includes the idea of ""true"" (e.g., fact vs fiction); the meaning of ""fact"" does have other aspects (e.g., fact vs opinion). Context can negate the idea of ""true"". Fowler himself used the phrase ""Fowler's facts are wrong; therefore his advice is probably wrong, too"" (a conclusion that he was eager to avert, moving him to defend his facts) in one of the S.P.E. tracts. It follows that ""true fact"" need not be a redundancy. ""try and"", ""be sure and"", ""go"" + verb ------------------------------------- These colloquial constructions are synonymous, or nearly so, with ""try to"", ""be sure to"", and ""go and"" respectively, those equivalents being undisputedly acceptable in both formal and informal style. They are syntactic curiosities in that they can only be used in conjugations identical to the infinitive: we can say ""to try and do it"", ""try and do it"" (imperative), ""I'll try and do it"", ""if I try and do it"", and ""he did try and make the best of it"", but not ""if he tries and does it"" or ""he tried and did it"" with the same sense. Some commentators maintain that there is no semantic difference whatever between ""try and"" and ""try to""; certainly in many contexts they are interchangeable: ""I will try to/and attend the party tonight."" But in other contexts ""try and"" seems to imply success: ""Do try and behave"" suggests that the only reason the listener is not behaving is that he is not trying to. Then there are the ironic contexts where ""try and"" implies failure: ""Try and make me move."" Here, ""try to"" would not be idiomatic. WDEU suggests that ""try and"" may actually be older than ""try to""; both are first attested in the 17th century. ""Go"" + bare infinitive was used by Shakespeare (""I'll go see if the bear be gone""; ""I'll go buy spices for our sheep-shearing"") but is now nearly confined to informal American usage, and elsewhere to a few fixed expressions (""hide and go seek"", ""He can go hang for all I care""). Most handbooks disapprove of these expressions in formal style; even the permissive WDEU admits of ""try and"" that ""most of the examples are not from highly formal styles"". Fowler wrote, ""It is an idiom that should not be discountenanced, but used when it comes natural""; but he also wrote that it is ""almost confined to exhortations and promises"", and these are more common in informal than in formal contexts. ""whom"" ------ In informal English, one can probably get away with using ""who"" all the time, except perhaps after a preposition. The prescription for formal English is: use ""who"" as the subjective form (like ""he""/""she""/ ""they""), and ""whom"" as a direct or indirect object (like ""him""/ ""her""/""them""): He gave it to me. Who gave it to me? That's the man who gave it to me. I gave it to him. Whom did I give it to? That's the man whom I gave it to. I gave him a book. Whom did I give a book? That's the man whom I gave a book. (The construction in the last two sentences is rare. Usually a preposition, in this case ""to"", is used when the indirect object is separated from the direct object.) Note the difference between: I believe (that) he is drowned. Who do I believe is drowned? That is the man who I believe is drowned. and: I believe him to be drowned. Whom do I believe to be drowned? That is the man whom I believe to be drowned. Note also, that unless you say ""It is he"", you cannot rely on these transformations for complements of the verb ""to be"". You may say ""It's him"", but the question is ""Who is it?"", definitely not ""Whom is it?"" The case of ""whoever"" is determined by its function in the dependent clause that it introduces, not by its function in the main clause: ""I like whoever likes me."" ""Whomever I like likes me."" Very few English-speakers make these distinctions instinctively; most of those who observe them learned them explicitly. Instincts would lead them to select case based on word order rather than on syntactic function. Hence Shakespeare wrote ""Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drowned"". But Fowler called this a solecism in modern English; it might be better to abstain from ""whom"" altogether if one is not willing to master the prescriptive rules. ""you saying"" vs ""your saying"" ----------------------------- In ""You saying you're sorry alters the case"", the subject of ""alters"" is not ""you"", since the verb is singular. Fowler called this construction the ""fused participle"", and recommended ""Your saying..."" instead. The fused participle *can* lead to ambiguity: in _Woe is I_ (Grosset/Putnam, 1996, ISBN 0-399-14196-0), Patricia T. O'Conner contrasts the sentences ""Basil dislikes that woman's wearing shorts"" and ""Basil dislikes that woman wearing shorts"": ""Both are correct, but they mean different things. In the first example, Basil dislikes shorts on the woman. In the second, he dislikes the woman herself. The lesson? Lighten up, Basil!"" Other commentators have been less critical of the fused participle than Fowler. Jespersen traced the construction as the last in a series of developments where gerunds, which originally functioned strictly as nouns, have taken on more and more verb-like properties (""the showing of mercy"" => ""showing of mercy"" => ""showing mercy""). Partridge defends the construction by citing lexical noun-plus-gerund compounds. In most of these (e.g., ""time-sharing""), the noun functions as the object of the gerund, but in some recent compounds (e.g., ""machine learning""), it functions as the subject. ==================================================================== PUNCTUATION ----------- ""."" after abbreviations ----------------------- Fowler recommends putting a ""."" only after abbreviations that do not include the last letter of the word they're abbreviating, e.g., ""Capt."" for captain but ""Cpl"" for corporal. In some English- speaking countries, many people follow this rule, but not in the U.S., where ""Mr."" and ""Dr."" prevail. spaces between sentences ------------------------ This issue is more suited to comp.fonts than here. In recent years, printers typesetting with proportional fonts have generally *not* made the inter-sentence space any greater than the inter-word space, although greater inter-sentence space can be found quite often in older books. Traditionally, students in typing classes have been taught to put two spaces between sentences. Some people never like the extra space, some always do, and some like it if the text is monospaced but not if it is proportionally spaced. The traditional UNIX text formatter, troff, uses extra space; in TeX it is optional, but turned on by default. The extra space, if used, need not be as much as the normal interword space (it can be less in TeX, but not in troff). Advocates of the extra space argue that the practice speeds reading by making it easier to pick out sentences. And sometimes it can aid clarity. A passage such as: | ""What's pluperfect?"" is a reasonably reasonable question that has | yet to be sweetly but fully answered on a.u.e. I answer the | questions about Erzherzoginen (Habsburg archduchesses). is far from clear on first reading. "", vs ,"" -------- According to William F. Phillips ( wfp@world.std.com ), in the days when printing used raised bits of metal, ""."" and "","" were the most delicate, and were in danger of damage (the face of the piece of type might break off from the body, or be bent or dented from above) if they had a '""' on one side and a blank space on the other. Hence the convention arose of always using '.""' and ',""' rather than '"".' and '"",', regardless of logic. Fowler was a strong advocate of logical placement of punctuation marks, i.e. only placing them inside the quotation marks if they were part of the quoted matter. This scheme has gained ground, and is especially popular among computer users, and others who wish to make clear exactly what is and what is not being quoted. Logical placement is accepted by many more publishers outside than inside the U.S. Some people insist that '.""' and ',""' LOOK better, but Fowler calls them ""really mere conservatives, masquerading only as aesthetes"". ""A, B and C"" vs ""A, B, and C"" ----------------------------- This is known as the ""serial comma"" dispute. Both styles are common. The second style was recommended by Fowler, and is Oxford University Press house style (hence it is also called ""the Oxford comma""; it is also known as ""the Harvard comma""); it is more common in the U.S. than elsewhere. Although either style may cause ambiguity (in ""We considered Miss Roberts for the roles of Marjorie, David's mother, and Louise"", are there two roles or three?), the style that omits the comma is more likely to do so: ""Tom, Peter, and I went swimming."" (Without the comma, one might think that the sentence was addressed to Tom.) ""I ordered sandwiches today. I ordered turkey, salami, peanut butter and jelly, and roast beef."" Without that last comma, one would have a MIGHTY weird sandwich! -- Gabe Wiener. James Pierce reports that an author whose custom it was to omit the comma dedicated a novel: ""To my parents, Ayn Rand and God."" ==================================================================== FOREIGNERS' FAQS ---------------- Non-native speakers are often unnecessarily cautious in their use of English. Someone once posted to alt.usage.english from Japan, asking, ""What is the correct thing to say if one is being assaulted: 'Help!' or 'Help me!'?"" Not only are they both correct; there was a whole slew of responses asking, ""Why the heck would you worry about correctness at a time like that?"" It may happen that your post's greatest departure from English idiom is something unrelated to what you are asking about. If you like, say ""Please correct any errors in this post""; otherwise, those who answer you may out of politeness refrain from offering a correction. Although not so stratified as some languages, English does have different stylistic levels. In a popular song, you may hear: ""It don't make much difference."" When speaking to a friend, you will probably want to say: ""It doesn't make much difference."" If you are writing a formal report, you may want to render it as: ""It makes little difference."" So it's helpful if when posting, you specify the stylistic level that you're enquiring about.

Roger Depledge writes: ""since you rightly show some concern for the non-native speaker, you might care to consider adding to your list of dictionaries the _Collins Cobuild English Dictionary_ (HarperCollins, 2nd ed., 1995, ISBN 0-00-379401-8), all of whose plentiful examples come from their 200-million-word corpus. As a freelance translator in Toulouse, I find it invaluable when my native ear for English fails me. And for usage for the non- specialist, I know of none better than Michael Swan, _Practical English Usage_ (OUP, 2nd ed., 1995, ISBN 0-19-431197-X). In its favour I would cite the 26 reprints of the 1980 edition, and the six pages on taboo words, including the priceless example, 'Bugger me! There's Mrs Smith. I thought she was on holiday.'"" Anno Siegel recommends _The BBI Combinatory Dictionary of English_, by Morton Benson, Evelyn Benson, and Robert Ilson, Benjamins, 1986, ISBN 90-272-2036-0. ""a""/""an"" before abbreviations ----------------------------- ""A"" is used before words beginning with consonants; ""an"", before words beginning with vowels. This is determined by sound, not spelling (""a history"", ""an hour"", ""a unit"", ""a European"", ""a one""). Formerly, ""an"" was usual before unaccented syllables beginning with ""h"" (""an historian"", ""an hotel""); these are ""now obsolescent"" in British English (Collins English Dictionary), although ""an historian"" is retained in more dialects than ""an hotel"". Before abbreviations, the choice of ""a""/""an"" depends on how the abbreviation is pronounced: ""a NATO spokesman"" (because ""NATO"" is pronounced /'neItoU/); ""an NBC spokesman"" (because ""NBC"" is pronounced /Enbi:'si:/) ""a NY spokesman"" (because ""NY"" is read as ""New York (state)""). A problem: how can a foreigner *tell* whether a particular abbreviation is pronounced as a word or not? Two non-foolproof guidelines: (1) It's more likely to be an acronym if it *looks* as if it could be an English word. ""NATO"" and ""scuba"" do; ""UCLA"" and ""NAACP"" don't. (2) It's more likely to be an acronym if it's a *long* sequence of letters. ""US"" is short; ""EBCDIC"" is too bloody long to say as ""E-B-C-D-I-C"". (But of course, abbreviations that can be broken down into groups, like ""TCP/IP"" and ""AFL-CIO"", are spelled out because the groups are short enough.) Is it ""a FAQ"" or ""an FAQ""? These days, probably the former, although some of us do say ""an F-A-Q"". ""A number of..."" ---------------- ""A number of ..."" usually requires a plural verb. In ""A number of employees were present"", it's the employees who were present, not the number. ""A number of"" is just a fuzzy quantifier. (""A number of..."" may need a singular in the much rarer contexts where it does not function as a quantifier: ""A number of this magnitude requires 5 bytes to store."") On the other hand, ""the number of..."" always takes the singular: ""The number of employees who were present was small."" Here, it's the number that was small, not the employees. When to use ""the"" ----------------- This is often quite tricky for those learning English. The basic rules can be found in the Purdue University Online Writing Lab's WWW page titled ""The Use and Non-Use of Articles"": < http://owl.english.purdue.edu/Files/25.html > (very brief), and in ""An Overview of English Article Usage for Speakers of English as a Second Language"" by John R. Kohl of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute: < http://www.rpi.edu/dept/llc/writecenter/web/text/esl.html > (As explained in the document ""Accessing the Internet by E-Mail FAQ"" posted to alt.internet.services , you can obtain textual WWW pages by e-mail. Send e-mail to "" agora@dna.affrc.go.jp "" with, in this case, ""send http://www.rpi.edu/dept/llc/writecenter/web/text/esl.html "" as the message body.) The book _Three Little Words; A, An and The: a Foreign Student's Guide to English_ by Elizabeth Claire (Delta, 1988, ISBN 0-937354-46-5) has been recommended. The article ""the"" before a noun generally indicates one specific instance of the object named. For example, ""I went to the school"" refers to one school. (The context should establish which school is meant.) Such examples have the same meaning in all English- speaking countries. The construct <preposition><noun>, with no intervening article, often refers to a state of being rather than to an instance of the object named by the noun. The set of commonly used preposition-noun combinations varies from one dialect to another. Some examples are: I went to bed = I retired for the night. Even if I had the habit of sleeping on the floor, I would still say ""I went to bed"" and not ""I went to floor"". She is at university (U.K.) = She is in college (U.S.) = She is a student, enrolled in a particular type of tertiary institution. This sentence does not imply that she is now physically present on the campus. He was taken to hospital (U.K.) = He was hospitalized. (A U.S. speaker might say ""to the hospital"" even if there were several hospitals in the area.) Subjunctive ----------- Present Subjunctive The present subjunctive is the same in form as the infinitive without ""to"". This is also the same form as the present indicative, except in the third person singular and in forms of the verb ""to be"". The present subjunctive is used: (1) in third-person commands: ""Help, somebody save me!"" Most third- person commands (although not those addressed to ""somebody"") are now expressed with ""let"" instead. The following (current but set) formulas would probably use ""let"" if they were being coined today: ""So be it""; ""Manners be hanged!""; ""... be damned""; ""Be it known that...""; ""Far be it from me to...""; ""Suffice it to say that..."" (2) in third person wishes. Most third-person wishes are now prefixed with ""may"" instead, as would the following formulas be: ""God save the Queen!""; ""God bless you""; ""God help you""; ""Lord love a duck""; ""Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done.""; ""Heaven forbid!""; ""The Devil take him!""; ""Long live the king!""; ""Perish the thought!"" (3) in formulas where it means ""No matter how..."" or ""Even if..."": ""Come what may, ...""; ""Be that as it may, ...""; ""Though all care be exercised...""; ""Be he ever so..."" (4) after ""that"" clauses to introduce a situation that the actor wants to bring about. Used to introduce a formal motion (""I move that Mr Smith be appointed chairman""); after verbs like ""demand"", ""insist"", ""propose"", ""prefer"", ""recommend"", ""resolve"", ""suggest""; and after phrases like ""it is advisable/desirable/ essential/fitting/imperative/important/necessary/urgent/vital that"". ""Should"" can also be used in such clauses. This use of the subjunctive had become archaic in Britain in the first half of the 20th century, but has been revived under U.S. influence. Note the difference between ""It is important that America has an adequate supply of hydrogen bombs"" (America has an adequate supply of H-bombs, and this is important) and ""It is important that America have an adequate supply of hydrogen bombs"" (America probably *lacks* an adequate supply, and must acquire one). (5) after ""lest"". ""Should"" can also be used after ""lest"". After the synonymous ""in case"", the plain indicative is usual. (6) ""Come..."", meaning ""When ... comes"" Past Subjunctive The past subjunctive is the same in form as the past indicative, except in the past subjunctive singular of ""to be"", which is ""were"" instead of ""was"". The past subjunctive is used: (1) for counterfactual conditionals: ""If I were..."" or (literary) ""Were I..."". In informal English, substitution of the past indicative form (""If I was..."") is common. But note that speakers who make this substitution are *still* distinguishing possible conditions from counterfactual ones, by a change of tense: Present Past Possible condition: ""If I am"" ""If I was"" Counterfactual condition: ""If I were/was"" ""If I had been"" ""As if"" and ""as though"" were originally always used to introduce counterfactuals, but are now often used in ""looks as if"", ""sounds as though"", etc., to introduce things that the speaker actually believes (""It looks as if"" = ""It appears that""). In such cases the present indicative is often used. (""As if"" and ""as though"" are exceptions to the above table in that they take the past subjunctive, not the pluperfect subjunctive, for counterfactuals in the past. The past tense of ""If he were a fool, he would mention it"" is ""If he had been a fool, he would have mentioned it""; but the past tense of ""He talks as if he were a fool"" is ""He talked as if he were a fool."" ""He talked as if he had been a fool"" would mean that he seemed, not foolish, but regretful of earlier foolishness.) Fowler says that there is no ""sequence of moods"" requirement in English: it's ""if I were to say that I was wrong"", not ""if I were to say that I were wrong"". (2) for counterfactual wishes: ""I wish I were...""; ""If only I were...""; (archaic) ""Would that I were..."". Again, substitution of the past indicative is common informally. Achievable wishes are usually expressed with various verbs plus the infinitive: ""I wish to..."", ""I'd like you to..."" (3) in archaic English, sometimes to introduce the apodosis (""then"" part) of a conditional: ""then I were"" = ""then I would be"". (4) in ""as it were"" (a formula indicating that the previous expression was coined for the occasion or was not quite precise -- literally, ""as if it were so""). ==================================================================== WORD ORIGINS ------------ ""A.D."" ------ ""A.D."" stands for _Anno Domini_ = ""in the year of the Lord"", not for ""after the death"". Most stylebooks prescribe placing ""A.D."" before the year: ""Arminius died A.D. 21."" WDEU calls this ""the traditional and still most frequently used styling"" (the OED has citations from 1579 on); but Collins English Dictionary says ""this is no longer general practice."" Placing ""A.D."" after the year is, if anything, better supported by precedents from Classical Latin (whose word order was flexible enough that either placement would be grammatical): the ancient Romans did not use A.D. dating, but Cicero (_Pro Flacco_ I) has _quingentesimo anno rei publicae_ = ""in the five-hundredth year of the state"". ""alumin(i)um"" (notes by Keith Ivey) ------------- This word is usually ""aluminum"" /@'lu:m@n@m/ in the U.S. and in Canada, and ""aluminium"" /,&lU'mInI@m/ in other English-speaking countries. People sometimes complain that the American form is inconsistent with other element names, which end in ""-ium"". But even in British spelling, there are elements that end in ""-um"" not preceded by ""i"": lanthanum, molybdenum, platinum, and tantalum (not to mention argentum, aurum, cuprum, ferrum, hydrargyrum, plumbum, and stannum; but then those aren't English names, just the names from which the symbols are derived). A widespread false belief among those who spell the word ""aluminium"" is that theirs is the original spelling, from which the American version is a later development, perhaps resulting from a typographical error. The CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics (63rd ed., p. B-5) gives this bit of history: The ancient Greeks and Romans used alum in medicine as an astringent, and as a mordant in dyeing. In 1761 [Baron Louis- Bernard Guyton] de Morveau proposed the name alumine for the base in alum, and [Antoine] Lavoisier, in 1787, thought this to be the oxide of a still undiscovered metal. [...] In 1807, [Sir Humphrey] Davy proposed the name alumium for the metal, undiscovered at that time, and later agreed to change it to aluminum. Shortly thereafter, the name aluminium was adopted to conform with the ""ium"" ending of most elements, and this spelling is now in use elsewhere in the world. Aluminium was also the accepted spelling in the U.S. until 1925, at which time the American Chemical Society officially decided to use the name aluminum thereafter in their publications. I used to work for ACS, but I have no idea why they would have chosen ""aluminum"" over ""aluminium"", especially if ""aluminium"" was already established. _A Dictionary of American English on Historical Principles_ (University of Chicago Press, 1938, ISBN 0-226-11737-5) gives U.S. citations of ""aluminum"" from 1836, 1855, 1889 (two), and 1916, and says: ""This form is in common use in mining, manufacturing, and the trade in the U.S.; the form _aluminium_ is used with practical uniformity in Great Britain and generally by chemists in the U.S."" ""Aluminium"" is given as the only form by Noah Webster's 1828 dictionary; and as the preferred form by _The Century Dictionary_ (1889) and by the 9th and 11th editions of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. The Britannica yearbook switched its index entry from ""aluminium or aluminum"" to ""aluminum"" in 1942. ""bloody"" -------- The use of ""bloody"" as an intensifier used to be considered highly offensive in England, as the fuss made over it in Shaw's _Pygmalion_ shows. (It is less offensive now, as shown by its use on mainstream British TV programmes such as EastEnders.) Eric Partridge, in _Words, Words, Words_ (Methuen, 1933), lists the following suggested origins: 1. From an alleged Irish word _bloidhe_, meaning ""rather"". This was proposed by Charles Mackay in the 19th century, but is highly implausible: even if the word exists, it would presumably have been pronounced /bli:/ since the early Modern Irish period. The closest I could find to it in an Irish dictionary was _bluire_= ""a bit, some"". 2. ""by our Lady"" (an invocation of the Virgin Mary). There *was* an interjection ""byrlady"", attested since 1570 and frequently used by Shakespeare, which *did* mean ""by our Lady"". But this was an interjection, not an adverb, although a citation from Jonathan Swift (""it grows by'r Lady cold"") shows a possible intermediate use. The transition from ""byrlady"" to ""bloody"" is phonetically implausible. 3. ""S'blood"", an ancient oath shortened from ""God's blood"". The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology says this is ""probably"" the origin, but the OED says ""there is no ground for the notion"". The etymologies in the OED are largely untouched since the first edition; the ODEE is generally more up to date. 4. blood with reference either to menstruation or to ""the bloody flux"", an old term for dysentery. ""Ingenious, but [...] much too restricted"", says Partridge. 5. ""blood"", an aristocratic young roisterer. The OED plumped for this one, because its earliest citations of ""bloody"" as an intensifier were in the phrase ""bloody drunk"", which it conjectured meant ""as drunk as a blood"" (cf. ""as drunk as a lord""). But the earlier citation found by Weekley (see below) makes this less plausible, and ""bloody drunk"" would be an unusual lexicalization of ""as drunk as a blood"". 6. blood's being something vivid or distressing. Partridge himself plumps for this one. Ernest Weekley, in _Words Ancient and Modern_ (Murray, 1926), finds analogous uses of French _sanglant_, German _blutig_, and Dutch _bloedig_. He gives one citation that antedates those in the OED (""A man cruelly eloquent and bluddily learned"", John Marston, 1606 -- but ""bluddily"" may be a descriptive adverb rather than an intensifier here), and two (""It was bloody hot walking to-day"", Swift, 1711; ""bloody passionate"", Samuel Richardson, 1742) that show that ""up to about 1750 it was inoffensive"". He attributes the dropping of ""-ly"" from ""bloodily"" to ""an instinct which tends to drop _-ly_ from a word already ending in _-y_"", as seen in ""very"", ""pretty"", and ""jolly"". A Merriam-Webster etymologist (in e-mail to me) chose 6, possibly influenced by 3, considering the analogy of German _blutig_ the strongest argument, and added: ""'Bloody' in 19th-century England -- like 'fucking' and other so-called intensifiers -- functioned principally as a marker of speech register signaling group or class membership. In a society in which speech register was strongly associated with economic class, and class distinctions were extraordinarily significant, it is not too hard to see why 'bloody' became so taboo for Victorians. I'm not sure any other explanation need be sought. The taboo on 'bloody' as well as a lot of other constraints in Britain declined in force with the social upheavals initiated by World War I."" ""bug""=""defect"" -------------- The 1947 incident often related by Grace Hopper, in which a technician solved a glitch in the Harvard Mark II computer by pulling a moth out from between the contacts of one of its relays, *did* happen. However, the log entry (""first actual case of bug being found"") indicates that this is *not* the *origin* of this sense of ""bug"". It was used in 1899 in a reference to Thomas Edison. See the Jargon File. It may come from ""bug"" in the obsolete sense ""frightful object"", whose use in Coverdale's 1535 translation of the Bible led to its being nicknamed ""the Bug Bible"". (Coverdale rendered Psalm 91:5 as ""Thou shalt not nede to be afrayed for eny bugges by night""; the King James Version reads ""terror"".) This word, which was the source of the current word ""bugbear"" and may be related to ""bogey"", comes from Middle English ""bugge"", which was used in the senses ""scarecrow"" and ""demon"". Possible etyma are Welsh _bwg_=""ghost"" and proto-Germanic *_bugja_= ""swollen up, thick"". The latter is also posited as the etymon of the Norwegian dialect _bugge_=""important man"" and English ""big"", from the proto-Indo-European *_beu-_=""to blow up, swell"", whence the English words ""poach""=""cook"", ""pocket"", ""poke""=""bag"", ""pout"", ""Puck""=""sprite"", and ""pucker"". ""Bug""=""insect"" (which gave rise to the senses ""germ"", ""annoy"", ""enthusiast"", and ""listening device"") is attested from 1622. It may come from Anglo-Saxon _budda_=""beetle"", influenced by ""bug""= ""frightful object"". ""Caesarean section"" ------------------- The OED erroneously states that Julius Caesar was born by Caesarean section. Merriam-Webster Editorial Department (on its AOL message board, in response to a query from me) writes: ""The name 'Caesar' is a cognomen, a nickname given to one member of a Roman clan and borne by his descendants as a kind of surname. No one knows who the original Caesar was, but his descendants within his clan, the Julii, continued to use his cognomen and formed a major branch of the clan. ""According to a legend related by the Roman naturalist Pliny, the first Caesar was so called because he was cut from the womb of his mother (_a caeso matris utero_), _Caesar_ supposedly being a derivative of the verb _caedere_ 'to cut'. This etymology is dubious, but the name 'Caesar' has continued to be associated with surgery to remove a child that cannot be delivered naturally. ""The OED gives evidence for the belief that Julius Caesar, the most famous bearer of the cognomen, was delivered this way that dates from 1540. There is no authority for this notion in ancient sources. Moreover, Julius Caesar's mother lived long after his birth -- unlikely if she had undergone such an operation, which few women would have survived in those days. In any case, the earliest record we have for the term 'cesarean section' used in English dates from 1615. You can easily see from these dates why we say that the term came from the belief, and not, to throw in a little more Latin, vice versa."" The Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins suggests that Caesar's name may have become associated with the operation because of an edict of the Caesars of Imperial Rome (Lex Caesarea) that any pregnant woman dying at or near term was to be delivered by C-section; but Merriam-Webster Editorial Department says ""We can find no evidence for"" such an edict. Also not named directly after Julius Caesar are ""Caesar salad"" (allegedly named after a restaurant named Caesar's in Tijuana, Mexico); and ""Julian day"" (number of days elapsed since 1 January 4713 B.C., used in astronomy; named by Joseph Scaliger after his father, Julius Caesar Scaliger). The computer term ""Julian date"" (date represented as number of days elapsed from the beginning of a chosen year) was apparently inspired by ""Julian day"". ""canola"" -------- ""Canola"" is defined as any of several varieties of the rape plant having seeds that contain less than 2% erucic acid, and whose solid component contains less than 30 micromoles per gram of glucosinolates. (This has been the statutory definition in Canada since 1986.) If you ever come across rapeseed oil that is *not* canola, avoid it, because erucic acid causes heart lesions, and glucosinolates cause thyroid enlargement and poor feed conversion! Rape plants have been grown in Europe since the 13th century; rapeseed oil was used in Asia and Europe originally in lamps, and later as a cooking oil. Canola was developed between 1958 and 1974 by two Canadian scientists, Baldur Stefansson and Richard Downey. Dictionaries have variously explained ""canola"" as standing for ""Canada oil, low acid"", and as a blend of ""Canada"" and ""colza"". I imagine that ""Mazola"" (a brand name for corn [= ""maize""] oil) had an influence. ""Canola"" was originally a trademark in Canada, but is now a generic term. It's the only term one is now likely to encounter there on packaging and in newspapers and books; some sources do say that canola was ""formerly called rape"". But the term ""rape"" still has some currency among Canadian farmers. (Although ""rape"" denoting the plant is etymologically unconnected with ""rape"" meaning forced sexual intercourse, the homonymy doubtless contributed to the former term's falling into disfavour.) The Canola Council of Canada, based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, told me that ""Canola"" was registered as a trademark in 1978 (that's one year before MWCD10's 1979) by the Western Canadian Oilseed Crushers' Association, and that control of the term was transferred in 1980 to the Rapeseed Association of Canada, which changed its name to the Canola Council of Canada the same year. They say that the origin is simply ""Canadian oil"", that ""it's not an acronym"", and that rapeseed oil that does not meet the criteria for canola should still be called ""rapeseed oil"". ""Designer eggs"", low-cholesterol eggs developed at the University of Alberta, are produced by adding canola and flax to the hens' diet. ""catch-22"" ---------- ""Catch-22"" means a trap created by mutually frustrating regulations. It was coined by Joseph Heller in his 1961 novel _Catch-22_, which satirized military illogic. From the novel: Yossarian looked at him soberly and tried another approach. ""Is Orr crazy?"" ""He sure is,"" Doc Daneeka said. ""Can you ground him?"" ""I sure can. But first he has to ask me to. That's part of the rule."" [...] ""And then you can ground him?"" Yossarian asked. ""No. Then I can't ground him."" ""You mean there's a catch?"" ""Sure there's a catch,"" Doc Daneeka replied. ""Catch-22. Anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy."" [...] Yossarian [...] let out a respectful whistle. ""That's some catch, that Catch-22,"" he observed. ""It's the best there is,"" Doc Daneeka agreed. Later in the novel, Yossarian visits a former brothel from which soldiers have chased away all the prostitutes. Yossarian asks why. ""No reason,"" wailed the old woman. ""No reason."" ""What right did they have?"" ""Catch-22. [...] Catch-22 says they have a right to do anything we can't stop them from doing. [...] What does it mean, Catch-22? What is Catch-22?"" ""Didn't they show it to you?"" Yossarian demanded, stamping about in anger and distress. ""Didn't you even make them read it?"" ""They don't have to show us Catch-22,"" the old woman answered. ""The law says they don't have to."" ""What law says they don't have to?"" ""Catch-22."" [...] Yossarian [...] strode out of the apartment, cursing Catch-22 vehemently as he descended the stairs, even though he knew there was no such thing. Catch-22 did not exist, he was positive of that, but it made no difference. What did matter was that everyone thought it existed, and that was much worse, for there was no object or text to ridicule or refute [...]. It is not logical for ""Catch-22"" to be hyphenated; other such expressions in English normally are not. But that's the way Heller did it. Heller originally planned to title the novel _Catch-18_, but changed it because of Leon Uris's 1961 novel _Mila 18_. ""cop"" ----- does not stand for ""constable on patrol"" or ""constabulary of police"". The noun ""cop"" (first attested meaning ""policeman"" in 1859) is short for ""copper"" (first attested meaning ""policeman"" in 1846). ""Copper"" in this sense is unlikely to derive from copper buttons or shields worn by early policemen. Rather, dictionaries derive it from ""to cop"" (first attested meaning ""to grab"" in 1704 and meaning ""to arrest"" in 1844). ""To cop"" may come Dutch _kapen_ = ""to steal""; or it may come from Old French dialect _caper_ = ""to take"", from Latin _capere_. ""copacetic"" ----------- This word, meaning ""extremely satisfactory"", was first recorded in 1919, and was originally heard chiefly among U.S. black jazz musicians. The tap dancer Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson (1878-1949) popularized the word, and claimed to have coined it when he was a shoeshine boy in Richmond; but a number of Southerners testified that they had heard the word used by parents or grandparents in the late 19th century. Suggested origins include: a supposed Italian word _copacetti_; a Creole French word _coupersetique_ meaning ""that can be coped with""; and the Hebrew phrase _kol besedeq_ ""all with justice"". RHUD2 says that all these theories ""lack supporting evidence"". ""crap"" ------ ""Crap"" does not derive from Thomas Crapper. Thomas Crapper (1837-1910) did exist and did make toilets. (At least 3 authors have gone into print asserting he was a hoax, but you can see some of his toilets at the Gladstone Pottery Museum, Uttoxeter Road, Longton, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire ST3 1TQ, U.K.; phone +44 1782 311378), and also at the Science Museum in London. The word ""crap"" was imported into English from Dutch in the 15th century, with the meaning ""chaff"". It is recorded in the sense ""to defecate"" from 1846; Thomas Crapper did not set up his business until 1861. Also, Thomas Crapper did not ""invent"" the flush toilet (the ancient Minoans had them); he merely improved the design. The Crapper company lived on until 1966 -- 105 years in business. See the article ""Thomas Crapper: Myth & Reality"" from the June 1993 issue of _Plumbing and Mechanical_ at < http://www.theplumber.com/crapper.html >. You can see some photographs of Thomas Crapper at < http://www.geocities.com/RodeoDrive/1093/Thomas_Crapper.html >. ""ebonics"" --------- This recently popular term for what linguists usually call BEV (Black English Vernacular) or AAEV (African-American English vernacular), or BVE or AAVE, was devised in 1973 by Robert Lewis Williams (born in 1903), a retired professor of linguistics at Washington University; he expanded on it in his 1975 book _Ebonics: the True Language of Black Folks_ (published by the Institute of Black Studies in St. Louis). The term came to wide attention when on 18 December 1996 the Oakland, California, school board unanimously voted to recognise Ebonics as a second language and to alter educational procedures to account for the difference between English taught in schools and the ""primary language"" of many of the district's students. The text of the resolution can be found at < http://www.west.net/~joyland/Oakland.htm >. Backlash to the Oakland School Board's decision prompted an amended resolution < http://ousd.k12.ca.us/board/wk011297/Amended_Resolution_No_9697_0063.html > on 15 January 1997, explaining that the board instructed teachers to accept Ebonics as a primary language and facilitate the transition to standard English, not to teach Ebonics in classrooms. The most distinctive characteristics of Ebonics are not conjugating the verb ""to be"" and dropping final consonant sounds, but there are of course many other differences from standard English. Ebonics can make some distinctions that standard English cannot, for example, the use of ""be"" to signify habitual action: ""He be sick"" means that he is chronically ill, whereas ""He sick"" means that he is ill at present. The corresponding negative forms are ""He don' be sick"" and ""he ain' sick""; the interrogative forms are ""Do he be sick?"" and ""Is he sick?"" ""He be sick right now"" and ""He sick all the time"" would be ungrammatical. Some of the grammatical features are listed at < http://www.west.net/~joyland/BlkEng.html >. There are also semantic differences; for example, Ebonics shares with U.S. Southern English ""carry"" in the sense ""to escort""; the sentence ""I'm going to take you, but I'm not going to carry you"" would in Ebonics be ""I gonna carry you, but I ain' gonna tote you."" A resolution on Ebonics adopted by the Linguistic Soceity of America can be found at < http://www.lsa.umich.edu/ling/jlawler/ebonics.lsa.html >. There is a bibliography at < http://www.english.uiuc.edu/English302/aavedesc.htm >. A forthcoming book is _The Ebonics Controversy : Exploring the Roots of an African-American Dialect_ (Birch Lane Press, 1997, ISBN 1559724277). ""eighty-six""=""nix"" ------------------ This verb meaning ""to eject or debar from premises, to reject or abandon"" was previously an expression used by waiters and bartenders indicating that the supply of an item was exhausted or that a customer was not to be served. Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins says: ""[...] 86 may well have come from a number code created by [...] soda fountain clerks [...]. Originally, according to the _American Thesaurus of Slang_, it was a password used between clerks to indicate: 'We're all out of the item ordered.' The transition from this meaning [...] to the bartender's sense of 'Serve no more because of the shape he's in' is fairly obvious. The number code developed by soda clerks was very extensive [...]. A hissed '98' from one soda-popper to another indicated 'The assistant manager is prowling around. Watch out.' [...] And most cheerful warning of all, 87 1/2, meaning 'There's a good-looking girl out front!'"" The earliest clear citation is from the February 1936 issue of _American Speech_, which gives the definition ""_Eighty-six_, item on the menu not on hand."" The Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang cites a comedy with a date range 1926-35 in which a waiter gives his number as 86. AHD3 gives the etymology: ""Perhaps after Chumley's bar and restaurant at 86 Bedford Street in Greenwich Village, New York City."" But most other dictionaries, including MWCD10, suggest that eighty-six was rhyming slang for ""nix"". On its AOL message Board, Merriam-Webster Editorial Department writes: ""The etymology we give at 'eighty-six' is the one we'll stand by. It is our contention that the address at Chumley's is purely coincidence, and that the word was developed in rhyming slang, and originally used by restaurant workers so that the average customer didn't know what they were talking about. ""The earlier citations for 'eighty-six' [...] do not influence our decisions about the etymology [...]. In fact, if the first citation is from the early part of the range, it would tell against the Chumley's hypothesis, as Chumley's did not exist before 1927-29. Finally, because slang usually exists in the language for a number of years before it is recorded, the existence of a citation from the 1920s tells strongly against the Chumley's explanation. ""There are a number of other theories about the origin of the word: that it originated in the heyday of the British merchant marine (the standard crew was 85, so that the 86th didn't get to go); that 86 was the number of the California (or Florida) law that forbade bartenders to serve the overly intoxicated; and that it refers to the number of tables (85) at the New York restaurant 21, and the table (86, in other words, no table) that the undesirable got. There are more, but the Chumley's theory is the most popular."" ""Eighty-six"" is attested as a verb meaning ""get rid of"" from 1955 on. It was surely in reference to this meaning that Maxwell Smart, the hero of the 1960s sitcom ""Get Smart!"", was Agent 86. ""Eskimo"" -------- It now seems unlikely that ""Eskimo"" means ""eater of raw meat"". Merriam-Webster changed its etymology when it brought out MWCD10, and referred me to an article by Ives Goddard in _Handbook of North American Indians_ (Smithsonian, 1984), vol. 5, p. 5-7. Goddard cites the following Amerindian words: Montagnais _ayassimew_=""Micmac"" Plains Cree _ayaskimew_=""Eskimo"" Attikamek Cree _ashkimew_=""Eskimo"" North Shore Montagnais _kachikushu_ or _kachekweshu_=""Eskimo"" ""not analysable but explained by speakers as meaning 'eater of raw meat'"" Ojibwa _eshkipot_=""Eskimo"" (literally ""one who who eats raw"") Algonquin Eastern Ojibwa _ashkipok_=""Eskimo"" (literally ""raw eaters"") Goddard writes: ""In spite of the tenacity of the belief, both among Algonquian speakers and in the anthropological and general literature [...] that Eskimo means 'raw-meat eaters', this explanation fits only the cited Ojibwa forms (containing Proto- Algonquian *_ashk-_ 'raw' and *_po-_ 'eat') and cannot be correct for the presumed Montagnais source of the word Eskimo itself. [...] The Montagnais word _awassimew_ (of which _ay-_ is a reduplication) and its unreduplicated Attikamek cognate exactly match Montagnais _assimew_, Ojibwa _ashkime_ 'she nets a snowshoe', and an origin from a form meaning 'snowshoe-netter' could be considered if the original Montagnais application (presumably before Montagnais contact with Eskimos) were to Algonquians."" _A Dictionary of the Otchipwe Language_ by Bishop Frederic Baraga (Beauchemin & Valois, 1878) gives _ashkime_=""I lace or fill snowshoes""; the phrase _agim nind ashkima_ with the same meaning (_agim_ is the noun for ""snowshoe""); _askimaneiab_=""babiche, strings of leather for lacing snowshoes""; and _ashkimewin_=""art or occupation of lacing snowshoes"". But there are no other obvious cognates: the words for ""snowshoe"", ""lace"", ""leather"", ""net"", and ""string"" are all unrelated. In all other words beginning with ""ashk-"" or ""oshk-"", the prefix signifies ""raw, fresh, new"". Eskimos' self-designations include: singular plural language places Inuk Inuit Inuktitut Canada, West Greenland Inupiaq Inupiat Inupiaq North Alaska Inuvialuk Inuvialuit Mackenzie Delta Katladlit Kalaallisut Greenland Yupik Yupik Southwest Alaska Yuk Yuit Siberia, St. Lawrence Island ""Inuk"" and ""Yuk"" mean simply ""person""; ""Inupiaq"" and ""Inuvialuk"" mean ""real, genuine person"". Goddard writes: ""In the 1970s in Canada the name Inuit all but replaced Eskimo in governmental and scientific publication and the mass media, largely in response to demands from Eskimo political associations. The erroneous belief that Eskimo was a pejorative term meaning 'eater of raw flesh' had a major influence on this shift. The Inuit Circumpolar Conference meeting in Barrow, Alaska, in 1977 officially adopted Inuit as a designation for all Eskimos, regardless of their local usages [...]."" For the the number of words the Eskimos supposedly have for snow, see the sci.lang FAQ, or the alt.folklore.urban archive under < http://www.urbanlegends.com >. ""flammable"" ----------- People often ask why ""flammable"" and ""inflammable"" mean the same thing. The English words come from separate Latin words: _inflammare_ and the rarer _flammare_, which both meant ""to set on fire"". Latin had two prefixes _in-_, one of which meant ""not""; the other, meaning ""in"", ""into"", or ""upon"", was the one used in _inflammare_. ""Inflammable"" dates in English from 1605. ""Flammable"" is first attested in an 1813 translation from Latin It was rare until the 1920s when the U.S. National Fire Protection Association adopted ""flammable"" because of concern that the ""in-"" in ""inflammable"" might be misconstrued as a negative prefix. Underwriters and others interested in fire safety followed suit. Benjamin Whorf (1897-1941), the linguist who shares credit for the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis that language shapes thought, may have been influential in promoting this change. Merriam-Webster Editorial Department writes: ""Though we have been unable to confirm that Benjamin Whorf was responsible for the word's adoption, the theory seems plausible enough: he was, in fact, employed by the Hartford Fire Insurance Company from 1918 to 1940, and was widely recognized for his work in fire prevention."" ""Flammable"" is still commoner in the U.S. than in the U.K.; in figurative uses, ""inflammable"" prevails (e.g., ""inflammable temper""). Other words where an apparently negative prefix has little effect on the meaning are: ""to (dis)annul"", ""to (de)bone"", ""to (un)bare"", ""to (un)loose"", and ""to (un)ravel"". ""Irregardless"" (which probably arose as a blend of ""irrespective"" and ""regardless""; it was first recorded in western Indiana in 1912), means the same as ""regardless"", but is not considered acceptable. ""freeway"" --------- The ""free"" in ""freeway"" never referred to lack of a speed limit; nor did it originally refer to a lack of tollbooths, although W3's second definition is ""a toll-free highway"". The word is attested since 1930, and in the earliest citations it is defined as a thoroughfare to which the abutting owners have no right of direct access. ""fuck"" ------ ""Fuck"" does NOT stand for ""for unlawful carnal knowledge"" or ""fornication under consent of the king"". It is not an acronym for anything at all. It is a very old word, recorded in English since the 15th century (few acronyms predate the 20th century), with cognates in other Germanic languages. The Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang (Random House, 1994, ISBN 0-394-54427-7) cites Middle Dutch _fokken_ = ""to thrust, copulate with""; Norwegian dialect _fukka_ = ""to copulate""; and Swedish dialect _focka_ = ""to strike, push, copulate"" and _fock_ = ""penis"". Although German _ficken_ may enter the picture somehow, it is problematic in having e-grade, or umlaut, where all the others have o-grade or zero-grade of the vowel. AHD1, following Pokorny, derived ""feud"", ""fey"", ""fickle"", ""foe"", and ""fuck"" from an Indo-European root _*peig2_ = ""hostile""; but AHD2 and AHD3 have dropped this connection for ""fuck"" and give no pre-Germanic etymon for it. Eric Partridge, in the 7th edition of _Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English_ (Macmillan, 1970), said that ""fuck"" ""almost certainly"" comes from the Indo-European root _*peuk-_ = ""to prick"" (which is the source of the English words ""compunction"", ""expunge"", ""impugn"", ""poignant"", ""point"", ""pounce"", ""pugilist"", ""punctuate"", ""puncture"", ""pungent"", and ""pygmy""). Robert Claiborne, in _The Roots of English: A Reader's Handbook of Word Origin_ (Times, 1989) agrees that this is ""probably"" the etymon. Problems with such theories include a distribution that suggests a North-Sea Germanic areal form rather than an inherited one; the murkiness of the phonetic relations; and the fact that no alleged cognate outside Germanic has sexual connotations. ""golf"" ------ does not stand for ""Gentlemen Only, Ladies Forbidden"". It is a Scots word mentioned in 1457 in reference to the game. Possible cognates are Scots _gowf_=""to strike"", Dutch _kolf_=""club for striking balls"", Swedish _kolf_=""butt-end"", and Old Icelandic _kolfr_=""bolt"". The postulated Proto-Germanic root is *_kulb-_. The English word ""club"" comes from the possibly related Proto-Germanic *_klumbon_=""heavy stick"". ""hooker"" -------- Contrary to what you may have read in Xaviera Hollander's book _The Happy Hooker_, the ""prostitute"" sense of ""hooker"" does NOT derive from Joseph ""Fighting Joe"" Hooker (1814-1879), a major general on the Union side of the U.S. civil war, whose men were alleged to frequent brothels. ""Hooker"" in this sense goes back to 1845 (see AHD3); the U.S. Civil War did not begin until 1861. It may come from the earlier sense of ""thief"" (which goes back to 1567, ""to hook"" meaning to steal), or it may refer to prostitutes' linking arms with their clients. A geographical Hook (Corlear's Hook in New York City, or the Hook of Holland) is also possible. ""ISO"" by Mark Brader ----- ISO is the International Organization for Standardization, not the International Standards Organization. Some people think the organization's initials in French are ISO, but actually they would be OIN (for ""Organisation internationale de normalisation""). According to someone I met who worked there, the abbreviation ISO was adopted because they didn't want to use the actual English initials, but could permute them into the Greek-derived prefix iso- meaning ""same"" (which is what standards are for making things the :-) ). In other words, it's wordplay. For the official account, see < http://www.iso.ch/infoe/intro.html >. Coordinated Universal Time is UTC because the C is of secondary importance and can be written as a subscript. This one, too, is mistaken for coming from French, but does not. ""jerry-built""/""jury-rigged"" --------------------------- ""Jury-rigged"", which means ""assembled in a makeshift manner"", is attested since 1788. It comes from ""jury mast"", a nautical term attested since 1616 for a temporary mast made from any available spar when the mast has broken or been lost overboard. The OED dubiously recorded a suggestion that this was short for ""injury mast"", but recent dictionaries say that it is probably from Old French _ajurie_=""help or relief"", from Latin _adiutare_=""to aid"" (the source of the English word ""adjutant""). ""Jerry-built"", which the OED defines as ""built unsubstantially of bad materials; built to sell but not last"" is attested since 1869, and is said to have arisen in Liverpool. It has been fancifully derived from the Biblical city of Jericho, whose walls came tumbling down; from the prophet Jeremiah, because he foretold decay; from the name of a building firm on the Mersey; from ""jelly"", signifying instability; from French _jour_=""day"" (workers paid day-by-day considered less likely to do a good job); and from the Romany _gerry_=""excrement"". More likely, it is linked to earlier pejorative uses of the name Jerry (""jerrymumble"", to knock about, 1721; ""Jerry Sneak"", a henpecked husband, 1764; ""jerry"", a cheap beer house, 1861); and it may have been influenced by ""jury-rigged"". ""Jerry"" as British slang for ""a German, especially a German soldier"" is not attested until 1898 and is unconnected with ""jerry-built"". ""kangaroo"" ---------- ""Kangaroo"" does NOT derive from the aboriginal for ""I don't understand"". Captain James Cook's expedition learned the word from an aboriginal tribe that subsequently couldn't be identified. Since there were a *large* number of Australian aboriginal languages, and it has taken some time to record and catalogue the surviving ones, for many years the story that it meant ""I don't understand"" was plausible. The search was further complicated by the fact that many aboriginal languages imported the word *from* English. But if you consult an up-to-date English dictionary, such as RHUD2, you will see that ""kangaroo"" is derived from the Guugu-Yimidhirr (a language spoken near Cooktown, North Queensland) word _ga<eng>-urru_ ""a large black or grey species of kangaroo"". Similar stories are told about ""llama"" (a Quechua word, not from the Spanish _Como se llama?_ = ""What's it called?""); ""indri"" (this one DOES derive from the Malagasy word for ""Look!""); and several place names, among them Canada (_kanata_ was the Huron- Iroquois word for ""village, settlement""; Jacques Cartier is supposed to have mistaken this for the name of the country); Istanbul (said to come from a Turkish mishearing of Greek _eis ten poli_ ""to the city""); Luzon (supposedly Tagalog for ""What did you say?""); Nome (supposedly a printer's misreading of a cartographer's query, ""Name?""); Senegal (supposedly from Wolof _senyu gal_ ""our boats""); and Yucatan (supposedly = ""I don't understand you""). ""limerence""/""limerent"" ---------------------- The meaning of ""limerence"" falls somewhere between ""infatuation"" and ""romantic love"". It was coined circa 1977 by Dorothy Tennov, then professor of psychology at the University of Bridgeport, Connecticut. It was an arbitrary coinage; there is no specific etymology. For further information on limerence see her book _Love and Limerence_ (Stein and Day, 1979); or you may e-mail her directly at "" tennov@dmv.com "". ""loo"" ----- This British colloquial word for ""toilet"" was established usage by the 1920s. Suggested origins include: French _lieu d'aisance_ = ""place of easement"" French _On est prie de laisser ce lieu aussi propre qu'on le trouve_ = ""Please leave this place as clean as you find it"" French _Gardez l'eau!_ = ""Mind the water!"" (supposedly said in the days before modern plumbing, when emptying chamber pots from upper-storey windows. According to Chris Malcolm ( cam@aifh.ed.ac.uk ), this phrase is still sometimes used by common folk in Edinburgh when heaving water or slops, and tour guides say that it originated there circa 1600.) ""louvre"" (from the use of slatted screens for a makeshift lavatory) ""bordalou"" (an 18th-century ladies' travelling convenience) ""looward"" or ""leeward"" (the sheltered side of a boat) ""lee"", a shepherd's shelter made of hurdles ""lieu"", as in ""time off in lieu"", i.e., in place of work done ""lavatory"", spoken mincingly ""Lady Louisa Anson"" (a 19th-century English noblewoman whose sons took her name-card from her bedroom door and put it on the guest lavatory) a misreading of room number ""100"" (supposedly a common European toilet location) a ""water closet""/""Waterloo"" joke. (James Joyce's _Ulysses_ (1922) contains the following text: ""O yes, _mon loup_. How much cost? Waterloo. water closet."") ""love""=""zero"" ------------- On its AOL message board, Merriam-Webster Editorial Department writes: ""The notion that the sports term 'love' comes from the French _l'oeuf_ seems to be another popular fallacy; so far, our etymologists have been unable to find any evidence that _oeuf_ was ever used in a 'zero' or 'goose-egg' sense in reference to game scores. A more probable, if less imaginative, explanation can be found in the Oxford English Dictionary, which links this sense of 'love' to the phrase 'for love' (i.e. 'without stakes, for nothing')."" ""merkin"" (notes by Michael B. Quinion and Ruth Bygrave) -------- The word ""merkin"" is one of the perpetual bad puns of the Internet. It actually means ""pubic wig"" (such wigs are used, apparently, in the theatrical and film worlds as modesty devices in nude scenes). It can also be a contrivance used by male cross-dressers designed to imitate the female genitals, or, as Eric Partridge delicately puts it, ""an artificial vagina for lonely men"". The OED dates it 1617 in the sense ""pubic wig""; the origin is unknown. Then ""merkin"" was coined afresh to mean ""an American"", because it sounds a bit like the half-swallowed pronunciation of ""American"" by some Americans, particularly President Lyndon Johnson; and the fact that it had a ""naughty"" meaning didn't hurt. Punning use of the word dates back to at least the early 1960s. Bill Fisher writes: ""I'd guess multiple re-invention is going on here. When I was fooling around with the Orange Blossom Playhouse in Orlando, FL, about 1963, we were amusing ourselves with trying to change a word here or there in the play 'Teahouse of the August Moon' -- without really screwing anything up -- and one guy cracked the cast up one night when instead of the line 'But ... but ... he's an American!' he said 'But ... but .. he's a Merkin!' (The cast had been laughing for a week or two about the definition of 'merkin' that someone had found in a dictionary.)"" One of Peter Sellers' roles in Stanley Kubrick's 1964 film _Dr. Strangelove_ was U.S. President Merkin Muffley. This gets two risque' locutions past the censor at once, since ""muff"" is another slang term for female genitals or pubic hair (as in ""muff-diving"" for cunnilingus). This name was presumably the work of Kubrick or his scriptwriter Terry Southern. The film was based on the 1958 novel _Two Hours to Doom_ (titled _Red Alert_ in the U.S.), by Peter George, pseudonym of Peter Bryant (1924-1966). The novel was serious -- Bryant had served in the RAF -- and does not name the presidential character. But when Kubrick filmed it as a satire, Bryant was so convinced that he then re-novelized the film. On Usenet, ""merkin"" is only a few years old. A few people recall alt.fan.pratchett (a newsgroup dedicated to the writings of Terry Pratchett, a British writer of humorous fantasy) as the origin, but Matthew Crosby ( crosby@nordsieck.cs.colorado.edu ) writes: ""I believe I was the original person to use 'Merkin' in AFP (certainly it was my use of the word that started the large thread on it), and I'm sure that 'Merkin' was being used before that as an underhand insult. By me, if nothing else."" ""Merkin"" is now widely used on Usenet to designate Americans (especially by non-Americans). ""nimrod"" -------- Genesis 10:8-9, in describing how the Seventy Nations were founded by the descendants of Noah, says that Nimrod, son of Cush, son of Ham, son of Noah, was ""a mighty man on earth"" and ""a mighty hunter before the LORD"". The word ""nimrod"" is recorded in English since 1545 with the (now obsolete) meaning ""tyrant"", and since 1712 with the meaning ""hunter"". In contemporary U.S. slang, ""nimrod"" means ""fool, numbskull"". Rex Knepp ingeniously suggested that the origin of this was Bugs Bunny's taunt of Elmer Fudd: ""So long, Nimrod."" Unfortunately for this theory, Jesse Sheidlower says that Random House has two citations of ""nimrod"" = ""numbskull"" from the 1930s, before the Bugs Bunny episode containing the taunt. ""O.K."" ------ This one has generated *lots* of folklore. The following list of suggested origins and info comes from MEU2, from Eric Partridge's _Dictionary of Historical Slang_ (1972 edition, Penguin, 0-14-081046-X), and from Cecil Adams' _More of the Straight Dope_ (Ballantine, 1988, ISBN 0-345-34145-2). Thanks to Jeremy Smith for his help. The abbreviations on cracker boxes, shipping crates, cargoes of rum, et al., became synonymous with quality. ""Oll korrect, popularized by Old Kinderhook"" is what's given in most up-to-date dictionaries. The earliest known citation is from the Boston Morning Post of 23 March 1839: "" [...] he of the Journal, and his train-band, would have the 'contributions box,' et ceteras, o.k. -- all correct -- and cause the corks to fly."" This was a facetious suggestion by a Boston editor that a Providence editor (the Journal mentioned was in Providence) sponsor a party. American ""O.K."", abbreviation of Obadiah Kelly, a shipping agent American ""O.K."", abbreviation of Old Keokuk, a Sac Indian chief American ""O.K."", contraction of ""oll korrect"". This was the choice of a British judiciary committee that investigated the matter for a 1935 court case (MEU2), and was further documented by Columbia University professor Allen Walker Read in ""The Evidence on 'O.K.', _Saturday Review of Literature_, 19 July 1941. A vogue for comically misspelled abbreviations began in Boston in the summer of 1838, and spread to New York and New Orleans in 1839. They used ""K.G."" for ""know go"", ""K.Y."" for ""know yuse"", ""N.S."" for ""nuff said"", and ""O.K."" for ""oll korrect"". American ""O.K."", abbreviation of Orrins-Kendall crackers American ""O.K."", abbreviation of Otto Kaiser, American industrialist American ""O.K. Club"". ""O.K."" gained national currency in 1840 as the slogan of the ""O.K. club"", a club of supporters of then President Martin Van Buren, in allusion to his nickname, ""Old Kinderhook"" -- Van Buren was born in the village of Kinderhook, N.Y. Choctaw _(h)oke_ = ""it is so"" English opposite of ""K.O."" (""knock out"") English ""of Katmandu"" English ""open key"" English ""optical kleptomaniac"" English ""our kind"" Ewe (West African) Finnish _oikea_ French _Aux Cayes_, a place in Haiti noted for excellence of its rum French _aux quais_, stencilled on Puerto Rican rum specially selected for export German _ordnungsgemaess kontrolliert_ ""properly checked"" German letters of rank appended to signature of Oberkommandant Greek _olla kalla_ = ""all good"" Latin _omnia correcta_ = ""all correct"" Mandingo (West African) = _o ke_ ""that's it"", ""all right"" Occitan _oc_ = ""yes"" (Occitan or Langue d'Oc is so called because it uses _oc_ where French uses _oui_.) Scots _och aye!_ ""oh yes"" Tewa _oh-ka(n)_ = ""come here"", ""all right"" Wolof (West African) ""waw kay"" = ""yes indeed"". Supported by Prof. J. Weisenfeld, professor of African and African-American religion at Columbia University. It was shown by Dr Davis Dalby (""The Etymology of O.K."", The Times, 14 January 1971) that similar expressions were used very early in the 19th century by Negroes of Jamaica, Surinam, and South Carolina: a Jamaican planter's diary of 1816 records a Negro as saying ""Oh ki, massa, doctor no need be fright, we no want to hurt him."" The use of ""kay"" alone is recorded in the speech of black Americans as far back as 1776; significantly, the emergence of O.K. among white Americans dates from a period when refugees from southern slavery were arriving in the north. Queried about the Dalby citations, Merriam-Webster Editorial Department told me: ""A word pronounced approximately 'kai' is an expression of surprise or amusement in Jamaican Creole and in Sea Islands Creole (Gullah). If you take into account the pronunciation and meaning, you'll see that it does not fit 'okay' either semantically or phonetically. There is nothing in the history of 'O.K.' or 'okay' that suggests it has an African-American origin."" ""outrage"" --------- does not come from English ""out"" + ""rage"". It comes from French _outre_ = ""beyond"" + _-age_. French _outre_ comes from Latin _ultra_. ""paparazzo"" ----------- This word for a freelance photographer who pursues celebrities is first attested in English in 1966. It comes from Paparazzo, the surname of the photographer played by Marcello Mastroianni in Federico Fellini's 1960 film _La Dolce Vita_. Fellini got the name ""Paparazzo"" from the name of a hotelkeeper in George Gissing's 1901 novel _By the Ionian Sea_. _Paparazzo_ could be analysed in Italian as _papa_=""pope"" + _razzo_=""rocket""; according to Jesse Sheidlower, _paparazzo_ means ""a buzzing insect"" in dialectal Italian. Webster's New World College Dictionary derives _paparazzo_ from French _paperassier_=""a scribbler, rummager in old papers"". ""pie-shaped"" ------------ This word, for which our earliest citation so far is from 1913 (found by Fred Shapiro with Lexis) nearly always means ""shaped like a slice of pie"", not ""shaped like a pie"". (A use found by Matthew Rabuzzi in W3's entry ""Jack Horner pie"" may mean the latter.) The word is quite common in North America (a search by Myles Callum on Nexis turned up more than a thousand instances), but little known elsewhere (a search on a British corpus turned up nothing, and British correspondents tell us that they ""would not automatically assume that that was what was meant""). The word, for which there is no entry in *any* dictionary, was discovered by Mark Israel on 11 July 1995, when Matthew Rabuzzi used it in a suggested emendation to the ""Origin of the dollar sign"" entry in this FAQ, and it was found to be missing from the dictionaries. That's right, folks; in future years, when you open your dictionary and see an entry for ""pie-shaped"" there, remember: you have *me* to thank for it! Other discoveries of mine are: ""underwear"" in the specific sense ""(women's) underpants"" (American women have taken a dislike to the word ""panties"", and will now say things like ""I put two pairs of underwear in the wash"", or ""I'm not wearing any underwear"" when wearing a bra); ""slab leak"" (a leak from a pipe embedded in a concrete slab; many plumbers advertise in the Yellow Pages that this is something they can repair); and ""go to temple"" (dictionaries note that ""church"" has a specific sense in which it is used as a mass noun, ""divine worship at a church"", but do not note that ""temple"" and ""shul"" can be used in a similar way). ""portmanteau word"" ------------------ This term for ""blend word"" comes from ""portmanteau"", ""a leather travelling case that opens into two hinged compartments"" (from the French for ""carry cloak""), by way of Humpty Dumpty in Lewis Carroll's _Through the Looking-Glass_: ""You see it's like a portmanteau -- there are two meanings packed up into one word."" Although most modern blends are simply the first part of one word plus the last part of another (e.g., ""brunch"" = ""breakfast"" + ""lunch""; ""smog"" = ""smoke"" + ""fog""; ""Chunnel"" = ""Channel"" + ""tunnel""), Carroll himself formed his portmanteau words in a more subtle manner: ""slithy"" = ""lithe"" + ""slimy""; ""mimsy"" = ""miserable"" + ""flimsy""; ""frumious"" = ""fuming"" + ""furious"". Carroll's coinages ""chortle"" (which is now in most dictionaries) and ""galumph"" (which is in the OED) are generally understood as ""chuckle"" + ""snort"" and ""gallop"" + ""triumph"" respectively, although Carroll himself never explained them. Blend words predate Carroll: MWCD10 derives ""squiggle"" from ""squirm"" + ""wriggle"", and dates it circa 1816. There is a dictionary of them: _Portmanteau Dictionary: Blend Words in the English Language Including Trademarks and Brand Names_ by Dick Thurner (McFarland, 1993, ISBN 0-89950-687-9). There is a Lewis Carroll WWW page at: < http://www.LewisCarroll.org/carroll.html > ""posh"" ------ ""Posh"" (probably) does NOT stand for ""port out, starboard home"". MWCD10, p. 27a, says, ""our editors frequently have to explain to correspondents that the dictionary fails to state that the origin of _posh_ is in the initial letters of the phrase 'port out, starboard home' -- supposedly a shipping term for the cooler accommodations on steamships plying between Britain and India from the mid-nineteenth century on -- not because the story is unknown to us but because no evidence to support it has yet been produced. Some evidence exists that casts strong doubt on it; the word is not known earlier than 1918 (in a source unrelated to shipping), and the acronymic explanation does not appear until 1935."" A tenable theory is that ""posh"" meant ""halfpenny"" (from Romany _posh_ ""half"") and then ""money"" before acquiring its present meaning. Or it may come from the slang ""pot"" (= ""big"", ""a person of importance""). Or it may be a contraction of ""polished"". I got e-mail from someone whose grandmother claimed to have seen steamship tickets with ""P.O.S.H."" overprinted. And William Safire's _I Stand Corrected_ (Times, 1984, ISBN 0-8129-01097-4) quotes a letter from an Ellen Thackara of Switzerland: ""When I lived in the Orient the P.&O. (Pacific [sic] and Orient) Line out of London _did_ put beside the names of important people 'POSH', so they would have the cooler side of the ship."" (The P&O is actually the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company; it's not clear whether the mistake is Thackara's or Safire's.) But to convince us, you'll have to *find* one of these tickets and send a copy to Merriam-Webster. ""quiz"" ------ This is first recorded in 1749 in the sense ""an odd person"". It is *doubtful* that ""quiz"" came from an alleged incident in which James Daly, a late-18th-century Dublin theatre manager, made a wager that he could introduce a new word into the English language overnight, and hired urchins to chalk the word ""quiz"" on every wall and billboard in Dublin. ""Quiz"" may come from the Latin ""Qui es?"" (= ""Who are you?"", the first question asked in Latin oral exams in grammar schools), or it may be a shortening of ""inquisitive"". ""Santa Ana"" ----------- This California term for ""a strong, hot, dust-bearing wind blowing towards the southern Pacific coast from the desert"" comes from (according to MWCD10) the Santa Ana mountain range or (according to AHD3) the Santa Ana Canyon, not from the California city of Santa Ana. ""scot-free"" ----------- Like ""hopscotch"", this word for ""without incurring any penalty"" has no connection with frugal Scotsmen. In 12th-century England, a ""scot"" or ""sceot"" was a municipal tax paid to the local bailiff or sheriff (the word came from an Old Norse cognate of ""shoot""/""shot"", and meant ""money thrown down""). The word ""scot-free"", which is recorded from the 13th century, referred to someone who succeeded in dodging these taxes. Later, the term was given wider currency when ""scot"" was used to mean the amount owed by a customer in a tavern: anyone who had a drink on the house went ""scot-free"". This ""scot"" was reinforced by the fact that the drinks ordered were ""scotched"", or marked on a slate, so that the landlord could keep track of how much the customer owed. ""sincere"" --------- ""Sincere"" is sometimes said to derive from Roman quarrymen's temporarily concealing imperfections in marble blocks by rubbing wax on them. On its AOL message board, Merriam-Webster Editorial Department writes: ""The theory that 'sincere' ultimately derives from Latin _sine cera_, meaning 'without wax', is a popular one; unfortunately, there is no evidence to support it. A far more likely origin, in our view, is that the Latin word _sincerus_ derives from _sem-_ ('one') and _-cerus_ (akin to Latin _crescere_, meaning 'to grow')."" ""sirloin""/""baron of beef"" ------------------------- ""Sirloin"" comes from Old French _surlonge_, from _sur_ ""above"" and _loigne_ ""loin"". Its current spelling may have been influenced by a story that a King of England (variously said to be Henry VIII, James I, and Charles II) ""knighted"" this cut of beef because of its superiority. A ""baron of beef"" is a joint consisting of two sirloins left uncut at the backbone. This ""baron"" may have originated as a joke on ""sirloin"", or it may be an independent word. ""SOS"" ----- SOS does NOT stand for ""Save Our Ship/Souls"", for ""Stop Other Signals"", for ""Send Our Saviour/Succour"", for ""Sure of Sinking"", or for the Russian _Spasiti Ot Smerti_ (= ""save from death""). The signal ""...---..."", recommended for international distress calls at the international Radio Telegraph Conference of 1906 and officially adopted in 1908, was not chosen for any alphabetic significance. Such a signal is now known as a ""prosign"" (from ""procedural signal""). Those prosigns (such as this one) that are transmitted without interletter gaps are notated with an overbar. Since ""..."" is S and ""---"" is O in Morse code, the distress signal is conventionally represented as: ___ SOS but since there are no interletter gaps, it could also be analysed as various other combinations of Morse code letters. Fred Bland writes: ""Three of anything (e.g. gun shots, fires, cairns) is a conventional signal of distress recommended in survival guides. I don't know whether this convention or the use of three dots and dashes is older."" Mark Brader writes: ""The sign used before SOS was CQD, which was composed of the usual 'calling' sign CQ, plus D for Distress. Even in 1912 when the Titanic was sinking, its operator put out a CQD first and only added SOS after being reminded."" Thomas Hamilton White ( whitetho@med.unc.edu ) writes: ""I have read that the international distress call evolved from SOE (sent as three letters), which had been used as a distress signal by German companies. However, because the final E in this sequence consisted of a single dot, the signal was modified to ...---... to be more distinctive and symmetrical. [...] I can think of one very practical reason for continuing to informally treat the distress signal as SOS -- ever try to stamp ...---... in a snowbank?"" ""spoonerism"" ------------ This term for interchanging parts of two different words in a phrase is named after the Reverend William Archibald Spooner (1844-1930), Dean and Warden of New College, Oxford. The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, 2nd edition (1953), attributed two famous spoonerisms to Dr Spooner: ""Kinquering congs their titles take"", and ""You have deliberately tasted two worms and you can leave Oxford by the town drain."" (The ""down train"" was the train going away from London, in this case through Oxford. Other popular attributions to Dr Spooner are: ""a well boiled icicle""; ""a blushing crow""; ""a half-warmed fish""; ""our shoving leopard""; ""our queer old Dean""; ""You hissed my mystery lectures""; ""My boy, it's kisstomary to cuss the bride""; ""Take this in aid of Oxford's beery wenches""; ""When the boys come home from France, we'll have hags flung out""; ""Pardon me, madam, you are occupewing my pie. May I sew you to another sheet?""; and ""Have you any signifying glasses? Oh well, it really doesn't magnify."") But after the publication of _Spooner: A Biography_ by Sir William Hayter (W. H. Allen, 1976, ISBN 0-491-01658-1), the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, 3rd edition (1979), gives only one spoonerism (""weight of rages""), and says: ""Many other Spoonerisms, such as those given in the previous editions of O.D.Q., are now known to be apocryphal."" The OED says the word ""spoonerism"" was ""known in colloquial use in Oxford from about 1885."" In his diary entry of 9 May 1904, Spooner wrote that someone he met at dinner ""seemed to think he owed me some gratitude for the many 'Spoonerisms' which I suppose have appeared in Tit Bits."" One of the undergraduates who attested ""weight of rages"" commented: ""Well, I've been up for four years, and never heard the Spoo make a spoonerism before, and now he makes a damned rotten one at the last minute."" ""suck""=""be very unsatisfying"" by John Davies ----------------------------- It is pretty clear that ""suck"" started out as a sexual insult, e.g., ""Charlie sucks"", what he sucks being unnecessary to spell out. As a term of general disapproval it did not take long to be applied to all sorts of things, animate and inanimate, to the point where it is now used by all manner of people, small children included, without any consciousness whatsoever of the sexual origin of the term. Some of them seem to find it very hard to accept that it ever had a sexual connotation. It has crossed the Atlantic, but would be regarded both by those who use it and those accustomed to hearing it as a conscious Americanism. The curious thing is that ""sucks!"" as a taunt or term of derision seems to be even older in U.K. english, but it has never to my knowledge had any hint of a sexual meaning attached to it, though that doesn't mean it never did have. The construction is not at all the same as the contemporary US phrase. To quote Eric Partridge's _Dictionary of slang and Unconventional English_: ""Sucks! An expression of derision: schools (?mostly boys') since late C19. Often sucks to you. E. F. Benson, _David of Kings_ (1924) has Sucks for----! (That's a disappointment for so-and-so). 'Sucks to' may also be directed at others, e.g. 'Well, sucks to them! they can jolly well go without'."" But for people of a certain age, ""Yah boo, sucks to you"" is indelibly associated with Billy Bunter, a fat schoolboy created by Frank Richards (1875-1961), and immortalized in children's books and comics of the period. Even when I was a small boy in the 1940s, ""sucks"" in that context sounded old-fashioned and upper-class, and personally I've never heard or seen it except as a conscious parody of Bunter. ""till""/""until"" -------------- The conjunction ""till"" is not a shortening of ""until"". MWCD10 dates ""till"" from the 12th century and ""until"" from the 13th century. ""Until"" was a compound, whose first element also survives in ""unto"", and whose second element was the ancestor of ""till"". The spelling ""'til"" occurs, but is not standard anywhere. ""tip"" ----- ""Tip"", in the sense of ""gratuity"", does NOT stand for ""to insure [i.e., ensure] politeness/promptness"" or ""to improve performance"". It may derive from ""tip"" in the sense ""to tap, to strike lightly"" or in the sense ""extremity"", both of which have cognates in other Germanic languages. Or it may be a shortening of ""stipend"". ""titsling""/""brassiere"" ---------------------- ""Brassiere"" is first recorded in a Canadian advertisement of 1911, and in the U.S. Index of Patents for the year 1910 (published in 1911). Dictionaries derive it from obsolete (17th century) French _brassiere_ = ""bodice"", from Old French _braciere_ = ""arm protector"", from _bras_ = ""arm"". (The French word for bra is _soutien-gorge_, literally ""support-throat"".) In the southern U.S., a bra is sometimes called a ""tit-sling"". This has an obvious derivation. Wallace Reyburn, to whom Thomas Crapper owes his current fame, wrote a later book describing a lawsuit over rights to the bra, fought from 1934 to 1938 in New York, between a German-born designer, Otto Titzling (1884-1942), and a French-born designer, Philippe de Brassiere. Martin Gardner, in _Time Travel and Other Mathematical Bewilderments_ (Freeman, 1988, ISBN 0-7107-1925-8), p. 137, says: ""The book by Wallace Reyburn _Flushed with Pride: The Story of Thomas Crapper_ does exist. For many years I assumed that Reyburn's book was the funniest plumbing hoax since H. L. Mencken wrote his fake history of the bathtub. [...] Reyburn wrote a later book titled _Bust-up: The Uplifting Tale of Otto Titzling and the Development of the Bra_. It turns out, though, that both Thomas Crapper and Otto Titzling were real people, and neither of Reyburn's books is entirely a hoax."" On its AOL message board, Merriam-Webster Editorial Department writes: ""dull though it may be, all the available etymological evidence indicates that the word derives from the French 'brassiere' [...]; there are many examples of the use of 'brassiere' in the women's apparel sense throughout the 19th century -- in French. [...] Given the word's history and that country's language heritage, it is not surprising that the first occurrence of the ""brassiere"" in English comes from Canada. [...] We can find no verifiable evidence that anyone named either 'Titzling' or 'Brassiere' had anything to do with the origin of the term."" troll ----- This word, meaning ""to fish by trailing bait behind one's boat"", and hence ""to post an article to Usenet designed to elicit flames from new or unperceptive readers, while signalling levity to the savvy and experienced"", is unconnected with ""to trawl"" (=""to fish by dragging a net along the sea floor""). ""Troll"" seems to come from Middle French _troller_=""to run here and there"", of Germanic origin, cognate with Middle High German _trollen_=""to walk or run with short steps"" and perhaps also with ""troll"", the mythological being; ""trawl"" seems to come from Middle Dutch _traghel_=""dragnet"", perhaps from Latin _tragula_=""dragnet"", from _trahere_=""drag"". typo ---- ""Typo"" is related to, but does not come from, the verb ""to type"". It is short for ""typographical error"", which, of course, could refer to any error made by a typographer. (The humorous but useful hackish coinage ""thinko"", used for when the person typing was *thinking* of the wrong thing, pretends that ""typo"" does come from ""to type"". The Jargon File also gives ""mouso"", a ubiquitous kind of error in this point-and-click era.) Arguments of the form ""It couldn't have been a typo, because those two keys are nowhere near each other on the keyboard"" are a bit tiresome, especially when one keeps the true etymology of ""typo"" in mind. Wicca ----- Wicca is ""a pagan nature religion having is roots in pre- Christian Europe and undergoing a 20th-century revival"" (AHD3). Only the most recently published dictionaries contain an entry for it; RHUD2 dates it 1975. ""Wicca"" is a revival of an Old English word that you can find in older dictionaries by looking up the etymology of either ""witch"" or ""wicked"". In Old English, _wicca_ was the masculine form of a word meaning ""wizard"" or ""sorcerer"". (The feminine form was _wicce_. ""Witch"" comes from _wicce_.) _Wicca_ and _wicce_ came from from a proto-Germanic (not Celtic) _wikkjak_, ""one who wakes the dead"", the first element of which comes from the same Indo-European root as ""wake"". Yes, we've heard the joke about the Beatles song ""Wiccan, Work It Out"". ""widget"" (notes by William C. Waterhouse) -------- ""Widget"" is a deliberately invented word meant (probably) to suggest ""gadget"". Most dictionaries fail to trace it to its origin. It comes from the 1924 play ""Beggar on Horseback"", by George Kaufman and Marc Connelly. In the play, a young composer gets engaged to the daughter of a rich businessman, and the next part of the play acts out his nightmare of what his life will be like, doing pointless work in a bureaucratic big business. At one point he encounters his father-in-law at work, and we get the following dialogue: (Father-in-law): Yes, sir! Big business! ---- Yes. Big business. What business are we in? ---- Widgets. We're in the widget business. ---- The widget business? ---- Yes, sir! I suppose I'm the biggest manufacturer in the world of overhead and underground A-erial widgets. Part of the point, of course, is that no one ever tells him what ""widgets"" are. ""wog"" ----- ""Wog"", a chiefly British, derogatory word for someone from the Middle or Far East, does NOT stand for ""wealthy/Western/wily/ wonderful/worthy Oriental gentleman"", or for ""worker on Government service"". It may be a shortening of ""golliwog"". ""wonk"" (notes by Fred Shapiro) ------ The OED defines ""wonk"" as ""a studious or hardworking person"". An article in _Sports Illustrated_, 17 Dec. 1962, explains that in Harvard slang, there was a tripartite classification of students into wonks, preppies, and jocks. I believe that this classification is in fact the origin of each of the three terms. The earliest citations in the OED for the three terms are dated, respectively, 1962, 1970, and 1963. I have found an occurrence of ""wonk"" in _Time_ in 1954; an occurrence of ""preppie"" in the _Cambridge Review_ in 1956; and an occurrence of ""jock"" in the _Harvard Crimson_ in 1958. In all three instances the context is a Harvard one. (But Esther Vail recalls: ""'jocks'; we called them that at Syracuse Univ. as early as 1948"".) ""Wonk"" is said to derive from the word ""know"" spelled backwards, but this is not certain. Other suggested origins are the adjective ""wonky"" = ""weak, shaky"", and ""wanker"" = ""masturbator"". ""Preppy"" comes from ""preparatory school"". ""Jock"" (attested from 1922 in the sense ""athletic supporter"") comes from ""jockstrap"", from ""jock"" = ""penis"", from the male name Jack. ""wop"" ----- This derogatory word for ""an Italian"" does not stand for ""without papers/passport"", for ""working on pavement"", or for ""western Oriental person"". It comes from Italian dialectal _guappo_ = ""thug"", ultimately from Latin _vappa_ = ""flat wine"". ""ye""=""the"" ---------- The ""y"" here is a representation of the obsolete letter thorn, which looked like ""b"" and ""p"" superimposed, and was pronounced [T] or [D] (the same as modern ""th""). The pronunciation of ""ye"" in ""Ye Olde Curiositie Shoppe"" as /ji/, which you sometimes hear, is a spelling pronunciation. ==================================================================== PHRASE ORIGINS -------------- ""the bee's knees"" ----------------- A bee's ""corbiculae"", or pollen-baskets, are located on its tibiae (midsegments of its legs). The phrase ""the bee's knees"", meaning ""the height of excellence"", became popular in the U.S. in the 1920s, along with ""the cat's whiskers"" (possibly from the use of these in radio crystal sets), ""the cat's pajamas"" (pyjamas were still new enough to be daring), and similar phrases which made less sense and didn't endure: ""the eel's ankle"", ""the elephant's instep"", ""the snake's hip"". Stories in circulation about the phrase's origin include: ""b's and e's"", short for ""be-alls and end-alls""; and a corruption of ""business"". ""beg the question"" ------------------ Fowler defines ""begging the question"" as the ""fallacy of founding a conclusion on a basis that as much needs to be proved as the conclusion itself."" ""Question"" here does not mean ""a sentence in interrogative form"". Rather, it means ""the point at issue, the thing that the person is trying to prove"". The phrase is elucidated by William Fulke in ""Heskins parleamant repealed"" (1579): ""O shameless beggar, that craveth no less than the whole controversy to be given him!"" The OED's first citation for ""to beg the question"" is from 1581. Common varieties of begging the question are paraphrase of the statement to be proved (""Telepathy cannot exist because direct transfer of thought between individuals is impossible""), and arguing in a circle (""The Bible must be true, because God wouldn't lie to us; we know God is trustworthy, because it says so in the Bible""). Fowler gives two example of non-circular question-begging: ""that fox-hunting is not cruel, since the fox enjoys the fun, and that one must keep servants, since all respectable people do so"". Gowers notes that single words, such as ""reactionary"" and ""victimization"", can be used in a question-begging way. The Latin term for the fallacy is _petitio principii_, a translation of the Greek _to en archei aiteisthai_=""at the beginning to assume""; but _aiteisthai_ does literally mean ""to beg"". The phrase can be traced back to Aristotle (4th century B.C.): ""Begging or assuming the point at issue consists (to take the expression in its widest sense) in failing to demonstrate the required proposition. But there are several other ways in which this may happen; for example, if the argument has not taken syllogistic form at all [...]. If, however, the relation of B to C is such that they are identical, or that they are clearly convertible, or that one applies to the other, then he is begging the point at issue."" (_Prior Analytics_ II xvi) Many people unaware of the technical meaning of ""to beg the question"" in logic use it in one of two looser senses. The first of these, ""to evade the question, to duck the issue"", is attested since 1860 (WDEU). The second, ""to invite the obvious question, (with an inanimate subject) to raise the question"", is now the most commonly heard use of the phrase, although we have found no mention of it prior to The Oxford Guide to English Usage, 1st edition (1983), and it is not yet in most dictionaries. The meaning of the adjective ""question-begging"" does not seem to have suffered a similar broadening. ""billions and billions"" ----------------------- Carl Sagan (1934-1996), in his last book _Billions & Billions_ (Random House, 1997, ISBN 0-679-41160-7), admitted that in the TV series _Cosmos_, first aired in 1980, he ""pronounced 'billions' with a fairly plosive 'b'"" to distinguish it from ""millions"". But he asserted that he never used the phrase ""billions and billions"" in that show, and that the public association of him with that phrase is due to a parody that Johnny Carson did of Sagan on _The Tonight Show_. ""blue moon"" (notes by Philip Hiscock) ----------- The phrase ""blue moon"" has been around a long time, well over 400 years, but during that time its meaning has shifted around a lot. I have counted six different meanings which have been carried by the term, and at least four of them are still current today. The earliest uses of the term are in a phrase remarkably like early references to ""green cheese"". Both were used as examples of obvious absurdities about which there could be no argument. Four hundred years ago, if someone said ""He would argue the moon was blue"", the average 16th-centuryman would take it the way we take ""He'd argue that black is white."" The earliest citation is a 1528 poem ""Rede Me and Be Not Wroth"": ""Yf they say the mone is blewe/We must believe that it is true."" This understanding of a blue moon's being absurd (the first meaning) led eventually to a second meaning, that of ""never"". To say that something would happen when the moon turned blue was like saying that it would happen on Tib's Eve (at least before Tib got a day near Christmas assigned to her). But of course, there are examples of the moon's actually turning blue; that's the third meaning: the moon's visually appearing blue. When the Indonesian volcano Krakatoa exploded in 1883, its dust turned sunsets green and the moon blue all around the world for the best part of two years. In 1927, a late monsoon in India set up conditions for a blue moon. And the moon here in Newfoundland was turned blue in September 1950 when huge forest fires in Alberta threw smoke particles up into the sky. Even by the 19th century, it was clear that although visually blue moons were rare, they did happen from time to time. So the phrase ""once in a blue moon"" came about. It meant then exactly what it means today: that an event was fairly infrequent, but not quite regular enough to pinpoint. That's meaning number four, and today it is still the main one. I know of six songs which use ""blue moon"" as a symbol of sadness and loneliness. In half of them, the poor crooner's moon turns to gold when he gets his love at the end of the song. That's meaning number five: check your old Elvis Presley or Bill Monroe records for more information. Finally, in the 1980s, a sixth meaning was popularized (chiefly by the game Trivial Pursuit): the second full moon in a month. The earliest reference cited for this is The Maine Farmers' Almanac for 1937. Rumour has it that when there were two full moons in a calendar month, calendars would put the first in red, the second in blue. ""Bob's your uncle"" ------------------ This British phrase means ""all will be well"" or ""simple as that"": ""You go and ask for the job -- and he remembers your name -- and Bob's your uncle."" It dates from circa 1890. P. Brendon, in _Eminent Edwardians_, 1979, suggests an origin: ""When, in 1887, Balfour was unexpectedly promoted to the vital front line post of Chief Secretary for Ireland by his uncle Robert, Lord Salisbury (a stroke of nepotism that inspired the catch-phrase 'Bob's your uncle'), ..."" Or it may have been prompted by the cant phrase ""All is bob"" = ""all is safe."" (Info from Eric Partridge's _Dictionary of Catch Phrases_, 2nd edition, revised by Paul Beale, Routledge, 1985, ISBN 0-415-05916-X.) ""Break a leg!"" -------------- There is a superstition in the theatre that wishing an actor good luck ""tempts the gods"" and causes bad luck, so negative expressions are substituted. In French one says _Merde!_ (""Shit!"") when an actor is about to go on stage. The German expression is _Hals und Beinbruch_=""neck and leg fracture"" (_Bein_ used to mean ""bone"" in German, so the translation ""neck and bone break"" may be correct if the expression is sufficiently old). The leading theory is that the English expression came from the German, possibly via Yiddish. Other suggested origins are: John Wilkes Booth, the actor who broke his leg shortly after he assassinated Abraham Lincoln in 1865; the great French actress Sarah Bernhardt, who ""had but one leg and it would be good luck to be like her""; wishing someone a ""big break"", that is, good luck leading to success; and the Hebrew _hatzlacha u-brakha_ = ""success and blessing"". ""to call a spade a spade"" ------------------------- is NOT an ethnic slur. It derives from an ancient Greek expression: _ta syka syka, te:n skaphe:n de skaphe:n onomasein_ = ""to call a fig a fig, a trough a trough"". This is first recorded in Aristophanes' play _The Clouds_ (423 B.C.), was used by Menander and Plutarch, and is still current in modern Greek. There has been a slight shift in meaning: in ancient times the phrase was often used pejoratively, to denote a rude person who spoke his mind tactlessly; but it now, like the English phrase, has an exclusively positive connotation. It is possible that both the fig and the trough were originally sexual symbols. In the Renaissance, Erasmus confused Plutarch's ""trough"" (_skaphe:_) with the Greek word for ""digging tool"" (_skapheion_; the two words are etymologically connected, a trough being something that is hollowed out) and rendered it in Latin as _ligo_. Thence it was translated into English in 1542 by Nicholas Udall in his translation of Erasmus's version as ""to call a spade [...] a spade"". (_Bartlett's Familiar Quotations_ perpetuates Erasmus' error by mistranslating _skaphe:_ as ""spade"" three times under Menander.) ""To call a spade a bloody shovel"" is not recorded until 1919. ""Spade"" in the sense of ""Negro"" is not recorded until 1928. (It comes from the colour of the playing card symbol, via the phrase ""black as the ace of spades"".) This, of course, does *not* necessarily render the modern use of ""to call a spade a spade"" ""politically correct"". Rosalie Maggio, in _The Bias-Free Word-Finder_, writes: ""The expression is associated with a racial slur and is to be avoided"", and recommends using ""to speak plainly"" or other alternatives instead. In another entry, she writes: ""Although by definition and derivation 'niggardly' and 'nigger' are completely unrelated, 'niggardly' is too close for comfort to a word with profoundly negative associations. Use instead one of the many available alternatives: stingy, miserly, parsimonious..."" Beard and Cerf, in _The Official Politically Correct Handbook_, p. 123, report that an administrator at the University of California at Santa Cruz campaigned for the banning of such phrases as ""a chink in his armor"" and ""a nip in the air"", because ""chink"" and ""nip"" are also derogatory terms for ""Chinese person"" and ""Japanese person"" respectively. In the late 1970s in the U.S., a boycott of the (now defunct) Sambo's restaurant chain was organized, even though the name ""Sambo's"" was a combination of the names of its two founders and did not come from the offensive word for dark-skinned person. ""cut the mustard"" ----------------- This expression meaning ""to achieve the required standard"" is first recorded in an O. Henry story of 1902: ""So I looked around and found a proposition [a woman] that exactly cut the mustard."" It may come from a cowboy expression, ""the proper mustard"", meaning ""the genuine thing"", and a resulting use of ""mustard"" to denote the best of anything. O. Henry in _Cabbages and Kings_ (1894) called mustard ""the main attraction"": ""I'm not headlined in the bills, but I'm the mustard in the salad dressing, just the same."" Figurative use of ""mustard"" as a positive superlative dates from 1659 in the phrase ""keen as mustard"", and use of ""cut"" to denote rank (as in ""a cut above"") dates from the 18th century. Other theories are that it is a corruption of the military phrase ""to pass muster"" (""muster"", from Latin _monstrare_=""to show"", means ""to assemble (troops), as for inspection""); that it refers to the practice of adding vinegar to ground-up mustard seed to ""cut"" the bitter taste; that it literally means ""cut mustard"" as an example of a difficult task, mustard being a relatively tough crop that grows close to the ground; and that it literally means ""cut mustard"" as an example of an easy task (via the negative expression ""can't even cut the mustard""), mustard being easier to cut at the table than butter. The more-or-less synonymous expression ""cut it"" (as in ""'Sorry' doesn't cut it"") seems to be more recent and may derive from ""cut the mustard"". ""cut to the chase"" ------------------ On its AOL message board, Merriam-Webster Editorial Department writes: ""The phrase 'cut to the chase' developed from cinema terminology, where it referred to the act of switching from a less action-packed scene to a more exciting sequence -- typically a chase scene -- in order to draw the audience's attention back to the screen. Within the past fifteen years or so, 'cut to the chase' has come to be used outside of the film industry with the figurative meaning of 'get to the point.'"" Jesse Sheidlower adds: ""The literal use -- as a director's instruction to go to a chase scene -- is quite old. A 1929 novel about Hollywood has 'Jannings escapes....Cut to chase', for example. The figurative use, which is now quite common, is fairly recent; it seems to date only from the early 1980s."" ""The die is cast."" ------------------ does NOT mean ""The metal template has been molded."" It's what Julius Caesar said on crossing the river Rubicon to invade Italy in 49 B.C. The ""die"" is a gambling die, and ""cast"" means thrown. The phrase means ""An irrevocable decision has been made."" (The Latin words, ""Jacta alea est"", are given in Suetonius' _Divus Julius_, XXXII. _Alea_ denotes the *game* of dice, rather than the physical die: the dice game is in its thrown state. ""The die is cast"" and ""the dice are cast"" would be equally good translations. Compare ""Les jeux sont faits"", heard at Monte Carlo.) Plutarch wrote two accounts in Greek of Caesar's crossing the Rubicon. Both times, he gives the words as _Anerriphtho: kubos_ = ""Let the die be cast."" In one of the accounts (Life of Pompey), he says that Caesar actually uttered the words in Greek; in the other (Life of Caesar), he suggests that the words were already a proverb before Caesar uttered them. ""dressed to the nines"" ---------------------- This expression, meaning ""very fashionably and elaborately dressed"", is recorded from the 18th century. ""The nine"" or ""the nines"" were used to signify ""superlative"" in numerous other contexts. Theories include: 9, being the highest single-digit number, symbolized the best; a metanalysis of Old English _to then eyne_ ""to the eyes""; and a reference to the 9 muses. ""Elementary, my dear Watson!"" ----------------------------- does not occur as such in any of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, although Holmes does exclaim ""Elementary"" in ""The Crooked Man"", and says ""It was very superficial, my dear Watson, I assure you"" in ""The Cardboard Box"". The first recorded juxtaposition is in the 1929 film _The Return of Sherlock Holmes_ (the first Holmes film with sound). The original stories never mention an Inverness cape, a deerstalker hat, or a meerschaum pipe, either. Those props are due to illustrators and to actors. The WWW Sherlockian home page is at: < http://watserv1.uwaterloo.ca/~credmond/sh.html > ""Enquiring minds want to know."" (notes by James Kiso) ------------------------------- This originated as a slogan used in TV ads in the 1980s by the National Enquirer. The Enquirer (based in Lantana, Florida; not to be confused with Philadelphia Inquirer, a fine paper) is the largest-selling ""news"" weekly in the U.S.; it belongs to the sensationalistic genre known as ""supermarket tabloids"" or ""checkout- line rags"" because the most familiar points of distribution are racks near supermarket checkout lines. The ads featured a series of ""ear-catching"" headlines from recent issues followed by actors (I hope) miming surprise at the revelation. The stories ranged from amazing weight-loss diets based on the intake of broccoli and ice cream to the tragic story of Michael Jackson's unrequited love for Liz Taylor. A following voice-over would say, ""Enquiring minds want to know."" ""The exception proves the rule."" -------------------------------- The common misconception (which you will find in several books, including the _Dictionary of Misinformation_) is that ""proves"" in this phrase means ""tests"". That is *not* the case, although ""proof"" *does* mean ""test"" in such locutions as ""proving ground"", ""proofreader"", ""proof spirit"", and ""The proof of the pudding is in the eating."" As MEU says, ""the original legal sense"" of the ""the exception proves the rule"" is as follows: ""'Special leave is given for men to be out of barracks tonight till 11.0 p.m.'; 'The exception proves the rule' means that this special leave implies a rule requiring men, except when an exception is made, to be in earlier. The value of this in interpreting statutes is plain."" MEU2 adds: ""'A rule is not proved by exceptions unless the exceptions themselves lead one to infer a rule' (Lord Atkin). The formula in full is _exceptio probat regulam in casibus non exceptis_."" [That's Latin for ""The exception proves the rule in cases not excepted.""] The phrase seems to date from the 17th century. (Anthony Cree, in _Cree's Dictionary of Latin Quotations_ (Newbury, 1978) says that the phrase comes from classical Latin, which it defines as Latin spoken before A.D. 400; but no classical citations have come to our attention.) Below are the five seventeenth-century citations that we could find. 1, 3, and 4 are in the OED; 2 is in _Latin for Lawyers_ by E. Hilton Jackson and Herbert Broom; 5 is in _A Dictionary of the Proverbs in England in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries_, by Morris Palmer Tilley. 1. 1617 Samuel Collins, _Epphata to F.T.; or, the Defence of the Bishop of Elie concerning his answer to Cardinall Ballarmine's Apologie_ 100: ""Indefinites are equivalent to universalls especially where one exception being made, it is plaine that all others are thereby cut off, according to the rule Exceptio figit regulam in non exceptis."" [Note that _figit_ rather than _probat_ is here used. _Probo_ can mean any of ""give official approval to"", ""put to the test"", or ""demonstrate the verity of""; but _figo_ can only mean ""fix"", ""fasten"", or ""establish"".] 2. _The reports of Sir Edvvard Coke, Kt., late Lord Chief-Justice of England_ (1658 edition; Sir Edward Coke died in 1634): ""[...] upon which Award of the Exigent, his Administrators brought a Writ of Error; and it was adjudged, That the Writ of Error did lie, and the reason was, Because that by the Awarding of the Exigent, his Goods and Chattels were forfeited, and of such Awards which tend _ad tale grave damnum_ of the party, a Writ of Error lieth, although the Principal Judgment was never given; in this case, _Exceptio probat regulam_, & _sic de similibus_."" [""A writ of error lieth"" = ""an appeal is admissible""; ""exigent"" = writ of suspension of civil rights; _ad tale grave damnum_ = ""to such great loss""; _sic de similibus_ = ""thus about similar things"".] 3. 1640 Gilbert Watts, _Bacon's Advancement and proficience of learning_ VIII. iii. Aph. 17: ""As exception strengthens the force of a Law in Cases not excepted, so enumeration weakens it in Cases not enumerated.""

[The OED (but not the other books I checked) gives the date as 1662. As far as I can tell from this scant context, Wilson seems to be saying, ""My description of two cowardly cheats should serve to show you the bad consequences of not being brave, and hence convince you of the need for a rule: 'Be brave!'.""] 5. 1666 Giovanni Torriano, _Piazza universale di proverbi italiani, or A Common Place of Italian Proverbs_ I, p. 80 ""The exception gives Authority to the Rule."" note 28, p. 242 ""And the Latin says again, Exceptio probat Regulam."" To convince us that *in this particular phrase* ""proves"" originally meant ""tests"", you will have to produce citations as old as or older than these to support your view. ""face the music"" ---------------- This expression, meaning ""accept the unpleasant consequences"", is first recorded in the U.S. around 1850. It may derive from musical theatre: a nervous actor would have to summon all his courage to face the audience across the orchestra pit. Or it may be one of three military references: an infantryman taking his place in the line of assembly; a cavalier keeping his restive horse still while the band starts to play; or a soldier being drummed out of his regiment. ""fall off a turnip truck"" ------------------------- This is now a very common phrase, as a search of Deja News will show. But Merriam-Webster reports that it has no citations of the whole phrase earlier than 1988, and no citations of ""turnip truck"" earlier than 1985. R. J. Valentine writes: ""This phrase has been used for many years by Johnny Carson, who hosted _The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson_ on NBC from the early 1960s to the early 1990s. He used it in precisely in the context discussed. He may not have originated it, but he certainly popularized it, and began doing so long before 1985."" Evan Morris, at < http://www.interport.net/~words1 >, says that this phrase ""seems to be a good example of an entire class of catch phrases based on urban-rural rivalry. The thrust of such phrases is, of course, that 'I am not a fool or a newcomer,' and, in this case, that 'I am not an ignorant country bumpkin who just arrived in the big city on a truck full of lowly turnips that I was dumb enough, on top of everything else, to fall off of.' This image of a bewildered hayseed ripe for fleecing by urban con artists is a close relative of more general phrases used to assert one's 'insider status' and thus intelligence or savvy. The United States being a nation largely composed of immigrants, it's not surprising that the all-time most commonly heard phrase of this type is 'I didn't just get off the boat.'"" ""full monty"" ------------ This British expression meaning ""the whole thing"", or more specifically ""16 megabytes of memory, when fitted to an IBM PC or compatible computer"", is first attested in 1986. To Michael Quinion's comprehensive treatment at < http://clever.net/quinion/words/monty.htm > may be added a story reported by Simon Gray that the origin is ""the full diamond mount"", i.e., the whole diamond ring; and the Jargon File's statement: ""This usage is possibly derived from a TV commercial for Del Monte fruit juice, in which one of the characters insisted on 'the full Del Monte'."" ""Get the lead out"" ------------------ is short for ""Get the lead out of your ass/britches/butt/feet/ pants"", which is long for ""Move!"" These expressions originated in the U.S. circa 1930. ""Go figure"" ----------- This expands to ""Go and figure it out"", and means: ""The reasons for the fact just stated are unknown and possibly unknowable. You can waste your time thinking about what they might be, if you choose, but you're not likely to accomplish anything."" (Kivi Shapiro) ""Go figure"" comes from Yiddish _Gey vays_ ""Go know"". Leo Rosten, in _The Joys of Yinglish_ (Penguin, 1989, ISBN 0-452-26534-6), says: ""In English, one says, 'Go _and_ see [look, ask, tell]...' Using an imperative without any link to a conjunction is pure Yiddish, no doubt derived from the biblical phrase, translated literally: 'Go tell...' 'Go praise the Lord...' (In English this becomes 'Come, let us praise the Lord.')"" Gianfranco Boggio-Togna writes: ""The expressions an Italian is likely to use to show bafflement correspond exactly to ""go figure"": _va a capire_='go understand' or _va a sapere_='go know'. The _va a_ idiom is common in colloquial Italian."" Other English expressions said to derive from Yiddish include: ""Big deal!"" (_A Groyser kunst!_); ""Bite your tongue"" (_Bays dir di tsung_); ""bottom line"" (_untershte shure_); ""Eat your heart out"" (_Es dir oys s'harts_); ""Enough already!"" (_Genug shoyn_); ""for real"" (_far emmes_); ""Look who's talking!"" (_Kuk nor ver s'ret!_); ""make like a"" (_makh vi_); ""shm-"" as in ""Fair, shmair""; ""Sez you"" (_Azoy zugst du_); ""Thanks a *lot*"" (ironic) (_A shenem dank aykh_); ""That's for sure"" (_Dos iz oyf zikher_); and ""Who needs it?"" (_Ver darf es?_). ""Go placidly amid the noise and the haste"" (Desiderata) ------------------------------------------------------- ""Desiderata"" was written in 1927 by Max Ehrmann (1872-1945). In 1956, the rector of St. Paul's Church in Baltimore, Maryland, used the poem in a collection of mimeographed inspirational material for his congregation. Someone who subsequently printed it asserted that it was found in Old St. Paul's Church, dated 1692. The year 1692 was the founding date of the church and has nothing to do with the poem. See Fred D. Cavinder, ""Desiderata"", _TWA Ambassador_, Aug. 1973, pp. 14-15. ""go to hell in a handbasket"" ---------------------------- This phrase, meaning ""to deteriorate rapidly"", originated in the U.S. in the early 20th century. A handbasket is just a basket with a handle. Something carried in a handbasket goes wherever it's going without much resistance. James L. Rader of Merriam-Webster Editorial Dept. writes: ""The Dictionary of American Regional English [...] records 'to go to heaven in a handbasket' much earlier than [...] 'hell,' which is not attested before the 1950s. The earliest cite in our files is from 1949 [...]. 'In a handbasket' seems to imply ease and and speed [...]. Perhaps part of the success of these phrases must simply be ascribed to the force of alliteration. DARE has a much earlier citation for another alliterative collocation with 'handbasket' (1714), from Samuel Sewall's diary: 'A committee brought in something about Piscataqua. Govr said he would give his head in a Handbasket as soon as he would pass it.' I suspect that 'to go to hell in a handbasket' has been around much longer than our records would seem to indicate."" ""hell for leather"" ------------------ Robert L. Chapman's _New Dictionary of American Slang_ (Harper & Row, 1987, ISBN 0-06-181157-2) says: ""hell-for-leather or hell- bent-for-leather adv _from late 1800s British_ Rapidly and energetically; =all out, flat out. _You're heading hell-for-leather to a crack-up_ [origin unknown; perhaps related to British dialect phrases _go hell for ladder, hell falladerly, hell faleero_, and remaining mysterious even if so, although the _leather_ would then be a very probable case of folk etymology with a vague sense of the _leather_ involved in horse trappings.]"" ""hoist with his own petard"" --------------------------- ""For 'tis the sport to have the enginer / Hoist with his owne petar"" -- Shakespeare, Hamlet III iv. ""Hoist"" was in Shakespeare's time the past participles of a verb ""to hoise"", which meant what ""to hoist"" does now: to lift. A petard (see under ""peter out"" for the etymology) was an explosive charge detonated by a slowly burning fuse. If the petard went off prematurely, then the sapper (military engineer; Shakespeare's ""enginer"") who planted it would be hurled into the air by the explosion. (Compare ""up"" in ""to blow up"".) A modern rendition might be: ""It's fun to see the engineer blown up with his own bomb."" ""by hook or by crook"" --------------------- This phrase formerly meant ""by fair means or foul"", although now it often (especially in the U.K.) means simply ""by whatever necessary means"". The first recorded use is by John Wycliffe in _Controversial Tracts_ (circa 1380). Theories include: a law or custom in mediaeval England that allowed peasants to take as firewood from the King's forests any deadwood that they could reach with a shepherd's crook and cut off with a reaper's billhook; rhyming words for ""direct"" (reachable with a long hook) and ""indirect"" (roundabout); beginners' writing exercises, where letters have hooks and brackets are ""crooks""; and from ""Hook"" and ""Crook"", the names of headlands on either side of a bay north of Waterford, Ireland, referring to a captain's determination to make the haven of the bay in bad weather using one headland or the other as a guide. ""Illegitimis non carborundum"" ----------------------------- Yes, this means ""Don't let the bastards grind you down"", but it is not real Latin; it is a pseudo-Latin joke. ""Carborundum"" is a trademark for a very hard substance composed of silicon carbide, used in grinding. (The name ""Carborundum"" is a blend of ""carbon"" and ""corundum"". ""Corundum"" denotes aluminium oxide, and comes to English from Tamil _kuruntam_; it is related to Sanskrit _kuruvinda_ = ""ruby"".) ""The ""-ndum"" ending suggests the Latin gerundive, which is used to express desirability of the activity denoted by the verb, as in _Nil desperandum_ = ""nothing to be despaired of""; _addendum_ = ""(thing) fit to be added""; _corrigendum_ = ""(thing) fit to be corrected""; and the name Amanda, from _amanda_ = ""fit to be loved""). _Illegitimis_ is the dative plural of _illegitimus_ = ""illegitimate""; the gerundive in Latin correctly takes the dative to denote the agent. _Illegitimus_ could conceivably mean ""bastard"" in Latin, but was not the usual word for it: _Follett World-Wide Latin Dictionary_ (Follett, 1967) gives _nothus homo_ for bastard of known father, and _spurius_ for bastard of unknown father. The phrase seems to have originated with British army intelligence early in World War II. It was popularized when U.S. general Joseph W. ""Vinegar Joe"" Stilwell (1883-1946) adopted it as his motto. Various variant forms are in circulation. ""in like Flynn"" --------------- This phrase's first meaning was ""in favour, assured of success, in an enviable position"". Some writers allege that it originated in allusion to Edward Joseph ""Boss"" Flynn (1892-1953), a campaign manager for the U.S. Democratic party during Franklin Delano Roosevelt's presidency. Flynn's machine was so successful at winning elections that his candidates seemed to be in office automatically. But the phrase was popularized with reference to Australian-born Hollywood actor Errol Flynn (1909-59), whose amorous exploits gave it a second meaning: ""being a quick seducer"". The earliest citation we have seen does refer to Errol Flynn (but not to seduction): ""_In like Flynn._ Everything is O.K. In other words, the pilot is having no more trouble than Errol Flynn has in his cinematic feats."" (1945 in _American Speech_ Dec. 1946, 310) The phrase ""In Like Flint"" has also been heard: it was the title of a 1967 movie, a sequel to ""Our Man Flint"" (1965). Both films were spy spoofs starring James Coburn. The 1967 title was, of course, wordplay on ""in like Flynn"" and the character name ""Flint"". ""Jingle Bells"" -------------- This song by James Pierpont was fist published in 1857 by Oliver Ditson & Co., with the title ""The One Horse Open Sleigh"". In 1859 Ditson reissued it with a new cover, and the title ""Jingle Bells, Or the One horse open Sleigh."" The book _Popular Songs of Nineteenth-Century America_ (ed. Richard Jackson, Dover, 1976, ISBN 0-486-23270-0) reprints this second edition in facsimile. There is no comma between ""Jingle"" and ""bells"" in either the title or the chorus. The first verse has ""Bells on bobtail ring"" (not ""bobtails""). The word ""fun"" appears nowhere in the song: the first verse has ""Oh what sport to ride and sing / A sleighing song tonight"", and the chorus has ""Oh! what joy it is to ride / In a one horse open sleigh."" The verse tune and the words of both the verse and the chorus are nearly identical to those familiar today. The chorus tune is much less monotone than the chorus tune familiar today, but would have been too difficult for children to sing: it must have been corrupted by generations of schoolchildren into what we have now. In the same volume are facsimiles of ""Jim Crack Corn"" (the words ""Jim crack corn I don't care"" have no ""and"", and ""don't"" rather than ""I"" on the downbeat), and ""Oh My Darling Clementine"" (said to be originally a serious song; the original does not include the verse with ""And her shoes were number nine""). ""Let them eat cake!"" -------------------- The French is _Qu'ils mangent de la brioche_ (not _gateau_ as one might expect). And Queen Marie-Antoinette did *not* say this. (When famine struck Paris, she actually took an active role in relieving it.) Jean-Jacques Rousseau attributed the words to ""a great princess"" in book 6 of his _Confessions_. _Confessions_ was published posthumously, but book 6 was written 2 or 3 years before Marie-Antoinette arrived in France in 1770. John Wexler writes: ""French law obliged bakers to sell certain standard varieties of loaf at fixed weights and prices. (It still does, which explains why the most expensive patisserie will sell you a baguette for the same price as a supermarket.) At the time when this quotation originated, the law also obliged the baker to sell a fancier loaf for the price of the cheap one when the cheap ones were all gone. This was to forestall the obvious trick of baking just a few standard loaves, so that one could make more profit by using the rest of the flour for price-unregulated loaves. So whoever it was who said _Qu'ils mangent de la brioche_, she (or he) was not being wholly flippant. The idea was that the bread shortage could be alleviated if the law was enforced against profiteering bakers. I have seen this explanation quoted in defence of Marie Antoinette. It seems a pity, after all that, if she didn't say it."" Gregory Titelman, in _Random House Dictionary of Popular Proverbs & Sayings_ (1996), writes: ""Zhu Muzhi [head of the official Chinese Human Rights Study Society in the People's Republic of China] traces it to an ancient Chinese emperor who, being told that his subjects didn't have enough rice to eat, replied, 'Why don't they eat meat?'"" ""mind your p's and q's"" ----------------------- This expression, meaning ""be very careful to behave correctly"", has been in use from the 17th century on. Theories include: an admonishment to children learning to write; an admonishment to typesetters (who had to look at the letters reversed); an admonishment to seamen not to soil their navy pea-jackets with their tarred ""queues"" (pigtails); ""mind your pints and quarts""; ""mind your prices and quality""; ""mind your pieds and queues"" (either feet and pigtails, or two dancing figures that had to be accurately performed); the substitution of /p/ for ""qu"" /kw/ in the speech of uneducated ancient Romans; or the confusion by students learning both Latin and Ancient Greek of such cognates as _pente_ and _quintus_. And yes, we've heard the joke about the instruction to new sextons: ""Mind your keys and pews."" The most plausible explanation is the one given in the latest edition of Collins English Dictionary: an alteration of ""Mind your 'please's and 'thank you's"". ""more honoured in the breach than the observance"" ------------------------------------------------- From _Hamlet_, Act 1, Scene 4. Shakespeare meant ""BETTER broken than observed"", not ""more often broken than observed"". ""more than you can shake a stick at"" ------------------------------------ This 19th-century Americanism now means ""an abundance""; but its original meaning is unclear. Suggestions have included ""more than one can count"" (OED, AHD3), ""more than one can threaten"" (Charles Earle Funk), and ""more than one can believe"" (Dictionary of American English). No one of these seems easy to reconcile with all the following citations: ""We have in Lancaster as many taverns as you can shake a stick at."" (1818) ""This was a temperance house, and there was nothing to treat a friend to that was worth shaking a stick at."" (David Crockett, _Tour to the North and Down East_, 1835) ""Our queen snake was [...] retiring, attended by more of her subjects than we even dared to shake a stick at."" (1843) ""I have never sot eyes on anything that could shake a stick at that."" (= ""set eyes on anything that could compare with that"", 1843) ""[...] Uncle Sam [...] has more acres than you can throw a stick at."" (1851) ""She got onto the whappiest, biggest, rustiest yaller moccasin that ever you shuck er stick at."" (1851) A connection with the British expression ""hold (the) sticks with"", meaning ""compete on equal terms with"" and attested since 1817, is not impossible. OED staff told me: ""The US usages in DAE do appear to have a different sense to that given in OED. [...] All the modern examples I've found on our databases conform to OED's definition so I think this is still the most common usage."" Merriam-Webster staff opined that the ""count"" interpretation ""works as well for 'as many as you can shake a stick at' [...] if you take it to mean that there is no limit to how many of the objects in question one could shake one's stick at. [...] We would consider 'A can't shake a stick at B' a different expression entirely, with a meaning similar to 'A can't hold a candle to B' [...]."" In their 1897 work _A Dictionary of Slang, Jargon & Cant_, Albert Barrere and Charles Leland suggested that Dutch immigrants originated the expression using the Dutch word _schok_ = ""to shake or hit."" ""ollie ollie oxen free"" ----------------------- At < http://www.randomhouse.com/jesse/display.cgi?970422.html >, Jesse Sheidlower writes: ""'Ollie ollie oxen free' is one of about a bajillion variants (I know -- I counted) of a phrase used in various children's games [...], especially hide-and-(go-)seek. [...] The original form of the phrase was something like 'all in free or all's out come in free', both standing for something like 'all who are out can come in free'. These phrases got modified to 'all-ee all-ee (all) in free' or 'all-ee all-ee out(s) in free'; the '-ee' is added, and the 'all' is repeated, for audibility and rhythm. ['All ye' has also been suggested as the origin.] From here the number of variants takes off, and we start seeing folk etymologies in various forms. The most common of these has 'oxen' replacing 'out(s)' in, giving 'all-ee all-ee oxen free'; with the 'all-ee' reinterpreted as the name 'Ollie' [the nickname for Oliver ...]. It's difficult to determine early dates for these expressions -- most of them weren't collected until the 1950s and later -- but based on recollections of the games, it seems that they were in common use by the 1920s, and probably earlier ('home free' is found in print in the 1890s, and the game hide-and-seek is at least four centuries old). ""peter out"" ----------- This expression meaning ""to dwindle to nothing"" is recorded from 1846, which precludes derivation ""peter"" in the sense ""penis"", an Americanism not attested until 1902. ""To peter out"" was apparently first used by American miners referring to exhausted veins of ore. The origin is uncertain. It may come from ""saltpetre"" (used in the miners' explosives, so called because it forms a salt-like crust on rocks, ultimately from Greek _petra_ = ""rock"", whence we also get ""petrify"" and ""petroleum""); or it may come from French _peter_, which literally means ""to fart"" but is used figuratively to mean ""to fizzle"" and in the phrase _peter dans la main_ = ""to come to nothing"" (this comes from the Indo-European root _*perd-/_*pezd-_, whence we get ""fart"", ""feisty"", ""fizzle"", ""partridge"", ""pedicular"", and ""petard""). ""politically correct"" --------------------- MWCD10 (1993) dates this expression 1983. But Merriam-Webster has since discovered a much earlier use, in H. V. Morton's _In the Steps of St. Paul_ (1936). The passage reads: ""To use such words would have been equivalent to calling his audience 'slaves and robbers'. But 'Galatians', a term that was politically correct, embraced everyone under Roman rule, from the aristocrat in Antioch to the little slave girl in Iconium."" Jesse Sheidlower of Random House sent me this citation from the U.S. Supreme Court decision Chisholm v. Georgia (1793): ""The states, rather than the People, for whose sakes the States exist, are frequently the objects which attract and arrest our principal attention [...]. Sentiments and expressions of this inaccurate kind prevail in our common, even in our convivial, language. Is a toast asked? 'The United States,' instead of the 'People of the United States,' is the toast given. This is not politically correct."" ""push the envelope"" ------------------- ""Push the envelope"" is now used figuratively to mean ""stretch the boundaries"". (The image is not of pushing a mailing envelope across a desk: those who push this sort of envelope do it from within. Cf. ""pressing the limits"".) On its AOL message board, Merriam-Webster Editorial Department writes: ""A sentence we spotted in a 1991 issue of the Wall Street Journal provides a typical example of the use of the phrase [...]: 'Ads...seem to be pushing the envelope of taste every day.' 'Push the envelope' in this sense is a very recent arrival on the scene, dating only from 1988 according to the evidence in our files. ""The phrase has its origins in the world of aviation, where 'envelope' has, since at least the late 60s, had the meaning 'a set of performance limits that may not be safely exceeded.' Test pilots are often called on to 'push' a new aircraft's performance envelope by going beyond known safety limits, as in determining just how fast an airplane can be flown. In 1979 Tom Wolfe's best-seller 'The Right Stuff' vividly described the life of test pilots during the 50s and 60s, and it appears that this book, and the subsequent movie, did much to popularize the notion of pushing the envelope. [Stuart Leichter reports that the words used in the movie are ""pushing the outside of the envelope""; someone should check what they were in the book.] ""The idea of an envelope as a kind of enclosing boundary is of course not new. In 1899 Arnold Bennett wrote: 'My desire is to depict the deeper beauty while abiding by the envelope of facts.'"" ""put in one's two cents' worth"" ------------------------------- This expression meaning ""to contribute one's opinion"" dates from the late nineteenth century. Bo Bradham suggested that it came from ""the days of $.02 postage. To 'put one's two cents' worth in' referred to the cost of a letter to the editor, the president, or whomever was deserving"". According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, the first-class postal rate was 2 cents an ounce between 1883 and 1932 (with the exception of a brief period during World War I). This OED citation confirms that two-cent stamps were once common: ""1902 ELIZ. L. BANKS Newspaper Girl xiv, Dinah got a letter through the American mail. She had fivepence to pay on it, because only a common two-cent stamp had been stuck on it."" On the other hand, ""two-cent"" was an American expression for ""of little value"" (similar to British ""twopenny-halfpenny""), so the phrase may simply have indicated the writer's modesty about the value of his contribution. ""rule of thumb"" --------------- This term for ""a simple principle having wide application but not intended to be strictly accurate"" dates from 1692. A frequently repeated story is that ""rule of thumb"" comes from an old law regulating wife-beating: ""if a stick were used, it should not be thicker than a man's thumb."" Jesse Sheidlower writes at < http://www.randomhouse.com/jesse/display.cgi?961108.html >: ""It seems that in 1782 a well-respected English judge named Francis Buller made a public statement that a man had the right to beat his wife as long as the stick was no thicker than his thumb. There was a public outcry, with satirical cartoons in newspapers, and the story still appeared in biographies of Buller written almost a century later. Several legal rulings and books in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries mention the practice as something some people believe is true. There are also earlier precedents for the supposed right of a man to beat his wife. ""This 'rule' is probably not related to the phrase 'rule of thumb', however. For one thing, the phrase is [...] attested [earlier ...]. (Of course, it's possible that it was a well-known, but unrecorded, practice before Buller.) Another problem is that the phrase 'rule of thumb' is never found in connection with the beating practice until the 1970s. Finally, there is no semantic link [... from what was presumably a very specific distinction to the current sense 'rough guideline']. The precise origin of 'rule of thumb' is not certain, but it seems likely to refer to the thumb as a rough measuring device ('rule' meaning 'ruler' rather than 'regulation'), which is a common practice. The linkage of the phrase to the wife-beating rule appears to be based on a misinterpretation of a 1976 National Organization of Women report, which mentioned the phrase and the practice but did not imply a connection. There is more information about this, with citations from relevant sources, at the Urban Legends Archive."" Thumbs were used to measure *lots* of things (the first joint was roughly one inch long before we started growing bigger, and French _pouce_ means both ""inch"" and ""thumb""). The phrase may also come from ancient brewmasters' dipping their thumb in the brew to test the temperature of a batch; or from a guideline for tailors: ""Twice around the thumb is once around the wrist..."" For a definitive rule of thumb, see the paper ""Thumb's rule tested: Visual angle of thumb's width is about 2 deg."" by Robert P. O'Shea in _Perception_, 20, 1991, pp. 415-418. ""shouting fire in a crowded theater"" ------------------------------------ This is from the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Schenck v. U.S. (1919), setting limits on the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Junior, wrote: ""The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic."" ""son of a gun"" -------------- dates from 1708; therefore, NOT son of a ""shotgun marriage"", which is only recorded from 1922. Possibly, it means ""cradled in the gun-carriage of a ship""; allegedly, the place traditionally given to women on board who went into labour -- the only space affording her any privacy and without blocking a gangway -- was between two guns. Or it may mean more simply ""son of a soldier"". ""spit and image""/""spitting image"" --------------------------------- These phrases mean ""exact likeness"". ""Spitting image"" is first recorded in 1901; ""spit and image"" is a bit older (from the late 19th century), which seems to refute the explanation ""splitting image"" (two split halves of the same tree). An older British expression is ""He's the very spit of his father"", which Eric Partridge, in his _Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English_ (Routledge, 1950) traces back to 1400: ""He's ... as like these as th'hads't spit him."" Other languages have similar expressions; e.g., the French say _C'est son pere tout crache_ = ""He is his father completely spat."" Alternative explanations are ""so alike that even the spit out of their mouths is the same""; ""speaking likeness""; and a corruption of ""spirit"". ""There's a sucker born every minute"" ------------------------------------ Those of P. T. Barnum's acquaintances who mentioned the subject were unanimous in insisting that he never said this. The closest thing to it that can be found in Barnum's writings is: ""I said that the people like to be humbugged when, as in my case, there is no humbuggery except that which consists in throwing up sky-rockets and issuing flaming bills and advertisements to attract public attention to shows which all acknowledge are always clean, moral, instructive, elevating, and give back to their patrons in every case several times their money's worth"" (the Bridgeport Standard, 2 Oct. 1885). Captain Alexander Williams, a New York City police inspector at the time, attributed ""There's a sucker born every minute, but none of them ever die"" to Joseph Bessimer, a notorious confidence trickster of the early 1880s known to the police as ""Paper Collar Joe"". See _P. T. Barnum: the Legend and the Man_, by A. H. Saxon (Columbia University Press, 1989). ""There is a Sucker Born Every Minute"" is the title of one of the songs in the 1980 Broadway musical _Barnum_ by Jim Dale. ""to all intents and purposes"" ----------------------------- This cliche (meaning ""practically"") is a shortening of the legal phrase ""to all intents, constructions, and purposes"" (found in an act adopted under Henry VIII in 1547). The corruption ""for all intensive purposes"" is frequently reported. ""wait for the other shoe to drop"" --------------------------------- This phrase means ""to await an event causally linked to one that one has already observed"". In the form ""drop the other shoe"", meaning ""say the next obvious thing"" or ""end the suspense"", it dates from the early 20th century. It derives from the following joke: A guest who checked into an inn one night was warned to be quiet because the guest in the room next to his was a light sleeper. As he undressed for bed, he dropped one shoe, which, sure enough, awakened the other guest. He managed to get the other shoe off in silence, and got into bed. An hour later, he heard a pounding on the wall and a shout: ""When are you going to drop the other shoe?"" Markus Laker reports that The Goon Show (a 1950s BBC radio comedy) made reference to this. The character Eccles was an idiot and a bit of a freak. *CLONK* ""What's that noise?"" *CLONK* ""Oh, that's just Eccles taking his boots off."" *CLONK* ""Wherefore art thou Romeo?"" --------------------------- ""Wherefore"" means ""why"", not ""where"". ""whole cloth"" (notes by Ellen Rosen) ------------- The phrase ""made out of whole cloth"" (and variants) currently means ""utterly without foundation in fact, completely fictitious."" MWCD10 gives only this sense for ""whole cloth"" and dates it 1840. The phrase did not always have this connotation, however. The OED has citations for ""whole cloth"" from 1433 on. Its first definition is ""a piece of cloth of the full size as manufactured, as distinguished from a piece that may be cut off or out of it for a garment, etc."" This sense is still used by people who sew or quilt, who use ""whole cloth"" to mean ""uncut fabric"". The OED also gives several citations for the phrase ""cut (or made) out of whole cloth"". The earliest citation is from 1579. These citations indicate that for roughly 300 years, the phrase was used to connote entirety, but not falsehood (an example from 1634: ""The valiant Souldier ... measureth out of the whole cloath his Honour with his sword"". This positive sense of ""whole cloth"" persisted in England until at least the beginning of this century (a citation from 1905: ""That Eton captain is cut out of whole cloth; no shoddy there"".) Before the Industrial Revolution, few people had ready access to whole cloth. Cotton had to be picked (or sheep sheared); the cotton or wool had to be washed and picked over; the material had to be spun into thread, and the thread woven into cloth. Cloth was therefore precious and frequently reused. A worn-out man's shirt would be cut down to make a child's shirt; the unworn parts of a woman's skirt would be reused to make quilts; etc. Also, homespun fabric was not very comfortable to wear. Even after the Industrial Revolution, ready-made whole cloth was sufficiently expensive that many people could not afford to use new cloth for everything. Therefore, to have a piece of clothing made out of whole cloth must have been very special, indeed: something new, not something hand-me-down; something that hadn't been patched together from disparate, often unmatched pieces; maybe even something comfortable. So describing something as being made from whole cloth would mean that it had never existed as a garment before, and that it was something special, something wondrous -- one's Sunday best, or better. The meaning of the phrase ""made out of whole cloth"" appears to have begun to change in the United States in the first half of the 19th century. The OED labels the falsehood sense ""U.S. colloquial or slang"", and provides a citation from 1843: ""Isn't this entire story ... made out of whole cloth?"" The change of meaning may have arisen from deceptive trade practices. Charles Earle Funk suggests that 19th-century tailors advertising whole cloth may really have been using patched cloth or cloth that was falsely stretched to appear to be full-width. Alternatively, the modern figurative meaning of ""whole cloth"" may depend on a lie's having sprung whole _ex nihilo_, having no connection with existing facts. All-newness distinguishes garments and lies made out of whole cloth. This is a positive characteristic for clothes, but not for the average tissue of lies and deception. A Web search done by Michael Papadopoulos ( papadop@peak.org ) indicates (a) that the original British usage has not been left behind by the British and (b) that ""the opposite US usage meaning 'completely fictitious' is neither the only US usage nor the dominant one."" ""the whole nine yards"" ---------------------- This phrase, meaning ""all of it, everything"", dates from at least the 1950s. The origin is a matter for speculation. 9 yards is not a particularly significant distance either in football or in the garment business (a man's three-piece suit requires about 7 square yards of cloth, and cloth is sold in bolts of 20 to 25 yards). The phrase may refer to the capacity of ready-mix concrete trucks, alleged to average about 9 cubic yards. Some people (e.g., James Kilpatrick in _Fine Print: Reflections on the Writing Art_) have satisfied themselves that the concrete-trucks explanation is the correct one; but I haven't seen the evidence. And Matthew Jetmore has unearthed some evidence to the contrary, a passage from the August 1964 issue of _Ready Mixed Concrete_ Magazine: ""The trend toward larger truck mixer units is probably one of the strongest and most persistent trends in the industry. Whereas, just a few years ago, the 4 1/2 cubic yard mixer was definitely the standard of the industry, the average nationwide mixer size by 1962 had increased to 6.24 cubic yards, with still no end in sight to the demand for increased payload."" The phrase is covered by Cecil Adams in _More of the Straight Dope_, pp. 252-257. A ""canonical collection"" of explanations has been compiled by ""Snopes"" ( snopes@netcom.com ). Michael Nunamaker writes that a friend of his in the U.S. Air Force suggested a World War II origin: ""According to him, the length of the ammunition belt (feeding the machine guns) in the Supermarine Spitfire was nine yards. Therefore, when a pilot had shot all his ammunition he would say he had 'shot the whole nine yards'."" ""You have another think coming"" ------------------------------- ""If you think that, you have another think coming"" means ""You are mistaken and will soon have to alter your opinion"". This is now sometimes heard with ""thing"" in place of ""think"", but ""think"" is the older version. Eric Partridge, in _A Dictionary of Catch Phrases_, gives the phrase as ""you have another guess coming"", ""US: since the 1920s, if not a decade or two earlier"". Clearly ""think"" is closer to ""guess"" than ""thing"" is. The OED gives a citation with ""think"" from 1937, and no evidence for ""thing"". Merriam-Webster Editorial Department writes: ""When an informal poll was conducted here at Merriam-Webster, about 60% of our editors favored 'thing' over 'think,' a result that runs counter to our written evidence."" ==================================================================== WORDS FREQUENTLY SOUGHT ----------------------- words ending in ""-gry"" ---------------------- Yes, questions like this belong in rec.puzzles , not here, but in a desperate attempt to reduce the volume of queries, I give here the answer from the rec.puzzles archive: THERE IS NO COMMON THIRD WORD ENDING IN ""-GRY"". Aside from ""angry"" and ""hungry"" and words derived therefrom, there is only one word ending with ""-gry"" in W3: ""aggry."" However, this word is defective in that it is part of a phrase ""aggry beads"". The OED's usage examples all talk about ""aggry beads"". Moving to older dictionaries, we find that ""gry"" itself is a word in Webster's Second Unabridged (and the OED): gry, n. [L. gry, a trifle; Gr. gry, a grunt] 1. a measure equal to one-tenth of a line. [Obs.] (Obs. = obsolete) 2. anything very small.

This puzzle has been plaguing AOL since at least mid-1995, and more recently Usenet. It is often presented with embellishments such as ""you use it every day, and if you've listened closely, I've already told you the answer."" A post by jackper@aol.com gives a clue to the origin of this version: | I heard this riddle 20 years ago from a fiddle player. He got it | from his wife who taught pre-school. It was worded slightly | differently from the version that got onto the radio recently. As | I remember it from 1975: | | Think of words ending in 'gry'. Angry and hungry are two of them. | There are only three words in the English language. What is the | third word? The word is something that everyone uses every day. | If you have listened carefully, I have already told you what it is. | | The answer, I remember, was 'language' (the first two words being | 'the' and 'English'). A person who doesn't know the trick and asks someone else to try the puzzle will almost certainly change the wording, unwittingly making it insoluble. It appears that one of these changed versions made it into circulation on phone-in radio shows. Other trick answers, each allegedly original, are ""what"" (as in ""What is the third word?""), ""say"" (with ""g or y"" pronounced to sound like ""g-r-y"" in the question), and ""gry"" (to satisfy the statement that the word has just been used). words without vowels -------------------- When I was 6 years old, my schoolmistress said, ""There are no words in the English language that have no vowels. To anyone who can tell me a word with no vowels, I'll give threepence."" I raised my hand and said, ""Shhh."" The mistress looked at me very contemptuously and said, ""He thinks 'shhh' is a word. But it isn't; it's just a sound that people make."" A couple of weeks later, the mistress asked the class, ""Has anyone thought of a word without any vowels yet?"" Another little boy raised his hand and said, ""My. Try. Sky."" ""No,"" replied the mistress, ""'y' is a vowel there. But I'll give you threepence anyway, because you've been thinking."" After all these years, I *still* think my example was better than that other little boy's. I WANT MY THREEPENCE! The word ""vowel"" has more than one meaning. From MWCD10: # 1: one of a class of speech sounds in the articulation of which # the oral part of the breath channel is not blocked and is not # constricted enough to cause audible friction; broadly : the one # most prominent sound in a syllable 2: a letter or other symbol # representing a vowel -- usu. used in English of a, e, i, o, u, and # sometimes y Children are usually taught sense 2, because meaning 1 would be harder for them to grasp. But since sense 2 is not that *useful* except as a rough approximation to sense 1 (and on the U.S. TV show _Wheel of Fortune_), ""words without vowels"" in sense 2 (such as ""cwm"", ""nth"", ""Mrs."", and ""TV"") are not terribly interesting. Words without vowels in sense 1 (such as ""shhh"", ""psst"", and ""mm-hmm"") *are* interesting, because they tell us something about the phonology of the language.

Look 'em up. :-) (A good book to look them up in is _The Random House Dictionary for Writers and Readers_, by David Grambs, Random House, 1990, ISBN 0-679-72860-0. There are also two lists on the WWW: < http://www.uky.edu/ArtsSciences/Classics/rhetoric.html > and < http://www.csi.uottawa.ca/~kbarker/ling-devices.html >.) ""I won't mention..."" -------------------- Mentioning something by saying you aren't going to mention it (e.g., ""I won't mention his laziness"") is called ""apophasis"" or ""preterition"". Joseph Shipley's _Dictionary of World Literary Terms_ (The Writer, 3rd ed., 1970) says: ""~apophasis~ Seeming to deny what is really affirmed. Feigning to pass by it while really stressing it"" (e.g., ""not to mention his laziness""): ""paralepsis. Touching on it casually: metastasis. Pretending to shield or conceal while really displaying (as Antony with Caesar's will in Shakespeare's play): parasiopesis. [...] ~autoclesis~ (P. the self-inviter). Introduction of an idea by refusing before being requested, intending thus to awaken (and respond to) a demand, as Antony with the will in _Julius Caesar_."" ""Paralepsis"" is more often spelled ""paraleipsis"" (which is the Greek form) or ""paralipsis"". A few sources (such as The Century Dictionary, and the Universal English Dictionary by Henry Cecil Wyld) do not support a distinction between apophasis and paraleipsis. names of ""&"", ""@"", and ""#"" -------------------------- (The lists of names given in this entry are DELIBERATELY incomplete. For a comprehensive list of formal and informal terms for these and many other keyboard symbols, see the entry ASCII in the Jargon File.) ""&"" is called ""ampersand"". The longest name for ""@"" is ""commercial at sign""; the first and last words may each be omitted. The official ANSI/CCITT name is ""commercial at"". There are actually two typeset symbols, with distinct histories, for which we use ""#"" in ASCII text. One (with horizontal strokes slanted and thicker than the vertical strokes) is the musical ""sharp (sign)"", as in ""the key of C# major"". The other (with vertical strokes slanted) is called ""number (sign)"", as in ""the team finished in the #5 position"", or ""pound (sign)"", referring to weight, as in ""a 5# bag of potatoes"". Although use of this sign to denote weight has declined, ""pound"" is the most widely used name for it in the U.S. But it confuses people who expect that term to mean the symbol for sterling currency (located on many British keyboards in the same place as ""#"" is found on U.S. keyboards). ""Number sign"", adopted by ANSI/CCITT, is unambiguous, but little known in both the U.K. and the U.S. Computer-users in the U.K. usually call the symbol a ""hash"", from its appearance (reminiscent of marks one might make when chopping). Finally, in a failed attempt to avoid the naming problem by creating a new name, the term ""octothorp(e)"" (which MWCD10 dates 1971) was invented for ""#"", allegedly by Bell Labs engineers when touch-tone telephones were introduced in the mid-1960s. ""Octo-"" means eight, and ""thorp"" was an Old English word for _village_: apparently the sign was playfully construed as eight fields surrounding a village. Another story has it that a Bell Labs supervisor named Don MacPherson coined the word from the number of endpoints and from the surname of U.S. athlete James Francis Thorpe. Merriam-Webster Editorial Department told me: ""All of the stories you record are known to us, but the evidence does not line up nicely behind any one of them."" ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."" ---------------------------------------------- Sentences containing every letter of the alphabet are called ""pangrams"", or ""holalphabetic sentences"". They are covered in part 2 of the language section of the rec.puzzles archive. ""Take the prisoner downstairs"", said Tom condescendingly. --------------------------------------------------------- A sentence where a description of the manner of saying refers punningly to quoted matter is called a ""Tom Swifty"". (Some people restrict ""Tom Swifty"" to sentences where the pun is in an adverb, and use ""croaker"" for sentences where the pun is in the verb: ""'I'm dying', he croaked."") The name ""Tom Swifty"" derives from the Tom Swift adventure series for boys (whose enthusiastic use of adverbs modifying ""said"" they parody); but the form goes back to the 19th century, and was used by James Joyce in _Ulysses_ (1922). I maintain the Canonical Collection of Tom Swifties, with over 900 entries. It's available on the WWW as: < http://www.scripps.edu/pub/dem-web/misrael/TomSwifties.html > or by e-mail from me. A sentence where words following a quotation humorously reinterpret what is quoted (""'Eureka!' said Archimedes to the skunk"") is called a ""wellerism"", after the character Sam Weller in Dickens' novel _The Pickwick Papers_. The form predates Dickens. What is the opposite of ""to exceed""? ------------------------------------ ""To fall short of"". ""To trail"" can also come in handy when both things are moving. What is the opposite of ""distaff side""? --------------------------------------- ""Spear side"", but I prefer Truly Donovan's suggestion, ""datstaff side"". :-) What do you call the grass strip between the road and the sidewalk? ------------------------------------------------------------------- This varies regionally. Terms include ""verge"" (U.K.); ""nature strip"" (south Australia); ""berm"" (New Zealand); ""parkway"" and ""planting strip"" (western U.S.); ""parking strip"", ""parking"", ""tree belt"", ""tree lawn"", ""lawn strip"", ""devil strip"", ""boulevard"", and ""terrace"" (all eastern U.S.); ""city strip"" and ""boulevard strip"" (both Canada); and ""long acre"" (rural Ireland and elsewhere). Most of these terms have other meanings also. ==================================================================== MISCELLANY ---------- What is a suggested format for citing online sources? ----------------------------------------------------- Michael Quinion has an essay on this. It is available at his WWW site < http://clever.net/quinion/words/citation.htm > or by e-mail from him ( michael@quinion.demon.co.uk ). Does the next millennium begin in 2000 or 2001? ----------------------------------------------- Many of us will be happy if people can even spell ""millennium""! As Mark Brader has noted in the relevant entry in the news.announce.newusers FAQ ""Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet"", the A.D. calendar system was devised before ""origin 0 counting"" was invented. The first year assumed (incorrectly, as most scholars now believe) to have begun after Jesus' birth was A.D. 1, not A.D. 0; the previous year was 1 B.C. This gives us the millennia 1-1000, 1001-2000, and 2001-3000. On the other hand, the convenience of grouping together years, decades, and centuries having like digits is obvious. The standard joke is that those who say the next millennium will begin in 2001 and not 2000 are right, but they'll be missing one hell of a party! What will we call the next decade? ---------------------------------- ""2000"" and ""2001"" will probably be called ""two thousand"" and ""two thousand and one"", under the influence of the movie _2001: A Space Odyssey_; but after that, people will probably gradually switch to calling the years ""twenty oh three"", etc. As for what we'll call the decade 2000-2009 (comparable to ""the eighties"", ""the nineties"", etc.), who knows? Several people have suggested ""the aughts"", but this may be too archaic to bear revival. No, don't bother snowing me with other proposals; let's just wait and see. Fumblerules (""Don't use no double negatives"", etc.) --------------------------------------------------- _Fumblerules_ was the title of a 1990 book by William Safire containing such rules, but it seems these rules should actually be credited to George L.

English is Tough Stuff ---------------------- This poem is properly titled ""The Chaos"", and appeared in _Drop Your Foreign Accent - Engelse Uitspraakoefeningen_, by G. Nolst Trenite (5th rev. ed., H. D. Tjeenk Willink & Zoon, 1929). It can be found at: < http://www.tue.nl/lava/people/henri/tough.html > What is the phone number of the Grammar Hotline? ------------------------------------------------ There are many such. Of the two most prominent, one (""The National Grammar Hotline"") is run by Michael Strumpf, Professor of English at Moorpark Community College, Moorpark, California, and author of _Painless, Perfect Grammar: Tips from the Grammar Hotline_ (Monarch, 1985, ISBN 0-671-52782-7). The phone number is (805) 378-1494; the hours are irregular, but he will return calls. The other (""The Write Line"") is run by Richard Francis Tracz, Chairman of the English Department at Oakton Community College in Des Plaines, Illinois, and author of _Dr. Grammar's Writes from Wrongs: A supremely authoritative guide to the common and not-so- common rules of the English language_ (Vintage, 1991, ISBN 0-679-72715-9). The phone number is (708) 635-1948, and the hours are 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Central Time while classes are in session. His e-mail address is "" richard@oakton.acs.edu "". In general, Prof. Strumpf gives more conservative advice than Prof. Tracz.

For one thing, every > dictionary I've ever examined has been all too full of > *un*intentional errors, and they could serve the same purpose. On the other hand, books such as _Who's Who_ do have fictitious entries. How reliable are dictionaries? ------------------------------ A former senior lexicographer at a major dictionary publisher has told me by e-mail: ""An editor seldom sits down and composes new text for any lemma out of whole cloth. Even for a supposedly thoroughgoing revision, what usually happens is that you take the text from your previous edition, apply whatever mechanical formatting changes have been decreed, and then check two or three of your competitors' books to see if they've said anything different from what you have. (Right -- it's no accident that all the major dictionaries look so much alike!) This practice can lead to some pretty awful results; the nautical terminology in [a dictionary that I worked on] was based on 19th-century square-rigger stuff originally copied out of OED -- and evidently *they* didn't have any sailors on the staff either! ""In any case, the citation files don't normally even get looked at unless something in the entry raises a red flag -- it's a new word, or a member of some class of words marked for special scrutiny (e.g., gender-specific terms or personal pronouns), or has been tagged for special attention as the result of someone's query somewhere along the line."" For more on the frightening extent to which dictionaries copy from one another, see ""The Genealogy of Dictionaries"", in Robert Burchfield's _Unlocking the English Language_ (Hill and Wang, 1992, ISBN 0-374-52339-8), pp. 147-165. Thus we see that a consensus of dictionaries does not necessarily indicate a consensus of actual research. Nor does disagreement among dictionaries necessarily indicate actual scholarly controversy: it may simply be that the lexicographers were too overworked and deadline-pressed to copy from one another more thoroughly. Samuel Johnson's observation, ""Dictionaries are like watches; the worst is better than none, and the best cannot be expected to go quite true"", remains highly pertinent today, despite the improvements in both products since Johnson's day. etymologies of personal names ----------------------------- See < http://www.engr.uvic.ca/~mcampbel/etym >. How did ""Truly"" become a personal name? --------------------------------------- by Truly Donovan ( truly@lunemere.com ) My name is my mother's nickname. Her name was Etrulia, which she acquired from an aunt-by-marriage, Etrulia (a.k.a. Truly) Shattuck. Beyond that, the origins of the name are lost. Truly Shattuck, however, was a woman of some notoriety, having first come to public attention, according to family legend, when her mother, Jane, was tried and acquitted for having murdered her young daughter's seducer. This would have been in Northern California, perhaps the Bay Area, around the turn of the century, I would guess. At some point thereafter Truly went on the stage, and was supposedly a Floradora girl. Somehow (family legend is very murky about this), she got herself married to a staid Scottish lawyer from Michigan (during which time my mother was born and named for her), but that was not a very enduring union. During my mother's childhood, she was known to be running a chicken farm in California. Her last brush with notoriety, which we learned about from her obituary published in the Chicago Tribune, was when she was arrested for shoplifting a very expensive dress at Marshall Field. Her defense was that she needed to look for a job and hadn't anything to wear. Anyway, it sure beats being named for a fatuous character in a bad Ian Fleming children's book. trademarks ---------- (None of the information here has been verified from legal sources.

erect, tear down Why do we say ""30 years old"", but ""a 30-year-old man""? ------------------------------------------------------ by Rich Alderson This pattern goes all the way back to Old English (alias Anglo-Saxon). It's the same reason many of us say that someone is ""5 foot 2"" rather than ""5 feet 2"". The source of the idiom is the old genitive plural, which did not end in -s, and did not contain a high front vowel to trigger umlaut (""foot"" vs ""feet""). When the ending was lost because of regular phonetic developments, the pattern remained the same, and it now seemed that the singular rather than the plural was in use. sentences grammatical in both Old English and Modern English ------------------------------------------------------------ Mitchell and Robinson's _A Guide to Old English_ (OUP, 5th edition, 1992, ISBN 0-631-16657-2) starts its ""Practice Sentences"" section with a few of these. A sampling: Harold is swift. His hand is strong and his word grim. Late in life he went to his wife in Rome. Grind his corn for him and sing me his song. He swam west in storm and wind and frost.

Opinions differ as to its initial meaning: one possibility is that it meant 10^12 to mathematicians and 10^9 to others. The first use in England recorded in the OED is by Locke in 1690: the quotation clearly shows that for Locke it meant 10^12. This remained the standard British meaning until the middle of the 20th century. Early in the 18th century, French arithmeticians revised its meaning to 10^9, and the U.S., acquiring the word directly from the French, took this meaning also. French has the word ""milliard"", also meaning 10^9, which had largely displaced ""billion"" by the beginning of the 20th century. (""Milliard"" is given in English dictionaries, though most of the few people who know it would think of it as a French word.) By 1948, the use of large numbers in the sciences and the declining value of the franc led the French Weights and Measures conference to recommend the return of ""billion"" to its original meaning of 10^12. This became official policy in 1961. For more information on international usage, see < http://clever.net/quinion/words/numbers.htm >. By this time, the British had been introduced to the U.S. meaning. MEU warns us that the usages differ; MEU2 (1965) suggests: ""Since _billion_ in our sense is useless except to astronomers, it is a pity that we do not conform [to the U.S. meaning]"". The British Government took this advice in 1974, when Prime Minister Harold Wilson announced to the House of Commons that the meaning of ""billion"" in papers concerning Government statistics would thenceforth be 10^9, in conformity with U.S. usage. Despite this, the U.S. meaning is still rare outside journalism and finance, its introduction having served merely to create confusion. Throughout the U.K., a common response to the question ""What do you understand by 'a billion'?"" would be: ""Well, I mean a million million, but I often don't know what other people mean."" Few schoolchildren are confident of the meaning, though, again, 10^12 seems to be preferred. Many well-educated adults, aware of both meanings, either avoid the term altogether or use it only in the unambiguous phrases ""English billion"" and ""American billion"". English-speaking South Africans, Australians, and New Zealanders are similarly reluctant to use a term that has become ambiguous. Scientists have long preferred to express numbers in figures rather than in words, so it is easy to avoid ""billion"" in contexts where precision is required. The plural is still used freely with the colloquial meaning of ""a very large number"". Publications consulted: OED, Editions 1 and 2. Robert, Dictionnaire historique de la langue francaise.

Biblical sense of ""to know"" --------------------------- Some people say things like: ""It is not correct that it is the biblical meaning. The biblical meaning of a man's knowing a woman is such total love as to know all about her, which includes intercourse. It is not an evasive term for one-night stands."" Not so. The Biblical sense of ""to know"" is simply ""to fuck"", as you can see from Genesis 19:4-8 : ""[...] the men of Sodom compassed the house round [...] and they called unto Lot, and said unto him, 'Where are the men which came in to thee this night? Bring them out unto us, that we may KNOW them.' And Lot [...] said [...] 'Behold now, I have two daughters which have not KNOWN man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you [...]'"" The Hebrew word here is _yada_ (yod daleth ayin). The Greek word _gino:sko:_ is used similarly in the New Testament. Postfix ""not"" ------------- Is assertion followed by ""not"" a recent American neologism? NOT! ""I love thee not"" was the regular word order in Shakespeare's day. Examples including the pause are harder to find; the earliest that we've found is in Irish dialect, in Ellis Parker Butler's _Pigs is Pigs_ (1905): ""Proceed to collect,"" he said softly. ""How them cloiks do loike to be talkin'! _Me_ proceed to collect two dollars and twinty-foive cints off Misther Morehouse! I wonder do thim clerks _know_ Misther Morehouse? I'll git it! Oh, yes! 'Misther Morehouse, two an' a quarter, plaze.' 'Cert'nly, me dear frind Flannery. Delighted!' _Not!_"" Clay Blankenship found a citation from ""circa 1906"" in the comic strip _Buster Brown_ on page 32 of _The Comics: An Illustrated History of Comic Strip Art_ by by Jerry Robinson (Putnam, 1974). A girl in the strip says, ""Swell time I had -- NOT!"" Jesse Sheidlower writes: ""Jonathan Lighter and I wrote an article about this in _American Speech_ in 1993, which included the 1905 E. P. Butler quote as well as an earlier (1900) quote from George Ade that's somewhat equivocal; we also cited a number of later but still early uses including F. Scott Fitzgerald, Edmund Wilson, and others. Since then we've found an even earlier one (1893 _Princeton Tiger_ (Mar. 30) 103: An Historical Parallel-- Not.) as well as more early examples (though the Buster Brown example is new to us)."" e. e. cummings wrote a poem beginning: pity this busy monster manunkind not. Credit to David Murray for bringing the cummings example to our attention. And Wanda Keown found the following in Fritz Leiber's _Conjure Wife_ (1943): ""Norman thought: Country parsonage? Healthy mental atmosphere, not!"" The construction owes its present popularity to the ""Wayne's World"" skits in the U.S. TV show _Saturday Night Live_. The first use in SNL was in the 1970s in a skit with Jane Curtin and Steve Martin. (It is said that the writers of these skits encountered the practice when it was a fad in their high school in the Toronto suburb of Scarborough.) Another phrase that comes from SNL is ""Isn't that special?"" (the Church Lady, played by Dana Carvey). Origin of the dollar sign (notes by Mark Brader) ------------------------- It is sometimes said that the dollar sign's origin is a narrow ""U"" superimposed over a wide ""S"", ""U.S."" being short for ""United States."" This is wrong, and the correct explanation also tells why the $ sign is used both for dollars and for pesos in various countries. The explanation is not widely known, maybe because not many people would think to look for it in a book called _A History of Mathematical Notations, Volume II: Notations Mainly in Higher Mathematics_ by Florian Cajori (published in 1929 and reprinted in 1952, by Open Court Press). Cajori acknowledges the ""U.S."" theory and a number of others, but, after examining many 18th-century manuscripts, finds that there is simply no evidence to support those theories. Spanish pesos were also called piastres, Spanish dollars, and pieces of eight. (The piece of eight was so called because its value was eight reales. Some countries made one-real coins by slicing pieces of eight into eight sectors; the still-current U.S. slang ""two bits"" for a quarter of a dollar may refer to this, although ""bit"" denoting any small coin -- as in ""threepenny bit"" -- was already in use.) The coins were circulated in many parts of the world, much as U.S. dollars are today. The coins were so well known that, when the U.S. got around to issuing its own silver coinage (U.S. dollar coins first appeared in 1794), it simply replicated the Spanish unit's weight and hence value, and even one of its names; so it was natural to use the same symbol. Since three of the four names given above for the Spanish dollar start with p (and pluralize with s), it was natural for abbreviations like p and ps to be used. Sometimes ps was written s as P -- P with a superscript s. The superscript was a common way of rendering abbreviated endings of words -- we see vestiges of it today in the way some people write ""10th"". Now, what happens if you write P with a superscript s *fast*, because it's part of a long document that you have to hand-write because you can't wait for the typewriter to be invented, let alone the word-processor? Naturally, you join the letters. Well, now look at the top part of the resulting symbol. There's the $ sign! Reduce the P to a single stroke and you have the form of the $ with a double vertical; omit it altogether and you get the single vertical. And yes, both these forms are original. Cajori reproduces 14 $ signs from a diary written in 1776; 11 of them have the single stroke, which was the more common form to the end of the century, and 3 have the double stroke. Although the $ sign originally referred to a Spanish coin, it was the revolting British -> American colonists who made the transition from ps to the new sign. (This is apparently also why we write $1 instead of 1$; it mimics the British use of the pound sign.) So, while it did not originally refer to the U.S. dollar, the symbol does legitimately claim its origins in that country. ==================================================================== SPELLING -------- Spelling reform --------------- The Simplified Spelling Society has a WWW page at: < http://www.les.aston.ac.uk/sss > Only a small minority of alt.usage.english participants favour spelling reform. Joke about step-by-step spelling reform --------------------------------------- The original version of this joke was apparently by Mark Twain, and can be found at < http://comedy.clari.net/rhf/jokes/87/2094.10.html >. A more elaborate version, by Dolton Edwards (probably a pseudonym), which gives no credit to Twain, was published in the science fiction magazine _Astounding_ in 1946 and can be found at < http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~d92-abj/humor/spelling_reform.html >. Various other versions are in circulation. What is ""ghoti""? (notes by Jim Scobbie) ---------------- It's an alternative spelling of ""chestnut"". :-) O.K., it's ""fish"", re-spelled by a Victorian spelling-reform advocate to demonstrate the inconsistency of English spelling: ""gh"" as in ""cough"", ""o"" as in ""women"", ""ti"" as in ""nation"". ""Ghoti"" is popularly attributed to George Bernard Shaw. But Michael Holroyd, in _Bernard Shaw: Volume III: 1918-1950: The Lure of Fantasy_ (Chatto & Windus, 1991), p. 501, writes that Shaw ""knew that people, 'being incorrigibly lazy, just laugh at spelling reformers as silly cranks'. So he attempted to reverse this prejudice and exhibit a phonetic alphabet as native good sense [...]. But when an enthusiastic convert suggested that 'ghoti' would be a reasonable way to spell 'fish' under the old system [...], the subject seemed about to be engulfed in the ridicule from which Shaw was determined to save it."" We have not been able to trace the name of the ""enthusiastic convert"". Bill Bedford ( billb@mousa.demon.co.uk ) writes: ""I seem to remember a film/TV clip of Shaw himself referring to this - but don't ask for chapter and verse."" It has also been suggested that ""ghoti"" could be a spelling of ""huge"": ""h"" having its usual value, [h]; ""g"" making [j], the sound of ""y"" in yes, after the *following* consonant as in ""lasagne""; ""o"" = [u] as in ""move"", ""t"" = [d] as in ""Taoism"", and ""i"" = [Z] as in one pronunciation of ""soldier"". In the same vein is ""ghoughpteighbteau"": P hiccough O though T ptomaine A neigh T debt O bureau Supposedly, this is an example of how awful English spelling is, and why it ought to be reformed. In fact, it argues that English spelling is kind and considerate, and easy. Why? Because ""potato"" *isn't* spelled ""ghoughpteighbteau"". It's spelled ""potato""! O.K, O.K., ""neigh"" isn't spelt ""ne"", and we can get into all the old arguments, but these really fun examples overstate the case and strike those of us opposed to spelling reform as self-defeating. I before E except after C (notes by Mark Wainwright) ------------------------- This old schoolroom spelling rule is supposed to help remember the spelling of vowels pronounced /i:/, the long ""e"" sound of ""feed"". It has no value for words where the vowel is pronounced in any other way, the key fact which people bemused by many ""exceptions"" to the rule usually do not realise. A version often cited in the U.K. makes the restriction clear: When the sound is /i:/, it's I before E except after C. A common U.S. version: ... or when pronounced /eI/ as in ""neighbour"" and ""weigh"". is misleading, as ""ei"" has many other pronunciations, as in, for instance, ""height"", ""heifer"", and ""forfeit"". The rule also fails to apply to names (Sheila, Keith, Leigh, etc.). ""I before E"": Properly applied, the rule is a very useful guide for people who are not naturally excellent spellers; those who are may look out for themselves. To an RP speaker, the exceptions in common use are very few: they are ""seize"", ""inveigle"", ""caffeine"", ""protein"", and ""codeine"". (The last three were originally pronounced as three-syllable words.) Other dialects pronounce a few other -ei- words with /i:/, making extra exceptions: ""either"" and ""neither"" (RP vowel: /aI/, as in ""pie""), ""geisha"" and ""sheik(h)"" (RP: /eI/, as in ""say""), and ""leisure"" (RP: /E/, as in ""get""). (Of course, derivatives of the above words, such as ""seizure"", ""decaffeinate"", and ""sheik(h)dom"", are spelled similarly.) There are many exceptions in Scots, so speakers with a large Scots vocabulary may as well give up on this rule. The vowel in ""weir"" and ""weird"" is usually quite different, as comparison of ""weird"" and ""weed"" will show; for most speakers, ""weird"" has a diphthong. ""except after C"": Fowler, who called the rule ""very useful"", noted: ""The c exception covers the many derivatives of Latin _capio_ [= ""take""], which are in such common use (_receive_, _deceit_, _inconceivable_; cf. _relieve_, _belief_, _irretrievable_) that a simple rule of thumb is necessary."" For most Britons, /i:/ after C is always ""ei"" rather than ""ie"", except in ""specie"" and ""species"". Americans generally pronounce -cies and -cied in words derived from -cy endings (e.g., ""fancies"" and ""fancied"" from ""fancy"") with /i:/ rather than /I/, making these words exceptions. Still, few people have any difficulty pluralizing -y, so such speakers should still be able to extract some value from the rule, by the application of a little common sense. How do you spell ""e-mail""? -------------------------- In September 1995, Jeff Adams ( jeffa@kurz-ai.com ) did a search on ""a corpus of about 40 million words of Usenet news articles"", and counted the following forms: email 19371 e-mail 15359 E-mail 7572 Email 5906 E-MAIL 3659 E-Mail 2986 EMAIL 1269 EMail 521 eMail 303 e-Mail 42 eMAIL 5 and several other forms each rare enough to be probably ""just dumb typos"". Total without hyphen: 27378 Total with hyphen: 29622 Bob Cunningham searched articles posted to alt.usage.english between mid-May and mid-September 1995, found 604 instances of ""e-mail"" and 235 of ""email"". A 1995 poll of subscribers to the Copyediting-L mailing list produced 60 votes for ""e-mail"" and 24 votes for ""email"". In favour of ""e-mail"", it has been argued that there are analogous nonce compounds in ""e-"" (e.g, ""e-vote"", ""e-boyfriend""); that the hyphen is a clue that the word is stressed on the first syllable; and that _email_ is French for ""enamel"". In favour of ""email"", it has been argued that this is the spelling used in the Jargon File, and that there has been a general trend away from hyphenating words once they become established. Many dictionaries favour ""E-mail"", which can be justified by analogy with such forms as ""A-bomb"", ""C-section"", and ""G-string"". Why is ""I"" capitalized? ----------------------- The Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology (Wilson, 1988, ISBN 0-8242-0745-9) says: ""~I~ _pron._ 1137 _i;_ later _I_ (about 1250, in _The Story of Genesis and Exodus_); developed from the unstressed form of Old English (about 725) _ic_ singular pronoun of the first person (nominative case). Modern and Middle English _I_ developed from earlier _i_ in the stressed position. _I_ came to be written with a capital letter thereby making it a distinct word and avoiding misreading handwritten manuscripts. In the northern and midland dialects of England the capitalized form _I_ appeared about 1250. In the south of England, where Old English _ic_ early shifted in pronunciation to _ich_ (by palatalization), the form _I_ did not become established until the 1700's (although it appears sporadically before that time)."" Diacritics ---------- You can use diaereses in words like ""naive"" and ""cooperate"" if you want. The use of diacritics has been declining because of Linotypes and computers that didn't allow them. ""-er"" vs ""-re"" -------------- The following words are spelled with ""-re"" in the U.K. but with ""-er"" in the U.S.: accoutre(ment), calibre, centre, fibre, goitre, litre, louvre, lustre (brilliance, but ""luster"" one who lusts) , manoeuvre (""maneuver"" in the U.S.), metre (for the distance and for poetic and musical metre, but ""meter"" for the measuring device), meagre, mitre, nitre, ochre, philtre, reconnoitre, sabre, sceptre, sepulchre, sombre, spectre, (amphi)theatre, titre. (The British ""metre""/""meter"" distinction is retained when the various prefixes are prepended: ""kilometre"", ""speedometer"", etc. ""Micrometer"", a device for measuring minute things, is distinguished from ""micrometre"", a micron. ""Theatre"" has some currency in the U.S., especially in names of specific theatres.) The following words are spelled ""-re"" in both the U.K. and the U.S.: acre, cadre, euchre, lucre, massacre, mediocre, ogre, wiseacre. (The ""-cre"" and ""-gre"" words may have been kept that way in order to keep the ""c"" and ""g"" hard, although there are counterexamples such as ""eager"" and ""meager"".) In none of these words is ""-er"" the agent suffix (as in ""revolver"") or the comparative suffix (as in ""longer""). Most of these words come from Latin through French, and they took the ""-re"" form in French because the ""e"" was not part of the word root. (The adjectives tend to be in ""-ral"", ""-ric"", and ""-rical"", rather than ""-eral"", ""-eric"", or ""-erical"".) But many similar words (cloister, diameter, neuter, number, sinister) were changed from ""-re"" to ""-er"" in English. The process has merely happened faster in the U.S. than in Britain. ""-ize"" vs ""-ise"" --------------- The following verbs are always spelled with ""-ise"": advertise, advise, arise, chastise, circumcise, comprise, compromise, demise, despise, devise, disguise, enterprise, excise, exercise, (dis/en)franchise, improvise, incise, merchandise, premise, reprise, revise, rise, supervise, surmise, surprise, televise. (At least, they're *almost* always spelled that way: ""advertize"", ""merchandize"", and ""surprize"" ARE listed in some U.S. college dictionaries, but are not the usual forms anywhere.) A useful mnemonic is that, except ""improvise"", none of these make nouns in ""-isation"", ""-ization"", or ""-ism"". (Exceptions in the other direction are ""aggrandize"", ""capsize"", ""recognize"", and verbs from which no verb ""-ization"" has been formed because the parent or cognate noun already had the desired meaning.) ""Apprise"" means ""to inform""; ""apprize"" means ""to appreciate"". U.K. ""prise open"" = U.S. ""pry open"". ""Exorcize"" is most commonly spelled ""exorcise"" in the U.S., though ""exorcize"" (which Fowler would have recommended) also occurs. For other verbs, ""-ize"" is usual in the U.S. and recommended by Fowler, although ""-ise"" is also used in the U.K. Fowler recommends ""-yse"" in ""analyse"", ""catalyse"", and ""paralyse"", although ""-yze"" is usual in the U.S. doubling of final consonants before suffixes -------------------------------------------- The general rule is that when one of the suffixes ""-ed"", ""-ing"", ""-er"", and ""-est"" is applied to a word ending in one consonant preceded by exactly one vowel, the consonant is doubled if and only if the word's final syllable is stressed: ""omitted"" but ""edited""; ""preferred"" but ""offered"". Americans obey the stress rule when the final consonant is ""l"": ""repelled"" but ""traveled"". Britons double ""l"" regardless of stress: ""repelled"", ""travelled"". Detailed discussion of doubling can be found in MEU under ""-B-, -BB-"", ""-C-, -CK-"", ""-D-, -DD-"", etc. Where to put apostrophes in possessive forms -------------------------------------------- by Peter Moylan PRONOUNS The ONLY personal possessive pronoun with an apostrophe is ""one's"". .----------------------------------------------------------------------. | The words ""his"", ""its"", ""whose"", ""their"" do NOT contain apostrophes. | | Nor do words like ""hers"", ""ours"", ""yours"", ""theirs"". | | (Would you say ""mi'ne""?) | '----------------------------------------------------------------------' The forms ""it's"", ""they're"", and ""who's"" are contractions for ""it is"" (or ""it has""), ""they are"", and ""who is"" (or ""who has"") respectively. They have nothing to do with possessive pronouns. The apostrophe does occur in the possessive case of indefinite pronouns (""anybody's"", ""someone's"", and so on). NOUNS 1. The standard rule: Use 's for the singular possessive, and a bare apostrophe after the plural suffix -s or -es for the plural possessive. For example: Singular Plural Nominative dog dogs Possessive dog's dogs' 2. Nouns ending with an [s] or [z] sound (this includes words ending in ""x"", ""ce"", and similar examples): The plural suffix is -es rather than -s (unless there's already an ""e"" at the end, as in the ""-ce"" words), but otherwise the rule is the same as above: Singular Plural Nominative class classes Possessive class's classes' (The possessive plural is what is wanted in ""the Joneses'"". This is short for ""the Joneses' house"", which is not ""the Jones's house"".) There are, however, examples where the singular possessive suffix is a bare apostrophe: Singular Plural Nominative patience patiences Possessive patience' patiences' (In most such examples, the plural is rarely used.) For nouns in this category, many people would consider the 's suffix and the bare apostrophe to be acceptable alternatives. The rules listed below may be taken as ""most common practice"", but they are not absolute. A. The 's suffix is preferred for one-syllable words (grass's) or where the final syllable has a primary or secondary stress (collapse's); B. The bare apostrophe is preferred: - for words ending in -nce (stance'); - for many classical names (Aristophanes', Jesus', Moses'); - where the juxtaposition of two or more [s] sounds would cause an awkwardness in pronunciation (thesis'). C. Usage is divided in the situation where the final [s] or [z] sound falls in an unstressed syllable (octopus'/octopus's, phoenix's/phoenix', and so on). The question of which suffix is correct arises less often than one might imagine. Instead of saying ""the crisis' start"" or ""the crisis's start"", most native speakers of English would say ""the start of the crisis"", thus avoiding the problem. 3. Plurals not ending in s: Use 's for the possessive plural (men's, people's, sheep's). HISTORY For those who want to know where the apostrophe came from, here is how it probably happened. Some of this is well documented, some is guesswork on my part. Back in the days when English had many more inflections than it now has, the most common suffix for the genitive singular was -es. (There were several noun declensions, so that not all nouns fitted this pattern; but this could be considered to be the ""most regular"" case.) For example: mann (=man), mannes (=of the man). Over time there developed a tendency to stop pronouncing the unstressed ""e"", so that ""mannes"" became ""mann's"". The apostrophe stands for the omitted letter. (Modern German still has -es as the genitive suffix for many nouns. The Germans did not stop pronouncing their unstressed ""e""s, so the case suffix is still written as -es.) Pronouns were also inflected, but not in the same way. (They were all fairly irregular, as they still are today.) The genitive form of ""hit"" (=it) was ""his"" (=its). As ""his"" evolved into ""its"", there was no ""e"" to drop, therefore no logical reason to insert an apostrophe. The ""its"" and ""it's"" forms did coexist in the 17th and early 18th century, but today the ""its"" form is considered to be the only correct spelling. Plural nouns are harder to explain. The most common genitive plural inflection was -a, which is quite unrelated to our modern -s'. My best guess is that most of the old plural suffixes were replaced by -s under the influence of French; and that subsequently the rules for forming singular possessives were extended to the plurals. If this is what happened, then a hypothetical -s's plural possessive suffix would immediately collapse to -s', in the same way as for many singular nouns ending in ""s"". There was in any case a long period where spelling was a lot less standardized than it is today, so one should not think in terms of any sort of ""standard rule"" existing during the transitional period. NOTE FOR NON-ENGLISH-SPEAKERS The apostrophe in these cases normally has no effect on pronunciation. Thus dogs, dog's, and dogs' all sound the same. The exception is where the apostrophe separates two ""s""s, and then it is pronounced as an unstressed schwa. Thus class's, classes, and classes' are all pronounced as /klA:s@z/. For nouns where there is some difference of opinion over whether the possessive suffix should be -'s or a bare apostrophe (that is, those nouns where a final unstressed syllable ends with an [s] or [z] sound) some native speakers use a lengthened final consonant intermediate between /z/ and /z@z/. This is, however, a fine and almost inaudible distinction. OTHER COMMENTS One occasionally hears that ""John's dog"" is an abbreviation for ""John his dog"". It is more likely that the derivation went in the opposite direction, i.e.: Johnes hund => John's hound => Johnny's dog => John 'is dog with the ""John his dog"" form coming into use only briefly before disappearing from modern English. Using an apostrophe in a plural which is not a possessive form is almost never recommended by prescriptivists. The only situation where it is recommended is where visual confusion would otherwise result, as for example in the sentence ""Mind your p's and q's"". In forms like ""the 1980s"" or ""two CPUs"", apostrophes are not recommended. It is correct to use an apostrophe to indicate missing letters, in contractions like ""aren't"", ""isn't"", ""it's"" (= it is or it has). Be careful in these cases to put the apostrophe in the correct place. The apostrophe replaces the missing letter(s); it does not replace the space between words. -- misrael@scripps.edu Mark Israel"

We have suffered four terrorist attacks on innocent Londoners, we have had the terrible Sandilands tram crash and the horrific Grenfell Tower fire. And there are big challenges on the horizon.The world has become increasingly polarised with President Donald Trump in power in the US and the rise of the far right across Europe. Austerity is putting unprecedented strain and pressure on our public services.Crime is rising across Britain after eight years of cuts to the police and preventative services.And Brexit continues to pose a huge risk to our jobs, prosperity and place in the world.Londoners are also having to contend with the most anti-London government in memory.The Tories just don’t understand our city or our values and only offer more of the same austerity and cuts.Unlike Sadiq, they are devoid of new ideas or a positive vision for London.Sadiq is standing up for London’s values in the face of this increasingly polarised world, he is making progress in the hard slog of increasing opportunities across our city, and he is working to build a fairer London that works for all Londoners.Working together with politicians and councils across our city, we are determined to build on the progress a Labour administration has made over the last two years.City A.M.'s opinion pages are a place for thought-provoking views and debate.

Some observers contend that the federal government does not have adequate resources to enforce immigration law and that state and local law enforcement entities should be utilized. Others, however, question what role state and local law enforcement agencies should have in light of limited state and local resources and immigration expertise. Congress defined our nation's immigration laws in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which contains both criminal and civil enforcement measures. [...]. Indeed, several jurisdictions have signed agreements (INA §287(g)) with the federal government to allow their respective state and local law enforcement agencies to perform new, limited duties relating to immigration law enforcement. Still, the enforcement of immigration laws by state and local officials has sparked debate among many who question what the proper role of state and local law enforcement officials should be in enforcing such laws. For example, many have expressed concern over proper training, finite resources at the local level, possible civil rights violations, and the overall impact on communities. Some communities have taken steps to define or limit the involvement of local authorities in the implementation of immigration law. This report examines some of the policy and legal issues that may accompany an increased role of state and local law officials in the enforcement of immigration law.""Report Number:CRS Report for Congress, RL32270Author:"

Also at the meeting with Adelson was his wife, Miriam; Norm Coleman, the former Minnesota senator who chairs the Republican Jewish Coalition; Corry Bliss, who oversees the super PAC; and Jake Kastan, Ryan's No. 2 political aide. They laid out a case to Adelson about how crucial it is to protect the House.Story Continued BelowAs a federally elected official, Ryan is not permitted to solicit seven-figure political donations. When Ryan (R-Wis.) left the room, Coleman made the ask and secured the $30 million contribution.CLF did not respond to requests for comment. The contribution will become public later this month in the organization's campaign finance filing.Coleman said he would not discuss his dealings with Adelson.Adelson’s donation comes at a perilous moment for House Republicans, who are facing growing headwinds as they try to save their majority. With dozens of incumbents being outraised by emboldened Democratic challengers, desperate party officials have been hoping that Adelson — the party’s most prominent benefactor — would give more than he traditionally does, and earlier in the election cycle.Sign up here for POLITICO HuddleA daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.EmailSign UpBy signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

And the cash comes much earlier in the cycle: In 2016, Adelson gave CLF $10 million in August, as the campaign headed into the homestretch.Party officials have been paying Adelson their respects. In February, a number of House Republicans made their annual sojourn to Las Vegas to attend the annual retreat hosted by the Republican Jewish Coalition, an organization that Adelson helps to fund. Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) addressed the conference, and Ryan spoke by teleconference to a meeting of the group’s board.CLF is one part of a two-pronged political organization designed to protect and bolster House Republicans. CLF is a super PAC, and the American Action Network is a nonprofit that boosts center-right policies. Ryan, and John Boehner before him, have backed the groups.

EDTPRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much. I want to begin today by expressing my deep condolences to the entire Bush family on the passing of former First Lady Barbara Bush, a wonderful, wonderful person. For decades, Barbara was a titan in American life. Her presence and character were engraved into America’s identity.Her strength and toughness really embodied the spirit of our country. And her warmth and devotion earned the admiration of an entire nation and, indeed, the entire world. She was a tireless champion for literacy. She was a fierce advocate for the American family. And she was a woman of proud patriotism and profound faith.Our hearts are saddened by her passing, but our spirits are lifted by the memories of her goodness and her grace. She was a good person.Melania and I send our prayers to Barbara’s husband of 73 years — I’ll never beat that record — President George H.W. Bush; to the surviving children — Jeb, and Neil, and Marvin, Dorothy, and former President George W. Bush; and to their many wonderful grandchildren and great-grandchildren.This evening, I also want to send a message to all of the brave service members from the United States, France, and the United Kingdom who were involved in the very successful strikes on targets associated with the Syrian chemical weapons program last week. Once again, the unmatched skill of the United States military, and our great partners and allies, was demonstrated to the entire world. Missiles were shot. They tried to knock them down; they weren’t in the least successful. They hit none.The purpose of our strike was to establish a strong deterrent against the use of banned chemical weapons. Civilized nations must join together to prevent the horrors of chemical warfare and, in fact, warfare. And I think our allies really were absolutely world-class, wonderful. We thank them for their support.Today, I’m thrilled to be joined by my good friend, Prime Minister Abe of Japan. Highly respected gentleman. Prime Minister, Melania and I are honored to host you and Mrs. Abe once again at Mar-a-Lago. We’re grateful for the tremendous hospitality you showed us during our visit to your country last fall. It was a true privilege to be welcomed to the magnificent land of Japan, or as I’ve heard all my life, the Land of the Rising Sun. It’s true. So great.During our visit to Asia in November, we had tremendous success enlisting support for our campaign of maximum pressure on the North Korean regime. As you know, I will be meeting with Kim Jong-un in the coming weeks to discuss the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Hopefully, that meeting will be a great success. And we’re looking forward to it. It would be a tremendous thing for North Korea and a tremendous thing for the world. So we will be doing everything possible to make it a worldwide success, not just for the United States or South Korea or North Korea or Japan, but for the entire world.We hope to see the day when the whole Korean Peninsula can live together in safety, prosperity, and peace. This is the destiny of the Korean people who deserve and have gone through so much over the years. We hope it all works out, and we’ll be trying very hard.I want to thank the Prime Minister for his insight and support over the past year as we have pursued the dream of a peaceful, nuclear-free Korea. Shinzo, you have worked very hard, along with us and all of our people, and we thank you very much. And we’re with you. And you’re a lot closer than we are, but we’re working on this together. Thank you very much. Your support has been critical to getting us to this important moment in time. It’s a historic moment, and possibly beyond that, if it works out properly.Our discussions today reaffirmed the close cooperation between the United States and Japan on the issue of North Korea and our common defense.We will not repeat the mistakes of previous administrations. Our campaign of maximum pressure will continue until North Korea denuclearizes. We have great respect for many aspects of what they’re doing, but we have to get it together. We have to end nuclear weapons, ideally in all parts of the world. That would be a goal for all of us, to hope for and to cherish.As I’ve said before, there is a bright path available to North Korea when it achieves denuclearization in a complete and verifiable, and irreversible way. It will be a great day for them. It will be great day for the world.During my visit to Japan last fall, I met with Japanese families who endured the terrible heartbreak of having their loved ones abducted by the North Korean regime. We want to see these families reunited as soon as possible. And I know for a fact that it’s one of the truly most important things on Shinzo’s mind. We talk about it often. So important to you. And we’re going to do everything possible to have them brought back, and bring them back to Japan. I gave you that promise.The United States also supports Japan’s efforts to improve its defense capabilities, and we’re exploring ways to expedite the sale of American military equipment to Japan through the Foreign Military Sales program.We’ve stepped up our effort not only with respect to Japan, but other allies, that when they order military equipment from us, we will get it taken care of and they will get their equipment rapidly. It would be, in some cases, years before orders would take place because of bureaucracy with Department of Defense, State Department. We are short-circuiting that. It’s now going to be a matter of days. If they’re our allies, we are going to help them get this very important, great military equipment. And nobody — nobody — makes it like the United States. It’s the best in the world by far.We’re also working to improve our economic partnership by reducing our trade imbalance and removing barriers to U.S. exports. The United States is committed to free, fair, and reciprocal — very important word — trade. And we’re committed to pursuing a bilateral trading relationship that benefits both of our great countries.Prime Minister Abe and I have agreed to intensify our trade and investment consultations. Ambassador Lighthizer, who’s with us today, will take the lead for the United States.These past two days have been extremely productive. The friendship between Japan and the United States has never been closer. I truly believe it has never been closer than it is today. And the bonds between our people have never been stronger.In the months ahead, we will rely on this great friendship as we face an array of old challenges and new opportunities, and we will face them together. We will work closely on trade. We will do something having to do with the imbalance that, frankly, should have been done for years and years and years.Mr. Prime Minister, I want to thank you again for traveling to Mar-a-Lago for these important discussions and meetings. It’s been a true honor to welcome you here and to work with you toward greater security, prosperity, and peace for our two truly great and wonderful nations. And thank you for being here, Shinzo. Thank you. Thank you very much.PRIME MINISTER ABE: (As interpreted.) Mrs. Barbara Bush, the former First Lady, she has passed away. On representing the Japanese people, I would like to express my condolences to former President Bush and to all the family members. We express our heartfelt condolences.For the infinitely blue sky, refreshing and a soothing sea breeze, it was a great pleasure to be invited once again to this beautiful Mar-a-Lago and in a relaxed atmosphere to spend significant length of time with President Trump to engage in fruitful discussion in a frank and straightforward manner.About a year ago at this place, at the very moment I was at dinner with President Trump, North Korea dared to launch ballistic missiles. It is absolutely intolerable. Immediately after I said so, President Trump stepped forward in front of the camera, though it was not planned, and made one following comment: The U.S. is with our ally, Japan, 100 percent. The President sent out a message of powerful commitment to the world.Donald, your words on that occasion is still deeply etched in my mind, together with my wonderful memory of my stay here in Mar-a-Lago. With one single comment, you demonstrated a rather superbly strong Japan-U.S. alliance, which has a history of longer than half a century.And once again express my deepest respect for your remarkable leadership. A year also has passed since then. The situation surrounding North Korea, due to the decisive decision by President Trump on the first-ever U.S.-North Korea summit, is at a historical turning point. The past mistakes should never be repeated. On this point, President Trump and I were in full agreement.On the occasion of the 1994 framework agreement or the 2005 Six-Party Talks agreement, North Korea committed to abandon nuclear weapons development. But those promises were broken, and the effort of the international community to engage in dialogue were all entirely exploited to buy time to develop nuclear weapons and missiles.Based on such lessons learned, both the U.S. and Japan, together with the international community, we will demand that for all weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles complete a verifiable and irreversible dismantlement of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles to North Korea.By envisioning multiple scenarios, we carefully thought out our policies and directions at a concrete and detailed level. Just because North Korea is responding to dialogue, there should be no reward. Maximum pressure should be maintained, and actual implementation of concrete actions towards denuclearization will be demanded. This firm policy has once again been completely shared between us.On this occasion, we also agree to continue our effort towards the earlier resolution of the top priority matter of abduction. Just now, President Trump, on this spot here, has mentioned that with the return of the abductees, maximum effort will be made. With a clear promise just made here, we are deeply encouraged, Donald.Half a year ago, when you visited our country, you listened intently to each and every family members of the abductees. You listened carefully and kindly said you would like to help. Your image on that occasion is indelibly etched in the eyes and minds of many of the Japanese people. Going forward, we wish to work closely with the United States and towards the immediate return of all abductees. We are determined to strengthen our approach vis-à-vis North Korea.North Korea has diligent workforce and is blessed with resources. If North Korea advances in the right direction, they can make their populations richer. If North Korea takes the right path under the Japan-North Korea Pyongyang Declaration, there could be a possible path to settle the unfortunate past and to normalize diplomatic relationship.For that to happen, a comprehensive resolution of multiple concerns — including abduction, nuclear, and missile — will be the fundamental precondition. Through the upcoming historic U.S.-North Korea summit, we certainly hope for a breakthrough in this situation.The Japan-U.S. alliance is not just limited to the sphere of security, but it also contributes to the peace and prosperity of the world, as well as the region. On the economic front, Japan and the U.S. will take a lead and develop a free and fair market in the Indo-Pacific region.I spent some time with President Trump to discuss ways to make that happen in a candid manner. First of all, we must further strengthen the economic ties between the two countries. Under President Trump, exports from the U.S. — including energy, aircraft, amongst others — have already been increasing significantly. Further, following the bold tax reform by President Trump, Japanese companies’ investments in the U.S. have been gaining momentum, which is creating a large number of jobs in the U.S. and contributing to the expansion of the exports from the U.S.In order to benefit both Japan and the U.S., we’ll further expand trade and investment between the two countries. Building upon that foundation, we’ll aim to realize economic development in the free and open Indo-Pacific region based on fair rules. To make that happen, at this time, President Trump and I agreed to start talks for free, fair, and reciprocal trade deals.And Minister Motegi will be responsible for these talks on the side of Japan. Minister Motegi and the U.S. Trade Representative Lighthizer, I hope, will have very fruitful discussions.Over the last two days, President Trump and I have spent more than seven hours together over meals and playing golf, while at the same time, we were able to hold extremely fulfilling talks in a relaxing atmosphere. The last few days were the time when I was able to further deepen my friendship and relationship of trust with President Trump.Lastly, I’d like to express my sincere appreciation to Donald and First Lady Melania for their wonderful hospitality, as well as the continued warmhearted welcome of the people of the United States. Thank you.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much, Shinzo. Appreciate it.Questions. Mark Landler? Mark.Q Thank you very much, Mr. President. Mr. Prime Minister, nice to see you again.Mr. President, you sent your CIA Director to Pyongyang a couple of weeks ago, and he returned without three Americans who are being detained there, and also without any other visible signs of concessions the North Koreans had made to the United States in advance of your meeting with Mr. Kim.My question is: Do you intend or are you willing to sit down with Kim Jong-un if Americans are still being held in North Korea? And will you insist on other tangible concessions from the North Koreans in return for gestures like sending a potential future Secretary of State to North Korea?And for the Prime Minister, if I may — you, a moment ago, alluded to new trade talks between your minister and Mr. Lighthizer. Should we interpret that to mean that you are now open to negotiating a bilateral trade deal between the United States and Japan?And then, a second question. Japan is the only major American ally that was not exempted from the steel tariffs. Did you ask the President to exempt Japan? And if so, how did he reply?PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you, Mark, very much. The fact is that they do have three prisoners. We have been talking about them. We are negotiating now. We are doing our very best. As you know, they’ve been there a long time and it’s harsh treatment. We fought very hard to get Otto Warmbier back. And when we came back, he was in very, very bad condition. It was a very sad event.We are likewise fighting very diligently to get the three American citizens back. I think there’s a good chance of doing it. We’re having very good dialogue. We will keep you informed. But we are in there and we are working very hard on that.We have come a long way with North Korea. We were, as you know — and when I say “we”, for many years, they’ve been talking to North Korea and nothing has happened. This should have been taken care of by past administrations when they were not nearly so far along. But we put unbelievably powerful sanctions on, and many other things.I want to thank publicly President Xi of China, who has done more for us than he’s done for any other administration, or than any leader of China has done for any President or administration. He has clogged up the border, as you know, and he’s done it very, very powerfully. He would tell you himself that he never thought he would go to this extent, and I appreciate that very much. But it’s put a lot of pressure on.As you know, 93 percent of the goods coming into North Korea come in from China. And President Xi understands that this is a very important set of months that are lying ahead. He doesn’t want to see a Korea — North Korea, or any Korea — that has nuclear weapons either. So he’s also fighting for China when it comes to this. But he has been terrific.Can he be better? I always say yes, he can be better. I said, “President, you’ve been great. Can you be better? Yes.” But he’s been very good, and it’s had a big impact. And what we’ve done has had a big impact.So we’ve never been in a position like this with that regime, whether it’s father, grandfather, or son. And I hope to have a very successful meeting. If we don’t think it’s going to be successful, Mark, we won’t have it. We won’t have it. If I think that it’s a meeting that is not going to be fruitful, we’re not going to go. If the meeting, when I’m there, is not fruitful, I will respectfully leave the meeting, and we’ll continue what we’re doing or whatever it is that we’ll continue. But something will happen.So I like always remaining flexible, and we’ll remain flexible here. I’ve gotten it to this point. President Moon of South Korea was very generous when he said, if it weren’t for Donald Trump, the Olympics would have been a total failure. It was my involvement and the involvement of our great country that made the Olympics a very successful Olympics. If you look at ticket sales prior to what took place with respect to North Korea, it was going to be a big problem, and it turned out to be a very successful Olympics.So we’ve gotten us here, and I think we’re going to be successful. But if for any reason I feel we’re not, we end. Okay? Thank you, Mark.PRIME MINISTER ABE: (As interpreted.) Between President Trump and myself, for benefitting both Japan and the U.S., we have expanded the investment and trade based on the foundation — open and fair economic development in the Indo-Pacific region. We have agreed to start talks for free, fair, and reciprocal trade deals at this time.As for Section 232, Japanese steel and aluminum would not exert any negative influence on the U.S. security. Rather, it’s a position that the quality of Japanese product is high. Many of those products are difficult to be replaced with, and they are greatly contributing to the U.S. industries and employment. So recognizing that, we’d like to continue to respond to this matter going forward.PRESIDENT TRUMP: I will add that the 232, having to do with aluminum and steel tariffs — 30 percent, in one case; 25 percent and 10 percent — that it’s got us to the bargaining table with many nations, and, in other cases, they’re paying. And it’s billions of dollars coming into the coffers of the United States. So they’ve been, actually, very important.If you look at what we did with solar panels, where we put 30 percent tariffs on, we had 32 companies opened with pretty new plants, because it’s a relatively new industry. Of the 32 plants, 30 were closed and 2 were not doing well. Since putting the tariffs on, the two are doing very well, seven or eight are going to be opening, and a lot more will open.Same thing with washing machines. We were, believe it not, having washing machines dumped all over the country. We put tariffs on, and we’re now opening up and expanding companies that create and make — which is actually a very big business — washing machines and dryers.So the workers of our country know what’s happening. We have companies moving up from Mexico — automobile companies — and they’re building new plants in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Kentucky, and expanding their plants. A lot of things are happening. Our country is doing very, very well. And it’s going to continue. It’s going to continue. A lot of great momentum.If you look at any chart, the enthusiasm for business in our country is at an all-time high. And unemployment — for African American workers, for Hispanic workers, unemployment is at an all-time low. In history — in the history of our country, it’s at the lowest point. If you look at unemployment for women, it’s at an 18-year low. So we’re very proud of our achievements.And starting know, as you see, over the last few weeks, the tax cuts are kicking in. And it’s a beautiful thing to see. And people are spending money where they didn’t have the money to spend previously. So we’re very happy with that.Shinzo, please.Q (As interpreted.) I’m (inaudible). I’d like to ask a question about how to handle North Korean issues. Prime Minister Abe, the coordination for holding summits between the South Korea and North Korea, as well between the U.S. and North Korea, is underway. There is a concern in Japan that Japan may be left behind. So how are you going to proceed with dialogue with North Korea?President Trump, you talked about the abduction issue. Are you going to consider the nuclear weapons disarmament the same level as abduction issue?PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, maybe I’ll go first. Abduction is a very important issue for me because it’s very important to your Prime Minister. I will tell you that we were having dinner last night, and he started talking about abduction and how horrible it was. And his level of enthusiasm was unbelievable. And I said to him right then and there last night at the table, I said we will work very hard on that issue, and we will try and bring those folks back home. Very, very hard.PRIME MINISTER ABE: (As interpreted.) Whether Japan will be left behind, that is not at all the case. In the last two days, together with President Trump, we have spoken about North Korea. There will be the inter-Korean talks, and a U.S.-North Korea summit is planned. We have gone into really in-depth discussion. About our policy and direction, we have reached agreement.Regarding the upcoming U.S.-North Korea summit, we hope that it will lead to the resolution of weapons of mass destruction, nuclear missile, and of course, more than anything else, we hope it will be a historic summit that will lead to the resolution of abduction. And for that purpose, I have seriously and thoroughly discussed it with President Trump, and we have fully agreed about our direction going forward, in particular regarding abduction. As Donald has explained in our tête-à-tête, we have thoroughly discussed about this matter.Last year, the President met with the victims of the abduction, as well as the family members. And the families’ feelings have been strongly felt and understood by the President, and he has given a very encouraging comment that he would appeal towards the resolution. I highly appreciate this encouraging comment. This gives us huge courage — a very encouraging comment. And for the families of the abductees, again, this is a massively, powerfully encouraging comment.And, therefore, going forward between Japan and the U.S., or between the trilateral of Japan, U.S., and South Korea, we will cooperate closely and do our utmost to resolve the issues of North Korea, including abduction, nuclear, and missile.PRESIDENT TRUMP: And we will be very loyal to Japan. Thank you.Jennifer Jacobs.Q Thank you, Mr. President. On the Mueller probe, have you concluded that it’s not worth the political fallout to remove either Special Counsel Mueller or Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein?And, Prime Minister Abe, did the President ask you to provide more funding for U.S. troops in Japan? And what agreement did you reach here in Florida on buying more military equipment from the U.S.?PRESIDENT TRUMP: Jennifer, I can say this — that there was no collusion, and that’s been so found, as you know, by the House Intelligence Committee. There’s no collusion. There was no collusion with Russia, other than by the Democrats — or, as I call them, the “obstuctionists,” because they truly are obstructionists.So we are giving tremendous amounts of paper. This was a — really a hoax created largely by the Democrats as a way of softening the blow of a loss, which is a loss that, frankly, they shouldn’t have had from the standpoint that it’s very easy for them. They have a tremendous advantage in the Electoral College. And this is what it is, and this is where it came from.You look at the kind of money that was paid. Probably some went to Russia. You look at Podesta having a company in Russia where nothing happened and people don’t talk about it. You look at the fact that their server — the DNC server — was never gotten by the FBI. Why didn’t the FBI take it? The FBI takes what they want. They go in; they wouldn’t get the server.This is a hoax. As far as the investigation, nobody has ever been more transparent than I have instructed our lawyers — “Be totally transparent.” I believe we’ve given them 1.4 million pages of documents, if you can believe this. And haven’t used — that I know of, or for the most part — presidential powers or privilege.So we are hopefully coming to the end. It is a bad thing for our country — very, very bad thing for our country. But there has been no collusion. They won’t find any collusion. It doesn’t exist.As far as the two gentlemen you told me about, they’ve been saying I’m going to get rid of them for the last three months, four months, five months. And they’re still here. So we want to get the investigation over with, done with, put it behind us. And we have to get back to business with negotiating with this gentleman and plenty of others. But this gentleman is a very tough negotiator, and we have to focus on that.Thank you very much.PRIME MINISTER ABE: (As interpreted.) Regarding the U.S. forces expenses, of the U.S. forces in Japan, the safety and security of Japan, and the peace and stability of the Far East is being maintained.And for the forward deployment strategy of the United States in the Asia Pacific — in terms of the presence, their presence in Japan is very meaningful and significant. In the case of Japan, across the world, in terms of paying for the expenses, Japan accounts for the largest percentage of stationing compared to other countries. And the President understands very well.Q I’m Taketa (ph) with Sankei News. I have a question for President Trump. This is the follow-up question for 232. So you don’t have any intention to exempt Japan at this point in time? And President Trump and Prime Minister Abe, with regard to trade, you are going to establish new talks for trade. Is it going to be in the direction of FTA or TPP? So I’d like to hear the views from both of you.PRIME MINISTER ABE: (As interpreted.) So at this time, between President Trump, talks for free, fair, and reciprocal trade deals to initiate that has been agreed. As for this talk, Minister Motegi and Ambassador Lighthizer, USTR, will be the representative. And Mr. Asō and Vice President Pence, the U.S.-Japan Economic Dialogue where they will be receiving the report of these talks.As for these talks, I thought that it would be the interest of both of the countries that the investment and trade between the two countries will be expanded. And we are going to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific economic growth.So on the U.S. side, that they are interested in a bilateral deal, we are aware of that. But at any rate, our country’s position is that TPP is the best for both of the countries. And based on that position, we shall be dealing with the talks.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much. The United States has a massive trade deficit with Japan. It’s anywhere from $69 billion to $100 billion a year. That’s massive by any standpoint. We are doing 232 on steel and aluminum. And if we can come to an arrangement on a new deal between the United States and Japan, that would certainly be something we would discuss — aluminum tariffs and steel tariffs. And I would look forward to being able to, at some point in the future, take them off.But right now we have a deficit that’s a minimum of $69 billion a year. Japan sends us millions and millions of cars, and we tax them virtually not at all. And we don’t send so much product because we have trade barriers and lots of other things. So these are the things that the Prime Minister and I are going to be discussing over the next short period of time.The media has not covered the TPP correctly. I don’t want to go back into TPP, but if they offered us a deal that I can’t refuse, on behalf of the United States, I would do it. But I like bilateral. I think it’s better for our country. I think it’s better for our workers. And I much would prefer a bilateral deal, a deal directly with Japan. We already have a deal with 6 of the 11 nations in the TPP. So we already have trade deals, and the others we can make very easily. They’re all calling wanting to make a deal. But we think that’s much better for us.So unless they offer us a deal that we cannot refuse, I would not go back into TPP. We’ll see what happens. But in the meantime, we’re negotiating. And what I really prefer is negotiating a one-on-one deal with Japan. And that’s where we are right now, and I will say that the representatives who are sitting right here are extraordinarily competent and very tough — those representing Japan. And we will hopefully, in the not-too-distant future, have a very good deal — good for Japan and good for the United States. Okay?Thank you all very much. We appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you very much.PRIME MINISTER ABE: Thank you.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much, Shinzo.Q Anything sanctions on Russia, sir?Q Why no sanctions on Russia, sir?Q Mr. President, why did you delay the sanctions on Russia?PRESIDENT TRUMP: Yeah, we’ll do sanctions. As soon as they very much deserve it, we will have — that is a question. There has been nobody tougher on Russia than President Donald Trump. Between building up the military, between creating tremendous vast amounts of oil. We raised billions and billions of dollars extra in NATO. We had a very, very severe — we were talking about it a little while — fight in Syria recently, a month ago, between our troops and Russian troops, and that’s very sad. But many people died in that fight. There has been nobody tougher than me.With the media, no matter what I did, it’s never tough enough because that’s their narrative. But Russia will tell you, there has been nobody tougher than Donald Trump. And then, the other night, we had a strike in Syria, which was absolute precision.I leave it with this, with all of that said: If we can get along with China, and if we can get along with Russia, and if we can get along with Japan and other nations, that’s a good thing, not a bad thing. Just remember that. If we got along with other nations, that’s good, not bad.Thank you very much everybody.END

Although this may not be true, those who have looked into it know that strange anomalies have surrounded the Moon for decades. “Contemplation without investigation is the height of ignorance,” a quote attributed to Einstein holds true here. If you actually do some independent research, you might be quite shocked with what you find, especially when it comes to the credibility of the sources.As far back as 1970, two well-respected members of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Michael Vasin and Alexander Shcherbakov, created a hypothesis suggesting that the Moon is a spaceship created by unknown beings. Fast forward to today, and we have former high-ranking members of the military and intelligence agencies sharing their knowledge with regards to strange things that are happening on the Moon. A few examples are listed in the articles linked below.Take for example Timothy Good, one of the world’s leading UFO researchers, who has lectured at universities, schools, and many organizations, including the Institute of Medical Laboratory Sciences, the Royal Canadian Military Institute, the Royal Geographical Society, the Royal Naval Air Reserve Branch, the House of Lords All-Party UFO Study Group, and the Oxford and Cambridge Union societies.Good says that a former member of MI6 revealed her conversation with Neil Armstrong at a NASA conference, when he confirmed there were “other” spacecraft on the Moon when Apollo 11 landed in 1969. Armstrong also confirmed the CIA was behind the coverup. He also goes into more detail about it in this 2013 lecture.Dr. John Brandenburg, the Deputy Manager of the Clementine Mission to the Moon, which was part of a joint space project between the Ballistic Missile Defence Organization (BMDO) and NASA, has also made some fascinating revelations. The mission discovered water at the Moon’s poles in 1994 ( Source: page 16 of 18 )( source )( source ). But, according to Brandenburg , the Clementine Mission had an ulterior agenda:“The Clementine Mission was a photo reconnaissance mission basically to check out if someone was building bases on the moon that we didn’t know about. Were they expanding they expanding them? . . . Of all the pictures I’ve seen from the moon that show possible structures, the most impressive is a picture of a miles wide recto-linear structure. This looked unmistakably artificial, and it shouldn’t be there. As somebody in the space defence community, I look on any such structure on the moon with great concern because it isn’t ours, there’s no way we could have built such a thing. It means someone else is up there.”The quote above comes from the documentary, “Aliens on the Moon.”Here is an interesting lecture Brandenburg gave with regards to strange anomalies that have been found on Mars. You can read more about that in detail here .Members of the Society For Planetary SETI Research (SPSR) have recently published a paper in the Journal of Space Exploration about certain features on the far side of the moon that appear in the crater Paracelsus C. Titled “Image Analysis of Unusual Structures on the Far Side of the Moon in the Crater Paracelsus C,” it argues that these features might be artificial in origin, meaning someone other than a human being built them and put them there. It suggest that life could be contained within the moon as well.Keep in mind that there is an entire side of the moon we can never see, unless we use probes. A new study published in the Journal of Space Exploration titled “The Mounds of Cydonia: Elegant Geology, or Tetrahedral Geometry and Reactions of Pythagoras and Dirac?” has added to the already robust evidence pointing to “artificial surface interventions” on Mars. The paper also mentions that it adds to the evidence which exists already that strongly point to artificial surface interventions.So you see, you’re not crazy if you see a headline above and actually contemplate if it’s true or not.Related CE Articles that go into more detail about the moon:

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly is planning payback for President Obama’s dismissing Mr. Netanyahu’s objections to the Iran nuclear deal last year. Mr. Netanyahu is said to be rallying moderate Arabs to thwart Mr. Obama’s bid to become the Secretary-General of the United Nations after he leaves the White House next year. Mr. Obama has already discussed the issue with Republican, Democratic and Jewish officials in the United States, according to Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Jarida. Mr. Netanyahu recently is said to have gotten wind of Obama’s plans which he calls the Obama Project. “Wasn’t eight years of having Obama in office enough?” Mr. Netanyahu is quoted in the Kuwaiti daily as telling associates. “Eight years during which he ignored Israel? Townhall.com reports: Further gripes Israel has with President Obama include the U.S. “moving closer to the Muslim Brotherhood, toppling the regime of Hosni Mubarak, and attempts to ally itself with political Islam,” the paper quotes a Netanyahu aide as saying. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s term expires in early 2017, making Obama’s bid for the position a possibility. Last year after his speech at West Point, some pointed out that he sounded an awful lot like he was campaigning for the role.

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/13/sentinel/headline-about-greitens-accuser-sex-case-doesn/	"""Greitens accuser admits photo session may have been a ‘dream.’ """	half-true	['Fake news']	https://sentinelksmo.org/	https://sentinelksmo.org/breaking-greitens-accuser-admits-photo-session-may-dream/	2018/04/13	Tweet on TwitterOne of the most contentious issues in the State of Missouri’s case against Gov. Eric Greitens has been the whereabouts of an incriminating photo that he is alleged to have taken and disseminated.A deposition of the woman (K.S.) in question, the woman who accused Greitens of taking a nude photo of her, reveals one new shocking bit of evidence. The woman may have dreamed up the incident at the heart of the criminal case.The St. Louis Circuit Attorney has contrived a case against Gov. Greitens that Lewis Carroll would have been hard pressed to imagine.The defense team’s April 8 motion to compel immediate production of all exculpatory evidence reports the following exchange.When the defense counsel asked K.S., “Did you ever see [Greitens] in possession of a camera or phone?” she answered: “Not to my knowledge. I didn’t see him with it.”The question was then asked, “And as you sit here now, you cannot state under oath that you ever saw him in possession of a camera – with a camera or a phone?”K.S. replied, “Correct.”The counsel then asked, “And you can’t say you saw it on his person, you can’t say you saw him put it down in the kitchen, take it from the kitchen, or put it down anywhere in the basement. Those are all correct statements, are they not?”K.S. answered, “Yes. I cannot say.”Trying to salvage the state’s case, the Assistant Circuit Attorney later asked K.S., “Did you see what you believed to be a phone?”Here comes the shocker. K.S. answered, “… I haven’t talked about it because I don’t know if it’s because I’m remembering it through a dream or I – I’m not sure, but yes, I feel like I saw it after that happened, but I haven’t spoken about it because of that.”K.S. remembered the photo incident “through a dream”? Memories recovered through dreams have led to some of the great injustices in recent jurisprudence. To her credit, K.S. struggled to give honest answers to the questions she was asked, but her honesty has undone the remaining threads of a quickly unraveling case.As the defense counsel observed in the motion, the state was aware that recovered memories may have accounted for K.S.’s recollection, but state prosecutors failed to turn that obviously exculpatory evidence over to the defense. K.S. also failed to so share this revelation with the House committee investigating Greitens.Defense counsel insists that there is additional exculpatory evidence the prosecution has yet to turn over to the defense and has asked the court to order Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner to produce it.TAGS

I hurried back as soon as I could, but while there, I had a powerful experience that reminded my why we fight.As I walked through the Capitol rotunda, I gazed up at the carvings and paintings that tell America’s glorious story…… smiling that Stephen F. Austin’s and Sam Houston’s statues were the only ones holding a rifle or a sword. I was reminded about the truth of all that’s exceptional about America and Texas.Standing just outside the Oval Office, I was overcome with pride and appreciation for all that is good and real in America.I thought about my family and children––sixth-generation Texans––who I want to see grow up in a Texas that still looks like the state I fell in love with as a child.I share this because sometimes it helps to look up from the heat of battle and take a moment to remember the core issues we fight so hard to defend.Only together, with your financial partnership , can we defeat those that threaten our freedom and fight for what we love :We fight to preserve religious liberty.We fight for privacy: the right of our wives and daughters to use intimate facilities like locker rooms, bathrooms and showers with those of their own biological sex.We fight for marriage as the lifelong union of one man and one woman.We fight for the definition of gender: the truth that God created us male and female.We fight for life itself: the right of our most helpless human beings to simply live––and be spared the barbaric murder called abortion.​Powerful threats on our liberty to worship, believe and live according to our beliefs are striking every part of the faith community––from every side.Religious liberty lies at the deepest core of America’s founding motives.

We take action because our Christian faith compels us to love people and stand for His righteousness.If we don’t continue to fight with all the strength we have, we will fail the calling that I believe God has given us at this critical moment in time.Make no mistake––the war against our Christian values is raging like never before.

http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2018/apr/12/richard-cordray/cordray-point-about-increase-firearm-deaths-ohio/	"""Since 1999, firearm deaths in Ohio have risen 58 percent."""	mostly true	['Guns']	https://secure.cordrayforohio.com/	https://secure.cordrayforohio.com/page/content/on-the-issues/	2018/04/12	"Veterans and ServicemembersOhio's Opioid CrisisA growing Ohio public health crisis is ravaging our families and our communities. Over 17,000 Ohioans died of drug overdoses from 2010-2016, many attributable to abuse of prescribed opioids. Researchers at OSU now estimate the cost of the crisis to Ohio at somewhere between $6.6 billion and $8.8 billion every year. This crisis is killing about 14 Ohioans every day. Many others are effectively disabled by addiction, unable to function or to qualify for many jobs. The number of opioid-related deaths among African-Americans has more than tripled since 2010. Also unconscionable is the fact that 28% of children taken into the state’s protective custody over this period had parents using opioids. Of the children in state care under the age of one, 70% had opioid-involved parents. We must get illegal drugs like heroin and meth off our streets. But as many local law enforcement leaders have made clear, we cannot simply arrest our way out of this problem. Overprescription of painkillers must be restricted. Treatment and prevention efforts must also be front and center. Recent activity forcing the closure of opioid pill mills without adequate human service resources in place have undercut our efforts to address these issues effectively. Local first responders must have the resources and tools they need for prevention, education, and law enforcement efforts stemming from this crisis. Cutting local government funding for first responders has been shortsighted and detrimental. Naloxone continues to be seen by experts as a constructive approach to preventing overdose deaths. Treatment bed availability continues to be a central challenge. After years of inaction, state officials have only recently begun to take any steps to address this crisis that ballooned to epic proportions on their watch. Many cities and counties and states are now belatedly suing pharmaceutical companies and distributors that have directly contributed to Ohioans’ addiction to narcotic painkillers. We must have an all-hands-on-deck effort to stem the crisis plaguing our state. What the Cordray-Sutton Administration Will DoImplement ""State of Emergency"" Coordination - This crisis is like a non-stop hurricane. As Governor, Rich would immediately declare a “state of emergency” requiring the strategic coordination of federal, state, and local government resources and community-based efforts - for both the short run and the long run. We will create clear, reliable channels for information flow about local needs and recommendations, supporting implementation of community-based solutions.Protect the Medicaid Expansion and Increase Local Capacity - Funding for treatment and prevention efforts is critically tied to continuing the Medicaid expansion. We cannot allow this framework and these resources to be rolled back. The state cannot dither while we wait for further guidance from Congress – we must act to protect Ohioans now. Training, data sharing, and program options that support law enforcement and first responders must be reinforced. Better mapping and statistical analysis can allow more effective use of scarce resources.Expand Access and Funding for Prevention and Treatment - We must go further to improve access to prevention and treatment services. Local government funding must be bolstered. Dozens of pending lawsuits must hold companies accountable for harming our people and our communities, and we must require industry officials to provide resources to address the devastating effects.Provide Support and Resources for Families and Improve Foster and Adoptive Services - Family and friends of those struggling with addiction are often left isolated and overwhelmed. More educational and support resources are key to their roles in helping loved ones find successful treatment and recovery. Children who are at risk due to the behavior of parents and caregivers must be protected and supported wherever possible. We must seek new approaches to increase foster and adoptive services for the growing number of children and grandchildren left behind by the opioid crisis.Replace Economic Despair with Broader Economic Opportunity - Clearly this epidemic is substantially a product of economic despair and hopelessness. Along with all of the other needed interventions, people all over Ohio must see that good jobs are available and that an alternative to addiction is a reality. Creating jobs and pathways to those jobs in communities throughout the state, not just in certain enclaves, is another critical element of confronting this crisis successfully.The Cordray-Sutton Proven Record on Fighting Opioid AddictionAs Attorney General, Rich teamed up to connect local law enforcement with retailers who sell products used to make methamphetamine. Cooperation and coordination with local law enforcement and local treatment officials are central to fighting the opioid epidemic effectively.As a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Betty was a steadfast supporter of funding for adequate drug treatment and services, including the ACA, which provided prevention and health services to people across Ohio. Support for Small Businesses to Grow and Spread Economic OpportunitySince 2014, 6 of Ohio's 7 major economic areas have posted job growth that was below the national average. The Youngstown and Akron areas actually had net job loss over that period. Ohio has fewer jobs today than it had in 2001. Another paper will examine prior and current approaches to job growth, including the past performance of the Department of Development, the current Jobs Ohio program, the Third Frontier initiative, and brownfields redevelopment. But local communities need to be equal partners in job growth strategies, including siting, community development, and workforce development. Currently, many communities in Ohio feel left out or left behind. We must be more effective in spreading economic opportunity around the state. At the same time, we are missing other opportunities that are right in front of us. Small businesses rooted in local communities frequently create quality jobs that stand the test of time. Ohio has 939,317 small businesses (99.6% of all Ohio businesses) that employ 2.1 million people – which is almost half of our private sector workforce. It is widely recognized that small businesses produce the bulk of the new jobs created in this country. Small businesses, nurtured with appropriate resources and support, can foster sustainable economic growth and innovation in communities across Ohio. But making this happen will require intensive focus and effort on the part of state officials who must be willing to partner closely with local communities, local businesses, and local investors and financing sources. It will require a strategy that understands and works with the capital investment markets to bring more, and more timely, venture capital and other bank and non-bank financing into Ohio communities that are in serious need of sustained capital investment to grow jobs and economic opportunity. What the Cordray-Sutton Administration Will DoProvide Better Tax Incentives, Grants and Small Business Loans – More effective focus on job training, infrastructure, transportation, and child care initiatives can create new businesses to meet those needs as well as help existing businesses grow in our communities. We need to incentivize business growth with available job training. We will launch ""Startup in a Day"" to allow entrepreneurs to get all required permits in a single day. We must also allocate specific funds for small businesses and MBE/EDGE companies.More Transparency – Ohio should conduct full audits of development programs that deploy public funds. The essential value and benefit of these efforts must be documented and justified. We need to take measures to ensure accountability and appropriate contract review in these support programs for small businesses.Empower a New Small Business Chief – Laser-like focus on job growth from our small businesses requires 24/7 attention from a senior leader with a strong team. Consolidating responsibility to help small businesses grow jobs includes:Business Services/Business Development Support – Ohio must directly help small businesses access quality, low-interest capital at timely moments. They also need regulatory compliance assistance (pre- and post-launch); business education resources; mentoring/networking for entrepreneurs; help with siting, in partnership with local communities; help matching job seekers with business needs; and guidance and outreach on government contracting opportunities.Community Development – We need competitive grant programs for community-based organizations, training them to build capacity through storefront improvements, neighborhood beautification and revitalization, urban planning, and leadership training to build local capacity. We must spread out this support to small and mid-sized towns around Ohio. Fellowship program should support hiring of recent high school and college graduates to do community development work (an “Ohio Peace Corps for our communities).Economic Empowerment – We must certify minority/women-owned businesses (M/WBE), streamline competition for public contracts; target programs and mentoring; do proactive outreach on contracting opportunities for M/WBEs; help lenders create targeted low-interest loan programs; and encourage more entrepreneurs from historically disadvantaged populations.The Cordray-Sutton Proven Record on Small Business Retention and AttractionBetty supported and Congress passed the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, a major overhaul of SBA loan programs to make it easier for small businesses to get loans and access capital, which saved or created 1.3 million jobs annually.Rich was named the U.S. Small Business Administration’s Financial Services Champion of the Year for 2008. As Ohio Treasurer, he led Ohio’s GrowNow program of low-interest loans for small businesses, which helped them expand their operations or develop new product lines, all of which produced many thousands of sustainable, high-quality jobs based in our communities.Reliable Health Care for All OhioansReliable access to quality health care saves lives, promotes stable and healthy lifestyles, and provides security to Ohioans across the social and economic spectrum. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), which Betty voted for in Congress, has benefited a huge number of Ohioans by providing them with greater access to affordable health care, which is a major worry for people and their families. The ACA has allowed more than 666,000 Ohioans to gain coverage and more than 80,000 Ohioans under the age of 26 have been able to remain on their parents’ healthcare plans. Yet politicians in Washington, D.C. are currently seeking to strip away the health care protections that people need. We must fight to keep our health care and help Ohioans manage any gaps in coverage. In addition, Ohio is one of the states that has adopted and implemented the Medicaid expansion, which has expanded access to affordable health care and bolstered the key medical sector of Ohio’s economy. This has been good for Ohioans, but more still needs to be done. Our uninsured rate is the 13th highest in the nation. And the state legislature remains opposed to the Medicaid expansion, seeking to eliminate it or freeze enrollment, putting these benefits at risk. We must make sure that our most vulnerable continue to receive access to healthcare. We can reduce inefficiencies in cost management, but access and affordability problems cannot be wished away. The coverage gaps are real, and we must assure basic health care rights to all Ohioans. In 2016, more than 103,000 Ohio children went without health insurance. We cannot claim to be invested in our children’s futures if they are denied access to doctors and treatment. Betty co-sponsored the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and has been a leader on children's health issues for years. We need leadership to ensure that no Ohio child is left behind without essential access to health care. What the Cordray-Sutton Administration Will DoProtect the Medicaid Expansion to Keep Our Health Care - Maintaining Ohio’s Medicaid expansion is crucial to protect healthcare services for families in our cities and rural communities, reduce infant mortality, and battle opiate addiction. Changes to current law must not be allowed to hurt seasonal workers, veterans, or the disabled. And we must reject punitive new cost-sharing proposals. Improve the Exchanges to Provide More Choice, Reduce Costs, and Ensure Access Across the State - Last summer, 19 Ohio counties lacked insurers in their individual exchange market. Medicaid filled in, but lack of competition means higher costs and higher rates. Insurers need incentives to enter rural counties and providers on the exchange must cover the entire state. This will help limit closures of local hospitals and clinics that create community health care vacuums. Other states are having better performance on their exchanges and we need to learn from them and improve Ohio’s performance accordingly.Expand Children’s Health Insurance Coverage in Ohio - We can expand coverage under the CHIP program in Ohio in a cost-effective manner. Ohio is one of the the worst states on infant mortality. Central Ohio’s Celebrate One campaign and other local initiatives address this challenge and should be taken statewide. Health care must be a certainty for children - and for mothers with young children.Tackle Ohio's Opioids Addiction Crisis - Opioids have caused a growing Ohio public health crisis that is ravaging our communities. Rich and Betty’s plan for the appropriate treatment, education, and law enforcement tools needed to tackle this epidemic is addressed in a separate issue paper on the Opioid Crisis.Focus Resources for Women and Children - The state legislature has pursued a narrow ideological agenda that has hurt women’s health programs in Ohio. It defunded Planned Parenthood’ programs for women’s health. It rolled back the rule requiring employers to provide contraceptive coverage, which had sharply reduced birth rates among teenagers. It has not invested sufficiently in pre-natal care, post-natal care, infant mortality programs, mammograms and other women’s health screenings. Rich and Betty will set a new direction in this key area.Investing in Ohio's Health Care industry - Health care is one of our strongest areas of job growth. We will invest in pathways to these high-demand careers.The Cordray-Sutton Proven Record on Health CareAs an original co-sponsor of CHIP, Betty helped provide health coverage for 9 million American children who had gone without it. This cost-effective measure allows health care access to roughly 200,000 Ohio children.In the Ohio House, Betty fought HMOs that were denying coverage. In Congress, she voted to pass the ACA, which led to a 49% decline in uninsured Ohioans. It was Betty's amendment that immediately limited health insurance companies' ability to reject coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.As Ohio Attorney General, Rich refused to join a lawsuit urged by Speaker John Boehner to challenge the validity of the ACA, stating that any proposed suit had “no legal merit and would needlessly tie up the resources of the office.” The ACA was later upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. Universal Pre-KThe evidence is crystal clear. Preschool educational and developmental programming improves school readiness. It lays a critical foundation for children to succeed. It measurably enhances their ability to master language, literacy, and math skills central to navigating our society. We must immediately take steps to implement Universal Pre-K. Simply put, kindergarten isn’t what it used to be. Today, well-prepared children arrive knowing the alphabet, able to count, to recognize colors, and to distinguish rhyming words. Early development of these learning and knowledge characteristics mesh with the development of key social skills. Pre-K children learn to wait their turn, persist with tasks they find difficult, work with others, and control their impulses. These attributes and the benefits of Pre-K education are documented in both local and national research studies. Where available, pre-school has also become our most reliable outside-the-home opportunity to identify health issues and learning disabilities among young children, allowing earlier interventions that better mitigate their effects. Yet these important Pre-K opportunities should not be determined by a child’s zip code. High-quality education is the foundation of our democracy, and of opportunity in our economy and our society. In 2010, Ohio public schools ranked #5 in the nation in Education Weeks' annual Quality Counts rankings. In 2015, we fell to #18 and last year we slipped down to #22. In Ohio and across the nation, parents of young children say the main reason they don’t send their kids to preschool is that they can’t afford it. It’s time to address that need. In 2017, the legislature crafted a biennial budget with only 0.6% of that money committed to Early Childhood Education. We need to help the legislature ""connect the dots"" so we can implement a common-sense approach to Universal Pre-K for Ohio’s young children. What the Cordray Sutton Administration Will DoCreate a Statewide Pre-K “Hub” to Help Local Educators “Connect the Dots” and Build More Comprehensive Programs - From Cincinnati's passage of Issue 44 in 2016, to Montgomery County's Pre-School Promise initiative joined by Dayton’s leadership in passing its own levy, to Cuyahoga County's Invest in Children Universal Pre-K program, communities across the state are getting smart about this critical need. In growing numbers, they are now investing in the future of our youngest children to give them a better chance to succeed. The Cordray-Sutton Administration will establish a Local Educator Support Hub, led by practical education problem-solvers from Ohio’s school districts with support from their colleagues across the state. The Hub will support Pre-K expansion and quality by providing help and support with needs assessment, planning, multi-sector coordination, system capacity-building, fund development and allocation, research and evaluation, public policy development, quality assurance, financial aid system management, public awareness, and advocacy. Opportunities will be maximized by the Hub identifying cutting-edge approaches to Universal Pre-K and joining public and private sources to bring them to fruition.Guarantee Adequate Funding for Universal Pre-K Through Combined Public/Private Efforts - We cannot assure Universal Pre-K in Ohio unless we identify the public and private funding sources needed to finance this effort. The Hub will be the focal point to generate and develop a funding plan that supports:High-Quality Early Care and Education Programs, including center-based programs (preschools, child care centers, Head Start, and church programs); home-based programs (family child care homes and family child care group homes); and family support and education programs.Pre-K System Infrastructure, including state and community-level entities that are linked to carry out coordination and basic infrastructure functions, with planning and oversight support provided by the Hub.Access to Resources, including outreach and information about child development, early learning, health, community resources, linkages and access to health and other community services, parent and family education and support, consumer information on early care and education programs and providers, referrals and program quality ratings, and a consolidated tuition assistance application and convenient one-stop process for all sources of aid.The Cordray Sutton Proven Record in Support of Universal Pre-KBetty Sutton has long been a champion for early education. In the Congress, she helped pass the most recent reauthorization of Head Start funding and fought for student loan forgiveness for Head Start teachers. She helped bring back over $3 million for the University of Akron’s Reading First program.Rich Cordray, as Ohio Attorney General, recovered millions of taxpayer dollars fraudulently spent by a day care center that failed children and parents. At the Consumer Bureau, he pushed for new research on how child development can support teaching financial education concepts even at an early age. His team worked with parents and teachers to implement this new approach, including a book club to help young children develop impulse control and other learnings and skills needed to benefit from education at the preschool level. Clean EnergyOhio is tragically missing out on the clean energy revolution. We could be creating more good-paying jobs, revitalizing rural communities, reducing energy bills, and improving our air and water quality. Instead, we rank #38 in renewable energy production and #31 for energy efficiency. This is simply unacceptable. Cleveland’s own Charles Brush created the world’s first electric wind turbine in the 19th century to power his home. We cannot allow other states to keep gaining a competitive advantage with companies like Amazon and Apple, which want to expand their operations in places with renewable energy sources to power their businesses. In addition to being a jobs engine, clean energy and energy efficiency are key to addressing climate change that threatens the Great Lakes and Ohio farmland. Ohio should be leading the way, not losing jobs to Michigan and Minnesota. Renewable energy and energy efficiency can play a key role in creating manufacturing jobs and revitalizing rural Ohio. We need to tell companies that Ohio is open for business once again in wind energy, solar energy, distributed generation, and cogeneration. What the Cordray-Sutton Administration Will DoStrengthen Ohio’s Renewable Portfolio Standard - In 2008, Ohio adopted one of the nation’s most ambitious renewable energy programs. An OSU study found the program was an economic success, spurring $160 million in annual GDP growth and creating over 3,200 jobs. Consumers also saved over $1.7 billion in electric bills, reducing electricity use by 2.6% and overall energy demand by 2%.In a handout to special interests and a sharp turn away from our future, in 2014 the Ohio legislature passed the first nationwide law to halt renewable portfolio targets. The law put a “freeze” on these goals for two years despite opposition from many Ohio businesses and manufacturers such as Honda, Nestle, and Whirlpool. When that freeze was finally lifted in 2016, Ohio had fallen well behind in the clean energy race as Illinois, Minnesota, and Michigan moved aggressively forward to attract clean-energy employers to their states. As governor, Rich will double our renewable energy and energy efficiency targets by 2025.Stop Over-Regulation that has Halted Ohio’s Wind Energy Development - To protect the status quo, in 2014 the supposedly anti-regulation Ohio legislature passed the nation’s most heavy-handed government blockade to developing wind energy. This secretive, last-minute amendment doubled the property line setbacks for wind turbines and has brought new commercial wind projects to a virtual halt. Ohio lost $4.2 billion in economic opportunities. A potential 13,000 jobs were also sacrificed. The Payments In Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) revenue over the life of these projects was estimated to be $660 million - and 70% of that would have gone to schools. Another $440 million could have been available to farmers and landowners who would have hosted wind turbines. The legislature’s protection of of special interests has significantly cost rural Ohio.Support Farmers and Public Bodies Like Schools as Sites for More Clean Energy – Many farmers could locate one or more wind turbines on their lands without impairing their existing operations and providing some additional steady income or reduction of costs. Schools and other public bodies could add solar panels to their buildings or wind turbines on their property to add income or reduce costs. The state should use bond financing to provide the support and expertise needed to boost construction and lower the cost of such projects.Invest in Solar Power to Create More Local Jobs - Even with public policies that have undermined the state’s commitment to renewable energy, solar jobs in Ohio continue to grow. A stronger Renewable Portfolio Standard in Ohio law will support more proposals such as AEP’s project to create 400 MW of solar power in Appalachian Ohio, tied to bringing in more solar supply chain businesses. The project will create permanent manufacturing jobs in the region with a commitment to hiring Ohio military veterans. Under Rich’s leadership, the state will pursue more projects that create good construction and maintenance jobs. These efforts will also encourage related support businesses to locate here, as is true right now in other midwestern states. These initiatives will also encourage other businesses from elsewhere to locate in Ohio, both as a matter of corporate preference and because they want reliable and predictable energy bills from power sources that are based on free energy creation, such as from the sun and the wind.The Cordray-Sutton Proven Record on Clean EnergyBetty Sutton was a champion of clean energy policy in the Congress, where she led efforts to pass clean energy legislation as a member of the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee.As Ohio Treasurer, Rich Cordray established a central inventory of state properties, which allowed counties across Ohio to use the inventory to consider potential sites to pursue development of new power sources.As Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Rich worked to make sure that leases for solar projects weren’t being fraudulently misused to harm consumers and responsible businesses in the growing solar industry. Agriculture and FarmingAgriculture employs one in seven Ohioans and contributes over $100 billion a year to our state economy. For years, Ohio has been a leading exporter of soybeans, corn, eggs, and cheese. Ohio farms feed the nation and the world; we must assure that our complex environmental and economic challenges don’t change that. Farmers must have 21st century tools and strategies along with support to adapt to new challenges. When our farms and our farmers are secure and faring well, our rural communities and small towns thrive. But farm communities face one particularly daunting problem that calls for a comprehensive plan of action right now: the opioid crisis. Half of those in rural communities report that they, a family member, or a friend have been directly affected by opioid abuse. For farmers and farm workers, it’s almost 75%. A recurring theme among those surveyed was the extraordinary lack of drug treatment facilities or programs in rural areas. We support the efforts of the “Farm Town Strong” movement to provide resources and information to farm communities and encourage farmer-to-farmer support to overcome the crisis. These challenges are magnified by falling prices for beef, poultry, and pork. Half of our 4,400 dairy farms have been shuttered since 2006. Possible changes in U.S. trade policy pose substantial risks of retaliation that could threaten our farmers and our economy. We need to integrate resources across Ohio to help small communities create jobs and businesses around the agricultural supply chain. Farm communities must benefit from rural development opportunities to counter the challenges they face. Interest in local food eco-systems has never been higher and must be met with action. Ohio farms can continue to feed our state and nation. What the Cordray-Sutton Administration Will DoAppoint an Assistant Director of Food Policy and Rural Development in the Ohio Department of Agriculture - Consolidating agricultural and agribusiness functions now at JobsOhio and the Development Services Agency would help expand agricultural export efforts and address effects of possible changes in U.S. trade policy. Reconvening the ODA Food Policy Council with experts from private food businesses; food banks; farm and environmental groups; and other spheres will help build partnerships and inform focused improvements in farm policy. Support Ohio Farmers with Strategic Business and Technical Resources - Family farms often end up consolidating for lack of effective succession planning. Strategic support and increased technical resources from the OSU Extension program along with targeted planning and collaboration from ODA officials would help optimize farming operations and help maintain more small farms. Target the Disproportionate Rural Impact of the Opioid Crisis - Expanded opioid treatment and health care (as discussed in our Opioid Crisis paper) is crucial in rural Ohio. The Ohio Department of Health must identify rural public buildings that can be fully or partially repurposed as opioid treatment facilities. And we must work with USDA’s Ohio Rural Development Agency to provide Community Facilities Loans and grants to fund the conversion of these facilities. The Cordray-Sutton Proven Record on Agriculture and FarmingAs Ohio Treasurer, Rich improved and expanded access to GrowNOW and Agricultural Linked Deposit Programs. Applicants from all over Ohio created or saved thousands of jobs. Rich’s office invested more than $295 million directly into Ohio small businesses and agricultural enterprises through the programs. In Congress, Betty co-sponsored the National Endowment for Workforce Education in Renewables and Agriculture Act, which sought to create grants to community colleges and advanced technology education centers in Midwestern states to support education and training of technicians in the fields of bioenergy and other agricultural and renewable energy resources. Reducing Gun ViolenceWe are facing an epidemic of gun violence in Ohio and across our country. While horrific mass shootings have captured headlines, the leading incidents of gun violence in Ohio are the daily homicides and suicides that often escape media attention. Gang violence and gun battles have taken too many young men from our urban communities. Armed domestic abusers have too many women fearing for their lives. Too many avoidable suicides are committed with firearms. We cannot simply stand by and watch, hoping that the situation will get better while the steady horror of gun violence affects our communities, our families, and our schools. We must work to find concrete, practical solutions that will reduce gun violence and save lives. We must balance the rights of responsible gun owners with the demands of public safety. We must craft measures that will keep all Ohioans safe by keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and those who would commit mass shootings. We must reduce the suicides, domestic violence, and gang violence that are responsible for too many gun deaths in urban, suburban, and rural areas. And we must allow responsible gun owners the freedoms granted by our U.S. and Ohio Constitutions. The numbers are truly alarming. Since 1999, firearm deaths in Ohio have risen 58%. In 2016, over 1500 Ohioans were killed by a gun. Nearly 75% of Ohio homicides were committed with a gun and 1 out of 5 guns bought in Ohio is recovered from a crime scene within two years. And we are not acting as good neighbors - Ohio ranks near the top in having guns bought here used in a crime in another state. But homicides only tell part of the story. Suicides by firearms have been rising since 2009. In 2016, Ohio had over 50% more suicides involving a firearm than homicides. What the Cordray-Sutton Administration Will DoRequire Universal Background Checks - Background checks on all gun sales would prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands, including criminals, the mentally ill, and domestic violence abusers. We should close all loopholes to safeguard Ohioans against the potential for gun violence by high-risk individuals. And we must aggressively enforce laws against straw purchases of firearms and the theft of firearms, which are the means that are commonly used to circumvent background checks and restrictions against felons possessing firearms. Ban Sale of High-Capacity Magazines and Bump Stocks - These steps would prevent legal firearms from being transformed into illegal weapons to use in mass shootings. Firearms too easily become weapons of war when they are enhanced by high-capacity magazine clips, “bump stocks,” and other potential mechanisms that have no conceivable use other than to evade legal restrictions on the sale and use of fully-automatic weapons. Any such mechanisms should be illegal. Align the Minimum Age to Purchase All Classes of Firearms - Federal law allows individuals under age 21 to purchase firearms, and Ohio law allows those under age 21 to purchase long guns, but not handguns until they turn 21. These laws were passed at different times and have never been rationalized with one another. Ohio should align these laws by raising the age for the purchase of all firearms to 21 years old. Enhance the Safety of Our Schools and Reduce Suicides - By placing certified school resource officers on-site in schools to enhance security, help spot warning signs, train personnel, monitor ingress and egress, speed emergency response times, and implement measures and protocols to enhance the physical security of our school buildings, we can save lives. We can also provide for Extreme Risk Protection Orders that would allow law enforcement to temporarily bar a person from having access to firearms where, after a court proceeding compliant with due process rights, it is determined that the person is a danger to himself or others. Appoint a Gun Violence Prevention Czar - The czar will coordinate a comprehensive statewide response to reducing gun violence by supporting local law enforcement efforts, aiding and funding tip hotlines, improving mental health efforts, and providing resources and best practices to local officials. Create Gun Violence Task Forces - These task forces will use proven tactics from Ohio and in cities around the country to target illegal gun trafficking and gang violence, and to stage early interventions to stop likely offenders from committing gun crimes, including heavy penalties for committing a crime with a gun. The Cordray-Sutton Proven Record on Responsible Gun OwnershipRich has advocated for responsible gun ownership throughout his career. He understands and respects the freedoms granted by the U.S. and Ohio Constitutions and how they must be judged in light of the responsibilities inherent in those freedoms. He has always worked to balance the individual’s Second Amendment rights with the need for public safety in our communities. Betty has long supported common sense gun safety reforms. In the Congress, she co-sponsored legislation to provide universal background checks and increase criminal penalties for violations of criminal background check requirements. Betty opposed the sale of guns to those convicted of domestic violence and advocated to limit high-capacity magazine clips. Seniors and Retirement Ohio is a great place to live and make a home: to raise a family, go to school, work, and grow a business. And it can be, and should be, a great place to age with dignity and respect and to retire securely, surrounded by family and friends and with strong support from community programs and resources. Investing today in the well-being of our seniors is the right thing to do and will help us retain and attract more retirees to live here. Ohio’s senior population is expected to double by 2040. Their diverse needs require planning and appropriate support. OSU researchers have shown that connecting more seniors to resources already available directly raises their quality of life and reduces costs of chronic illness and long-term crisis intervention. Too many seniors lack this support, and we need to change that. We must focus on developing and training a high-quality workforce in the medical and helping professions. We need to support the caregivers who treat our seniors with the dignity and respect they have earned and assure the kind of broad support that our growing and increasingly diverse community of seniors demands. We should invest strategically to assure access to affordable places to live and other critical resources. AARP estimates that about 2 million Ohioans work in jobs with no retirement plan. We will explore and adopt new approaches to provide more retirement planning and investment options to them, providing comfort that their futures are more secure. What the Cordray-Sutton Administration Will DoEstablish a “Retire as a Buckeye” Initiative - Seniors deserve affordable housing in accessible communities with robust transportation options. Ohio should design a focused and tangible effort to partner with local communities to:Boost outreach and Increase awareness of the programs and services that are already available for home-based living and care.Improve investments in caregiver support, including respite care.Expand Meals on Wheels and other mobile services for healthcare support.Provide for senior financial management education and fraud protection.Create a Retirement Savings Plan Option for Those Who Lack Access Through Their Employer - Many Ohioans lack access to any retirement savings plan option at their workplace. This includes self-employed; seasonal, temporary, and contract workers; part-time workers; and employees who are excluded from eligibility for their company retirement programs. We will explore tax incentives for more employers to provide a framework for retirement planning and investment. We will also adapt reform measures from other states to create a retirement savings plan option for those who lack access to one in the workplace - setting a framework that will enable all working Ohioans to secure their own futures. Launch a Life Expectancy Improvement Task Force - The Ohio Department of Aging should leverage its resources to maximize equity in life expectancy for all Ohioans. The Task Force will focus on improving health and longevity, with crucial attention to those facing shortened life expectancies based on race, ethnicity, and poverty. In addition, the Task Force will work with local communities to conduct outreach and awareness campaigns to assure that seniors across Ohio know more about the services and support systems that are already available to them but are not currently being utilized. And it will focus the resources of state government on supporting caregivers and developing and training a high-quality workforce in the medical and helping professions. Lower Benefit Age Thresholds in Health Care Systems - Ohio health care providers will be encouraged and assisted to provide wellness information earlier than at the typical ages of 60-65. An individual who is turning 50 should receive comprehensive information, in a form that is easily understandable, to identify available programs, eligibility requirements, contact information, and supportive resources to prepare for the changes and challenges of aging into senior status. The Cordray-Sutton Proven Record on Seniors and RetirementAs County Treasurer, Rich established programs for property tax relief and assistance to seniors in danger of losing their homes. As Director of the Consumer Bureau, Rich led creation of the ""Planning for Retirement"" tool that helps consumers across the country decide when to claim Social Security and maximize benefits. It also helps families and friends face the challenges of ""Managing Someone Else's Money"" with a unique resource that helps financial caregivers understand and manage fiduciary responsibilities appropriately. Betty has been a champion for seniors who fought to strengthen and expand Medicare and Social Security in Congress. She opposed the Ryan budget cuts that would have ended Medicare as we know it and co-sponsored legislation to require the HHS Secretary to negotiate lower prescription drug prices in the Medicare Part D program. A member of the U.S. House Seniors Task Force, Betty fought against efforts to privatize Social Security and received a 100% rating from the Alliance of Retired Americans. Free Community College Ohio needs to make a substantial reinvestment in community colleges so every student can get a post-secondary education and be ready for the workforce. For far too long, state government has failed to properly invest in higher education, pushing the skyrocketing costs of college onto students and families. Ohio now ranks 45th in college affordability. To solve this problem, we should provide free community college. In the absence of affordable options, students are turning to for-profit higher education institutions, which prioritize profits over education, and often exploit students who are simply trying to get a good education and build a future. The hole growing in Ohio’s higher education system is leaving students with mountains of debt and with useless degrees, which don’t allow them get good-paying jobs to pay off their student loan debt. Investing in our community colleges will benefit everyone - students, families, businesses, and our economy. Thousands of unfilled jobs could be filled with Ohioans who are prepared to join the workforce, if we only make the necessary investments in educating students. By 2020, 64% of jobs in Ohio will require at least an associate's degree, but today, only 37% of our working-age adults have a degree. Providing more access to affordable education and training won’t just help businesses, it will improve the quality of life across our state - a worker with a community college degree will earn hundreds of thousands of dollars more than a person with a high school diploma or G.E.D. over a 40-year career. What the Cordray-Sutton Administration Will DoMake Community College Free – Community colleges are a gold mine of opportunity for many people, both young and older. The infrastructure of community colleges already exists, so we just need to use them more effectively and deploy the necessary resources to provide Ohioans with the training they need to succeed in the modern workplace. Every student in Ohio who gets into a community college should be able to pursue their higher education free of tuition. The initial investment in each student is an investment in Ohio’s future, and it’s an investment that we can and should be making more aggressively and effectively. It is estimated that this would increase Ohio’s college attendance rates by 20-35%.Expand the Adoption of “Preferred Pathways” – Columbus State Community College’s “Preferred Pathways” program guarantees students admission and 100% credit transfer to a dozen four-year colleges and universities across the state. The program pairs regular academic and career counseling with a set and sequence of classes for each course of study. This reduces choice paralysis for students and helps lead them on a more focused path to settling on a specific career. Ohio should offer challenge grants to community colleges to incentivize adoption of guided pathways. Help our Community College Students Graduate in a Timely Manner – Too often, advisory and support services have been the first programs to be cut when funds are short. We need to provide the appropriate resources to lower the student-to-advisor ratio to help ensure that students who enter college have the support they need to graduate. We should also expand implementation of the Accelerated Study in Associate Program “ASAP,” which offers scholarships, intensive advising, a stipend for transportation, and other services. It is currently being implemented at Cincinnati State Technical and Community College, Cuyahoga Community College, and Lorain County Community College. The Cordray-Sutton Proven Record on Free Community CollegeAt the Consumer Bureau, Rich took on predatory for-profit colleges and held them accountable for misleading students and providing them with a poor education and a mountain of debt. The Bureau also provided easy-to-use online tools to help students and parents better understand their projected college costs, choices, and borrowing and payment options. Rich has been to a number of community colleges this year as part of his Community Solutions Tour, to learn more about how they link education resources to available jobs in both the public and private sectors, including jobs such as safety forces, first responders, veteran services, the auto industry, and the insurance industry, among others. Based on what he has seen, he has said: “This is exactly what we need in 2018 in Ohio so that we can match young people, and people of all ages, with the jobs that are available and the skills that are needed.” As a member of Congress, Betty helped pass the College Cost Reduction and Access Act, the single largest investment in college aid since the GI Bill. She served on the the Community College Caucus and the Congressional Career and Technical Education Caucus. Betty was a consistent supporter of cutting student loan interest rates in Congress and as a state legislator she supported allowing senior citizens to receive tuition-free college credits. Veterans and Servicemembers Veterans and servicemembers deserve the highest gratitude and respect our country and state can offer. Our government must ensure access to opportunities and tools that provide a high quality of life to those who have risked their lives to protect and preserve our democracy, our liberty, and our freedom. Veterans, servicemembers, and their families face distinct challenges that require attention and resources to address. In particular, the government should be ensuring that veterans have access to adequate health care coverage, potential job placement options, employment protections, the opportunity to pursue additional education, and a streamlined state certification and licensing process to simplify and expedite their transition to civilian life, where their leadership and skills enhance our communities. In addition to providing resources and support, the Cordray-Sutton Administration will be an active advocate for veterans, servicemembers, and their families, just as Rich was at the Consumer Bureau. While there, Rich had an entire department focused on identifying and stopping scams and frauds that target servicemembers and their benefits - such as educational support and insured home and car loans. With state officials who respect and value the challenges and achievements of those who serve our country, Ohio’s servicemembers, veterans, and their families can rest assured they have allies in the Statehouse who have their backs and look out for them. What the Cordray-Sutton Administration Will DoProtect and Maximize Health Care Coverage and Other Services:Help veterans submit medical claims and keep preferred doctors by providing adequate resources for our Veteran Services Commissions.Provide a voluntary “I’m a Veteran” check box on Ohio tax returns so the Cordray-Sutton Administration can identify and follow up with individuals to match them with available benefits and services.Support veterans with mild traumatic brain injury with employer tax breaks and other incentives to hire them and provide on-the-job support.Expand suicide prevention and community engagement programs to help veterans coping with civilian transition issues, especially mental health issues.Support and strengthen the VA system and Ohio veterans’ access to it. And maintain Ohio’s medicaid expansion, which is critical to veterans who are not eligible for VA care.Support Job Placement and Employment Protections:Increase job opportunities by permitting private sector employers to offer a hiring preference for veterans and the families of servicemembers.Help veterans start civilian job searches with “veterans preference” personnel/desks at county JFS, Veteran Services Commission, and library job search centers.Streamline state certification and licensing for veterans and military family members seeking jobs with those requirements.Mandate job projection during state-sponsored national guard activation.Permit military spouses to be eligible for Ohio unemployment compensation and other services when they must leave a job due to a military transfer. Bolster State Support for Veterans, Servicemembers and Their Families:​Renew the fight against predatory payday lenders, especially those that target veterans, servicemembers and their families.Expand Ohio National Guard Assistance to military families.Provide homeless veterans with better VA and veterans court coordination.Support the military community, especially those newly arriving in Ohio, by requiring all state agencies to regularly report on the support they provide to veterans and the special needs of military families.The Cordray-Sutton Proven Record on Veterans and ServicemembersAt the CFPB, Rich and his team returned over $200 million to servicemembers and their families that had been cheated by unscrupulous predatory lenders. CFPB staff were deployed to 150 military installations to help veterans and servicemembers with financial matters, and they resolved over 90,000 consumer complaints from servicemembers, veterans, and their families. As Treasurer, Rich put forward a constitutional amendment for a special bonus and recognition for those who came home to Ohio after serving in the Persian Gulf, Afghanistan, and Iraq. The people overwhelmingly approved the amendment at the ballot, and many thousands of veterans who got the bonus were encouraged to bring their talents and leadership home to Ohio. Betty served on the Armed Services Committee and fought for veterans and servicemembers. The Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America gave her an A+ in 2008 for her support of veterans and the Ohio American Veterans Association named her Legislator of the Year in 2010. She successfully led the effort to end the “back door draft” and increase stop-loss pay for soldiers when their service was extended. She also backed legislation increasing benefits and educational opportunities available to veterans. "

Only 5 percent of taxpayers will see increased taxes in 2018.California Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu, speaking alongside Pelosi at the event, said the GOP tax cuts would result in “deep cuts to Social Security, to Medicare, to all these critical programs that serve a lot of Americans.”Pelosi didn’t offer specifics when asked if Democrats would re-work the bill from scratch or focus on specific portions, saying instead her party would work openly with Republicans to reach a deal.“One of our complaints about what they did with the tax bill is they did it in the dark of night with the speed of light,” the California Democrat said.“We’ll sit down at the table and say … what would be a tax bill that creates growth, that creates good paying jobs as it reduces the deficit?” she said.“It’s not about chipping at this piece or that piece, it’s about a comprehensive look at what our tax policy should be for the future,” she added.“Secondly, we would do it so it would be transparent so that people could understand the ramifications of this, that or the other,” Pelosi promised.Pelosi’s comments Wednesday comes after she said in February that Democrats would have to “replace and repeal” the GOP tax bill once retaking the House.“It may have to be a ‘replace and repeal’ — replace them and repeal the bill,” Pelosi said.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer offered a more specific proposal towards reworking the GOP tax plan in March. His plan called for a number of tax hikes, including lifting the corporate tax rate to 25 percent, raising the income tax rate to 39.6 percent for high earning Americans and slashing the carried-interest tax loophole.“We want to roll back the Republicans’ tax giveaways to corporations and the wealthy and invest that money instead in jobs and infrastructure,” Schumer said.Public opinion polls indicate that voters are warming to the GOP tax bill. Fifty percent of respondents in a February poll from The New York Times and SurveyMonkey approved of the GOP tax overhaul, up from 37 percent approval in December.Follow Andrew on Twitter .

EDTTHE PRESIDENT: That’s good music, isn’t it? (Laughter.) Well, thank you all for being here. And I don’t know if you know, but your state is doing very well. West Virginia — (applause) — Big Jim is doing a good job. Much better since he turned Republican, too. (Laughter and applause.) Nobody like him. I know him for a long time. He’s a friend of my boys, and he’s doing a great job as governor. So thank you very much, Jim. Appreciate it. And we’re on television nationwide talking about that, Jim. That’s pretty good. Huh?GOVERNOR JUSTICE: Just keep talking about me. (Laughter.)THE PRESIDENT: And he’s definitely the biggest governor, too. Right? (Laughter.) And we’ll take that also. Thanks, Jim.But it’s wonderful to be back in West Virginia. It was a very special place during the election for me. It was not even close. Was it? Huh? (Laughter and applause.) A lot of things have happened with your coal and a lot of other things that you’re doing in West Virginia. But they’ve all happened for the positive.And actually, you’re one of the most successful, now — percentage-wise, you’re one of the most successful in the nation. And I could not say that during the election. Right? Before we got elected, it was not doing so well. And a lot of factors, but we got it going. And I’m very proud of it because you are very, very special people. That I can tell you. (Applause.) Thank you. Nice hat. Look at that beautiful hat.I want to thank Jim and Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and Senator Shelley Moore Capito. (Applause.)SENATOR CAPITO: Thank you.THE PRESIDENT: Hello, Shelley.Congressman Jenkins, Alex Mooney, David McKinley for being here today. They’re all here. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.)So now, once again, you see that America is open for business. The numbers are fantastic. The results are really incredible, what’s happening. We’re being talked about all over the world. One of the big things is our tax cuts. You know, they used to call it tax reform, and for 40 years they couldn’t pass anything and they didn’t know why. I said, “How’s it hard to pass tax cuts?” Turned out it was not that hard. It was not easy.But we changed the name. I said, let’s — because being a person that’s only been doing this for two-and-a-half years, I said, “Don’t use the word ‘reform.’ Use the word ‘tax cut.'” Because when you talk about tax reform, that could mean your taxes are going up. And your taxes went down. They went down a lot.And I always tell the Republican politicians, because the Democrats have a problem. I mean, if you look at your senator, he voted against — Joe — he voted against.AUDIENCE: Booo —THE PRESIDENT: No, it was bad. I thought he would be helpful because he talks. Grabs me; I grab him. Says hello; I say hello. But he votes against everything. And he voted against our tax cuts. And that was bad. And he voted — he also voted against medical help and healthcare. And that’s bad, and we can’t have it. So, you know, it’s one of those things. And he does other things that I don’t like. I’ll be honest with you. (Laughter.) He does other things.So, you know, you’re going to have a chance — (applause) — you’re going to have a chance to get a senator that’s going to vote our program, that’s going to help you in so many different ways. And you’re not getting that help right now.I mean, we didn’t get one Democrat vote for tax cuts. And when you think about it, it was more than tax cuts — because we got rid of the individual mandate. When you get rid of the individual mandate — that was a disaster. That was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare. This is where you have the privilege of paying a lot of money in order to not to have to pay for healthcare. Right? That’s not too good. And we got it out in our tax cut plan.And we also got ANWR — energy. Big energy. We’re — I’m into the world of energy, as you know. And nobody does it better than you folks. So it’s very important to me.But it’s really great to be here. We’re going to have a discussion on how to get the country moving even more so. You know, you probably saw that, for many years, no President wanted to go against China, economically. And we’re going to do it. We had a trade deficit of almost $500 billion last year with China. And I have great respect for the President of China, President Xi. He’s a friend of mine, and I’m a friend of his. And I like him a lot. But he’s representing China, and I’m representing the United States of America.And it was time that we did something. We can’t continue to have — I spoke with Jim just coming in and — Jim is a great businessman — and he said, “You’re right.” Because we can’t continue to allow this to happen, where hundreds of billions of dollars is taken out of our country and our system; where if they make a car, they sell it here, it’s 2.5 percent tax. If we make a car and try and get it into China, number one, they won’t take it. But if they did, it’s 25 percent tax. So they pay 2.5; we pay 25. They don’t even want to take it. That doesn’t sound so good.But it’s all like that. And we have our intellectual property, and a lot of people don’t understand what that means. And it doesn’t matter if you understand it or not. You understand the concept of being taken advantage of, and we can’t be taken advantage of any longer.So we’re at a point where we had to do this. Our economy is strong. Our jobs are great. We’re going to come out with numbers on Friday that, hopefully, are going to be fantastic numbers. Companies are doing really well, and you have to go after the people that aren’t treating you right.And in many respects, I think we’re going to have a fantastic relationship, long term, with China. But we have to get this straightened out. We have to have some balance. And that goes for other countries and it goes for other places.If you look at the European Union, it’s very solidly against us in terms of trade. It’s very unfair. Look, a young girl shaking her head “yes.” You know about the European Union? (Laughter.) It’s like — it’s almost — we can’t even do business. They send their cars over here; they send everything over here. They don’t want to take our product. So we can’t let that happen. Do we agree with that? We can’t let that happen. (Applause.)We’re working very hard on NAFTA with Mexico and Canada, and, you know, we’ll have something, I think, fairly soon. And I told my people — they’re like, “Oh, I want it before” — we’re making a trip next week to Peru, representing all of South America and different places.” And it will be very interesting. But they said, “Oh, let’s have NAFTA before.” I said, “Don’t rush it. Take it nice and easy. There’s no rush. We get it done right or we’ll terminate.” You know, if we don’t have it done right, we’re going to terminate.When I was running, I said we’ll terminate NAFTA or we’ll renegotiate it. And Mexico has been pretty good. They were very good to us yesterday because, you know, they had the caravan of thousands of people coming up from Honduras. Thousands of people. And we have very weak laws because of the Democrats and Joe. I mean, Joe Manchin is just — (laughter) — he’s really not helped us on this stuff.So we had very, very weak laws. We have the worst laws. You ever think catch-and-release, which we’re terminating very quickly. (Applause.) We’re doing it in pieces. No, it’s unbelievable. Think of this: So we have a country where if they step one foot — not two feet — if one foot hits our country, we have to take those people gently, register them, and then release them. Okay? We’re going to release them, essentially, in a short period of time. So we release them. And then they’re supposed to come for a court case. We hire more judges — we’re trying to hire thousands of judges. No other country in the world does it. We hire judges so that these people will come back.Now, they’re on the land. We release them. They go someplace into our country. They’re supposed to come back within two or three years for a court case, but nobody ever comes back. (Laughter.) It’s bad enough to say, “Come back in three years.” But nobody comes back anyway. This is our country. If you have a baby on our land, congratulations, that baby is a United States citizen. We’re the only one.Now, Mexico has very tough policies. They can do whatever they want, which is the way it should be, to be honest. You’re violating something very sacred. You’re violating a border.Canada, very, very tough — very, very tough. And Canada is very merit-based. If you come into Canada, it’s got to be based on merit. With us, it’s a lottery system — pick them out — a lottery system. You can imagine what those countries put into the system. They’re not putting their good ones.And remember my opening remarks at Trump Tower, when I opened. Everybody said, “Oh, he was so tough,” and I used the word “rape.” And yesterday, it came out where, this journey coming up, women are raped at levels that nobody has ever seen before. They don’t want to mention that.So we have to change our laws. And the Democrats, what they’re doing is just — it’s insanity. I don’t — nobody understands what’s going on.So we have to have strong borders. We’re going to have the wall. We’ve already started building it. We have a billion-six. We’ve started building it and fixing miles and miles of wall that’s already up — and fence. And we’re going to have our wall. And we’re going to get it very strongly. The military is going to be building some of it. But we’re going to have very strong borders. And we have to change our laws, and we’re on working on doing that.And believe it or not, if you look in California and you see what’s happening, it’s an incredible phenomenon, because sanctuary cities — it’s the worst; it’s basically a city to protect a lot of people that are bad people, really bad. You look at Kate Steinle, you look at so many other things that have happened in our country. And they’re protected.How about the Mayor of Oakland, where she tells a thousand people to “get going; law enforcement is coming to get you.” And this was all planned. And many of them scattered, and it was pretty much a failure. I mean, to me that’s obstruction of justice, and something should happen there. And it hasn’t, and I don’t know why it hasn’t. But something should happen there.So we’re toughening up at the border. We’ll be, I think, in great shape over the — I think over the next 12 months we’ll have a lot of things happening. But we cannot let people enter our country. We have no idea who they are, what they do, where they came from. We have no idea what their records are. We don’t know if they’re murderers, if they’re killers, if they’re MS-13. We’re throwing them out by the hundreds.You know, we’ve gone into towns in Long Island where we’ve taken MS-13 and we’ve actually liberated towns. This is our country, right? I grew up in Long Island, right short of Long Island. And these are great towns; I know every one of them. And they were taken over by thugs, by — you know, they talk about guns; they didn’t want to use guns. They use knives because it’s much more painful, where they cut people up, because a bullet is too quick. They want to inflict pain on students, on young women, young girls walking home. And their parents never see them again. They’re cut up.And this is the kind of stuff — and crap — that we’re allowing in our country. And we can’t do it. We can’t do it anymore. (Applause.)You have to see, there are some scenes of — the ICE people, they’re fantastic and they’re tough. And, by the way, that’s the only thing that these thugs understand. They don’t understand, “Oh, isn’t he an intelligent young man, isn’t he wonderful. He studied so hard in school.” They don’t — they only want tough. That’s all they understand.And these ICE guys are so much tougher than them, and they’re grabbing them by the necks and throwing them into the paddy wagons. And the town — the people are clapping and screaming. Their town has been liberated. It’s like it’s a war. It’s like, literally, it’s a war, where your town or your city or your country has been liberated. They’re clapping, because even the law enforcement, some of it, has a hard time. But we have taken out — we’re moving hundreds and hundreds. You saw two days ago, we caught 101 of these MS-13 thugs. They’re the worst of — I mean, probably the worst of the group. But other gangs, too, come in — you just don’t know their names. But the MS-13 seems to be emblematic of evil, and we’re getting them out by the hundreds.But they can come back in. They can come back in. It’s tougher, but they can come back in. So we’re working out systems now, and we called out the National Guard. And, you know, we’re doing a real job.But I’ll tell you what: The laws of this country have to be strengthened and toughened up, because it is crazy. How about that? Catch — that means you catch them. Now you release them. That’s what it’s called — catch-and-release. Just think of that.And chain migration — think of that. So you come in, and now you can bring your family, and then you can bring your mother and your father. You can bring your grandmother. You can bring your this; you can bring — we had somebody on the West Side Highway, which I know very well — in Manhattan — he ran over — I think he killed about eight people. And they never mention the 12 people that have been horribly injured. You know, these are not people that have been a little bit hurt. You know, they’ll lose legs and arms, and they’re destroyed for life. Nobody ever says that. You know, they don’t say, 12 people were absolutely destroyed. A man goes out to run because he wants to keep himself in shape, and he ends up going home with no leg, no arm. And all he wanted to do was run. It’s a beautiful place along the Hudson River.And this guy comes out and he makes a right turn, right where everyone runs. He’s on the highway going 50, 60 miles an hour. He just goes, “Eh.” Then he killed eight people and injured many, many people. Still in the hospital, some of them. That was months ago. And came in through chain migration. Or he might have also come in through a lottery. But he brought a lot of people with him. They say 22 people. Twenty-two people.So this guy, because he’s here, now can get the mother and the father and the grandmother and the cousins and the brothers and the sisters and the aunts and the uncles. This is what the Democrats are doing to you. And they like it because they think they’re going to vote Democrat. Okay? Believe me, they’re doing that for that reason. (Applause.)They’re doing it for that reason and other reasons. And other reasons. And other reasons. But they are doing it for that reason, because they’re not going to be voting with us for the most part. A lot of them aren’t going to be voting. A lot of times it doesn’t matter, because in many places, like California, the same person votes many times. (Laughter.) You probably heard about that. They always like to say, “Oh, that’s a conspiracy theory.” Not a conspiracy theory, folks. Millions and millions of people. And it’s very hard because the state guards their records. They don’t want to see it.So we have a lot of things going on, but a lot of things are being straightened out. And I just want to congratulate the state of West Virginia because I am so proud of you. You were with me from day one. From day one. I mean, it was — (applause) — no, you were with me from day one. There was never like, “Oh, gee, maybe it’s going to be close.” (Laughter.) And do you remember, at that beautiful arena — where’s the arena? Where was the arena, Shelley? At that beautiful — it probably held 7,000 people, and we had 20,000, 25,000 people that couldn’t get in.SENATOR CAPITO: No, in Charleston. Charleston.THE PRESIDENT: Wasn’t that incredible? And I went before the — I said, “Do you mind if I don’t come back? Because I want to focus on places where it’s going to be close, okay?” And everyone said, “Don’t worry about. Don’t come back.” Right?SENATOR CAPITO: It’s getting remodeled. It’s getting bigger.THE PRESIDENT: And we won — I think we won here by 42 points or something. Some incredible number. Forty-two points.SENATOR CAPITO: It’s getting remodeled, so it will be bigger.THE PRESIDENT: It’s getting remodeled. We’ll be back. (Applause.) All right?But I remember I said that. Because I was seeing these polls and we were so far ahead. I said, “Do you think it would be okay if I went to Pennsylvania?” Which, by the way, we won. (Laughter and applause). And if I went to North Carolina, which by the way, we won — and Wisconsin and Michigan, where it was close. States that hadn’t been won by Republicans in many, many years. So I really appreciate West Virginia. And I’m very proud of you, and your numbers are incredible. And, you know, you’re among the — percentage-wise, you’re among the greatest gainers in this country, and I think it’s great and it just wasn’t that way.But — a lot of reasons, but I’ll tell you what, you have done great. And we’re working on coal — clean coal. I always say “clean, beautiful coal.” And we’re working and the miners are happy. (Applause.) The miners are happy. And we’ll be looking at that 202. You know what a 202 is, right? We’ll be looking at that. We’re trying. But nine of your people just came up to me outside: “Could you talk about 202?” And we’ll be looking at that as soon as we get back.And I think with that, I’ll start — you know, this was going to be my remarks. It would have taken about two minutes but — (laughter) — what the hell. (Laughter.) That would have been a little boring. Little boring. No, I’m reading off the first paragraph and I said, “This is boring. Come on.” (Laughter.) We have to say — tell it like it is. We have to get Republicans in office.And I think with that, I’ll — maybe, Shelley, I’ll let you start off and you can — we can go around. And I’d like to have Jim say a few words.SENATOR CAPITO: Yes. Thank you.THE PRESIDENT: We’ll go around the horn. Thank you.SENATOR CAPITO: Thank you, Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT: And we’ll take some questions.SENATOR CAPITO: Yes. And welcome back to West Virginia for the fourth time. You could probably drive the car in. (Applause.) Yes.We really do have an incredible story to tell. And I’m going to go off script, because when people ask me, “What is something about President Trump that I don’t know that I might be interested to hear?” — and I always say that President Trump is an incredible listener. At any meeting I’ve ever been in with you, you’ve always listened to whoever is speaking and kind of take it in and then assimilate it, and then move forward in a policy sense. And I appreciate that. Because you are such a good listener, and you’re going to hear some good stories today.I want to remind you, and everybody here — which I think they already know — I was one of your earliest and staunchest supporter for the tax cut bill. (Applause.)THE PRESIDENT: That’s true. That’s true.SENATOR CAPITO: So it’s also no secret, West Virginia, we’ve had some tough times. We really have. But we’re in a sense of renewal and great optimism because of the policies that you’ve brought forward and that Congress has been able to help you with.I have a Share Your Stories initiative and I’m just going to briefly say two. And this is going to be brief. I asked people to share their stories about tax cuts and the influence that it’s had on you. And I was at a Holiday Inn Express and I learned that the desk clerk had just gotten her first paycheck from the tax — from the new schedule. And she got an extra $50 on her paycheck. And she came in the next morning and she told the manager, she had this bright smile on her face, she was so happy. And he goes, “Well, how come you’re in such a good mood today?” And she said, “With that $50, I was able to purchase high-speed Internet for my house so my daughter can do her homework.” So that is an impact on that person and her daughter. (Applause.)The second instance is a gentleman from Huntington, as well, who also just got a thousand-dollar raise with his company. And he said, “It’s just amazing.” He’s been able to save some. He’s also — with energy costs going up and traveling now that it’s spring, he’s able to use that to enjoy more things with his family.So he says thank you. I say thank you. And I look forward to hearing the stories today. And thank you, again, for coming.THE PRESIDENT: I do too. Thank you very much. And, Shelley, this will be the last time — April — be the last time that you’re going to go that old-fashioned, big, lots of pages, complicated tax form. Because next April you’re going to, in many cases, one page, one card. It’s going to be very, very different. Very, very different. (Applause.)So not only will you save a lot of money, because it’s a lot of money for a lot of people, but you’re also — and not to even mention the companies where they’re employing because now they have all this incentive. If you look, Apple is going to spend $350 billion building plants in our country instead of the different places they have them.But you’ll have a nice, simple form next year. This will be the last year. So take pictures of it and enjoy it. (Laughter.) This is the last time you’ll have to file a very complex and big tax form. It will be much easier starting next April.Jim.GOVERNOR JUSTICE: Well, Mr. President, let me just say just two or three things. First of all, this man is a friend of mine, and his family has been a friend for a long time. I can share with you just this — that what he’s done that has impacted our state thus far has changed our state in so many ways, it’s unbelievable.I mean, you just think, I ran on “tired of being 50th.” And we’re finally first in all kinds of things. And all of us have a gratitude to pay to this man and his guts — his guts to stand up — like we and like a lot of West Virginians do, to change our country, and to do this when he surely to God didn’t have to do this. I mean, this man stepped forward for all of us.Now, let me just say just this real quickly: The thing that I know about him that you may not is he really cares. He genuinely, in his heart, really cares about West Virginia, about you, and about this country.And let me just end with just this, because this I love to tell you to death: The last time he was here, I was in the limo with him and I said, “Mr. President, the ladies down at Hardee’s this morning when I was going through — (laughter) — were out of their minds.” But then they said, “Can you please tell him we said hi and we love him and everything else.” And he looked at me and he said, “You like Hardee’s?” (Laughter.) He said, “I like McDonald’s.” And then I asked him if he could sign something and give to those ladies. And he looked all through the limo, and finally he pulled out his speech. And he said — he wrote: “Hardee’s gals, take care of Big Jim, a great guy and great friend. Donald J. Trump.”Now, I’m telling you, that’s what kind of man we have in this office. And I love him with all my heart, and I’ll support him to the death. He’s a great man. Give him a giant round of applause. (Applause.)THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Jim. Thank you, Jim. That was very nice. Thank you very much. (Applause.)That’s really nice, Jim. Thank you very much. My sons come up — you know, they go hunting with Jim. He’s a good hunter. And they go hunting. They love to hunt. So thank you very much for that. That’s really beautiful.Maybe I could ask two very smart and very good representatives of you folks to say a few words. I’ll start with Evan, who — you’re going to be running, and you got a pretty close race going, I understand.REPRESENTATIVE JENKINS: Welcome. (Laughter.)THE PRESIDENT: We’re going to know the outcome. When is the actual race?PARTICIPANT: May 8th.THE PRESIDENT: May?PARTICIPANT: Eighth.THE PRESIDENT: May 8th. So go out and vote. Evan, go ahead. You’re up. Then Patrick.REPRESENTATIVE JENKINS: Thank you, Mr. President. Welcome to the 3rd Congressional District.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.REPRESENTATIVE JENKINS: Thank you. It’s an honor to have you. And as Shelley referenced, this is the fourth time in the 3rd Congressional District. So thank you — thank you very much.THE PRESIDENT: That’s right. Thank you.REPRESENTATIVE JENKINS: Terrific. You know, Shelley says people oftentimes ask her, “What’s something you don’t know about the President?” Let me suggest that something everybody in this room and every West Virginian knows, and that is, you’re a man keeping your promises. (Applause.)I was a proud early supporter of your candidacy. Thank you. You made a promise to the people of West Virginia to end the war on coal, and you referenced the campaign — remember your opponent said she was going to put a lot of coal miners out of work.THE PRESIDENT: Until she got here. (Laughter and applause.) That didn’t work. Right? She came here and tried to say no. Did I ever say that? That was not a good day — the roundtable. (Laughter.)REPRESENTATIVE JENKINS: You made a promise to end the war on coal, and you’ve kept that promise. Thank you, on behalf of the great people of West Virginia.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Evan.REPRESENTATIVE JENKINS: You also said we’re going to cut taxes, and you did that. Shelley referenced, I think, some facts and figures. Let me give you an example.Not a lot of people know it, but for the average West Virginian, two kids — it’s $1,966 more in their pocket because of your tax cuts, Mr. President. Thank you, on behalf of the people of West Virginia. (Applause.)THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Evan. Thank you, Evan.REPRESENTATIVE JENKINS: Now, here’s something just as powerful: The average mortgage in West Virginia is $600. You divide 600 into 1,900, and you find out that, thanks to President Trump, President Trump paid the mortgage payment for three months of the average West Virginian. You want to talk about making a difference in a family’s life, you’ve done that. You’ve kept your promise.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Evan.REPRESENTATIVE JENKINS: And I’ve shared with the President here, a couple months ago — I said, “Mr. President, you know, in West Virginia, you have the highest approval rating of any state in the nation, because West Virginians understand your policies are working.” You ended the war on coal. You signed the legislation I had the honor of authoring that saved one-third of all the coal-mining jobs in America. And you did that in the Oval Office.So on behalf of the people of West Virginia, thanks for keeping your promise. You’re welcome to come back any time. (Applause.)THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. That’s beautiful. Thank you. And it’s my honor.Patrick?MR. MORRISEY: Well, Mr. President, welcome once again to “Wild and Wonderful” West Virginia. It’s my pleasure to be up with you at this roundtable today because your policies really have made an incredible difference in our state.Now, to put this in perspective a little bit, for the previous four years, as the Attorney General of West Virginia, I probably had to file a lawsuit, it felt like, every day against the Obama administration. Thank goodness we now have an administration to work closely with who’s committed to regulatory reform, tax relief, and helping our state out. We had the bullseye on us until you got here. So thank you for that. (Applause.)THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Thank you, Patrick.MR. MORRISEY: Now, when the President comes to your state for the fourth time, you know that he cares. He has an incredible commitment to the people of West Virginia. The reason why I’m so excited about President Trump and his administration is because on the key issues that matter to our state, your policies are dead-on correct.Regulatory reform — this is where you’ve made an incredible amount of progress. That Clean Power Plan, I sued Obama, took him all the way up to the Supreme Court, and I won. But you know what? It still was pending in the courts. You came in, and, boy, we walked into the White House and it was much easier dealing with the Trump administration than it ever was under Barack Obama. That’s an awesome thing for West Virginia. (Applause.)You know what? On issue after issue, you have a regulation, an executive order you put out — the one in, two out. Well, I defended your administration. We actually knocked it out of the D.C. court. Because President Trump understands we have to dramatically reduce the size and scope of the administrative state. And so he’s committed to doing that, with his appointments to the Cabinet, with his judicial picks. And that’s what gets me so excited about it.Now, he also is focusing on the opiate epidemic with a laser beam. I have to tell you, sir, that is our number-one challenge here in West Virginia.THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, it is.MR. MORRISEY: We have incredible amounts of senseless death here in our state. But over the last six months, we’ve been working with your DEA and others because we’re changing the completely failed drug quota system that spit millions and millions of pills into our state. Finally, after years of me being stonewalled by Obama, the Trump administration is delivering. That is a great thing for the citizens of our state, and I want to thank you for that. (Applause.)THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you. Thank you, Patrick. And, you know, speaking of opioid — because you do; you’re one of the top states, unfortunately, in the nation in terms of the opioid problem — but we just had $6 billion approved to fight opioid, to take care of people, to wean them off the problem once it begins. (Applause.) And that came with the tax cut bill also. And very important, $6 billion, that came just with the recent bill, the omni. And we got $6 billion approved toward the opioid crisis. It’s a tremendous crisis. And something that I’m very happy that we’re able to at least have the funding.Now we have to start the work. It is not an easy situation. This, whatever you call it, it starts and you get hooked so fast. You know, I have friend, he goes to the hospital, he had a bad arm. He comes out and he’s like a drug addict. You get hooked, and you get hooked fast.And we’re spending a lot of money on research so that it’s not so addictive — painkillers that aren’t so addictive. These are painkillers where you go into a hospital, you come out, you’re a drug addict. And then we have the more normalized drug problem, and a lot of that comes through the southern border. And that’s one of the other reasons we’re being very strong with the National Guard and with the wall. (Applause.) And we’re going to get it stopped. We’re going to get it stopped.We don’t need — it’s not even — we don’t — it’s not like we have a choice. We have to get it stopped and we will.Let’s go down toward the end, and you could talk a little bit and tell us about what’s going on. Go ahead.MR. HODGE: All right. Hey, good morning, Mr. —THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.MR. HODGE: — or good afternoon, Mr. President. My name is Tony Hodge. I’m a rural mail carrier here in West Virginia. I have my wife Jessica with me, and my two sons — Hayden, he’s 10 and Lenin is 7. They’re waving at you right now. (Applause.)THE PRESIDENT: Beautiful. Great. Great looking.MR. HODGE: We are here to thank you for signing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Because of this act, my family has been able to save, this year, $2,417.I want to tell you two quick ways of how we’ve used it. My wife and I, we’ve talked, we have a modest kitchen at home. We wanted to update the countertops. We’ve wanted to do this for a while. Last fall, we were talking about it. I said, “Well, let’s wait and see what happens with the tax plan.” I knew you wanted to have it passed by the end of the year. I said, “Let’s see what happens.”The tax plan went through, the new year came around, the economy is rolling. We felt, because of the tax plan, confident as consumers, and we said, you know what, now is the time. We’re going to take what we have a little bit extra of, we’re going to go out, we’re going to update our home. That’s one way.The other way is — you just spoke about the opioid epidemic. The part of West Virginia I’m from — Hurricane, it’s over near Charleston and Huntington — one of the most effective ways that we deal with the opioid epidemic is through our faith-based initiatives. And because I’m getting a little bit of extra money in my paycheck, and my wife as well, we are able to give a little bit more to our churches, to ministries. And we use these ministries to fight this epidemic going on. Ministering people — to people; we’re seeing them set free.And when they’re set free and released from the bondage of their addiction, they are becoming productive members of society. They’re getting jobs. They’re restoring their families. They’re finding self-worth and dignity through gainful employment because of the work that our charitable organizations are doing. And we’re able to give into that.So those are two ways that it’s directly affected my family. If, Jessica, my wife, would like to say something.MRS. HODGE: I just want to say thank you. I said I wasn’t going to cry. (Laughter.) Gosh. I just want to say thank you to you for the tax cuts. This is a big deal for our family. I think half of this audience is our family. (Laughter.) We really support you. And this is a big deal. These tax cuts are a big deal.Thank you for listening to us. Thank you for fighting for us. Thank you for caring enough to allow us the opportunity to come here and tell you “thank you” to your face. My boys — my little 10-year-old wants to be President one day. (Laughter and applause.)THE PRESIDENT: Oh. It will happen. That’s fantastic. That’s a beautiful family.MRS. HODGE: And I just thank you for the opportunity.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. So beautiful. Thank you very much. Great family. Thank you. Take good care of them, okay, boys? Take good care of them. (Applause.) Thank you.Please.MR. BONNELL: Mr. President, first, thank you for the invitation. I really appreciate it. I think it’s an honor to meet you, and I’m happy and very proud to participate in this event.My name is Nathaniel Bonnell and I am the President of Citizens Bank of West Virginia. I’m from Elkins. That’s where Citizens is headquartered. We’re a small community bank. We have five branches within the state and we’ve operated out of Elkins for 94 years. So we have a long history in the state.Our staff is the heart and soul of what makes Citizens successful as a small community bank in a small town in West Virginia. And because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we were able to give every one of our 66 employees an additional $1,000 over and above their normal annual raises. (Applause.)THE PRESIDENT: Good. Great.MR. BONNELL: That $1,000 bonus — we talked to several of the staff members and they’ve told us several stories. And I’ve brought with me a staff member today that I’ll let speak with you in just a moment.But in addition to the bonuses, Citizens operates in rural Appalachia, and we know all too well that, oftentimes, small organizations, like us, help support local communities and charities. Citizens Bank, with the savings from the tax plan — or the tax reform — we have committed to increasing our philanthropy and we’ve made a couple of significant contributions, for our size, to the local nonprofit hospital, as well as the local liberal arts college in our town, as well as some other small things.But I think that the tax plan has given Citizens the opportunity not only to invest more money in our folks, who obviously deserve more, but also invest in our local communities and the nonprofits that serve those areas.So I brought with me today Anita Jones. She is with us and she is one of the recipients of the $1,000 bonus. And I’d like to let you — let her tell a little bit about her story.THE PRESIDENT: Great. Thank you.MS. JONES: Mr. President, I’m very honored to be here and to finally meet you. My name is Anita Rubianto Jones. I am from Elkins and I work at Citizens Bank of West Virginia as a mortgage loan processor. I am originally from Jakarta, Indonesia. I got married in 2006 and I moved to West Virginia in 2007. And in 2013, I became a proud U.S. citizen. (Applause.)This country has given me a lot of opportunities to know myself, to be well, to done well in so many things I do. I live in beautiful West Virginia. I left my family back home, but I gained more in here. I found them in my workplace, I found them in college, and I found them in my communities.I went to Davis and Elkins College in 2009. And in 2010, I had my internship at the bank. And 2010 I started working myself up to the position that I am today. And this year, this last 2018, I had a wonderful surprise from the bank. (Laughter.) We all do. We have $1,000 bonus each. For me, it is such a blessing because I’m going to use that money to add the trip for me to go home — my home country — to visit my parents and my dad that has not been well. And I have not been home since 2009.THE PRESIDENT: Wow.MS. JONES: Yeah. And I’m going to bring my son, Daniel, to go home with me because he forgot everything about where he came from. It is very important for him to do so.So, I am thankful for the opportunity you gave me. And again, I’m very honored.THE PRESIDENT: That’s so nice. (Applause.) Thank you. And have a good trip. I know Indonesia very well. Great people and great — you have some great representatives that I’ve gotten to know very well in Indonesia. So have a good trip. That’s really nice.And, you know, your bank, maybe from the standpoint of lending — we’ve done something very important; we made it a lot easier for you to lend now to great people that a short period of time ago you were not able to lend because of rules, regulations, and you were lending to people that you didn’t even want to lend. And the people that you wanted to, it was all messed up with the rules, regulations, and everything else. And I’m sure you find a big difference.But also, we’re working on Dodd-Frank right now so that especially the smaller institutions can, like — from areas like right here, where you have some incredible people that want to borrow money, they could never borrow money to start a business or anything else. As you know, you were able to do that. The lending difference, you see a big difference right now. And the lending climate and the level of anger at banks was just enormous. It was horrible what was going on. And there’s a tremendous difference right now. You see that as a banker?MR. BONNELL: Significant difference. And community banking is significantly different than, I’ll say, Wall Street banking.THE PRESIDENT: Right. Absolutely.MR. BONNELL: And tailoring regulation to community banks is really important to small towns like Elkins and small towns in West Virginia. So —THE PRESIDENT: That’s made a big difference. That’s great. And we’re doing a step further, and it should be done fairly quickly. We’re actually — you won’t believe this — we’re actually getting bipartisan support. Does anybody believe that? (Laughter.) Maybe Joe won’t, but most people would. (Laughter and applause). So thank you. Thank you. That’s a great story. Beautiful.Yes, sir.MR. FARRELL: Good afternoon, Mr. President. Welcome back to West Virginia. We’re glad you’re here. My name is Sean Farrell. I’m the principal engineer at Service Pump and Supply in Huntington, West Virginia. We primarily serve the coal industry, developing solutions for their water issues.This is my wife, Michelle.MRS. FARRELL: Hello, Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT: Hi.MRS. FARRELL: I would like to introduce with you today that we have our two children, Carly, Collin, here with us today. (Applause.) Both of our children attend St. Joseph Catholic School, which is a private school in our hometown of Huntington.MR. FARRELL: Sir, last month, we opened for the first time a 529 account. Previously, these accounts could only be used to spend on college education. With the changes to the tax law, we can now spend it with St. Joe, for our kids’ K-12 education.THE PRESIDENT: Great.MR. FARRELL: It’s a great benefit to us. We know a lot of families that are taking advantage of it as well. So we appreciate that change to the tax law that allows us to save and invest in those accounts and spend it on their K-12 education at St. Jo.Additionally, Service Pump, where I work, everybody in the company received a raise as a direct result of the tax plan. And we made sure that everyone there knew that the reason that the reason they got raises was because of the new tax laws. So we really appreciate that.On a side note, we had an impromptu spring break trip to Washington, D.C. the last three days. Purdue and Marshall both were out of the basketball tournament, so — (laughter) — my plans opened up.So we took our two kids to Washington, D.C. and explored all the things that there is to do there. Our son was disappointed we couldn’t walk up to the front door of the White House and ask for you. (Laughter.)But we appreciate that you’re here. We thank you for all that you’ve done for West Virginia and the fact that you’re here and that my little guy gets a chance to say hello.THE PRESIDENT: That’s really nice. Thank you. Hello. (Applause.)Please. Please.MR. DOTSON: Thank you, Mr. President. My name is Terry Dotson. I’m the Chairman and CEO of a company called Worldwide Equipment. We have 48 rooftops in six states. Our company is 50 years old. And partly because of your administration, we were able to bring every employee that had been with us over 50 years, and celebrate 400 rooms we rented from Jim down at the Greenbrier last May. (Laughter.)We’ve suffered through the — we employ about 225 people in West Virginia and have six rooftops here. We currently have about a $6 million payroll, yearly, in the state of West Virginia.Our employees this past — because of the tax cut and your administration, and the changes that you’ve made in the energy business, we were able to give every employee a $300 bonus. We’ve been able to give more rapid raises. We’ve broken ground on two new facilities in another state. Yesterday, we just announced the acquisition of another location that we employ people.You know, this country moves on trucks. Eighty-four percent of all freight in this country moves solely on a truck. And with the technology we have today, the air going out of a truck is cleaner than the air coming into it. And I can tell you how good the total country is in business today — that’s changed since you’ve been in office — is virtually the trucking industry is sold out for this entire year’s build. And they’re scheduling now for the first quarter.You’ve made a huge difference. Your tax cuts have made a difference. And I can tell you our people know that your tax cuts have made a difference. I can tell you that it’s not crumbs to them when they can pay their car payments and invest in their children’s future. It’s extremely important that the money stays and turns over in the communities. You’re a businessman and you know that.And I thank you very much for the things that you’ve done, for the things that you’ve made possible by you being in office. And I just pray to God that you stay focused and get it done as it needs to be. Because you’ve done a great job, and you’re (inaudible). (Applause.)THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. That’s very nice. Thank you. (Applause.)MR. DOTSON: I’d like to introduce our HR person for another statement.THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Go ahead. Thank you.PARTICIPANT: Hello, Mr. President. I just want to say that, because of your tax cuts, our employees were able to enjoy bonuses this year. Most of our businesses are located throughout the coalfields. And you guys were talking about the war on coal. I, firsthand, know — not only as an HR director and as a business person, but I’m married to a very proud coal miner. So, personally, I know what that wage on war — on coal really did to our areas.Our employees, I’m proud to say, that throughout the previous administration’s war on coal, that Worldwide Equipment didn’t — we held the line. We had zero layoffs throughout that entire time. And to me, that only reinforced to our employees how dedicated we were to them.When we were able to give the bonuses, we had employees who — they came at a time where people were looking to travel. They wanted to go be with their families. It was over the Christmas holiday when we actually gave the bonuses. We had employees who may not otherwise have been able to travel to see family who lived in other states. We had an employee who actually wrote a thank-you letter to Mr. Dotson. He actually used that money to go spend time with his father who was dying during that time. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have had the means to have done that.We had employees who spent the bonuses on things such as car seats, things that many of us don’t even think that maybe — you know, where’s that extra money going to come from? And we were able to actually give them a little bit of cushion.And I’m proud to say that, under your administration, Mr. President, and the administration, the hardworking people of our company feel like they’ve been able to take a deep breath and maybe relax a little bit and enjoy some of the extras that we’re able to provide because of you and your administration.I just want to say thank you, on behalf of Worldwide Equipment and all of our employees. Thank you.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. That’s so nice. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.)And, you know, you talk about the trucking industry. It’s true, they’re doing very well, and they’re building a lot of trucks. And we want those trucks, for the most part, to be built right here in the United States. Right? Right here in the U.S. (Applause.) And a lot of them are.Thank you. That’s great. It’s a great story.MR. LILLY: President Trump, I want to thank you for just this opportunity to address you. I want to thank God for this opportunity as well. I’m not a political person by any means. I mean, I really don’t pay a whole lot of attention to it. I’m a simple man. I’m a father, I’m a worker, I’m a husband, and that’s what I focus on.You know, my daughter, Hailey (ph), is in the audience. We have two young sons, Jordan and Jason, that — (applause) — we have two young sons, Jordan and Jason, that wasn’t able to come today. And, you know, I work for them.We’re Christians. We serve at our church, Daniels Bible Church. Our pastor is with us today in the audience. And I know he’s a big supporter. And you know —THE PRESIDENT: Which one is he? Where is your pastor?MR. LILLY: Carl Dingus. He’s up there waving.MRS. LILLY: There he is. All the way up there. (Applause.)MR. LILLY: But, you know, I work for Leslie Equipment. We’re a John Deere dealership, and last week you was at a Cat training facility. They might be our competition. But you was — (laughter) — talking, just speaking a lot about infrastructure and how you’re going to rebuild the American infrastructure. And, you know, that’s a blessing to hear for our company.You know, my job as a parts manager is to make sure that our dealership has the parts in stock to keep the machine that’s going to take care of that infrastructure running. So, you know, just in job security, that’s good to know.You know, we also — you know, coalfields are big around our area. It’s good to see that coming back. It’s also — we, me and my wife, we’re members of — steering committee members for the Friends of Coal Auto Fair, which is a large car show in the area. It benefits a lot of local charities, the biggest one being Hospice of Southern West Virginia. And it’s just great to be able to see you supporting the industries that really supports those charities and that event.The bigger reason we’re here is our family was blessed a lot by the tax cuts. I’m going to introduce my wife now, Elizabeth. She can tell you exactly how that’s been a blessing to our family.MRS. LILLY: Hi, my name is Elizabeth. Thank you for being here. Thank you for letting us be here. We really appreciate it.Our family is averaging savings, now, right over $3,500. So, it’s amazing. And Hailey — we actually — she’s joined the archery team for her school, and we get to travel with her now and watch her shoot archery all over the state of West Virginia, which is awesome.And also, my health — we have some issues with my health, and we have to travel about three hours one way to the hospital that I have to go to. And instead of driving down and back, now we can stay overnight instead of making the trip in one day. So that’s amazing.THE PRESIDENT: That’s great.MRS. LILLY: It’s really, really helped us out.THE PRESIDENT: That’s great. Thank you. That’s beautiful. Thank you. (Applause.) And you’re doing well, right?MRS. LILLY: I have surgery again in June, but I’m okay.THE PRESIDENT: You’re going to be well.MRS. LILLY: Yeah, I’m good.THE PRESIDENT: No doubt. That’s great. Thank you very much.MR. LILLY: Thanks.THE PRESIDENT: It’s really beautiful. Thank you.Please.MR. HITCHCOCK: President Trump, it’s an honor to have the opportunity to speak with you today. And I want to thank you also, again, for coming back to West Virginia. I know it means a great deal to all of our citizens that you’re here. Thank you.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you.MR. HITCHCOCK: I’m Hugh Hitchcock. I’m President and CEO of Davis Trust Company. We’re a $145 million community asset — community bank in Elkins, West Virginia, about 110 miles north of White Sulphur Springs. We’ve been in business for over 117 years. We have 45 full-time employees. We’re members of the Community Bankers of West Virginia, which is a state affiliate to the ICBA.Last year, about this time, some of our members got the opportunity to visit with you in the Rose Garden and we presented you with one of our red hats, which obviously is a play off your red hat, made famous during the campaign with Make America Great Again. (Applause.)Now, obviously, our red hat is not as famous as yours. But our slogan, “Make Community Banks Great Again,” certainly goes hand-in-hand — (laughter) — with what you are working to accomplish in America, Mr. President. Thank you.The Tax Cut and Jobs Act, signed by you into law right before Christmas, is a prime example of what you’re doing to provide the tools to help business turn things around in our country. And you are turning things around.On the business side, by reducing the corporate tax rate from 34 to 21 percent right out of the gate, it helps make us more competitive, it improves our bottom line, which in turn enables us to invest more into our community — more lending, more small business lending, more consumer lending, and also invest more in the community.Like Nathaniel mentioned, we’re also located in Elkins, West Virginia. We’re a large supporter of our community and we’re able to do more. The local college, the local United Way — they look to the community banks. They look to Davis Trust Company. And because of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, we’re able to do more.And in this case, our board also, with the benefits that we’re seeing, we were able to give an across-the-board 3 percent pay increase coupled with a 2 percent cost-of-living increase. And I can assure everyone listening: This was much more than just crumbs. It makes a tremendous difference. (Applause.)And, Mr. President, I urge you to stay the course. Stay the course. It’s not easy And what you have done for our country — you, again, are helping to turn things around in a big way.And now, to give you an idea of what the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act means to one of our employees, it’s my pleasure to introduce to you one of our recently promoted Assistant Head Teller, Ann Macomber, to explain just what the benefit of the base-pay increase means to her.Thank you for being here.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.MR. HITCHCOCK: Thank you.THE PRESIDENT: Thank very much. (Applause.)MS. MACOMBER: I am so fortunate to work for a company willing to share their savings from the tax plan with their employees. The employees of Davis Trust Company did not just receive a one-time-only bonus, but an increase to our wages. This means more money in our paychecks now and also in the future.I am already using my extra money to spoil my grandsons just a little bit more. (Laughter.) I have two grandsons; Ethan is nine, and Silas will be seven tomorrow. Silas wanted a guitar for his birthday, and grandma came through and he is getting a guitar for his birthday tomorrow. (Applause.)His brother, Ethan, plays the banjo, but has decided now he wants to play the violin. So I imagine that I will be buying a violin in the very near future. (Laughter.)I appreciate the opportunity to express my gratitude to both my employer, Davis Trust Company, and also to you, Mr. President. Thank you.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you very much. And also, I think you were probably in the White House, and I saw a whole group of people. It was over the regulation. They were being regulated right out of business and we took care of that. And we did it in a very nasty fashion. You would have been very proud of us. (Laughter.) We had a man that was a disaster. He really — he was inflicting pain, wasn’t he?MR. HITCHCOCK: Absolutely.THE PRESIDENT: It was crazy.MR. HITCHCOCK: Absolutely.THE PRESIDENT: These are great people. There was, you know, 100-year-old institutions that were not going to make it. And we took care of that situation very rapidly. It was a terrible thing that was happening to a lot of great institutions, smaller institutions. And now they’re thriving, I would say, right?MR. HITCHCOCK: Yes. Things are — have definitely turned around.THE PRESIDENT: Little difference. That’s good. Thank you very much Hugh. I’m glad to see you in happier times. You were not so happy when I saw you.MR. HITCHCOCK: (Inaudible.)THE PRESIDENT: Yep.MR. HITCHCOCK: Thank you. (Applause.)THE PRESIDENT: So that pretty much wraps it up. We’re very proud of the tax cut. It’s — a lot of people are being helped so much, and so many things in there that we don’t even talk about, when you’re talking about tooling and trucking and all of the elements of investment that you have to make and now you have one-year expensing. Who would have believed you would have had that? Nobody ever thought that was going to be possible to get where you can write off your expenses in one year what you — it was simply one-year expensing. I think it’s going to be the greatest benefit in the whole bill. I actually think that perhaps could have the biggest benefit in the bill.Tremendous amounts of money is coming, and basically billions and billions of dollars is being brought from offshore where big companies, small companies, they had money trapped outside of our country; they couldn’t get it in. And I think it’s going to end up being $4 trillion will come back in. Already, Apple said they’re bringing back about $220 billion and others are bringing back billions and billions of dollars, and it’s coming back at a faster rate than we ever thought possible.So it’s been — it’s really been tremendous. So I just can say, on behalf of myself and Republicans and the Trump administration, and all of the people that work so hard, it’s been an honor. It’s had a huge impact on our country. And wait until you see the numbers. The numbers are starting to get released of companies and, frankly, families and their spending and their spending habits, and they’re able to go out and buy things. And hopefully we’re going to start making more things in the United States.And that will be great when you see elements of your life that were very important and they were made in different countries. I think we’re going to start making things here again, and that’s very important. When we renegotiate a lot of these deals, we’re taking a lot of the incentive away to go elsewhere.We want our people to make products that they’re buying and we want to be proud of it again. You know, we used to have an expression, “Made in the USA.” And we don’t hear that too much anymore, but we’re starting to hear it a lot. We have factories moving from Mexico. And again, we’re negotiating a deal with Mexico, NAFTA, and I hope it works out. But it was a horrible deal for our country. It was incompetently drawn. It was a shame that it ever happened. It emptied out millions of jobs. Thousands of factories and plants. They left. And a lot of them are moving back. Chrysler just announced they’re moving back into Michigan and many other car companies are expanding and building brand-new plants. That hasn’t happened for many years — for decades.So it’s my honor. We’re enjoying it. We’re fighting it. We got a lot of people out there that I don’t think are very good people, but that’s okay. We have some people that are great people. We have some people that really, they love this country more than anything and they see now it’s on the right track. And it’s going to get better and better. And you’ll see a lot of changes and a lot of very positive changes.But it’s been great hearing your stories. Your stories have been fantastic. And, Jim, I want to thank you. And, Shelley, I want to thank you. And, Patrick and Evan, good luck. I don’t know, you two — (laughter) — you two. Good luck.MR. MORRISEY: Thank you, Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT: That’s going to be a — should we do a little test? (Laughter.)REPRESENTATIVE JENKINS: Yes. Let’s do it. Let’s do it. (Laughter.)THE PRESIDENT: Who’s voting for Patrick?AUDIENCE: (Cheers.)THE PRESIDENT: Who’s voting for Evan?AUDIENCE: (Cheers.)MR. MORRISEY: This is his Congressional district.THE PRESIDENT: I don’t know. Yes, it’s your district. Okay. (Laughter.)MR. MORRISEY: We’re statewide.THE PRESIDENT: But it was fairly close. (Laughter.) It was fairly close, right?Hey, thanks everybody. We love you all. We’ll be back. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.)END

http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/05/political-thinkers/headline-falsely-says-rep-steve-king-facing-arrest/	"After attacking Emma Gonzalez, U.S. Rep. Steve King is ""facing arrest."""	false	['Congress', 'Crime']	https://www.politicalthinkers.site/	https://www.politicalthinkers.site/congressman-just-annihilated-parkland-victim-in-calling-her-out-now-hes-facing-arrest/	2018/04/05	Congressman Just ANNIHILATED Parkland ‘Victim’ In Calling Her Out – Now He’s Facing ARREST! adminDAMN!! Welcome To The School Of HARD KNOCKS!On Sunday the Congressman tweeted out what was the pure truth by calling attention to the fact that Emma Gonzales, who has risen to fame by being one of the anti-gun and anti-second amendment activists in the wake of the Parkland Florida shooting which took place on Valentine’s Day where 17 people lost their lives while the Broward County Sheriff’s department coward in a corner, actually wore a jacket with a Cuban flag on it.Republican Congressman Steve King from Iowa is under fire for pointing out the obvious.King’s campaign Facebook page on Sunday featured a picture of Emma Gonzalez as she gave a speech at Saturday’s “March for Our Lives” rally in Washington. Alongside a photo of Gonzalez, who wore a Cuban flag patch, the page noted: “This is how you look when you claim Cuban heritage yet don’t speak Spanish and ignore the fact that your ancestors fled the island when the dictatorship turned Cuba into a prison camp, after removing all weapons from its citizens; hence their right to self-defense.”Of course, some people can’t handle the truth. What do they do? They investigate, the same way they have investigated President Trump since even before he came into office.BREAKING: We just filed a House Ethics Complaint on Rep. Steve King for his racist attack against Parkland shooting survivor Emma Gonzalez. We also uncovered tens of thousands in campaign payments & reimbursements to members of King’s family. We included that in the complaint. pic.twitter.com/LLD4ccxj4G— Scott Dworkin (@funder) March 27, 2018They are trying to take this Congressman down on made up charges because they know what this so-called “activist” did was wrong and they need to deflect attention. You don’t try to convince law-abiding America Citizens to give up their guns while wearing a flag that represents a nation which was taken over by a murderous dictator who took everyone’s guns away and ruled with an iron fist for over 50 years.Funny how all of a sudden after @SteveKingIA points out the obvious you @TheDemocrats suddenly care about ethics. Didn’t @SenatorReid and #Feinstein take contributions for their families and many other kickbacks? #WitchHunt— al_waisman (@al_waisman) March 29, 2018But since the left knows it’s not illegal to be a “racist” as they claim Congressman King to be for pointing out the truth they have to find another way to get him out of the way. And since the American public pretty much expects ethics violations from the Democrat Party, but not from the Republicans, they have come up with these trumped up charges. Isn’t it interesting how these accusations magically appeared after his post on Sunday?More on these fake charges and how the left is trying to use this to take out Speaker Paul Ryan via Reverbpress :“On Sunday, Iowa Congressman Steve King tweeted a clearly racist, “alternative facts” based attack on Emma Gonzalez, the firebrand survivor of the Valentines Day mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman High School in Parkland, Florida who has become an instant celebrity and a formidable activist in the wake of the attack.This is atrocious, What kind of Congress is this?”King left the tweet up just long enough for his racist base to notice, and then deleted it as the backlash from more sensible folks who also noticed came in. But now, he probably regrets ever posting it at all – because it started the ball rolling on something that could get him in serious trouble.King is well known for his history of shamelessÂ racism and sexism. During the Obama years he was a cheerleader for the likewise racist, and “alternative facts” based “Birther” movement, which insisted that President Obama was born in Kenya, not Hawaii – despite clear evidence to the contrary. King even once asked on CNN what non-white races ever did for humanity, leaving mouths agape on the screen and around the country. And since Trump and his neo-nationalist movement began, he’s been even more open about it than ever.But now an ethics investigation has been launched into King after the resistance watchdog group The Democratic Coalition Against Trump submitted a request to the House Office of Congressional Ethics. In the request, they ask the Ethics Office to look into his racist tweet.“This is atrocious,” Dworkin told Reverb Press. “What kind of Congress is this? Are they members of the mafia? Threatening kids who had their school shot up. Who watched their friends get shot and die in front of their eyes… Congress should be held to a higher standard, not a lower one.”And there’s more.Â The group ALSO ask the Ethics Office to look into serious financial improprieties uncovered by the watchdog group in the course of their investigation. As reported by the Iowa paper of record, the Des Moines Register, King has a long history of employing his family in ways the paper calls “unusual“.According to Dworkin, from 2004 to 2017 King has paid $805,000 to members of his own family. And King’s son has received more than $32,000 from “Keep The Promise I”, an independent group which backed Ted Cruz during the 2016 election. Dworkin noted that the payment from Keep The Promise to King’s son was “interesting” given the revelations about Cambridge Analytica, the scandal plagued data (and dirty tricks) firm that worked with Cruz, before switching to the Trump campaign.And now, the House Ethics Office will not only be investigating if King behaved unethically with his latest bigoted BS, but also whether or not he improperly funneled “tens of thousands” of dollars to members of his family, through his campaign.So, there’s a strong possibility that this could lead to the penitentiary, before all is said and done.And, there’s even more. The watchdog group also plans to file a separate request for an ethics investigation into Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, for allowing King’s racist behavior without consequence.So, all in all, I bet Steve King wishes he’d kept his racist lies to himself now. And Paul Ryan probably does too.” 	
http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/05/viral-truth-wire/no-barack-obama-did-not-flee-country-because-surfa/	"""Obama secretly flees US - leaves stunning evidence behind."""	pants on fire!	['Fake news']	https://www.viraltruthwire.com/	https://www.viraltruthwire.com/obama-secretly-flees-us-leaves-stunning-evidence-behind/	2018/04/05	adminNow former intelligence officer Lt. Col Tony Shaffer just revealed why!After months of the liberal media ridiculing Trump over his claim that Obama spied on him during the election, Trump finally got vindication this week. America learned the truth on Tuesday that Obama did in fact unconstitutionally spy on Trump throughout the presidential election, leaving Barack Obama with his pants down yet again.Now former intelligence officer Lt. Col Tony Shaffer just revealed that Obama’s wiretapping was not only a federal crime, but says that the results of this investigation will likely result in Obama being brought up on FELONY CHARGES. The colonel’s dire prediction about Obama’s future is sending shock-waves through the black hearts of liberals all across America today, as it’s now thrown a monkey wrench into Obama’s plans to stage his “political comeback” this fall.In a recent interview with Trending Today USA, Lt. Col Tony Shaffer called ‘Obamagate’ an “order of magnitude” even bigger than the Watergate scandal because the incident included “using nation-state resources for purposes of political gain.”When asked if Obama could be arrested for violating the law, he said that it would be the “first time a former president could be indicted for a felony.”“…I think it is very possible that he acted outside of the scope of his duties, responsibilities and authorities to turn the resources of a nation-state on a candidate. This is, as I’ve said before, soviet-dictator level wrongdoing,” he added.Shaffer said that Obama using government resources to spy on Trump was for the sole purpose of getting Hillary into office, as Obama hoped the wiretapping would produce enough “dirt” on Trump to sabotage his presidential run.Given Shaffer’s lengthy military career, his rise to the top of the American intelligence community, and his current senior position at the prestigious London Center for Policy Research, his prediction about Obama shouldn’t be scoffed at. Being brought up on felony charges would completely destroy Obama’s plan of making his political comeback this year, as he’d be trying to figure out a way to keep himself out of prison instead of spending his hours obsessing with ways to bring Trump down.The Hill reported on just how extensive Obama’s spying truly was, as this unconstitutional move wasn’t just limited to listening in on Trump’s calls. They reported:If these reports are accurate, it means U.S. intelligence agencies secretly surveilled at least a half dozen Trump associates. And those are just the ones we know about.Besides Manafort, the officials include former Trump advisers Carter Page and Michael Flynn. Last week, we discovered multiple Trump “transition officials” were “incidentally” captured during government surveillance of a foreign official. We know this because former Obama adviser Susan Rice reportedly admitted “unmasking,” or asking to know the identities of, the officials. Spying on U.S. citizens is considered so sensitive, their names are supposed to be hidden or “masked,” even inside the government, to protect their privacy.In May, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates acknowledged they, too, reviewed communications of political figures, secretly collected under President Obama.After getting away with whatever the hell he wanted over the past 8 years and wiping his butt with the Constitution, it looks like Obama’s cockiness might just be his undoing. He might have gotten away with his antics in the past, but things are vastly different now that Obama doesn’t have all his minions blocking all investigations into his crimes, as was the case when he was president.If this colonel’s predication is in fact true, Obama’s little plan to keep trolling Trump with his little shadow government from the headquarters of his D.C. home could soon be coming to an abrupt end. How poetic would it be that after spending 8 years pandering to terrorists and trying to destroy America that Obama could live out the rest of his life behind bars in an orange jumpsuit? Sounds like perfect justice for America!Facebook Comments

Terrorist attacks Trumps at Mar A Lago."""	false	['Crime', 'Terrorism']	https://www.thetrumptalks.com/	https://www.thetrumptalks.com/breaking-terrorist-attacked-trumps-at-mar-a-lago-police-on-scene/	2018/04/03	BREAKING! Terrorist Attacked Trumps At Mar A Lago – Police On SceneBREAKING! Terrorist Attacked Trumps At Mar A Lago – Police On SceneadminApril 2, 2018Since President Trump has been in office, the left has been in an uproar and doing their best to create as much civil unrest as possible. These angry leftists in their rage over the fact that Trump trounced Hillary in the 2016 presidential election have been fanning the flames of division in our country and promoting violence against the president. Over the last year, several liberal Democrat politicians and unhinged Hillary Clinton fanatics have made explicit death threats against President Trump which has kept the Secret Service on high alert. Now, over this holiday weekend, President Trump and his family had an urgent situation unfold that had the police rushing to the scene, and has everyone wondering when the violence will end?There was a time in our nation’s history that no matter who won the presidential election, the American people and the loser of the election would band together behind the elected president for the good of the nation. However, those days seem far behind after the last eight years of Barack Obama and his divisive nature that has thrust our country into constant turmoil. Now, instead of those in the Democrat party cheering on President Trump to ensure that he does a job well done for the American people, they have been actively doing their best to sabotage his presidency. For instance, over the last year, the left has been doing whatever they can to oust Trump from office with their phony Russian collusion story, and since that has not worked the way, they had hoped they are turning to threats of physical violence.Threats of violence toward President Trump is not anything new in this “brave new world” of politics, in fact just earlier last month, Democratic Congressman Tom Suozzi promoted acts of violence against Trump during a town hall meeting he attended. Then last year, Missouri Democratic State Senator Maria Chappelle-Nadal posted on Facebook that she hoped that President Trump was assassinated, are you starting to notice a pattern here?So, it should come as no surprise that civilians in the country would attack Trump, his family, and now his property, which is what happened over the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort.Here is more from Local 10 News:“Someone in West Palm Beach, Florida, took the term “paint the town red” a bit too literal on Saturday night.The entrance to Trump International Golf Club, the president’s course du jour while at the so-called Winter White House in Mar-a-Lago, had new decoration on Saturday evening in the form of red paint splattered all over one of the entrance signs.The red paint was tossed haphazardly on the left entrance with a can of paint visible on the ground. It’s unclear exactly when the vandalism happened.Two vans from the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Department were on scene investigating the apparent vandalism Saturday at about 10 p.m.Neither the U.S. Secret Service nor the sheriff’s department responded to inquiries from ABC NewsSaturday night.Donald Trump spent Saturday at Trump International Golf Club, according to the Tampa Bay Times, though it’s not clear if he was on the course. Trump was at the club on Friday as well. The president is usually secretive about whether he actually hits the links or not.Fox News host Sean Hannity and PGA golfer Dustin Johnson spent time with Trump at the golf club on Saturday as well, according to Palm Beach Post reporter George Bennett. Donald Trump Jr. shared a photo on Instagram of his daughter Kai with Johnson, the current world No. 1 player, and 2016 U.S. opener winner, on the course.It’s not clear whether any of the Trumps were at the club when the vandalism occurred.Trump opened the golf club in 1999, the first of what is now many courses in his portfolio. According to ABC News’ analysis of public records of Trump’s schedule, the president spent 109 days at one of his properties in his first year in office.The president’s Mar-a-Lago estate is just a 15-minute drive from Trump International.”Now, while this attack on Trump’s property is disgusting, it is not the first time it has been done. Earlier last year, another of Trump’s hotels were vandalized when a light was projected onto the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, several anti-Trump messages.Here is more from Business Insider:“Several messages were displayed in a bluish light. The Washington Post reported that the words “PAY TRUMP BRIBES HERE” appeared above the entrance to the building, along with an arrow pointing toward the entrance of the hotel.Another projection read, “EMOLUMENTS WELCOME” — an apparent reference to the emoluments clause that became a point of contention amid arguments about Trump’s financial conflicts of interest in the early days of his presidency. The “emoluments” message was displayed over a backdrop of Turkey’s flag.”Whether or not you agree with the president in office there is a proper way to air your grievances but to destroy private property is not the way. One can only hope that the people who did this to Trump’s resort will be found and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law to send a clear message to others who may think this behavior is acceptable when it most certainly isn’t.	
http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/03/fellowship-minds/no-march-our-lives-demonstration-was-not-prepared-/	"""Application for March for Our Lives permit was made months before Parkland shooting"" "	pants on fire!	['Fake news']	https://fellowshipoftheminds.com/	https://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2018/03/30/application-for-march-for-our-lives-permit-was-made-months-before/	2018/04/03	On March 24, 2018, one month and ten days after the February 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, student-led pro-gun control “March For Our Lives” demonstrations took place across America, including in Washington, D.C. The word “Our” in March For Our Lives refers to students. March For Our Lives was a student-led demonstration in support of tighter gun control that took place on March 24, 2018, in Washington, D.C., with over 800 sibling events throughout the United States and around the world. Student organizers from Never Again MSD planned the march in collaboration with the nonprofit organization Everytown for Gun Safety. The event followed the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, which was described by many media outlets as a possible tipping point for gun control legislation. Never Again MSD (MSD refers to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School) is a group started on social media as a movement “For survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting, by survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting” using the hashtag #NeverAgain. The MSD student survivors who formed Never Again MSD include the now-famous David Hogg, Emma Gonzalez, and Cameron Kasky. Public demonstrations, especially those that are large-scale like March For Our Lives, require a permit from the police department of the city in which the demonstration will take place. A source of European researcher Ole Dammegard contacted the Metropolitan D.C. Police Department concerning the permit for the March For Our Lives demonstration in Washington, D.C. Dammegard’s source received the following email from Officer Scott C. In reference to your inquiry concerning the March For Our Lives Demonstration, here in the District of Columbia on March 24, 2018. MPD received a permit application several months prior to the actual event, and there was several months of planning for this large event. If your have any additional question sor concerns, please feel free in contacting me directly. Officer Scott C. Earhardt, Badge No. Homeland Security BureauSpecial Operations DivisionPlanning and LogisticsMetropolitan Police Department2850 New York Ave., N.E. Washington, D.C. According to the PDF document, Metropolitan Police Department, Washington.D.C., Scott Earhardt indeed is a detective there. Metropolitan Police Department, Washington.D.C. The shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas (MSD) High School occurred on February 14, 2018. A day after the shooting, on February 15, 2018, MSD students formed the group, Never Again MSD. On March 24, 2018, March For Our Lives demonstrations took place in Washington, D.C. (and other cities). Among the organizers of March For Our Lives is Never Again MSD, which had not existed before February 15. The D.C. Metropolitan Police Department received a permit application for March For Our Lives demonstration “several months prior to the actual event”. How can Never Again MSD apply for a permit “several months” BEFORE the group had even been formed? How can an application be made for a permit for a “March For Our Lives” demonstration “several months” BEFORE the Parkland MSD school shooting that galvanized MSD students to form the Never Again MSD group that organized the demonstration? There are claims that the email from Officer Earhardt is bogus, and that there’s a permit application for March For Our Lives in D.C. which is dated February 20, 2018, but which is an application to the National Park Service, not Metro PD. See “The curious ever-changing dates of March For Our Lives permit application“. I, therefore, asked Professor James Fetzer for the original Earhardt email. Fetzer had obtained the screenshot of the email from Ole Dammegard, whose friend was the person who originally contacted Officer Earhardt about the permit. I just received an email from Mr. Dammegard, with an attachment of the original Earhardt email, indicating the date on which the email was sent to Dammegard’s friend who, understandably, prefers to remain anonymous. I find the above email from Officer Earhardt to be credible.

The immigration rules will prohibit migrants from coming to the country and taking advantage of free American welfare money right away. It will slow down, or stop, chain migration while protecting American workers and potentially saving taxpayers money.What used to happen is that people would migrate to America and just live on the free money they received. That’s called welfare abuse. America is open to migrants, but perhaps we don’t want migrants who can’t fend for themselves. Maybe it’s better if people who are self-sufficient migrate to the country so that we can reduce the amount of citizens living off the system.President Trump wants to introduce a merit-based Green card system in which migrants compete for Visas. Migrants can earn points for themselves by learning to speak English, gaining job training or job offers, or doing something else that is considered a benefit to the America. The idea seems to be that in order for America to grant Visas or citizenship, the migrant has to give something back to the country. It’s as though the government wants to stop people coming to America and living off the system and would prefer people coming to the country to be contributors. Do something for America and America will do something for you.Migrants to those countries must compete for a limited number of visas by gaining points for English proficiency, competitive training, a job offer or another major achievement that benefits the host country.The concept, which is modeled after similar programs from Australia and Canada, is taking harsh criticism from activists. It’s like they want an open border policy where everyone gets free welfare money, but that would just be the downfall of America. If we observe what’s happening in Germany, with Merkel’s “come on in” policy, then we see a mass increase in horrible crimes like gang rape. Do we want mass amounts of migrant gang rape in America? There’s already enough trouble with crime in sanctuary cities that protect illegal immigrant criminals. Those folks should be deported because of their bad behavior and often violent crimes they commit on American people and even other immigrants.If America prevents immigrants from getting free benefits for five years, then that makes people think twice about coming here. If a family who thinks about crossing the border to start a new life knows that they cannot live for free, then they may not come at all. If they have possible jobs lined up and will be almost instantly integrating successfully with society, then that’s a great match. America is the land of the free, but not the land of the free money.Migrants who enter the United States cannot receive welfare during their first five years in the country, President Trump revealed from his upcoming immigration overhaul.“Just this week, we announced a historic immigration bill to create a merit-based Green Card system that ends the abuse of our welfare system, stops chain migration, and protects our workers and our economy,” he stated on his weekly radio address. “As an example, you cannot get welfare for five years when you come into our country.”“You cannot just come in like in past weeks, years, and decades, you come in immediately and start picking up welfare. For five years, you have to say you will not be asking or using our welfare systems.”Compare that to Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the border to millions of unvetted migrants who can’t speak German and lack employable skills, which dooms them to perpetual welfare paid by German taxpayers – and boredom that manifests into terrorist attacks against, once again, German taxpayers.Last year the German government admitted that only 2.8% of over 1.2 million migrants had gotten a job – but even then those statistics might be exaggerated, according to journalist Chris Menahan.“They said back in July only 55 out of one million migrants had got jobs with any major firms and 50 of those jobs were working at the post office,” he reported. “Two-thirds or more of these migrants are illiterate in their own languages.”“They came because Merkel promised them free money if they can just make it into the country.”What in tarnation would be a good reason for any country to accept illiterate people who don’t work? There is literally no benefit to the host country to admit people like that. I know it sounds mean to say this, but they don’t offer anything to the country other than leeching the system of funds and it’s a complete downgrade to the population. If you let too many low illiterate people into the country, then they have kids who could be illiterate, then over time, it would only decrease the overall intelligence of the country and civilization in America would suffer. We need hard working and intelligent people who bring promise and productivity to further the advancement of Americans and mankind. That sounds like quite a stretch but think of the impact of accepting one million people who mostly can’t read or don’t work.Now the government has to pay for them.Let’s say one million immigrants each get $30,000 worth of welfare benefits per year. That’s $30,000,000,000 of free welfare money sucked out of the American budget for people who put NOTHING back into our society, culture, or anything at all. That is literally a $0.00 return on investment. Not that people are a business, but that’s really bad business. And as you can see, Germany has turned into a cesspool from all the migrants flooding the gates and ruining their nation.Prepare for a massive backlash from liberals, democrats, and activists. There’s sure to be protests regarding Trump’s potential immigration policy.FOLLOW us on Facebook at Freedom Daily!

In other words, she once again made remarks that would go viral, putting her back in the spotlight, but it’s in such a negative way that most people had to shake their heads and say “eeeeewwwwwww” right after what she said to the Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley.Gidley and Griffin were at the same event and Gidley was passing by the table she was sitting at. Griffin snapped at him by asking how he sleeps at night. Gidley replied that he sleeps well and said thanks. Then it seems like she said something else, and he asked if they were going to go at it right there on the spot, and that’s when Griffin went into the full nasty mode and talked with a repulsive next few words that had people questioning her behavior and gender at the same time.Here’s what happened in full detail courtesy of the Washington Blade: “The event is a celebration of the First Amendment. As a longtime LGBT rights advocate, a comedian and provocateur, Griffin has made a long and successful career out of exercising her First Amendment right to free speech. The stunt last year in which she posed with a mock severed head of Donald Trump — which needlessly led CNN to fire her from a longstanding New Year’s Eve hosting gig with Anderson Cooper — was a textbook case of satire, which is constitutionally protected speech.Thus, the decision to invite Griffin proved an easy and obvious one. (We also invited Stormy Daniels, but her attorney, Michael Avenatti, told me without irony that it would be too much of a “sideshow” for her to attend.)Trending: Sarah Sanders Just Revealed What She Asked God For After Being Publicly Humiliated At WH DinnerGriffin didn’t disappoint, bringing her quick wit and fearless, LGBT-centric sense of humor to the dinner table. I met her and her boyfriend, Randy Bick, on the red carpet and held her purse as she posed for photographers and granted a series of TV interviews. Inside the heavy purse was a stapler; it turns out she suffered a last-minute wardrobe malfunction leaving the hotel, breaking a strap on her gown. After it was repaired, she feared a repeat and asked to borrow the stapler, just in case.She proved a good sport throughout the night, posing for an endless stream of selfies with (mostly gay) fans who congratulated her on surviving the Trump machine’s attacks in the aftermath of the photo scandal. When asked how her famous mom Maggie is at age 96, Griffin replied, “drunk.”The only awkward moment came when Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley tried to squeeze past our table. Griffin stopped him and said, “How do you sleep at night?” Gidley replied, “Very well, thank you.” When Griffin expressed doubt about that, Gidley asked, “Are we really going to do this?”That’s when things got interesting. Griffin, in her trademark style, retorted, “Yes we are, suck my d-ck! No, really, suck my d-ck!”There was some back-and-forth, then Gidley, who was holding a Tecate, announced he was off to enjoy his Mexican beer “before we build the wall and you can’t get these anymore.” That prompted a farewell “f-ck you” from Griffin, triggering nervous laughter around our table.”It sure sounds like they had a fun time exchanging comments before Kathy Griffin took it to the levels of a unprofessionalism, acting exactly like the person who couldn’t hold a job with the Squatty Potty.Even though she claims to be a comedian, there’s still a level of professionalism that people should exude when they’re not on stage. Griffin has been unable to differentiate that and consistently confuses real life for her stage life (or lack thereof).Griffin might have some fans, but she’s constantly finding ways to lose them with her inability to act decently in public and her outrageous attempts to place herself in the spotlight.She’s in the spotlight again, but it’s not the type of spotlight a celebrity should want to be in since this doesn’t seem to be a way to gain new fans.After her generic low-brow comments, some people might jokingly question if Kathy Griffin is a man. Nowadays, you just can’t tell anymore!How do you feel about Kathy Griffin’s remarks?

See what Stone had to say:This begs the question: did President Trump really endorse DeSantis for governor or was the president just being kind?DeSantis 2014 Food Stamp Vote: Illegal Immigrant Families FirstCurrently, illegal and legal immigrant families are cashing in on American taxpayer-funded benefits. The Washington Examiner reported that American families receive $1,261 less in welfare than immigrant families.Ron DeSantis’ 2014 vote speaks volumes to those American families – he isn’t willing to stand up for them, put them first, and prohibit food stamps for illegal immigrants. The forgotten man and woman is the hard working American taxpayer who wakes up every day without asking government for anything in return. We are finally putting these Americans first again, and I promise to fight every day for them as Governor. #DeSantisforGovernor— Ron DeSantis (@RonDeSantisFL) January 29, 2018If DeSantis understood that there are well-deserving Americans being pushed to the back of the food stamp line, he would have included them in this tweet.Despite illegal immigrants being ineligible for welfare benefits, the Washington Examiner estimated that they are receiving between $1.4 billion and $2.1 billion in food stamp benefits.The American taxpayers DeSantis is promising to fight for every day would most likely care about saving billions of dollars in taxpayer funds. Little do they know, one vote from DeSantis could have prevented this welfare disaster.America First?Ron DeSantis doesn’t have a problem talking tough about putting America First. But talk is just that, talk. In reality, DeSantis is forgetting hard working American families who deserve to be at the front of the line for benefits and welfare like food stamps.America First means putting ALL Americans first, and if Ron DeSantis were a friend of President Trump, he would also be fighting for these American families who have been forgotten by Congress.Is There A Pattern? 2016 Ron DeSantis: Trump ‘Reluctant Endorser’Even beyond his questionable 2014 vote, Ron DeSantis’ embrace of President Donald Trump and his message of conservative, America First solutions is a relatively new phenomenon.As late as July 2016, DeSantis was ranked by Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight political blog as a ‘Reluctant Endorser’ of President Trump. He was never on board with him until he conveniently began supporting the then-GOP Presidential Nominee Trump.While DeSantis is trying to be a Trump copycat, vowing to clean up Tallahassee Swamp in 2018, the Florida 6th District Congressman continues to dodge reporters while refusing to defend Trump’s ability to do his job.Is there a pattern of questionable decisions and weak Trump support? You be the judge.

CuomoThe Governor also unveiled a plan to create a tenant-led oversight council to oversee how funding is spent and how repairs are being conducted at NYCHA. As tenants are closest to the problem, they are in the best position to advance and oversee solutions to the crisis plaguing NYCHA. The council would include NYCHA's tenant board members and members of the Citywide Council of Presidents, but would serve as an independent oversight body. The tenant-led oversight council would be made up of resident leaders, who would work with advocacy organizations, elected officials, and faith and union leaders. The creation of the tenant-led oversight council would be negotiated in the FY 2018-19 State Budget. In addition to hazardous health conditions, many NYCHA tenants have been left without heat or hot water throughout the cold winter months. Despite the $300 million in state funding dedicated to NYCHA—the largest allocation of state funds to public housing—city officials previously determined that it will take up to four years to replace the failing boilers.

JENKINS: OPIOID CRISIS FUNDING SHOULD BE BASED ON NEEDMarch 20, 2018Press ReleasePushing for passage of his legislation, the Federal Opioid Response Fairness ActWASHINGTON – U.S. Representative Evan Jenkins (R-W.Va.) is continuing to push for passage of his legislation to ensure federal opioid epidemic funding goes to the states most affected, like West Virginia.The federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration announced on Monday that West Virginia will be receiving $330,000 in additional funding, as our state has the highest overdose death rate in the nation.This supplemental funding was needed because the formula for funding under the 21st Century Cures Act sent large amounts of funding to populous states, while states most impacted saw smaller amounts and had unmet needs.“I appreciate and welcome this additional funding to help our state combat the drug crisis. Federal agencies must prioritize aid to the states struggling the most, and West Virginia must be at the very top of the list. President Trump unveiled his opioid response plan this week, and it is time for Congress to pass my legislation to make sure that West Virginia and other states hardest hit by the drug crisis get the resources they need to truly make an impact in combating this epidemic. We must to everything possible to help people in need find recovery and stop the flood of opioids and other drugs into our communities,” Rep. Jenkins said.The 21st Century Cures Act, bipartisan legislation signed into law in 2016, included $1 billion in funding to address the drug crisis. In distributing these funds, the U.S. Health and Human Services Department and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration relied on a funding formula that benefited states with larger populations.The Federal Opioid Response Fairness Act, introduced by Jenkins and Rep. Annie Kuster (D-N.H.), would make clear that per capita overdose deaths should be a part of the formula used to distribute 21st Century Cures Act funding. The introduction of this bill followed an announcement by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department and SAMHSA that there would be no change in the funding formula for the distribution of opioid State Targeted Response grants.Issues:

Andrew M. Cuomo need an overhaul, which she said will become especially evident this summer during the corruption trial into the awarding of the Buffalo Billion and other upstate projects.“I think it’s going to be incredibly damaging"" for Cuomo, Nixon said in an interview with The Buffalo News about the political impact of the pay-to-play trial of several Buffalo and Syracuse executives and the recent conviction of a former trusted adviser of Cuomo.“In the corruption Olympics that is Albany, I think Andrew Cuomo is winning himself some gold medals,"" said the actress and political activist who on Monday announced her Democratic primary run against Cuomo .In a 16-minute interview, her first with a daily news outlet since her campaign started, Nixon kept up her barrage of assaults on Cuomo and sought to lay out a path for her candidacy.Though focused in the early days on New York City, Nixon said she expects to begin an upstate campaign either next week or the following week.Nixon, 51, best known as one of the stars of the ""Sex and the City"" television series and movies, is making her first run for elected office. She said one of the reasons she is running is “because of Andrew Cuomo’s enormous tax breaks” that she said have benefited wealthy people and corporations.Asked for her view of a major tax break Cuomo has championed for the film and television industry, Nixon said she is studying the issue. But, she quickly added, “I don’t think there’s any real truth that that enormous expenditure of money is making a significant enough different in production to justify it.’’ She added that the more than $420 million annual tax break the industry receives “doesn’t merit the investment” the state is giving in tax credits. She said the beneficiaries are predominately large entertainment companies.Nixon, who has been involved in public school funding activism for 16 years, slammed Cuomo for not providing enough state aid to the Buffalo city schools. She estimated Buffalo schools would be owed more than $100 million in aid from the state, had Albany followed the decision that came out of a landmark school funding lawsuit won by the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, a group Nixon got involved with when her oldest teenager began as a kindergarten student in a New York City public school.Actress and activist Cynthia Nixon launches run against CuomoBut Nixon saved much of her attacks on Cuomo over the component of the Buffalo Billion program that is going to be front and center in a federal courtroom later this summer. “If you look at (Cuomo’s) attempt at economic development, there’s just been enormous giveaways with not a lot to show for it. Buffalo Billion is a prime example of the intersection of corruption and pay to play, giving state business to his donors without a lot of oversight, without a lot of strings attached,"" Nixon said.“The thing that’s so awful about the Buffalo Billion is the corruption, of course … but also how much money is being spent with so little accountability. The corruption is one thing, but these are just a bad investment of taxpayer dollars,"" she said.Nixon added that “it was good that jobs were created” in the broader Buffalo Billion program, but she questioned the way in which economic development dollars are dedicated by the Cuomo administration and said more state money needs to be spent on crumbling infrastructure needs. “We need an overall, real investment in our infrastructure,"" she said.The looming Buffalo Billion trial in June is partly over alleged pay-to-play bribery allegations involving the state’s more than $750 million contract to build the solar manufacturing plant at Buffalo’s RiverBend. Cuomo has not been accused of any criminal wrongdoing by federal prosecutors.The Buffalo News interview Thursday was the first Nixon gave to a daily or upstate media outlet. Earlier this week, she did an interview with the Amsterdam News, a weekly in Manhattan that is one of the oldest African American publications in the nation.Nixon said her campaign will not take any corporate donations. Her campaign said in the last four days it has received 2,214 contributions from backers giving her $200 or less. “In one day of fundraising I received more small donor (contributions) than Andrew Cuomo received in seven years,"" Nixon said.Asked why that mattered, she said: “Andrew Cuomo has a $31 million war chest … but it’s overwhelmingly from millionaires, billionaires and corporations (and) a lot of that is people looking for influence in Albany who want to do business in the state, who want political appointments.""In Manhattan this morning, Cuomo was asked by Zack Fink, a NY1 reporter, about the number of small individual donations going to Nixon.“I’m going back to Albany to work on the budget and I’ll answer your little questions later,’’ Cuomo told Fink. (Cuomo later told NY1 that his campaign would be targeting smaller donors in the future.)Nixon began her campaign a week after Joseph Percoco, a longtime confidante to Cuomo, was convicted of using his top post in the governor’s administration to help companies that steered more than $300,000 in bribes to Percoco.But she said the Percoco case “didn’t enter into the thinking” for her final decision to run, saying she was influenced by everything from the election of President Trump to what she sees as a declining state of New York.An unabashed liberal, Nixon was asked if she had any centrist policy or fiscal views. “I consider myself right in line with what New Yorkers feel. I don’t feel we have a centrist state. I feel we have a real progressive state,"" said Nixon.“Andrew Cuomo is not anyone I’d describe as a centrist. I’d describe him as an opportunist,"" added Nixon, who has spent her first four days attacking Cuomo.Nixon has kept her fledgling campaign in New York City so far. In 2014, Cuomo was also challenged from the left by Zephyr Teachout, an unknown law professor who ended up with 34 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary. In that race, 107,000 of the 192,000 votes Teachout received came from outside New York City, and she won a number of upstate counties over Cuomo.Asked about plans to spread her campaign beyond the boroughs of New York, Nixon said her campaign will announce an upstate swing shortly. She then volunteered that two of her best friends – she did not name them – are from Buffalo, that she attended a wedding in Buffalo and recalls having a great vegan meal at Amy’s Place in Buffalo .With no government experience and having never run for office before, Nixon is seeking a job whose occupant must oversee a $170 billion budget and more than 100,000 state employees, as well as deal with diverse issues in a diverse state.“I think certainly I’m not a political insider. But we’re looking at a moment in history where New York State government is so mired down in corruption and corporate influence that that’s trumping … everything else that’s going on in New York State,"" she said.There are no comments - be the first to commentRecommended for you"

Bruce Rauner declared victory over Jeanne Ives in the Illinois Republican primary for governor. Rauner, despite spending millions, faced a much stronger than expected challenge from the arch-conservative West Point graduate Ives. The governor declared victory around 10:15 p.m. in a speech to supporters. “I am honored and humbled by this victory,” he said. Early polls had Rauner with a big lead, but the race tightened considerably into a single digit race in the final days. The Rauner campaign was pressing a get-out-the-vote campaign heading into the final hours. Ives represented Wheaton in the statehouse but decided to enter the race after Rauner flip-flopped, signing a bill providing public funding of abortions for the poor. Rauner has already spent $12 million and is sitting on another $55 million in cash. The bulk of his resources come from his fortune earned as a hedge fund investor. Rauner has stated he will spend whatever it takes to compete in both the primary and the general election. Ives’ campaign was largely funded by conservative packaging mogul Dick Uihlein, who has donated $2.5 million.

Easing rules for those institutions, Warren argues, is risking another financial crash.“It’s outrageous,” Warren wrote in one fund-raising email that accused her colleagues of voting “against working Americans” and in favor of what she calls the “Bank Lobbyist Act.” She’s delivered five speeches against the bill on the Senate floor, convened a rare Capitol Hill press conference, and made the rounds on the Sunday news shows to rally opposition on the left. With backing from 17 Democrats, the measure could pass the Senate later this week.By her own acknowledgement , Warren has irked Democrats by attacking the bipartisan bill so aggressively. They’ve accused her of misstating its provisions and exaggerating its likely impact, raising what they say is unnecessary alarm about another financial crisis exacerbated by deregulation. Politically, Warren is burnishing her reputation as a progressive fighter ahead of a possible 2020 run for president, but by going after Democrats, she could undermine the party’s bid to recapture the Senate majority, since backers of the bill include some of the most vulnerable Democrats up for reelection in 2018.Chief among Warren’s Democratic critics is Heitkamp of North Dakota, a co-sponsor of the deregulatory bill who is in a tight reelection battle this year. Heitkamp and Warren sit next to each other on the Senate Banking Committee, but their perspectives on the bill could not be further apart. In a phone interview on Monday, Heitkamp told me Warren was misleading the public about the bill and that the debate exposed a fundamental divide between Democrats who represent rural states and those who hail from more urban and suburban areas. “She doesn’t live where I live,” Heitkamp said of her Massachusetts colleague.“I think it’s really unfortunate that she has misled people regarding this bill,” she continued. “Some of the things that she has said are incorrect, and I cannot let the legislative history of this legislation be what Elizabeth Warren says it is.”For years, Heitkamp said, Democrats have watched as smaller banks and lenders in their states have been eaten up by larger institutions, due in part to the added burden of regulations created by Dodd-Frank. “Fundamentally, what I would say is Dodd-Frank was designed to prevent too-big-to-fail,” she said. “And it became too small to succeed. And you’ve seen since Dodd-Frank the bigger institutions have gotten bigger and the smaller institutions have consolidated.”Other Democratic backers of the Senate bill, written by GOP Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo of Idaho, have made largely the same argument, and they include the party’s 2016 vice presidential nominee, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia.Warren has said that if the bill were solely about helping small, community banks, she’d be all for it. But the new proposal goes beyond that. The Dodd-Frank law defined “too-big-to-fail” banks as those with more than $50 billion in assets, subjecting them to annual stress tests and other regulations that smaller banks were exempt from. Even one of the bill’s namesake authors, former Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, has said that threshold was too low and could safely be raised to $100 billion or $125 billion. But the Senate bill raises that line all the way to $250 billion, exempting all but the nation’s 12 largest institutions from the stiffest regulations and mandatory stress tests.“Give me a break,” Warren said in a recent floor speech. “This bill is about goosing the bottom line and executive bonuses at the banks that make up the top one half of 1 percent of banks in this country by size. The very tippy-top. Your local community bank doesn’t have a quarter of a trillion dollars in assets.”Heitkamp said Warren was exaggerating the danger posed by the changes and pointed out that banks with assets below $250 billion would still be subject to stress tests if regulators determined they posed a risk to the system. She also rebutted the argument that the Senate bill, through a change to reporting requirements in the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), would make it easier for small lenders to discriminate based on race or other factors. The bill exempts mortgage lenders who make fewer than 500 loans a year from the reporting requirements. “We are only affecting less than 4 percent of the total data collected with this change,” Heitkamp told me. “So there’s this, ‘Oh, the sky is falling,’ but when you actually look at who is going to be affected, and the kind of data that will be collected, 95.5 percent of all the data that could be collected under HMDA will continue to be collected.”Heitkamp wouldn’t speculate on Warren’s political motives for picking an intra-party fight over the banking bill, saying they just see things “completely differently.” But when I asked her if having the liberal Warren as a foe might be helpful as she runs for a second term in a deep-red state, Heitkamp replied: “I think people in North Dakota don’t care what Elizabeth Warren thinks.”Below is a condensed and edited transcript of our conversation.Russell Berman: Why is this bill worthy of support for a Democrat and is not the cave to Wall Street and bank lobbyists that critics on the left say that it is?Senator Heidi Heitkamp: First off, this is something we’ve been working on for five years, and it started out in reaction to the small community banks and the credit unions saying, ‘Look, we’re getting out of mortgage lending. We don’t think that we can serve our communities because the compliance burdens are way too high. The risk is way too high for these basically family-owned corporations. And we don’t have the staff to basically do mortgage lending.’So for five years we’ve been working on a fix. Fundamentally, what I would say is Dodd-Frank was designed to prevent too-big-to-fail. And it became too small to succeed. And you’ve seen since Dodd-Frank the bigger institutions have gotten bigger and the smaller institutions have consolidated. So this is to respond to that economic reality out there and also to make sure that we have thriving lending institutions like credit unions, like small community banks in rural areas.Berman: Obviously the biggest, loudest critic has been Elizabeth Warren. You sit right next to her on the Banking Committee, and she has been, in contrast with some others, just as hard on you and your fellow Democrats as on the Republicans for supporting this. So let me just get you to respond to a couple specific things that she has said.From a fundraising email:It’s outrageous. Roughly a third of all Democratic Senators voted with Wall Street yesterday and against working Americans in Massachusetts and across the country.From Meet the Press on Sunday:I don’t understand how anybody in the United States Senate votes for a bill that’s going to increase the likelihood of taxpayer bailouts. This bill also makes it easier for banks that discriminate against people on home mortgages, charges more for African Americans or Latinos than they do for whites. Makes it easier to cheat people who buy mobile homes …How do you respond to that?Heitkamp: I’d respond by saying she doesn’t live where I live. I live in rural America, and she could say this about big banks or Wall Street bailouts—that’s certainly not what my community banks believe in North Dakota. I think it’s really unfortunate that she has misled people regarding this bill. I intend to go to the floor before this bill goes to final passage and correct the record. Some of the things that she has said are incorrect, and I cannot let the legislative history of this legislation be what Elizabeth Warren says it is. So we are doing everything we can to correct the record.There are no provisions in here that substantially affect or advantage the big Wall Street bankers. That is a misstatement and highly unfortunate. As it relates to discrimination, I can tell you that less than 4 percent of all the data that’s collected is going to be affected by this amendment to HMDA. What we’re basically looking at is reducing the compliance burdens for small institutions that make less than 500 loans a year. So there is an exaggeration to the statement about discrimination, there’s been exaggeration to the statement about this being about a Wall Street bailout. The reality is this is a bill that advantages and makes more competitive our Main Street lending institutions.Berman: Given all the talk about Elizabeth Warren and 2020, do you see her critique of this bill as being on the level, or do you see her as trying to rev up opposition on the left to bolster her credentials ahead of a possible presidential run?Heitkamp: Unlike some people here, I never ascribe motivation to what people say. I’m assuming that Elizabeth feels strongly about this. She did during the discussions about this when we drafted the Democratic bill in the last Congress. This is no surprise to me that she’s in opposition. She and I see it differently. In fact, completely differently, and I think that’s a result of the perspective that I have coming from a rural community.Berman: Do you think her coming out against this will actually help you sell this bill to people in North Dakota given how different North Dakota is from Massachusetts?Heitkamp: I think people in North Dakota don’t care what Elizabeth Warren thinks.Berman: You said she was involved in some of the discussions. Have you talked to her in recent days? Did she give you any heads up about her plans to rally so aggressively against this?Heitkamp: I think we all at the end of the day as United States senators have to make decisions that are best for our constituency and we have to call it the way we see it. Obviously Elizabeth and I do not see this bill at all the same way. I intend to correct the record. I think she has misstated the facts of this legislation, and I intend to make sure the record is corrected before we go to final passage.Berman: One of the big criticisms of the bill, from Barney Frank and others, is that if this was solely about helping small and community banks, they’d be on board, but that it goes far beyond that and that it’s ridiculous to call banks with holdings of up to $250 billion, which get relief from this bill, as small. How do you respond to that?Heitkamp: Nothing in this bill in any way weakens the prohibition about making shaky loans, loans to people with weak credit and packaging them within a security. I think we have to be clear in what former Congressman Frank has said about this bill. The first thing I would like to clarify is we moved an assumption: The assumption was any bank over $50 billion could be systemically risky, right? So now we have to pick a number. The number that we picked that would create the presumption was $250 billion. But remember this: There’s a couple of really important caveats.First off, it does not take away from the fact that those institutions will continue to be stress-tested. They’re going to be regulated so that they aren’t taking unnecessary risks. Those institutions still have to comply with qualified mortgage standards. The only QM changes that we made were for institutions under $10 billion and then only if they kept those mortgages in portfolio. So all the qualifying mortgage standards that Dodd-Frank adopted continue to be part of the overall regulatory scheme. And we did not change capital or liquidity requirements for those institutions. And so that one change simply changes an assumption with allowing the regulators to continue to regulate them if in fact they find that those institutions present systemic risk.Now if I can just clarify one point. There’s a whole lot of attention to what happened in 2008. Bad mortgages were the foundation, but what really happened in 2008 was securitizing those mortgages and putting the entire system at risk. The only thing that we changed as it relates to mortgage lending is we said you can make these mortgages without meeting qualified mortgage standards, but only if you don’t put those mortgages into the secondary market and you keep them in portfolio. So to say that we are creating the same conditions that created the 2008 meltdown is a gross exaggeration.Berman: On the threshold issue, why go up that high at all, to $250 billion in assets? It seems to allow critics of the bill to say you’re not talking about small and community banks anymore if you’re going up to a quarter of a trillion dollars as opposed to, say, $100 billion, which is what Barney Frank suggested.Heitkamp: I think we’ve been persuaded that we shouldn’t always just look at the number. What we need to do is look at what the bank does, and a lot of institutions at that level, less than $250 billion in assets, they’re not sophisticated and they’re not complex. A lot of them really don’t do anything more sophisticated than what a community bank does, except they do it in greater amounts.Berman: One change Warren suggested was just taking out the provision amending the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. Why not do that?Heitkamp: Because the paperwork that’s required for the HMDA standards is overwhelming. It is absolutely one of those things that my small-town banks and my lenders say is absolutely overwhelming. It’s really important to point out here that it does not weaken any of the traditional HMDA standards or data that helps regulators combat lending discrimination. It does change for those institutions that make less than 500 loans the step-up in data collection that was in Dodd-Frank. But think about this. We are only affecting less than 4 percent of the total data collected with this change. So there’s this, ‘Oh, the sky is falling,’ but when you actually look at who is going to be affected, and the kind of data that will be collected, 95.5 percent of all the data that could be collected under HMDA will continue to be collected.Berman: The senators in the Democratic Party who support this largely represent rural communities. So how much of this debate comes down to an urban or suburban-rural divide, and do you think your colleagues who oppose this have an appreciation for the challenges like the ones in North Dakota face?Heitkamp: The short answer is no, they don’t. It’s interesting. We were talking to a reporter recently who was saying, ‘Well, why don’t they just hire another compliance officer?’ That kind of argument I just shake my head at. These are institutions that may employ 12 people total. And to ask them to hire one more compliance officer to no good end? They are not, by putting that compliance officer in that institution, guaranteeing security and soundness of the overall financial system in this country. All they’re doing is adding a burden to that institution and making their conditions in providing capital to people in rural communities less than optimal.About the AuthorRussell Berman is a staff writer at The Atlantic, where he covers politics.Loading ...

Tammy Baldwin ""claims to support a 'Buy America' philosophy, but her actions speak louder than her empty words."""	false	['Economy', 'Trade']	http://dailycaller.com/	http://dailycaller.com/2018/01/25/hey-look-senator-tammy-baldwin-is-back-in-wisconsin-must-be-an-election-year/	2018/03/12	 TOPNow that it’s 2018, an election year, I would like to welcome Senator Tammy Baldwin back to Wisconsin.For the last 25 years, whenever an election approaches, Sen. Baldwin seems to begrudgingly leave her elitist donors on the coasts for Wisconsin. Almost overnight, after months and months away from her constituents, she tries to trick us into believing she’s spent the past two decades in Washington representing us, as opposed to representing donors in California and New York who try to impose their agenda on the Badger State.Senator Baldwin has made this deceitful campaign of tricking the people of our great state her focus. Wisconsin deserves better, and voters won’t fall for it again.This time around, the recently passed Republican tax bill provides voters with the perfect opportunity to hold Senator Baldwin and her Democrat colleagues accountable for their unwillingness to do what is right for the millions of Wisconsinites and Americans they claim to represent.Senator Baldwin and her colleagues in Washington were given a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reform an outdated, broken and costly tax code that discouraged job growth and investment in America, failed to reward the middle-class or boost economic growth, and lined the pockets of Washington D.C. special interests, all at the expense of hard-working citizens and small businesses. She claims to support a “Buy America” philosophy, but her actions speak louder than her empty words.Instead of doing the right thing and voting for legislation that would have improved the lives of so many whose voices she is supposed to represent in Washington, Senator Baldwin did what she has done so often during her almost 30 years in public office: She played politics with the well-being and wallets of Wisconsin citizens. It was a desperate attempt to score cheap political points — and not so cheap campaign contributions — from her radical, far left supporters in faraway states.Here in Wisconsin, it is estimated that a family of four will receive more than $2,500 per year in tax relief from the bill Senator Baldwin voted against. That extra $200 plus per month might not mean much to the liberal millionaires from New York and California whom she relies on to bankroll her campaigns, but it could change the lives of folks from Beloit to Superior, and everywhere in between.Given the senator’s long history of only supporting policies championed by the far left and the coastal elite, it is no surprise she voted against a tax bill that will help so many Wisconsinites. In fact, she proudly joined large numbers from California, New York and New Jersey’s Congressional delegations in voting against more money in the pockets of Wisconsin families.I have no doubt that Ms. Baldwin will soon be back to embark on one of her semiannual election-year tours, masquerading as “Wisconsin’s” senator. As she travels our great state, she ought to take the time and ask voters what they think about the extra income they’re receiving as a result of the tax bill. Senator Baldwin won’t like the answer, but least she’ll know a little bit more about the people of Wisconsin.Wisconsin U.S. Senate candidate Leah Vukmir is a nurse, military mom and conservative with a proven record of reform. She currently serves as a state senator from Brookfield, Wisconsin.The views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of The Daily Caller.

Aired 7:30-8a ETAired March 7, 2018 - 07:30 ETTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.[07:30:00] ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: Yes, I mean --JIM SCHULTZ, FORMER LAWYER, TRUMP WHITE HOUSE: And so this isn't what I feel. I'm discussing what the president thinks. It's strikingly different from what --CAMEROTA: All right, so where can we get it, Laura?SCHULTZ: -- happened in prior cases.CAMEROTA: Do you agree with that assessment?LAURA COATES, CNN LEGAL ANAYLST, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR, SIRIUS XM HOST, ""THE LAURA COATES SHOW"": Well Jim, I don't think she was careful enough because she's hanging all of her hat on the words ""according to the president."" And although that's a way to sanitize the prior statement that came before the ""according to the president"" attempt at saving the statement.The Hatch Act very clearly states that look, just because you're a federal employee doesn't mean you can't have private views on politics. It just means that in your official capacity when you stood on the White House lawn as opposed to in front of your own home talking about yourself as just Kellyanne Conway, then you go into territory that violates the Hatch Act.And remember, the benefit of the doubt you want to extend cannot really extend to Kellyanne Conway who just a few months before had already been schooled on the Hatch Act with respect to the Ivanka Trump clothing line. You've got Scovino, you've got everyone else who's on the same platform as her talking about this and have been trained --CAMEROTA: Yes.COATES: -- on the issue. It's a problem and violation is there.CAMEROTA: OK. Jim Schultz, Laura Coates, thank you --COATES: It's what you're punished for, Alisyn.CAMEROTA: It should because it's up to the president to punish her, so that's why you're saying she should --SCHULTZ: Right, and it did --COATES: That's what --SCHULTZ: It didn't -- there was no one punished in the Obama administration --COATES: I mean, exactly -- it's up to the president.CAMEROTA: All right.SCHULTZ: -- for much more grave violations.CAMEROTA: Jim Schultz, Laura Coates, thank you very much -- Chris.CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: All right. So the midterm election season is officially underway with Texas kicking things off. There was big turnout there. There are big implications.Senator Ted Cruz coasted in the state's primary but he's already mocking his challenger in a new ad. Senator Cruz joins us to take on the news of day, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[07:35:34] CUOMO: Senator Ted Cruz easily winning the Republican primary in Texas. He got well over 80 percent of the vote. Cruz will now be challenged by Democrat Beto O'Rourke.The Cruz campaign already getting into the swing of things. They have a new ad mocking O'Rourke for his name. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CRUZ AD (SUNG TO TUNE OF ""IF YOU'RE GONNA RUN IN TEXAS""): I remember reading stories liberal Robert wanted to fit in, so he changed his name to Beto and hid it with a grin. Beto wants those open borders and he wants to take our guns. Not a chance on earth he'll get a vote from millions of Texans.(END VIDEO CLIP)CUOMO: The senator could sing that way.Joining us now is Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Senator, thank you for taking the invitation. Congratulations on the win.SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX), MEMBER, ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE, JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Well, thank you Chris. Good to be with you this morning.CUOMO: So what do you make of the turnout numbers? There was a boost for Republicans as well that should be added, but you've been talking about Democrats coming out. You see it as a signal.CRUZ: Well listen, there's no doubt the extreme left right now is energized. They are angry, they hate the president and we're seeing that -- we're seeing that in the fundraising numbers for Democrats all across the country. We're seeing that in turnout.That being said, in Texas last night, we had a strong turnout for conservatives. It was really encouraging. The early vote numbers were quite good for Democrats.But at the end of the night I was very gratified to win over 85 percent of the vote -- to win 1.3 million votes which is more than double what my Democratic opponent got. That doesn't quite fit the narrative that a lot of folks in the media want to tell because every two years, every four years Texas is always fixing to turn blue but the nice value of it is in Texas, as least, there are a lot more conservatives than there are liberals.CUOMO: So you're subscribing to the idea of a blue wave that is hitting a red wall.So, O'Rourke will be your challenger but you're already going after him. Why, if don't take it seriously and you had twice the votes? Why go after him so early?CRUZ: Let's be clear. We absolutely take the race seriously. We take nothing for granted. I'm going to do everything I can to continue to earn the support of every one of 28 million Texans across the state.And I will say for the voters that there's a clear contrast. A clear contrast on substance, and policy, and ideas.Congressman O'Rourke is running hard to the left. He is embracing positions like open borders, like amnesty. He's embracing positions like aggressive advocacy of gun control and undermining our Second Amendment.Now those are wonderfully popular positions if you're running for the Senate in New York or Massachusetts or California, but this is Texas and those are not the views of the vast majority of Texans and I think that's why you saw the overwhelming election results last night.CUOMO: Are you concerned about your poll numbers? I'm looking at one here from YouGov from February first to 12th. It has you about 40-40 approve/disapprove -- 10 points higher with strong disapprove than strong approve.Are you worried about those numbers?CRUZ: You know, there are always these online polls that end up oversampling a bunch of Democrats. And listen, we live in a polarized world right now so it's not surprising if you ask a bunch of Democrats their approval of Republicans, but the numbers are pretty low.You know, I will say though that for anyone that follows Texas politics we all remember back four years ago when Wendy Davis was the next big thing in the national media. She had filibustered in support of late-term abortion.CUOMO: Yes. CRUZ: The national media loved her.In primary day she lost in the Democratic primary -- it was either 22 or 23 counties all in south Texas -- against an unknown Democrat with no money at all and that really presaged the fact that her views were out of step even for Democratic primary voters in Texas.The reason I draw that analogy is last night we saw something very similar. Congressman O'Rourke won barely 60 percent of the Democratic primary against two opponents with no-name idea and no money. And just like Wendy Davis, he lost south Texas. He lost the valley badly and I think that underscores that most Texans look at a candidate who brags about his F-rating from the NRA.And just a couple of weeks ago Congressman O'Rourke tweeted out to the world how proud he was that he has an F rating from the NRA. Not a D, not a D-minus, not a C, an F.And I happily retweeted. I said look, we've got a choice and if you're running to succeed Nancy Pelosi in San Francisco that's a great thing to be tweeted out. Those are the values of that district's voters.[07:40:09] But in Texas those are not the values of Texas and that's why at the end of day I think we're going to see a very strong election day in November.CUOMO: So we'll get into a couple of these policy issues and where you are because you've got a little bit of a challenge, too. If you still have your eyes on the prize of a national race you're going to have to be careful about your positions. That may suit Texas but, as you say, you'd have to win points at some point in California and New York as well.But the ad -- you go after Beto for his name. Beto is obviously a nickname. Why?One, you didn't like that dirty pool when you were running for president and the president called you ""Lyin' Ted."" You didn't like that kind of tactic.And you know, look, your name is Rafael, you know. You go by Ted -- your middle name is Edward. That's an anglicized version of it. He went the other way and has a more ethnic version of his name.Why go after it? You're both doing the same thing.CRUZ: But listen, you're absolutely right. My name is Rafael Edward Cruz.I am the son of my father, Rafael Cruz, an immigrant from Cuba who came to Texas with nothing. He had $100 in his underwear, couldn't speak English. Washed dishes making 50 cents an hour.And my dad's journey of an immigrant coming to Texas seeking freedom, that's the American story. That's who we are. You know, in terms of the jingle some of it is just have a sense of humor. You actually missed the central -- the title of the song which is ""If You're Going to Run in Texas You Can't Run As A Liberal Man.: And the whole point of the song is --CUOMO: That's a catchy title by the way, Senator.CRUZ: Yes, we had -- we had some fun with it because listen, Texans -- there is a common-sense conservative practicality about Texans.Texans -- we understand low taxes, low regulations produce jobs. There's a reason 1,000 people a day move to Texas because we have jobs everywhere.Texans don't want to see a return to the high tax, high regulation, high spending days of Barack Obama and the economic stagnation that came with it. Texans value jobs and low taxes and freedom.We see Obamacare doing devastation. Congressman O'Rourke supports high taxes, high regulation, Obamacare.And fundamentally, Texans value our freedoms. Our constitutional liberty, our religious liberty, our Second Amendment.CUOMO: Right.CRUZ: Those are values that --CUOMO: I am never going to talk law with you. I remember Professor Dershowitz telling me that you were the best mind he ever taught.But even you know that some of the things that you won't give a position on right now, like bump stocks, like the NICS fix which is, of course in part, advanced by your fellow senator there in Texas.Why not give positions on those? Do you think you can argue in favor of bump stocks? Do you think you can argue in favor of not having background checks cover all sales?CRUZ: Chris, what I think is that we need to be serious about stopping mass murders and stopping crime. I've spent a lot of my professional career working in law enforcement, working to keep behind bars murderers and rapists and violent criminals.And we need to talk about what works and what doesn't because every time you have a mass murder you see a lot of Democratic politicians posturing and advocating all sort of gun control and inevitably, their gun control focuses on law- abiding citizens. And there are many problems with that but the most important one is it doesn't work. It's singularly ineffective.CUOMO: How do you know it doesn't work?CRUZ: Because if you look at the jurisdictions with the toughest gun control laws -- cities like Chicago, cities like Washington, D.C. -- they almost invariably have the highest crime rates, the highest murder rates.CUOMO: No, that's not true.CRUZ: Yes it --CUOMO: The Giffords Center analysis --CRUZ: Chris, yes it is. The facts are --CUOMO: -- said that we a few exceptions states that have the strictest gun control measures have the lowest rates of guns death.And just a recent example, look at Connecticut. Look how they brought their numbers down.CRUZ: Well, except your advocating from a -- you're citing sources from a partisan source that is not reliable.Gun control -- when you --CUOMO: Where are you citing them from, the NRA? Where are you getting them from?CRUZ: Sir, when you disarm law-abiding citizens the consequence is the criminals have the gun.Now listen, let me finish. I said we need to be effective so there is a lot we can do to be effective in stopping crime.Just yesterday I reintroduced legislation that I introduced in 2013. It was called Grassley-Cruz. It was in the wake of Newtown. And what it does is instead of the Democratic talking points of going after law-abiding citizens, it focuses on criminals -- on violent criminals.So one of the things Grassley-Cruz did was increase funding for school safety by $300 million. The Obama administration had cut $300 million from school safety. You know, if that had been in place that might well have meant that another armed police officer could have been in Parkland and could have stopped that killer before he murdered those teenagers.CUOMO: Well, we did -- you did have an armed guard there. But there's -- I think there's a legitimate argument that school safety is part of it.But why ignore the other part? I mean, just like covering all sales. You know, it's always -- it's always bothered me because I know how your mind works on some of these issues and if you're going to cover some sales why wouldn't you cover all sales?CRUZ: Because Chris --You know that in Texas if you talk to responsible gun owners they're not against having people check whether they buy person-to-person or at a gun show or on the Internet. They're for safety. Why not be for that? [07:45:06] CRUZ: Not only am I for safety, the background check system needs to be a lot more effective. If you look at Grassley-Cruz and what it did to the background check system, it strengthened it. Number one, it directed the -- it incentivized the states to report convictions to the -- to the background check system.CUOMO: Right.CRUZ: Many states don't do that.Number two, it directed the attorney general to audit federal agencies --CUOMO: Right.CRUZ: -- to make sure they're reporting convictions -- the ones that --CUOMO: But why not cover all sales?CRUZ: Sir, why does that matter because in Texas in Sutherland Spring we had just a few months ago the worst --CUOMO: Church.CRUZ: -- church shooting in the history of the country. I was in that sanctuary the day after that shooting.CUOMO: True.CRUZ: I was with the victims of that crime.The shooter in Sutherland Springs --CUOMO: Right.CRUZ: It was already illegal for him to purchase a firearm under federal law, two reasons over. Number one, he had a felony conviction.CUOMO: Right.CRUZ: Number two, he had a domestic violence conviction.CUOMO: Right.CRUZ: Why was he able to buy a firearm? Because the Air Force, under President Obama --CUOMO: Didn't report.CRUZ: -- never reported the conviction.CUOMO: Yes.CRUZ: Grassley-Cruz would have fixed that. And here's the more important piece. Grassley-Cruz would have also directed the Department of Justice to prosecute felons and fugitives who illegally try to buy guns. The Department of Justice hasn't been doing that.So the Sutherland Springs shooter when he went in to buy his guns, he lied on the background check.CUOMO: Right.CRUZ: He checked a box that said he wasn't a felon. That was a lie. That's another felony.CUOMO: Right.CRUZ: He checked a box that he didn't have a domestic violence conviction. That was a lie and a felony too.CUOMO: All true, all fixable.CRUZ: Grassley-Cruz would have prosecuted him and put him in prison which meant he would have been in the penitentiary and not murdering people in this sanctuary.CUOMO: Understood. I'm just saying that the bill on the table is the Cornyn bill and ""Fix NICS."" You're going to have to figure out how to make peace with that or be against it. When you do, come back on the show --CRUZ: Chris, can I ask one question?CUOMO: -- because I've got to -- I've got to get cut for time.CRUZ: Let me ask one --CUOMO: All right, ask for it, Senator.CRUZ: Let me ask one quick question.CUOMO: Please.CRUZ: Grassley-Cruz got 52 senators supporting it -- nine Democrats. The most bipartisan support of any comprehensive bill. But, Harry Reid and the Democrats filibustered Grassley-Cruz even though it targeted criminals and could have perhaps prevented these attacks.CUOMO: Right.CRUZ: And what I would ask is the next time you have a Democrat on --CUOMO: Yes.CRUZ: Have you ever asked a Democrat why did you filibuster Grassley- Cruz which targeted violent criminals and sought to put felons who try to illegally buy firearms in jail? I think that's cynical in politics. We ought to be focusing on substance and actually getting the job done. CUOMO: We will do exactly that and please, come back on the show to make the case to the American people when you take a position on these bills.Thank you for being with us, Senator. Congratulations on your win.CRUZ: Thank you, Chris.CUOMO: Alisyn --CAMEROTA: OK. So we just heard from Sen. Ted Cruz. Now let's hear from his opponent. We have Beto O'Rourke with us live, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[07:50:38] CAMEROTA: Democratic Congressman Beto O'Rourke winning the Democratic nomination to challenge Sen. Ted Cruz in November. Will O'Rourke become the first Democrat to win a U.S. Senate seat in Texas in 30 years?Joining us now is Congressman Beto O'Rourke. Good morning, Congressman.REP. BETO O'ROURKE (D-TX), TEXAS SENATE CANDIDATE, MEMBER, ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE: Good morning.CAMEROTA: OK, so the good news for you is that last night you saw the highest Democratic turnout in Texas since 2002. The bad news, I guess, is that your future opponent Sen. Ted Cruz got twice as many votes in his primary -- in his GOP primary as you did.So what does that tell you?O'ROURKE: I was really encouraged by the turnout that we saw amongst everyone -- everyone in Texas, Democrats and Republicans alike. That can only be a good thing for our state which has historically been not a red state but a state that just doesn't vote, and so people are getting off the sidelines and into the game.And our strategy of going to each one of the 254 counties, listening to people and making their concerns and their fight our concerns and our fight is going to work. And the good thing is we have eight months to continue to work with and listen to the Texans that we want to serve and represent in the United States Senate.And we're doing it without a dime of PAC money, corporate cash, special interest contributions. It's just people -- the people of Texas we want to serve and represent.CAMEROTA: We just heard from your future opponent Sen. Ted Cruz who basically says that -- he pointed out that you lost south Texas and said that he thinks it's impossible for you to win in Texas because of your NRA rating. He said you have an F rating with the NRA and let's face it, I mean, Texas is a gun culture.How can you win in Texas with that rating? O'ROURKE: You know, I think a lot of Texans are wondering who it is that Ted Cruz represents in the Senate. He's taken hundreds of thousands of dollars from the NRA. So as people are begging us to take action and dispense with the prayers and thoughts and make sure that we have comprehensive universal background checks and save the lives of our fellow Americans and fellow Texans.As they ask to ensure that we don't allow people to buy weapons of war designed for the sole purpose of killing people as effectively and efficiently. They're going to see in us a campaign that is responsive to only the people that I want to serve and represent of Texas.And you're right, we have a great tradition and culture of gun ownership and gun safety for hunting, for sport, for self-defense, and I think that can allow Texas to take the lead on a really tough issue which the country is waiting for leadership and action on.And so, I'm just -- I'm grateful that the people of Texas are going to give us a chance to do that and I'm following their orders and taking their lead. I want to make sure that we do the right thing by Texas and by this country.CAMEROTA: But just out of curiosity, when you do go to all those counties and if you're saying that south Texas is more conservative, then what do people say about your desire to ban the AR-15? I mean, is that a bridge too far from them.And realistically, would that -- I understand that everybody wants background checks and certainly polls suggest that, but not everybody is for banning the AR-15, and do you think realistically that could cost you the election?O'ROURKE: You know, I was just in Brownwood, Texas. At a town hall a woman stood up and said born and raised on a ranch just outside of Brownwood. Born with a 22 in my hands. We use guns all the time.But I'm also the grandmother to 46 children --CAMEROTA: Wow.O'ROURKE: And I want to know that you're going to stand up to the NRA.Listen, I've got to face my kids and my conscience and do the right thing when we have the opportunity to do the right thing. We can save more lives in this country and in our state and I'm going to do everything that I can to do that, and I think Texas wants to do that.And Texas -- again, given our tradition of gun ownership and gun safety and responsibility is in a perfect place to be able to do that.CAMEROTA: OK, so your opponent Ted Cruz has put out a catchy jingle campaign ad attacking you on a couple of different things including your name. Here it is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CRUZ AD (SUNG TO TUNE OF ""IF YOU'RE GONNA RUN IN TEXAS""): I remember reading stories liberal Robert wanted to fit in, so he changed his name to Beto and hid it with a grin. Beto wants those open borders and he wants to take our guns. Not a chance on earth he'll get a vote from millions of Texans.(END VIDEO CLIP)CAMEROTA: Now, Congressman, I know you have a punk rock past. Do you plan to compose a punk rock song to counter that jingle?[07:55:05] O'ROURKE: Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to continue to meet with and work with my fellow Texans on the big issues that we want Texas to lead on. We are the defining immigrant state. We should be leading the way on immigration reform, not being the sole senator as Ted Cruz was, to turn his back on Texas in this opportunity to lead on an issue that we know better than anyone else in other part of the country.I want to make sure that Texas goes from being the least insured state in the country to leading the way to ensure that every single American can see a doctor or provider or for their medications so that they can live to their full potential, finish their education, go to work, pay taxes, create a business, hire more Americans.CAMEROTA: Yes.O'ROURKE: I want to make sure that we get our democracy back and return it to the people and get corporations, and PACs, and lobbyists, and special interests out of the halls of Congress. And running this campaign in the most grassroots fashion that we've seen in Texas. All 254 counties relying on people --CAMEROTA: Yes.O'ROURKE: -- instead of PACs and corporations.CAMEROTA: But Congressman --O'ROURKE: That's the way to do it.CAMEROTA: -- why aren't you taking my punk rock bait?O'ROURKE: Because I just don't think that's what folks in Texas want us to focus on.

The bill would end Medicare as we know it and ban successful health plans like Kaiser – forcing all Californians into a single state-run health insurance system.Said Mayor Villaraigosa:“I challenge Gavin Newsom to debate the actual details of SB562. Enough with the slogans – it’s time to show real leadership and have a serious in-depth discussion.“I’m offering him the opportunity to explain in detail how he plans to fund this new policy estimated to cost $400 billion and increase taxes by $200 billion. He should detail how he will persuade Donald Trump and a Republican Congress to grant California the necessary waivers for it to become a reality. He can explain to seniors that rely on life-saving Medicare, how SB562 will force them into a new state-run system.“I have a record of supporting universal healthcare. As Assembly Speaker, I authored the Healthy Families program that provided healthcare coverage to 750,000 uninsured Californians. We passed it because it was sound policy.“Newsom calls any attempt to demand details of his $200 billion tax increase and plan to force seniors off of Medicare as ‘defeatist.’ I call refusing to say how you will successfully persuade Californians to more than double their taxes while taking away their Medicare simply deceptive.“I’m proud to stand with medical and policy leaders including Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, the California Medical Association, the California Association of Nurse Practitioners, the California Chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians and the California Psychiatric Association in opposing SB 562.”###	
http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/08/noah-smith/has-automation-driven-job-losses-steel-industry/	"""Since 1990, production of metals in the U.S. has held roughly constant, but the number of people employed in the industry has fallen steadily."""	true	['Economy', 'Jobs']	https://www.bloomberg.com/	https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-03-07/trump-s-tariffs-on-steel-aluminum-will-do-more-harm-than-good	2018/03/08	There's a right way — and a wrong way — to help.Photographer: Ty Wright/Bloomberg“Trade wars,” President Donald Trump recently declared on Twitter, “are good, and easy to win.” But it’s questionable whether the president’s proposed tariffs -- a tax of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on imported aluminum -- will be a war or an act of friendly fire.As I recently wrote , tariffs are generally not a good way to promote domestic industry. They encourage American producers to hunker down behind the tax’s protective wall, focusing on the captive local market instead of figuring out how to prevail in the rough-and-tumble of global competition. Forcing American consumers to use the domestic-made product might eventually result in American steel and aluminum becoming bywords for low quality.There’s also the danger that making metals more expensive will hurt a lot more U.S. manufacturers than it helps. The construction industry would take the biggest hit:Where the Pain Would Be Felt the MostShare of total U.S. steel use by industrySource: Statista.comImport taxes will tend to drive already exorbitant U.S. construction costs even higher, hurting commercial development around the country.It will also harm U.S. exporters. The U.S. makes a lot of internationally tradeable products that use steel -- aircraft, autos, appliances and industrial machinery. A lot of others use aluminum. Although the majority of what they use is produced locally -- the U.S. steel industry supplied about 70 percent of the domestic market in 2017 -- a tax on imports will allow American metal producers to charge more to companies like Boeing Co., General Motors Co. and Whirlpool Corp. Higher steel and aluminum company profits will therefore come at the expense of these other American manufacturers -- exporters like Caterpillar Inc. and Harley-Davidson Inc. are already warning that the tariff would put them at a competitive disadvantage in world markets. No wonder shares of these companies slid after the tariff plan was announced:That Didn't Feel So GreatIndexed share performance of companies that might be hurt by tariffsSource: BloombergSo Trump’s ham-fisted attempts to protect one American industry seem likely to deal a blow to many others. This is the exact opposite of the increased international manufacturing prowess that Trump has promised.Defenders of the tariffs argue that steel and aluminum are important for national defense , and so need to be protected even at the cost of less martial industries. But military shipbuilders will be hurt by higher metals prices, as will makers of tanks, planes, guns and other crucial defense equipment.Nor will the tariffs bring back good jobs at steel and aluminum factories. Since 1990, production of metals in the U.S. has held roughly constant, but the number of people employed in the industry has fallen steadily:Look Elsewhere for the Growth Story of TomorrowIndustrial production of primary metal*Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. LouisIndex 2012 = 100Doing the Same With Fewer PeopleEmployment in primary metals productionSource: Federal Reserve Bank of St. LouisThe reason is technology. Productivity has improved, even as demand has stayed more or less constant. Mathematically, that means fewer jobs for steel and aluminum workers. Tariffs won’t change that equation. If anything, by hurting downstream industries like car and equipment manufacturers, the new import taxes will probably kill more factory jobs than they save.So Trump’s metals tariffs look likely to be a self-inflicted wound for the U.S. -- even if they don’t spark retaliation from trading partners, and even if they don’t weaken American alliances .If Trump wants to help the steel and aluminum industries, there are better ways to do it. Instead of letting U.S. metal-makers charge higher prices to other American industries, the government could focus on helping to raise exports. The reason domestic steel production hasn’t grown isn’t because of cheap imports; it’s the fact that the U.S. market hasn’t grown.The U.S. is a mature economy with a lot of existing buildings, infrastructure and vehicles, meaning that its consumption of metal can be expected to grow only slowly. Countries in Asia and Africa, however, need lots of new steel to fuel their economic development. The U.S., which makes higher-quality steel than countries like China, could potentially be supplying much of those countries’ needs.Currently, U.S. steel companies command only 2 percent of world exports, compared with 24 percent by China. There are things the government could do to improve that situation, including export promotion, export loans and assistance for small producers looking to break into world markets. Selling more steel and aluminum abroad is a much better bet than trying to capture a bigger slice of a stagnating pie back home.So far, though, Trump has shown more interest in trade war for its own sake than in actually helping U.S. companies compete. Tariffs might make Trump and his diehard followers feel better, but they’ll hurt more American pocketbooks than they benefit.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.To contact the author of this story:Noah Smith at nsmith150@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story:James Greiff at jgreiff@bloomberg.net

Filed with Secretary of State October 05, 2017. ]LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGESTSB 54, De León. Law enforcement: sharing data.Existing law provides that when there is reason to believe that a person arrested for a violation of specified controlled substance provisions may not be a citizen of the United States, the arresting agency shall notify the appropriate agency of the United States having charge of deportation matters.This bill would repeal those provisions.Existing law provides that whenever an individual who is a victim of or witness to a hate crime, or who otherwise can give evidence in a hate crime investigation, is not charged with or convicted of committing any crime under state law, a peace officer may not detain the individual exclusively for any actual or suspected immigration violation or report or turn the individual over to federal immigration authorities.This bill would, among other things and subject to exceptions, prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies, including school police and security departments, from using money or personnel to investigate, interrogate, detain, detect, or arrest persons for immigration enforcement purposes, as specified, and would, subject to exceptions, proscribe other activities or conduct in connection with immigration enforcement by law enforcement agencies. The bill would apply those provisions to the circumstances in which a law enforcement official has discretion to cooperate with immigration authorities. The bill would require, by October 1, 2018, the Attorney General, in consultation with the appropriate stakeholders, to publish model policies limiting assistance with immigration enforcement to the fullest extent possible for use by public schools, public libraries, health facilities operated by the state or a political subdivision of the state, and courthouses, among others. The bill would require, among others, all public schools, health facilities operated by the state or a political subdivision of the state, and courthouses to implement the model policy, or an equivalent policy. The bill would state that, among others, all other organizations and entities that provide services related to physical or mental health and wellness, education, or access to justice, including the University of California, are encouraged to adopt the model policy. The bill would require that a law enforcement agency that chooses to participate in a joint law enforcement task force, as defined, submit a report annually pertaining to task force operations to the Department of Justice, as specified. The bill would require the Attorney General, by March 1, 2019, and annually thereafter, to report on the types and frequency of joint law enforcement task forces, and other information, as specified, and to post those reports on the Attorney General’s Internet Web site. The bill would require law enforcement agencies to report to the department annually regarding transfers of persons to immigration authorities. The bill would require the Attorney General to publish guidance, audit criteria, and training recommendations regarding state and local law enforcement databases, for purposes of limiting the availability of information for immigration enforcement, as specified. The bill would require the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to provide a specified written consent form in advance of any interview between a person in department custody and the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement regarding civil immigration violations.This bill would state findings and declarations of the Legislature relating to these provisions.By imposing additional duties on public schools and local law enforcement agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.Digest KeyVote: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program: YES Bill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. Section 7282 of the Government Code is amended to read:7282. For purposes of this chapter, the following terms have the following meanings:(a) “Conviction” shall have the same meaning as subdivision (d) of Section 667 of the Penal Code.(b) “Eligible for release from custody” means that the individual may be released from custody because one of the following conditions has occurred:(1) All criminal charges against the individual have been dropped or dismissed.(2) The individual has been acquitted of all criminal charges filed against him or her.(3) The individual has served all the time required for his or her sentence.(4) The individual has posted a bond.(5) The individual is otherwise eligible for release under state or local law, or local policy.(c) “Hold request,” “notification request,” and “transfer request” have the same meanings as provided in Section 7283.

['Fake news']	https://www.nyfoxnews.co/	https://www.nyfoxnews.co/michelle-obama-just-received-life-shattering-news-from-the-doctor/	2018/03/07	Home /Michelle Obama Just Received LIFE-SHATTERING News From The DoctorUncategorized March 4, 2018Michelle Obama Just Received LIFE-SHATTERING News From The DoctorMichelle Obama has been mostly laying low on one vacation after another since leaving the White House, only to emerge when she sees an opportunity to publicly slam President Donald Trump. A lot of questions have come up about the former first lady, starting when Barack Obama was still the president and continuing on now as the two live very separate lives. Although she’s desperately tried to hide the truth for months, a doctor has recently revealed what she has diagnosed her with which confirms our suspicions as well as our fears.Many have felt that Michelle’s behavior in the final months of being the first lady was strange, even for her, and has only gotten more alarming since the arrogant woman left the White House, but perpetually tries to remain as the center of everyone’s attention. Much of the country is happy to have her and her husband out of politics and wish that she’d slip into obscurity, but she refuses. Now we know why.Michelle’s hate for America seemed to become more obvious as the grip of power she had while her husband was president started to slip away at the end of his second term as their eviction dated neared. Every chance she got to make disparaging remarks about the country, she took, which has been a habit that’s only gotten worse in her post-presidential life. Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, shed some light on why Michelle did this as result of what she unofficially diagnosed her with.Biz Pac Review reported on the issue at the end of Obama’s administration before Trump took office:Why is First Lady Michelle Obama suddenly appearing so many places disparaging the country in the last days of her husband’s presidency?Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, recently wrote a book entitled, “On Behalf of the President: Presidential Spouses and White House Communications Strategy Today.”Wright diagnosed Mrs. Obama’s recent behavior. She has become an attack dog in an effort to help Obama build his legacy as the last days of his presidency slip away.“She’s in legacy building mode. She doesn’t have to worry about the implications [of her remarks] for months to come,” Wright said. “This is the time she’s most free to say what she feels, what she believes, and what she wants the message to be for the public.”As First Lady, Obama has given more public speeches and indulged more appearances than any First Lady in history, Wright reported in her book.“I think what surprises and upsets people most often is that first ladies give more public remarks than vice presidents, and that’s been true over the last three administrations,” she wrote.Of her biggest, and most disturbing claims she made in her campaign of hate against the country was that America is a racist nation who needed her husband in office and that she’s now suffering a feeling of “hopelessness” with Trump in office. Doubling down on that disrespectful sentiment is that she said she was never proud of America until her husband got elected to the White House. It’s ironic how Michelle says Barrack was successful in inspiring hope in the nation after everyone overwhelmingly voted Trump in, desperate for the hope his predecessor promised and failed to deliver on.The best case of revenge was how miserably she failed at building her legacy and trying to save it in the final days, especially now, that Trump just took the final sledgehammer to her most beloved project. After her disastrous lunch program crumbled around her and even her biggest supporters were critical of the changes she made to school meals, her nemesis, Trump, came in and reversed all she had done. He then topped it off by giving kids back their chocolate milk that she had ridiculously robbed them of.Dean James from America’s Freedom Fighters let loose on Michelle and her nasty claims about our country she’s more than profited off of:So, Michelle is out there claiming that we are all racists and with Trump taking the White House the nation is in a state of hopelessness… This coming from someone who said she was never proud of America until her Muslim, racist pathetic husband was elected.Hey lady, I hate to break it to you but your ‘husband’ has destroyed America and has left the entire planet in a complete state of chaos. The only reason he was elected is because he is black.The truth of her desperate attempt to make America and President Trump look bad before she left was nothing more than a temper-tantrum by this entitled woman who knew that Trump was actually about to bring real hope back and in doing so prove what a failure his predecessor really was.Facebook Comments

REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke/File PhotoOn Thursday, Trump said the duties — 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum — would be formally announced next week, although White House officials later said some details still needed to be ironed out.“We are putting it on hold. We believe that tariffs could cause a pretty significant increase in the price of steel on the U.S. market,” Electrolux spokesman Daniel Frykholm said.Electrolux buys all the steel it uses in its U.S. products domestically.“So this is not the possibility of tariffs directly impacting our costs, but rather the impact it could have on the market and that it could damage the overall competitiveness of our operations in the U.S.,” Frykholm said.The company is waiting to see the final details of the U.S. plans before making a final decision, he said.Electrolux had said in January it would invest $250 million to expand and modernize its plant in Springfield, Tennessee.Reporting by Simon Johnson; Editing by Jason Neely and Peter Graff

Glenn Simpson, who cofounded the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, told lawmakers that a trip Trump Organization representatives took to Moscow several years ago had come onto the firm's radar as part of their research into Trump's business history. The trip was organized by Sergei Millian, Simpson said. He said Millian ""came up in connection with Chris' work as one of the people around Trump who had a Russian background."" Chris is a reference to Christopher Steele, the former British intelligence officer hired by Fusion to research Trump's Russia ties. This Russian Buissnessman Sergei Millian who is a Russian source behind Hillary Clinton and the DNC's paid for Russia/Trump dossier from Fusion GPS used by Obama to get a FISA warrant on Trump goes by another name, that name is Sergey Panchenko. Sergey Panchenko just happens to be one of the dead passengers in today's Russian plane crash that has killed 71 people. Also dead in this plane crash is Ivanov Vyacheslav the CFO of Rosatom who is involved in Hillary's Uranium One deal with Russia back in 2009 under Barack Obama. So it looks like this is officially a kill by the Hillary team/Deep State to cover tracks, but it's already figured out...As the Russian source behind the fake Trump dossier who worked with Christopher Steele and Hillary Clinton to smear Trump is dead, and also the CFO of Rosatom also being killed in this plane crash in Russia today that left 71 dead."

Breaking news and information will be updated on TheHerald-News.com.Q&A: Gov. Rauner talks infrastructure, politics and his plans for 2018By ALEX ORTIZ Email FollowJan. 3, 2018Gov. Bruce Rauner was in Joliet Wednesday afternoon to speak with The Herald-News editorial board about his campaign for re-election and what's on his legislative agenda for 2018.The following is a part of a question and answer session that lasted about half an hour. The transcript has been edited for length and clarity.[Eric Ginnard - eginnard@shawmedia.com]Rauner: I'm actually here in Joliet and Will County meeting with elected officials and talking about different initiatives we got going on. Obviously (it's a) big year in terms of the election and also hopefully getting a truly balanced budget for the first time in maybe forever. We're going to be proposing again a balanced budget and actually proposing an income tax reduction. They overrode my veto on the tax hike last June. I'm going to propose that we start rolling that back.My goals in this year, and then for the next four years, that's after re-election, are to roll back the income tax hike, get it back down to 3 percent over time. (That's) number one.Number two, get property tax relief, meaning get local control and let local residents be able to control whether their levy goes up or down through a simple voter referendum process. So local residents can say, “Hey we want our levy up 5 percent to cover our schools this year,” or, “We need it to go down 7 percent over the next two years because we can't afford our homes anymore,” and then local control of the cost of government.Third big issue, big goal is to grow the economy faster. Our biggest challenge in Illinois is our government spending has been growing four times faster than our economy has been growing. This is has been true for 30 years. That's unsustainable. It's the reason why we always have deficits. It's the reason why we're always having tax hikes. We're sort of on this long, slow debt spiral and we've got to change that.[Eric Ginnard - eginnard@shawmedia.com]Herald-News: The Houbolt Road project, do you have any update on that?Rauner: I haven't heard much in the last couple weeks. What I'll do is when I leave here, I'm going to have my team call you and give you the full download. Everything I know is last time I heard, about a few weeks ago, things are going. I think that's a great project.Herald-News: One of the issues facing people here is that you talk about jobs here, it's expanding, but also trucks are expanding, the roads can't handle it. What can the state do for people here on that?Rauner: It's a huge issue. We've got to be invested in our infrastructure. I've advocated having an infrastructure plan on capital bills from day one. I'm still pushing for that. It would help if we had a balanced budget so we could have the money to put in.Also, get creative with public-private partnerships. We recommended one for the I-55 managed lanes. Madigan so far has held that up for his own, whatever reasons, not valid reasons. But we can do a lot of raising of money. I've talked to investors who would love to invest and expand our highway network where you can do flexible tolling and other creative ways to finance the roads and you don't even need to have taxpayers pay for it. But I'm also happy to have state government projects the taxpayers pay. The reality is that drives major economic growth.Will County is the heart of transportation in the United States of America and boy, Will County totally depends on the highway system, 100 percent.[Eric Ginnard - eginnard@shawmedia.com]Herald-News: What does that look like in your mind? Is is bridges, more lanes on highways?Rauner: Yes. (laughs)It's like everything. It's highways primarily, but it's also intermodal ports. It's also rail improvements. It's also terminals for the different companies in public-private partnerships in some of these terminals.We haven't gone forward with any third airport issues, and I'm not pushing that yet, but over time. If we get balanced budgets, if we get more economic growth going, we're going to need to expand air transit as well. Illinois is the transportation hub of America and Will County is the hub for Illinois. We've got to be investing in every type of transportation infrastructure.Herald-News: The Grundy County State's Attorney Jason Helland is running for Secretary of State. Do you have thoughts on him?Rauner: The one person that I'm really advocating strongly for is Erika Harold to be Attorney General. There are other competitive races where I'm not taking an active position one way or another. Erika Harold is the one where I'm very – and Darlene Senger for comptroller. We've got to have a comptroller who is independent of Madigan.[Eric Ginnard - eginnard@shawmedia.com]Herald-News: We wanted to ask you about something in the news recently about the Legionnaires' disease outbreak at the Quincy Veterans' Home. Your opponents were coming down on you not taking responsibility in their eyes. Do you want to respond to that?Rauner: It's so false. First of all, it's heartbreaking. I take care for our residents, all our residents, especially our veterans very seriously. We go above and beyond to take care of our veterans. We had an outbreak of Legionella at that facility. Our team took immediate, strong action. We brought in national experts, brought in the CDC, spent $6.5 million on a new filtration system, changed the protocols, did everything possible to improve the situation and keep people safe there. We got rave reviews and appropriate support from the national experts.Since then we've had a few incidences of Legionella infection and we've checked and made sure we're doing all the protocols, etc. The reality is, and this is what's not getting into the reports, the Legionella bacteria is in most water systems in Illinois. There were just two infections of Legionnaires at Northwestern Hospital, which is not even an old facility and I think is regarded as a really well-run facility. These things happen.With our veterans, many of them are in their late 80s and 90s (and are) vulnerable to getting sick. They don't have a strong immune system. So the reality is that there's some risk but in all facilities there's risk. We're getting criticized. We went the extra step. Normally for years, these issues have been going on in Illinois. We actually wanted to find out what was causing it.You might be interested in...

McCaskill’s request focuses specifically on efforts to intercept shipments of fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, one of the most powerful types of opioids. Committee Chairman Ron Johnson is joining McCaskill in her request.“Fentanyl is now killing more Americans than heroin or any other opioid, and we should use every tool at our disposal to keep it from entering the United States,” McCaskill said. “I look forward to hearing more from the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and USPS about what we’re doing to stop deadly opioids from entering the country and what more can be done on this front.”Partnerships between the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and USPS, as well as partnerships between the United States and foreign countries, can help to reduce the flow of illegal drugs into the United States. Shipments of fentanyl and fentanyl analogs (which have very similar ingredients to fentanyl) are of particular concern, as fentanyl is one of the most powerful types of opioids. In the U.S., opioid overdose from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids almost doubled between 2015 and 2016 to nearly 20,000.The State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and USPS all play important roles in reducing the flow of illegal drugs into the country. “The opioid crisis in this country has reached epidemic proportions, and it is a multifaceted problem that demands a whole-of-government approach to resolve,” the Senators wrote in their letters to the agencies. The Senators are seeking details on how the agencies encourage cross-departmental and international data sharing so that USPS can better identify suspicious packages and help partners overseas identify those trying to illegally ship drugs to disrupt the supply chain. The Senators are also requesting information on how extensive of a problem international drug shipments are and how agencies are doing at following current guidelines to address this problem.Previously, McCaskill and Johnson requested details about what Customs and Border Protection is doing to stop illegal opioids from being smuggled into the country at ports of entry and the border. McCaskill also targeted opioid shipments from China at a Senate hearing earlier this year. McCaskill is currently leading the largest Congressional investigation to date into the opioid epidemic, requesting information from opioid manufacturers and distributors .Read the Senators’ letters to the State Department , the Department of Homeland Security , and USPS .###

""There are a lot of officers that don't agree with that.""Valdez said the law was a political tool to attack vulnerable Texans.""Throughout history, we've had a vulnerable group to pick on,"" Valdez said. ""Now it seems to be Hispanics.""Valdez said Department of Public Safety numbers show that 1.6 percent of crime is committed by unauthorized immigrants.""Why don't we actually take care of the problem, instead of going after a group?"" she said.Tarrant County Sheriff Bill Waybourn also said he was glad Abbott clarified that the new law would not be used to make local police officers the immigration police.Special session updateIn a news conference after his speech, Abbott said he was hopeful that the Legislature would approve all 20 items on the agenda for the special session now in progress. He said the Senate has conducted its business and the House could do the same, if it had the will.But the governor did not commit to calling another special session, if lawmakers don't approve all of his wish list.Abbott also defended the controversial bathroom bill that would reverse local laws related to transgender restroom use. Transgender residents would be restricted to using bathrooms that correspond to the gender of their birth.He said police officers would not have to enforce such a law; that would be left to the Texas attorney general.He asked Texans to ""step back and calmly look at what the bill says before casting misguided judgment.""But Valdez, Dallas County's first Hispanic, woman and lesbian sheriff, said the Legislature should stop trying to pass a bathroom bill.""I've had more people injured by trying to hold their urine to go to a bathroom where they feel safe than injured by somebody going in dressed as another sex,"" Valdez said. ""We're making up something. It's not an issue. We need to start caring for our people.""Also at the sheriffs meeting, Abbott said the country needed to better support police officers.""Respect for our law enforcement officers must be restored in our nation,"" he said. ""The badge every sheriff and every officer wear over his or her heart is a reminder of a sacred trust, commitment and contract with each of us.""View Comments"

We're very proud of it. As far as Puerto Rico is concerned, that's been going, as you know, really well.(END VIDEO CLIP)DICKERSON: Not so, says the mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yulin Cruz.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CARMEN YULIN CRUZ, MAYOR OF SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO: It has been too slow. It's been so slow, that it's put lives in danger. There's a disconnect between what has been said and the reality.(END VIDEO CLIP)DICKERSON: We will get the real story from Puerto Rico and hear from Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio.Then, it's on to tax reform, as House Speaker Paul Ryan tells us what we can expect from the Republican tax plan.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DICKERSON: Can you guarantee that every middle-class person will get a tax cut once this becomes a bill and then that passes?REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: That's the purpose of doing this. The purpose of this is to get a middle-class tax cut.DICKERSON: So, is that a guarantee?(END VIDEO CLIP)DICKERSON: What will the plan do for you? And what do Democrats want? Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer will be here.Plus, CBS News man Bob Schieffer will join us. His new book, ""Overload"" takes a look at the news deluge in the Trump era.Plus, we will have plenty of political analysis.It's all coming up on FACE THE NATION.Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I'm John Dickerson.We have got a lot of news to get to today, but we want to begin with the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria.CBS News correspondent David Begnaud is in San Juan.David, right now what is the most urgent need?DAVID BEGNAUD, CBS NEWS CORRESPONDENT: John, physically getting food and water to the people who so desperately are still begging for it 11 days after this hurricane made landfall.Look, we went to the western tip of the island in Aguadilla. It's a place that is surrounded by water, yet people are still desperately finding a drop that they can actually drink.The military is there. FEMA is there. We saw the good work that they are doing. But we also talked to the mayor, who said: It's not enough. I have got 60,000 people in town, but I have only got 2,000 meals that I can hand out.John, there were people who got in line to get food and were given four bottles of water and four snacks, adults and kids. And when some people came back for seconds, they were turned away, because, as the sheriff said, there's not enough to give seconds to people.DICKERSON: David, where is the bottleneck? We heard about those thousands of shipping containers that had supplies, but there no were truckers to get them to the people. Is that where the problem is?BEGNAUD: Look, John, the problem appears to be actually doing it.There's a lot of talking. There's a lot of meetings, but the actual doing is what seems to be lacking in many areas. When we went to the port earlier this week, there were 30,000 shipping containers that we were told were just sitting there waiting on truckers.The governor said to us, ""I need truckers.""I said, Governor, ""Why do you need truckers?""And he said, ""Because we can't get in touch with some of these people.""There's no communication. Their homes may have been destroyed. The roads are impassable.Well, good news. Yesterday, we saw truckers leaving the port. But of those 3,000 shipping containers, only 300 or 400 hundred had been processed.So, here's what FEMA is doing. They're going in. They're buying some of the supplies in those trucks -- in those containers, and they're sending them out themselves.John, there is a larger military presence here today than there was a week ago. But even a general on the ground has said, ""We don't have enough yet.""DICKERSON: David Begnaud for us, thanks so much, David.CBS News chief medical correspondent Jon LaPook caught up with the mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yulin Cruz, yesterday, and asked her what she would say to President Trump if she had the opportunity to do so.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)YULIN CRUZ: He is a businessman, so I will talk to you in business terms.Right now, we're in the business of saving lives. And if the supply chain of aid is not constant, is not properly administered, is not properly replenished, then the business of saving lives will go bankrupt.DR. JON LAPOOK, CBS NEWS CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: And, bottom line, right now, do you think you're headed in the right direction? Do you think everything is being done now that could be done?YULIN CRUZ: No.(END VIDEO CLIP)DICKERSON: We turn now to Republican Senator Marco Rubio. He joins us from Miami.Senator, you wrote a letter to the president this week about the situation in Puerto Rico. You said there is no clear command and control.Has that been worked out? And is enough being done at the federal level?SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), FLORIDA: Well, I think it really hopefully began to turn the corner on Thursday evening, when General Buchanan arrived and the sort of command began to take over of the daily tactical and logistical operation on the ground.My concern was not that FEMA wasn't responding. There's a tremendous amount of aid that's gone into Puerto Rico. The problem is, as I said to someone yesterday, there is aid getting to Puerto Rico, but it wasn't getting to Puerto Ricans, because it had to be distributed from San Juan to the different municipalities and then, within those municipalities, distributed to people.They had established this sort of spoke -- the sort of hub and spoke system where all the aid came in and then had to be distributed out. Those distribution systems were victims of the storm themselves. They were broken.And so I felt and continue to feel that the Department of Defense are the only people that could have gone out reestablished that. And I hope that that's what's begun to happen. There are some small inkling signs of progress in that regard.And, obviously, from the time they make a move to the time you start to see its effects will take a number of days. There are some other issues now emerging that I think are problematic. And I'm very concerned about the situation with the hospitals in Puerto Rico.And I have had some -- I have heard some concerning things about that. And, hopefully, we will keep an eye on that as well.DICKERSON: What concerns you the most about the hospitals?RUBIO: I'm concerned about the capacity of these hospitals. I'm concern about how many medical personnel might still be around, and do they have sufficient quantities of that?And, obviously, the fuel systems in these hospitals require the operation of generators. And so do they get enough of the fuel to those hospitals in time to continue to operate? We have had reports of hospitals calling in the middle of the night to say, we're down to two hours of operating fuel.DICKERSON: You...RUBIO: So, I know that FEMA and I know that emergency responders are aware of this, and are trying to address it at the front end. But that's something to keep an eye on.DICKERSON: You mentioned that General Buchanan got there on Thursday.That is almost a week after this started. Was there just not fast enough recognition from the administration or from the Department of Defense to get in there?RUBIO: You know, I think what it -- they responded to the storm the way we respond to storms. They responded to it in a way no different than Texas or Florida in terms of the assets.And what that is, is, the federal government says, we are here to the local government or to the state government, in the case of Puerto Rico, the territorial government there, we're here to help, tell us what you need.That model generally works. It's worked in Florida a couple of weeks ago. It's helped in Texas. It didn't work in Puerto Rico. And the reason why it didn't work is because the government of Puerto Rico itself is a victim of the storm.There are 78 municipalities. Some of those mayors themselves couldn't communicate with San Juan. And even if they could, and even if you could get to them and deliver aid to those mayors, they didn't have enough municipal employees to be able to deliver the aid, or they didn't have resource, like fuel or vehicles or even drivers in many cases.So, that -- they recognized that a few days later, but, again, by the -- from the time you make a decision to make a change to the time you start to see its impact takes a number of days.And, hopefully, we are now at that point where we're going to begin to see some measurable progress.DICKERSON: Speaking of the government, the president has been quite critical of the mayor of San Juan. What do you make of that?RUBIO: I don't spend a lot of time thinking about it, to be honest with you, because right now, having lived through four hurricanes, nothing like what Puerto Rico is facing, our desire is to be a voice and a force for positive results, helping people.I truly believe that if we don't get ahead of the curve there, bad things are going to happen. Some have already happened, unfortunately, because storms are terrible things, especially in an area like Puerto Rico, where people have been without electricity now for over a week, a food issue, et cetera.But I do think every minute we spend in the political realm bickering with one another over who is doing what or who is wrong or didn't do right is a minute of energy and time that we're not spending trying to get the response right.And so I think, when this is all said and done, we're going to have time to stop and look back and say, should things have -- done differently? I think everyone involved in the response has things they could have done better, but right now I hope we will stay 100 percent focused on what needs to be done to get the people of Puerto Rico help.And then we will have plenty of time in the future to have these debates about who didn't do the right thing or what could have been done better.DICKERSON: Let me ask you a question about Cuba, an issue you have spent a lot of time working on.You have been critical of the State Department's response to the attacks on diplomats in Cuba. You have said it's weak, unacceptable and outrageous.But is there any evidence that the Cuban government has been behind these attacks?RUBIO: Well, obviously, I'm limited in what I can discuss in a media program like this.Let me just say this. Cuba is one of the most tightly controlled and monitored societies in the world. Anyone who has interacted Cuba, been to Cuba or has anything to do with Cuba understands that very little happens in Havana that the Cuban government doesn't know about, especially Americans working for the State Department.So, the idea that over 20 Americans working for the State Department, working for the U.S. Embassy could be severely injured in Cuba, and the Cuban government not know anything about it is ridiculous.DICKERSON: What should be done now?RUBIO: Well, I think they have done half of it, which is drawing down our embassy presence, again, for purposes of protecting our personnel.Set the -- everybody knows how I feel about Cuba policy, but set that aside for a moment. If something like this had happened anywhere in the world with a government that tries to argue that they know nothing about it, this was the same response we would advocate.So, I agree with the drawing down of our personnel. I just think it is fair and reciprocal for us to require a proportional drawdown of the Cuban Embassy and the Cuban diplomatic presence in the United States.DICKERSON: Let me...RUBIO: And that's what I expect they will do.DICKERSON: Let me ask you another question.Secretary Price had to resign this week because of the private plane travel. The White House has new procedures here.Is that it? Is this an executive branch thing, or does Congress need to look into this and oversee this, since Congress controls the purse strings?RUBIO: Well, I mean, obviously, Congress controls the purse string.And you can always look in the internal budget of agency and put prohibitions on -- in place. But, first, I think we should -- it's an executive office management issue, and if they can get ahead of it and manage it appropriately and prevent that from happening in the future, that's what we would expect them to do, and there may not be a problem to solve.You know, Congress should be focused on tax reform. Congress should have its hands full in the weeks to come in trying to get tax reform done, hopefully before Thanksgiving. That won't be easy. And you will have some guests on later today that will describe the path to get there and how difficult that could be.And so -- but, again, look, I think this was an issue that unfortunately kind of got in the way of Secretary Price being able to continue to do his job. I think he's a good person. Obviously, this didn't work out in a positive way and he had to step aside.But the important work has to continue.DICKERSON: All right, Secretary -- excuse me -- Senator Rubio, thanks so much for being with us.RUBIO: Thank you.DICKERSON: President Trump traveled to Indiana this week to unveil a new Republican tax reform plan.But, at this point, the plan is only a framework.So, we traveled to Aston, Pennsylvania, with Speaker Paul Ryan to tour a manufacturing plant and get more details.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)DICKERSON: Mr. Speaker, we are at Pennsylvania Machine Works.I'm going to ask you a question a work here asked you. How are these tax cuts going to help the blue-collar worker? What are they going to take home in their pocket?RYAN: Well, first of all, the whole purpose of this to get a middle-class tax cut, to help the people who are working paycheck to paycheck keep more of their own hard-earned dollars.They haven't had a break in a long time. Our economy has been growing between 1 and 2 percent for a long time. We haven't had 3 percent growth in about a decade. And that means workers are struggling. So, number one, a middle-class tax cut to help those families keep more of what they earn.But, number two, this business is a perfect example of how we need to help get tax reform to get the tax rates down on these businesses, so they can stay competitive and keep hiring people.DICKERSON: But I'm a blue-collar worker, what is my paycheck going to look like? What am I taking home? What are you promising? Are you promising anything? Can I -- do I know some money is coming to me?RYAN: You know some money is coming to you. We're going to double that standard deduction.We're going to make it so he can fill out his taxes on a postcard. We're going to lower his taxes. That's really important, so he has more take-home pay.But there's another component to this is, look at this -- look at this machine shop. This -- this business pays about a 40 percent tax rate, but it competes with companies all around the world who pay on average 22.5 percent on their taxes.So, we're going to lower the taxes on this business, so it's globally competitive, so it can compete with this foreign competition. Then we're going to give this business an ability to write off the investments that they make in this business to buy more machines, to hire more workers, to raise wages.That to us is really important.DICKERSON: I want to get back to the businesses in a second, because there's obviously some debate about the effective rate they pay.But let's just stick to the worker for a minute. Can you guarantee that every middle-class person will get a tax cut once this becomes a bill and then that passes?RYAN: That's the purpose of doing this. The purpose of this is to get a middle-class tax cut, to lower people's...DICKERSON: So, is that a guarantee?RYAN: Well, I don't know every single person's little small problem or their issue.DICKERSON: But it will be minimal, if nobody gets -- if I'm a middle-class...RYAN: The entire purpose of this is to lower middle-class taxes.So, yes, people are going to get tax cuts. How big are those tax cuts? That depends on the individual. Do you have kids? Because there's going to be a bigger child tax credit. Are you married? You're going to have zero marriage penalty.DICKERSON: Well, that's the worry, because...RYAN: Those are the kinds of things that will determine, based on how low people's taxes go, because we want a pro-family tax code to make it easier for people to get married, to raise kids, to work.DICKERSON: You mentioned you're doubling the standard deduction, but you're also getting rid of some exemptions. And also the child tax credit is still up in the air. Those numbers haven't been figured out yet.RYAN: That's right.DICKERSON: So, when the math gets worked out...RYAN: It's going to go up, but we don't know how much it's going to go up.DICKERSON: But when the math gets worked out, there may be some families who do see their taxes increase.And I'm saying that, as an objective for the bill, as it goes through the process, will you work to squeeze that number to as low as possible?RYAN: That's exactly right. That's exactly right.So, the objective is to lower taxes for middle-class taxpayers.DICKERSON: Let me ask you about something you have wanted to do in the past you're not doing here, which is expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit for childless filers. It's a way to help people who are at the real bottom end, the people who have seen this inequality really face to face.Why is this not in -- why is that not in there?RYAN: Yes, Well, we're still working at -- we're keeping the EITC, of course, because we think it's actually pretty effective.(CROSSTALK)RYAN: But we're -- that's one of the things the committee is still looking at.DICKERSON: So...(CROSSTALK)RYAN: But within the framework of this bill are many other decisions that have to be made, because the framework of this, and the reason we did it this way, is, unlike health care, we wanted to make sure that everyone was on the same page with respect to the House and the Senate and the White House.Now, working within that framework, we're going to be targeting these things, so that we can make sure that middle-class taxpayers get a break. And one of the things that we think helps move people into work is the EITC.So, we want more work incentives. And EITC reform is clearly something we're going to be looking at.DICKERSON: So, you could expand it.Let me ask you this, then. Another thing that maybe will be in it coming in the process, the president had wanted to get rid of carried interest, the so-called carried interest loophole.RYAN: Sure.That's something that the committee is going to make a decision on. What I made a decision...DICKERSON: Why? Shouldn't it be a kind of cinch?RYAN: No, it should be something that the tax-writing committees who are in charge of writing tax legislation will be deciding and working on.That is one of the issues they're clearly looking into. The point I'm trying to make here is, I like going through what we call the regular order process.DICKERSON: But you're pitching this as a middle-class tax cut. And you say every child in America should have an opportunity in this country, and that's been part of the American dream.But there are specifics in this. You're getting rid of the estate tax. The Earned Income Tax Credit is not being expanded. It might be in the future. The carried interest loophole is still in there.If I'm looking at this, and I'm a middle-class person, I'm thinking, the estate tax people are taken care of, the Alternative Minimum Tax, which will help the wealthy, that's getting taken of, but the things that will help me, those are until later.RYAN: Can I go through that? Can I get through that?We're going to double your standard deduction, so you can file your taxes on a postcard. We're going to take people who are in the 10 percent bracket and put a lot of that money in a zero percent tax bracket.We're taking the 15 percent bracket down to 12 percent. We're going to get rid of the marriage penalty. We're going to increase the child tax credit. We're going to maintain critical things like incentives for home buying, charitable giving, education savings, retirement savings.(CROSSTALK)RYAN: Those are all -- just give me...DICKERSON: Yes.RYAN: Those are all middle-class tax things.The purpose of this is to help people who are living by a paycheck get to keep more of their own hard-earned money, but also get more jobs, a faster growing economy.DICKERSON: Let me ask you about the theory behind the lowering of the corporate tax rate.If the corporate tax rate goes down, how do you know a company is going to put it back into wages? A lot of money from companies has gone to shareholders. Most sat on the sidelines.RYAN: Most studies show that, when you lower -- that the tax on businesses is taken out of wages. So, the point is...DICKERSON: But, actually, isn't there quite a lot of debate about that?RYAN: Let me say it this way.Should we be taxing American businesses at much higher tax rates than our foreign competitors are taxing theirs? This business is taxed as high as 40-plus percent, and their competitors are taxed on average 22.5 percent.How does that help this business in global competition?DICKERSON: I guess isn't the debate that, A, effectively the rate is actually quite lower than 40. And, also, I guess the question is...RYAN: But that's not actually always the case.DICKERSON: Well...RYAN: The point is, we know we're taxing our businesses at much higher tax rates than our foreign competitors are taxing theirs.And here is the point, John. Businesses are leaving America. The current tax code discourages making things in America. The current tax code says, if you are good enough to be big enough to make money overseas, you can't even bring it back because of our tax laws.DICKERSON: You have spent your life thinking about tax reform. The other thing you have thought about is fiscal issues.(CROSSTALK)RYAN: Yes.DICKERSON: Will this tax plan increase the debt?RYAN: It's going to be deficit-neutral. That's the budget rules we use, which is called the Byrd rule.DICKERSON: Yes.RYAN: So, this will have to be a deficit-neutral tax bill.But we do fundamentally believe that this tax code and this tax reform will give us faster economic growth. Faster economic growth helps raise the economy, which raises revenues. And that helps us tackle the deficit.There's two things we got to do to get rid of this debt, deal with entitlements. That's -- that's -- that's why we're frustrated health care reform hasn't passed the Senate yet. Deal with runaway spending, but also grow the economy.This helps grow the economy. So, if you are asking me whether it's going to be deficit-neutral tax reform, that's what it has to be for us to be able to pass the bill.DICKERSON: After 10 years? So, it will -- so, what about the debt in terms of the additional money to the debt from this, from this, not deficit year to year, but overall?RYAN: If this results in giving us a faster economic growth, that will help us reduce our debt.DICKERSON: What a lot of people who have known you for a long time and have worked on these issues, when they hear you say, if this gives us growth, they say, he's gone to the dark side. He's...RYAN: I think it's the bright side, which is economic growth.Two things.DICKERSON: Sure, but they say the growth of the kind that you will need to fund this is just beyond the real reality.RYAN: Two things. Two things.You have got to have tax reform to get faster economic growth. Faster economic growth is necessary for us to get our debt under control. But you also have to reform entitlement programs.(CROSSTALK)DICKERSON: But could you tie entitlement reform to this, as some in the Freedom Caucus want?RYAN: You could. You could, but I don't -- I think we'd kill tax reform if we did, because let me just show you one piece of evidence.The Senate can't get health care out of the Senate. So, if we put something that has been proven to fail in the Senate to tax reform, we would kill tax reform. So, why would we do that?DICKERSON: Well, that leads us to politics. And the Affordable Care Act, it didn't make it through in the Senate. Why is it going to make it through in the Senate this time?RYAN: You talking about tax reform?DICKERSON: Mm-hmm.RYAN: I think it will make it through for a few reasons.Number one, we did this on the front end. We negotiated a framework, so that we all agree what this needs to look like at the front end.In health care, what we did was, we passed a bill in the House, and then Senate looked at our bill and decided to go a different direction. And here we are.We have more consensus on tax reform as Republicans, and we have less consensus on health care reform as Republicans.DICKERSON: I don't hear you talking about working with Democrats on this.RYAN: We talk to Democrats actually all the time, actually.DICKERSON: But do you work with them on this in a real way?RYAN: We do work with Democrats.But we're not going to give chuck Schumer the ability to filibuster this bill, because we think that would derail tax reform. Do we want Democrat involvement? Absolutely. Did the president have Democrats in the Ways and Means Committee in the White House two days ago? Yes.DICKERSON: Do you worry the Democrats -- the president will go off and work with the Democrats?RYAN: I think he should work with Democrats.DICKERSON: On tax reform?RYAN: Well, I don't think you're going to -- not on a filibuster.I think it would be a big mistake if we didn't use reconciliation, because we're basically dooming tax reform.But do we want Democrats to work with us on this? Of course we do. He had Joe Donnelly on the plane yesterday going to Indiana, which, by the way, I really fundamentally believe some of these Democrats from some of these states are going to vote for this.Look, Indiana, number one state for manufacturing. This tax reform so much helps these kind of manufacturers. So, I think, when people look at their constituents, tax breaks for middle-class families, making manufacturing more competitive, helping businesses stay in America, creating more jobs and faster economic growth, I got to think that some Democrats are going to listen not to the party leaders, but to their constituents.And I think some of them are going to vote for this.(END VIDEOTAPE)DICKERSON: And we will be back in one minute with more from House Speaker Paul Ryan.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)DICKERSON: We also spoke to Speaker Ryan about the topic of race in America.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)DICKERSON: A year ago, we talked about race relations in the country.And you said you hoped candidate -- then candidate Trump would be inclusive. You said, he's new at this.It's been a year now. How would you rate his ability to bring this country together, which hasn't clearly...(CROSSTALK)RYAN: Well, like I said on the Charlottesville thing, it was -- there were like three comments. One of them was great. Two of them -- no, four comments, I think, two good, two bad.I think, like you say -- like I said before, he's learning. I know his heart is in the right place.DICKERSON: How do you know that?RYAN: Just I have had some candid conversations with him about this, especially during that time. I have had some very candid conversations.And so I do really believe his heart is in the right place. I think what matters is that we have to show people that we are an inclusive society, that we want everyone to succeed.And I think there's more that all of us as leaders have got to do to be inclusive with people and make people feel like they're included in society. And I don't -- I think we have got a long ways to go, just as a society and a country for that.DICKERSON: Here is the criticism -- you know it -- with respect to the NFL.The president makes the case for those who see the kneeling at football games as an act of disrespect, and he argues about patriotism. He never mentions the reason that the players, some, have chosen to kneel and what that's about.RYAN: Yes.DICKERSON: Should that be addressed by a national leader? Isn't that part of the conversation?RYAN: Well, that has -- we -- there has been conversations.We have had these police shootings, Ferguson. That has been a national conversation, no two ways about it.We have -- we do hearings on this. We have -- we -- I set up a task force last year after the police shootings, bipartisan task force.DICKERSON: But, I mean, is the president? He's spending time on one side of the argument, but suggesting -- in fact, holding the opposite view and being concerned, as an African-American, it's an act of...(CROSSTALK)RYAN: But I do think he's got a point, which is, what I think a lot of people who are protesting on that don't necessarily see is that other people see it as disrespecting the country, what it stands for, the flag, and the people who died to protect it.So, I think, clearly, people have a right to express themselves in the First Amendment however they want to. But what so many Americans -- I see this at home -- see is, you're disrespecting the idea of America that we want to make this free country a more perfect union and that people have died and fought and survived to protect it.So, they don't see the point that they're trying to make.DICKERSON: All right, Mr. Speaker, thanks so much for being with us.RYAN: Hey, you bet. Thanks, John.(END VIDEOTAPE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)DICKERSON: Next up, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is standing by in our New York studio.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)DICKERSON: And we will be right back with Senator Schumer, Bob Schieffer, and a lot more FACE THE NATION.Stay with us.JOHN DICKERSON, CBS ANCHOR: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.We're here with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.Senator, I want to start on Puerto Rico. There's been a lot of criticism of the federal response. But the administration and Marco Rubio have said Puerto Rico is a special case. It's not like Texas and Florida. They were existing challenges in Puerto Rico, a weak electrical grid, those kind of things that are really a part of evaluating what's happening there.SEN. CHARLES SCHUMER (D), MINORITY LEADER: Well, first of all, the president, instead of tweeting against the mayor of San Juan, who's watching her people die and just made a plea for help, ought to roll up his sleeves and get to work here.The bottom line is, at least for the first week and a half, the effort has been slow-footed, disorganized and not adequate. And that's not just me saying it. General Buchanan said he doesn't have enough troops or materials. The secretary -- acting secretary of HHS, Duke, when she visited, said that things are not good.And so the bottom line is that we need more help. We need -- Marco Rubio is right, we need control and command. That means many more military troops.Let me give you an example. In Haiti, there were 22,000 troops after two weeks here. Right now there are 10,000. There haven't been 10,000 -- and those are very, very recent. So this has not been a good response. It needs the president to stop calling names, stop downgrading the motives of people who are calling for help, but roll up his sleeves and get to work.And, by the way, he should have gone to Puerto Rico earlier than two weeks. He'll go Tuesday, that's good, but two weeks after it hit. He was in Texas twice after that. Obama was up at Sandy two days afterwards. They say, oh, there are logistics that get in the way. But the president going makes a huge difference and logistics didn't get in the way in the past.DICKERSON: Well, I guess they would argue that -- that Puerto Rico is just a different -- much different case than Florida or Texas.But let's move on here to tax reform quickly. You've been -- you've been talking to the president about making deals with the presidents. Is this something you can do a deal with the president on?SCHUMER: Well, look, we Democrats sent a letter to the Republican leadership and the president, said that here were three things that we thought tax reform ought to have. One, it -- tax breaks ought not to go to the top 1 percent, but ought to be focused on the middle class. Two, it ought not blow a hole in the deficit. And, three, it ought to be done in bipartisan way, not through reconciliation.Unfortunately, the Republican plan doesn't agree with any of those. First, it's completely focused on the wealthy and the powerful, not on the middle class. Second, it blows a huge hole in the deficit. And, third, they said they're going to do it through reconciliation. That's a partisan process. It excludes Democrats. It's the same process that led to the demise on health care.And let me just address one thing, John. Speaker Ryan kept -- keeps saying it helps the middle class. That's not true. What he's saying and what the plan is are totally different.Let me go over three quick points. One, they get rid of the estate tax. The only people who benefit are the very wealthy, estates over $11 million. Five million -- five thousand estates will get over $3 million each. Second, they lower the top rate from 39 to 35. That affects the wealthy. They raise the lowest rate from 10 to 12. That affects working people. And, finally --DICKERSON: But that also knocks a lot of people off the rolls, senator.SCHUMER: Well --DICKERSON: People no longer have to pay taxes, which means that's good for them.SCHUMER: Well, no, they already don't have to pay taxes. But to lower the top rate and raise the bottom rate does not make any sense at all.And third, here's what the tax policy center, 80 percent -- 80 percent of the tax breaks in their plan are aimed at the top 1 percent and the top 0.1 percent, the people who make over $5 million, who are one in a thousand, get a tax break of over a million dollars.DICKERSON: So is your --SCHUMER: The middle class, at the same time, is hurt. Just one more point here. The Achilles heel of this, the first one, there are many state and local deductibility. In suburban, fairly well off districts, Republicans, throughout these states like New York, California, Illinois, New Jersey, those people, even with the standard deduction, will pay a lot more.DICKERSON: But why should -- why shouldn't people in Alabama --SCHUMER: It will be a real test of their Congress people -- it should be a real test of their Congress people, whether they vote with their constituents or they vote with the hard right ideology against state and local deductibility.DICKERSON: Well, the argument on state and local is, why should Alabama subsidize New York.But it sounds like you're basically out now to stop this bill, not to shape it?SCHUMER: Well, we'd like them to change. We would like them to really say it will be deficit neutral instead of using these fake numbers that say, oh, there will be huge growth. You know, they tried that in Kansas. That's Charles Koch's state. And this was the great experiment. They dramatically cut taxes and said there's going to be growth and an increase in the -- in the surplus.Well, after they did it, not -- they predicted the surplus would go up 300 million. It went down. The deficit went down 700 million. They had to cut money for schools and infrastructure and then they had to put in a tax increase.DICKERSON: Let me --SCHUMER: And did -- did Kansas grow? No. Last year its growth was 0.2 percent verse U.S. growth at 1.6.DICKERSON: Let --SCHUMER: So this idea that cutting taxes on the wealthy, this trickle-down economics, which the Republican Party loves, does not create growth. It never has. Does not reduce the deficit it never has.George Bush, his tax cuts, 2001, 2003 --DICKERSON: All right --SCHUMER: They said after ten years the deficit will go down. It went up by CBO's point 1.6 trillion. So this is fake numbers, helping the very, very wealthy, ignoring the middle class. And what Ryan said and what his proposal are, are totally different.DICKERSON: All right, well, we're out of time, senator, thanks for being here.SCHUMER: Sorry.DICKERSON: We'll be back with our --SCHUMER: I feel strongly about this.DICKERSON: Indeed.SCHUMER: But we want to work with them if they will change. We do. They have to -- they have to consult us.DICKERSON: They might not -- they --SCHUMER: They, you know, they have to consult us. They can't just put down a plan and say bipartisanship is you guys come over and do what we want when it's against our principles.DICKERSON: All right. Well, you've been talking to the president. I bet you'll give him that message.SCHUMER: I will.We'll be back with our panel. Don't go away.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)DICKERSON: All right, and now we're going to try an analyze all of this. Amy Walter is the national editor at ""The Cook Political Report."" Ben Domenech is the founder and publisher of ""The Federalist."" And Ezra Klein is the editor in chief at vox.com.Ben, I want to start with you.In Puerto Rico, what is -- just assess the blame here. Obviously there's blame to go around. Where does it lie?BEN DOMENECH, ""THE FEDERALIST"": Well, I think that there's a significant blame to be placed in a lot of different places. But just, first off, my family is Puerto Rican. We have many friend and relatives who are there right now. They are going through an incredibly challenging time.Puerto Rico is different in a lot of key ways from Florida and Texas. You can't just get the debris out of a place in the same way when it is an island.And I think that one of the biggest problems that Puerto Rico has is that their infrastructure was not in a good position even before this storm arrived. Part of the problem in Puerto Rico is that the politics of the island has been entirely driven by the question of status, what your position is on statehood versus commonwealth verse independence, and that's led to lot of different people getting elected politically who can take a position on that and argue for it in a fluent way but aren't necessarily the kind of infrastructure minded, diligent workers that you want to be in place when a crisis like this comes to bear.Clearly the aid got to the island in a lot of different place, but did not get to the people who needed it. It hasn't been delivered that last mile. And that is going to require, I think, a lot more effort than what you might see for a domestic storm in a similar situation, in part because the people who are there in leadership on that island have not had the experience of having to deliver and with such a heavy lift in the past.DICKERSON: So, Ezra, that is the local view.On the federal issue, Marco Rubio said basically that the problem with the response was they were planning for a certain kind of disaster and it turned out to be more tricky in Puerto Rico. So isn't that the job in a disaster to adapt at the federal level and know that Puerto Rico is different than Florida and Texas and therefore be able to basically adapt. That was kind of the promise of having a businessman in the -- in the Oval Office. What's your sense of that?EZRA KLEIN, VOX.COM: Adapt and predict and focus, right? I mean there are things they have said about Puerto Rico about how it's different, and it is different. But when Donald Trump comes in and says the thing about Puerto Rico is it's an island in the middle of the ocean, that was preexisting knowledge. We knew that before Hurricane Maria hit. There was a real lack of focus in the White House. I mean every bit of reporting we have seen so far, and also what we saw publicly from Donald Trump during the critical first days after the hurricane, have shown this. This was a hurricane that was predicted. It hit Puerto Rico in much the way we thought it was going to hit Puerto Rico. They didn't have a high level White House meeting on this, including Trump, with the right people in the room for six days.And during that period, it's not like Donald Trump is out there talking incessantly about Puerto Rico or at the White House focusing on Puerto Rico. He was playing golf. He was picking fights with the NFL.Focus in any White House, giving the number of things they need to do, is one of the truly scarce key qualities. You need to be -- you need to have people running herd on these kinds of projects if you're going to be able to adapt, if you're going to be able to bring to bear the amount of resource you need to. And this was, at the very least, a failure of management and a failure of focus.DICKERSON: Amy, the focus, at least in part from the president, recently has been on the mayor of San Juan. What in -- how is that a help?AMY WALTER, ""COOK POLITICAL REPORT"": It doesn't is the short answer and I -- I -- look, I think that has been the challenge for the president all along, which is when there's criticism that comes at him, his response is to lash back. And even those who are supporters of the president say, you know, I wish you would just stop tweeting and start -- to Ezra's point -- keep focused.But, fundamentally, I think, unfortunately, what this does is it brings us back to this place where if you are on a certain side of the aisle, you're going to side -- you know, you put on your jersey you side with the mayor. If you're on the other side of the aisle, you put on your jersey and you side with the president. And, once again, we're back to taking something that is a really serious humanitarian crisis and it's become now a political -- a test of your political fealty (ph). Are you in this tribe or this tribe?And this, I think, is both where we are at this place in time and it's also what so many voters hate about where we are at this place in time and that the unifying theme that should be, we're in a cries, let's all get together, has now become a test of, who are you, you know, more in alliance with.DICKERSON: Ben, let's switch to taxes here.Chuck Schumer has just given the opposition view. And I don't think he took a breath.What's your sense of both -- let's start first with policy in this. There are -- what do you make of the unified Republican framework?DOMENECH: Well, I think that Republicans are obviously far more comfortable talking about taxes than they are talking about health care. They are happy --DICKERSON: And the president for sure.DOMENECH: They are happy to run into the teeth of any kind of oppositional argument on the tax policy issue because they're so used to making these arguments and they're so -- they come so naturally to them.I think, though, that one of the things that Chuck Schumer brought up that is going to be a critical question here is this issue of state and local tax deductibility. There are a number of different Republicans who come from blue or purple states that are in these suburbanite sort of areas that have benefited from this state and local tax deduction in the past. That's a lot of different House members who are in states like California who are going to have a tough time going to their constituents and basically saying, yes, I'm going to -- I'm going to remove this as -- out of an act of fairness, as you said, to the taxpayers of Alabama. But they aren't elected by the taxpayers of Alabama. And I think that that's -- this could turn out to be one of the stickier subjects that they have to deal with in terms of the debate within their conference on this.DICKERSON: The state and local tax issue.Ezra, where do you take ahold of this plan?KLEIN: So, right now I think it's important to say, the plan lacks a lot of details.DICKERSON: A framework, yes.KLEIN: For instance, we don't know if there will be three or four tax brackets.But given what we have, the Tax Policy Center, which does the best tax modeling work in Washington, looked at it and I think there are three numbers that are worth thinking about here. So far Republicans have said, this is going to be defect neutral and it's going to retain the current codes progressivity.So the Tax Policy Center looked at the plan, made what assumptions they could make and said if you -- if you sort of do the best model you can, this code -- this plan is going to give the top 1 percent a tax cut of 130,000 on average each. People in the middle class a tax cut of about 660. It's very hard to look at those numbers and say that's a progressive plan. And then it's going to cost about $2.5 trillion.So somehow if you're going to have it deficit neutral you've got to pay for all that $2.5 trillion. And if you're going to have -- be as progressive as the current code is, you're going to have to somehow change deductions and put in a bracket and do a lot of things. They're going to really shift that.I am very skeptical they're going to make those changes.DICKERSON: And also you're doing -- you're fixing the deficit impacts of the plan, which means you don't have any money from growth to pay for the underlying deficit and debt issues, which they have talked about in the past.WALTER: Yes.DICKERSON: Amy, let me -- giving the numbers that Ezra just talked about, this -- the president campaigned for the -- for the forgotten man, the little guy.WALTER: Yes.DICKERSON: How do you think that plays out when the numbers are disparate and when the political -- obviously the Democrats are making this case about -- that it's basically just going to the top.WALTER: I think there are a couple of challenges Republicans have. The first is, as we've seen with health care, being the opposition party, it was very easy to craft a message on health care. When you're the party in charge and actually have to pass something, where there's give and takes, where you're going to have to put this coalition together, it's much more difficult. I think tax reform is going to fit in that same boat. It is something that is much more unifying for Republicans, but they still run up against -- and I think Ben's exactly right on the issue of the state and local tax issue, as well as other issues that are going to come up as they're putting this framework together.The second is that this tax debate, much like health care, is being driven by the clock and the calendar more so than by deeper policy arguments. You talk to Republicans who are very upset they didn't get health care through. They say, we have to get tax reform done. It's almost a non-issue about what it look like, as much as, we've got to get this done because if we go into 2018 without a tax cut, without anything to tell our constituents we're going to get killed in the mid-term elections, and I think that's a great way to make policy is being worried about running out of time for budget reconciliation, running out of time before a mid-term election.DICKERSON: Ben, in 1986, tax reform took two years, so --DOMENECH: Yes, they are definitely rushing, I think, to get this done with the mind on what's going to happen in 2018. One of the things that's not going to happen in 2018 obviously is that Bob Corker is not going to be running for re-election. I think that -- that --DICKERSON: The senator from (INAUDIBLE) from Tennessee.DOMENECH: I think that story is actually one of the most significant stories to happen this past week, which had a lot of different significant stories because it's step one, I think, of a wave of retirements, people deciding not to run for re-election within the '18 and '20 cycle. There's a number of Republican senators who have had enormous influence over that conference for a long time, but they're now all in their 80s and they're approaching that point where they that have to decide whether they want to stick around in Washington or not. I think the fractiousness of debates like these on health care and on taxes increases the likelihood that they exit.WALTER: Yes, and if they don't pass a tax cut, this is what a lot of Republicans are worried about on the House side, that you are going to see a wave of retirements come January, February. Folks said, we were here for a year, we had total control, we didn't get stuff done, I don't know if I want to be here for longer. That is a very, very big concern.DICKERSON: And then you had an Alabama primary this week, Ezra, where some of these issues were already playing out, the Republican primary.KLEIN: Right. And -- and the primary looks like it's only going to become more fractious. If Roy Moore does win that, that's a real problem for Mitch McConnell.I do just want to say one thing about the tax effort, which is, there was a deal here. There was a -- I was talking to a top Democratic staffer for the kind of Democrat they need to get in the Senate, and could get. And he said, look, we could have done corporate inpatriation (ph) for infrastructure, middle class tax cuts and corporate tax reform and Democrats would have helped on that. They would have been involved in that.Think about the Trump administration and this Republican Party. They don't try. They could try to get bipartisan support and then go for the partisan bill if that fails, but they don't try at the front end. And so this is going to be a much more fractious plan. And by the end it, if it doesn't go well, Democrats are not going to need to come on board. And that's a political mistake they're making.DOMENECH: But consider why Roy Moore is even the nominee. Moore is the nominee because Mitch McConnell decides that Mo Brooks, a conservative, you know, congressman in the Ted Cruz (INAUDIBLE), was also a critic of McConnell, was someone who needed -- who needed to be destroyed in the primary. He parachuted in millions of dollars getting rid of this conservative candidate thinking that Moore would be an easy candidate for Luther Strange to beat. As it turned out, Strange was too, you know, conflicted given his relationship to the governor of Alabama and the appointment that happened. That ended up dragging him down. And that's why you end up with someone like Moore instead of potentially a more traditional but problematic conservative from McConnell's perspective.DICKERSON: All right, we're going to have to end it there because Bob Schieffer is here and he'll take the chair away from you (ph). He's coming up right next. So, stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)DICKERSON: And we're back with the one and only Bob Schieffer. He is a CBS News political contributor and the author of a new book ""Overload: Finding the Truth in Today's Deluge of News.""Welcome back, Bob.BOB SCHIEFFER, CBS NEWS POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you.DICKERSON: So you set out with this book to figure out whether we are better informed or just overloaded. You talked to reporters and news editors. And so where did you come out at the end of this?SCHIEFFER: We're overwhelmed. We've never been through anything quite like this, probably since the invention of the printing press.You know, we talk about the invention of the printing press, how it improved literacy, it caused the reformation, the counter reformation. But there was also 30 years of religious wars that followed the printing press. And it took about three decades for the world to finally reach equilibrium.We're at the very beginning of what's going on right now in -- in this digital age that has taken the place of print. It's affected nothing more than the way we get the news and our politics.Let me just give you one little stat here, John. In 2004, one reporter in eight lived in New York, Washington or Los Angeles. That number is now down to one in five live in those three places.In a lot of parts of the country right now, it's not a question of bias news or too much news, it's a question of no news. Sixty-two percent of people are now getting their news from social media, from FaceBook. And while those are great vehicles, they don't exactly follow the same standards that we did in the mainstream media and still do.DICKERSON: Right.SCHIEFFER: And that is, we don't print or broadcast something unless we check it out and find out if it's true.So there's all this news out there right now. You don't know who to believe. Is it true. Is it not true. And that's what we're sorting our way through right now.DICKERSON: And so the new medium is shakier in terms of standard and also fewer reporters out in the real part of the country. In other words, everybody's in their bubble now.SCHIEFFER: Yes. And we're no longer basing our opinions on the same data. If you listen to one channel, you get one set of facts. If you listen to another channel or read another publication, you get another set of facts. So what's different now is we're basing our opinion on different data. It's not the common data that in the old, more orderly days of what I call the gatekeeper era, where you had three television stations and one newspaper in every town. Maybe you didn't agree with the editorial policy, but you took pretty much for granted that what was on the front page or what Walter Cronkite said was true, that he had gone to the trouble of checking it out. Now there's 700 channels out there. We're bombarded with so much information, we simply cannot process.DICKERSON: And so it's -- the facts are more in question. And also you -- you have a great quote at the start of the book about attention span. I mean that's another huge challenge of our current moment.SCHIEFFER: Well, it certainly is. I mean when we've gone to 30- second commercials on television, that -- that has reduced our attention span. It's also reduced our patience. It's also made us less patient with things. It's made us, I think, ruder and a different kind of society.You know, we talked -- you and I have talked about this, about the dialogue in the 2016 campaign and how crude and rude it was. I think a lot of that has to do with social media because the dialogue in politics this year was much like the thread on a blog post. Somebody posts a blog and then somebody else says, no, that's stupid. And then somebody else says, no, you're stupid. And then it's blankety-blank stupid. We go from the inane to the profane. But I'm not sure that we have improved our knowledge.DICKERSON: What can we do in the press -- if you're giving advice to a young journalists, what's your advice right now about how to navigate all of this?SCHIEFFER: Well, I think you have to remember what the role of journalists is, and that is basically, we are not the politician. The politician's job is to deliver a message. Our job is simply to check it out and find out if it's true or if it's false and then report the results of that. We're not here to run the government. We're not here to run politics. We're here to report on the people who are involved in politics and government.And if we do that right, we have performed a service that is crucial to democracy as the right to vote. We can't have a democracy like we have unless citizens have access to independently gathered information that they can compare with the government's version of events. And when they do that, we've done our job.DICKERSON: So we have about 30 second left. What then is the consumer's job here in looking at this whole swarms? Is there something they can do better?SCHIEFFER: Buyer beware. Trust the sources. Depend not on one source, but as many source as you can to come to your own conclusions about what's going on here.DICKERSON: All right, our trusted source, Bob Schieffer. Thanks very much, Bob.SCHIEFFER: Thank you, John.DICKERSON: Congratulations on the book.And we'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)DICKERSON: With the news of the week by subscribing to the FACE THE NATION diary podcast.

He plans to carry a 2018 statewide ballot initiative to address the shortage of affordable housing in California.Since 2013, for instance, Chiang voted to grant 9 percent tax breaks to three of Domus Development’s projects: Curtis Park Court, a senior community near Sacramento City College, as well as Sutter Place in Carmichael and Anchor Village in Stockton.SIGN UPHelp us deliver journalism that makes a difference in our community.Our journalism takes a lot of time, effort, and hard work to produce. If you read and enjoy our journalism, please consider subscribing today.SUBSCRIBE TODAYBeginning that year, the company’s top brass and its tax-credit equity syndicator contributed nearly $40,000 to Chiang’s campaign committees, including $7,500 toward his 2018 run for California governor.Last year, he featured Curtis Park Court and a Domus representative in a 4 1/2-minute video posted to his government website under the title “Treasurer Tackles California’s Affordable Housing Crisis.”A Chiang campaign spokeswoman declined to make him available for an interview. But in a prepared statement, Chiang said the contributions have no influence over his decisions.“As someone who has spent a career exposing billions in government waste and corruption, protecting the integrity of my office is paramount to me,” he said. “Decisions by my office about where to invest public dollars are driven largely by mathematical formulas tied to getting taxpayers the most bang for their buck. The evaluation and scoring are done by professional staff who have nothing to do with or any knowledge as to who supports my campaigns.”Treasurer’s Office officials stressed that the affordable housing firms included in The Bee’s tally began working with California before Chiang assumed his first statewide post, state controller, in 2007. But campaign finance records show they have been far more generous to Chiang than others who have served as treasurer or controller.Chiang supported the perks to Domus through the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee, whose three voting members administer federal and state low-income housing tax credits. The bonds were green-lighted by the three-member California Debt Limit Allocation Committee, a board that like the other includes voting representatives for the treasurer, controller and governor.Chiang said he does not have a policy of screening certain tax and bond applicants for campaign contributions, arguing that “everyday citizens who don’t have country club memberships have to be able to raise money to be competitive.”Such activities normally don’t run afoul of the law unless there is an explicit agreement or understanding that it was made as a quid pro quo for an official action, said Ken Gross, a campaign finance expert in Washington.“Beyond that, it’s a political decision for the electorate,” Gross said.Chiang is campaigning on a platform of fiscal responsibility and empowering the public to hold government officials accountable. Experts said the activity could undercut his credibility with voters and give ammunition to his better-known Democratic opponents. Among those Chiang is running alongside are former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom.“He’s in this weird place where he says ‘I know I don’t have the star wattage of my opponents, ‘but you can trust me with the (state’s) checkbook,’ ” said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School and president of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission.Donations and votes in close succession, she said, can raise questions and potentially some red flags. “The question becomes, was the donation given for a vote, or to say ‘thank you’ for a vote?” Levinson asked.Still, she laid much of the blame on a campaign finance system that allows such examples to proliferate in politics.“People give to get something,” Levinson said. “And you give to those in power, and to those with power over your destiny.”‘We sharpened our pencils’The types of tax perks Chiang supported for firms such as Domus, the developer of Curtis Park Court, are difficult to obtain.After a June 2010 vote granting credits to Domus’s La Valentina on 12th Street in Alkali Flats, Meea Kang, then president of the development company, told The Bee that Domus tried to secure them the previous year, but lost out “because they’re so competitive.”“We sharpened our pencils, applied again, and were successful,” Kang said at the time.Maurice Ramirez, Domus’ new president, said in an interview that the company never appealed to Chiang “to ask him to vote in favor a project.”“I get it,” he said of the implication, “but in terms of trying to connect donations to the selection of projects – that’s definitely not the case.”The treasurer’s video featuring Domus and Kang includes clips of Chiang sitting at a desk talking about his role in improving the scarcity of affordable housing.“I sit on three of the state’s four housing authorities,” he says in the video. “I chair the two state housing authorities that did the first rewrite of affordable housing regulations in over a decade. We’ve had in the early months of this year, after last year’s rewrites, an increase by about 72 percent of affordable housing construction in California.”The Treasurer’s Office paid a vendor $4,968.69 to produce the video, a Chiang spokesman said.Ramirez said he doesn’t think appearing in Chiang’s video helps Domus. “For us, it’s nice. But I am not sure that it does us any great benefit,” he said.Marc Lifsher, a spokesman for Chiang, said the purpose of the videos is to help promote the programs administered by the Treasurer’s Office, not Chiang.‘1,000 new affordable homes’Chiang received campaign contributions from other companies for which he voted to approve tax breaks.Caleb J. Roope, president and chief executive of The Pacific Companies, develops low-income housing through its subsidiary, Pacific West Communities, and received tax breaks from the Tax Credit Allocation Committee.The Bee determined that Chiang voted to approve the vast majority of Pacific West Communities’ more than six dozen applications beginning in 2007.His votes helped steer more than $100 million in state and nearly $60 million in federal tax credits to Roope and Pacific West Communities projects. The company made its first contribution in 2009. To date, it has given $37,000 to Chiang, including the maximum $28,200 for governor late last year.In an October 2015 news release from the Treasurer’s Office, Roope is quoted crediting Chiang with providing more incentives to developers to build more affordable housing.“With the implementation of his administration’s regulatory reforms, our company can immediately produce over 1,000 new affordable homes that otherwise would not have been possible,” Roope said in the release.Roope, a Republican who lives in Idaho, told The Bee his company never gave money to Chiang to win his backing on projects. Roope said he’s watched the treasurer speak, and likes his stances on housing and his “fiscal discipline.”“The policies matter and I want to support somebody who cares about housing,” he said.‘He would make a wonderful governor’Chiang supported a series of multimillion dollar tax breaks and tens of millions in bonds for Affirmed Housing Group projects beginning in 2007, when he was state controller.Starting the year before, Affirmed and its management company, Solari Enterprises, cut checks to Chiang’s campaigns totaling nearly $40,000, sponsoring or co-sponsoring fundraisers in June 2016, October 2014 and October 2013, when it reported an event at Bertrand at Mister A’s, an upscale restaurant whose wraparound balcony offers sweeping views of San Diego’s skyline.Contributions came shortly before and after votes. After Chiang supported Affirmed tax credits on May 18, 2016 and June 8, 2016, he received contributions from the firm on June 10 and June 16 of the same year.Two years before, he voted for tax credits for the company on Nov. 12, 2014 and Dec. 10, 2014. Checks came in just ahead on Oct. 8, 2014.In September 2013, Chiang and the debt limit committee backed a bond for Affirmed. Contributions flowed to his campaign on Oct. 7 and Oct. 22 of that year.The company and Solari combined to contribute to Chiang, giving $12,500 for his campaign for governor as recently as June 29.Two days later, Chiang toured Affirmed’s affordable housing project: Cypress Apartments in San Diego’s East Village. In June 2015, Chiang voted to approve $1.27 million in federal credits annually for a decade for Cypress.Jim Silverwood, president and chief executive of Affirmed Housing, was quoted lauding Chiang in a June 22 news release issued by his gubernatorial campaign.Chiang reached out to Affirmed to schedule the campaign stop at Cypress, Silverwood said in an interview. He said the project was built to serve the city’s spiraling homeless population. Affirmed never received preferential treatment from the Treasurer’s Office under Chiang, Silverwood said. “Any contributions that might be made around any time of year are totally coincidental,” he said.Silverwood called Chiang a “great guy,” and said he deeply understands affordable housing and smart-growth concepts.“He would make a wonderful governor,” he said.‘I wanted to get a first-hand view’Chiang is not the first treasurer to face questions about benefiting those who financed their political ambitions.Former Treasurer Matt Fong collected more than $177,000 from contributors who had a range of business before his office, the San Francisco Chronicle reported during his 1998 campaign for U.S. Senate. Fong used the money from developers, contractors and lawyers – some with pending tax credit applications such as the few The Bee reviewed in Chiang’s case – to build out his campaign early on.Democrats Jesse Unruh and Kathleen Brown and Republican Tom Hayes, who all held the office before Fong, raised much of their contributions from what the newspaper described as a “narrow and specialized constituency” of the Treasurer’s Office.Other donors appearing in taxpayer-funded promotional materials successfully sought help from Chiang, the Bee analysis found.Blue Line Transfer, a solid waste and recycling company in South San Francisco, contributed to Chiang – $1,000 in 2008, $1,500 in 2014 and $2,000 for governor this year.Efforts to help Blue Line and related companies began in 2007. Chiang’s California Pollution Control Financing Authority authorized $10.2 million in bonds for Blue Line in 2012. That was extended to $17.6 million in 2014; and then $22.7 million the next year.Blue Line also received a sales tax exclusion from the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority in 2013. Company officials did not return calls seeking comment.Chiang included Blue Line in a news release and 6-minute video last year spotlighting Douglas Button, the president and chief executive, as well as himself, wearing a neon yellow safety vest.“Blue Line is actually at the very front of creating biogas using waste products to create greater environmental results ...” Chiang says in the video. “I wanted to get a first-hand view of what was transpiring here, and it’s very, very exciting.”

It’s all so clear now,” he added.After the video started to go viral in ISIS cave networks and strongholds, thousands of terrorists began pouring out into the streets of Mayadin, giving one another spontaneous group hugs, destroying their weapons, and planting trees and flowers in an attempt to begin rebuilding the Middle East into a utopian wonderland.According to reports, al-Baghdadi further confirmed that a recent advertisement in which Kendall Jenner offered a group of riot police a Pepsi was also influential in his decision to immediately cease their murderous reign of terror and lead ISIS down a path of peace.TAGS

Martina White issued a statement in response to an hour-long protest outside an officer’s Bustleton home.“Black Lives Matter activists invaded a residential neighborhood without a permit, utilized bullhorns to spew profanity and threatened an endless occupation of that neighborhood until their demands are met.”— State Rep. Martina WhiteState Rep. Martina White (170th dist.) condemned Black Lives Matter for showing up last week outside the Bustleton home of Philadelphia Police Officer Ryan Pownall.Pownall, assigned to the 15th Police District, was transporting a father and two children to the Special Victims Unit on June 8 when he saw David Jones allegedly driving recklessly on a dirt bike — which are prohibited on public streets — in Feltonville.Pownall attempted to frisk Jones, who allegedly had a loaded handgun in his waistband. During a physical struggle, Pownall shot Jones, who died at a hospital 20 minutes later.The state attorney general’s office is investigating.“Activists from Black Lives Matter took over a quiet residential Philadelphia neighborhood to aim their vitriol at the home and family of Officer Pownall. They called him a murderer in an attempt to influence public opinion in a sensitive matter that is still under investigation by both the Police Department and the attorney general’s office,” White said in a statement.The protest lasted about an hour.There were about 10 supporters of Black Lives Matter, including Asa Khalif, who shouted into a bullhorn, and a foul-mouthed videographer. They carried wanted signs featuring Pownall’s picture.Neighbors and about three dozen police officers were on the scene, according to a video of the protest.“Black Lives Matter activists invaded a residential neighborhood without a permit, utilized bullhorns to spew profanity and threatened an endless occupation of that neighborhood until their demands are met,” White said. “This same unlawful protest also required a contingent of police officers who would otherwise be working to preserve safety across our city to instead protect the residents of this neighborhood, including the officer and his family.“It is shocking to me that Police Commissioner Richard Ross and Mayor Jim Kenney allowed this illegal occupation to go on for hours without taking any action to enforce the law, and I question whether the police department has been ordered to stand down when it comes to addressing this Black Lives Matter action.”In a Facebook posting of a story on White’s comments, Khalif wrote, “Go to hell!!”White is the sponsor of House Bill 27, which would delay releasing the names of officers involved in shootings until 30 days have passed, or until the investigation is concluded, whichever is completed sooner. She said this would provide the necessary balance between the need for public transparency and the time to conduct a professional and thorough investigation.House Bill 27 has passed the House and awaits action in the Senate.More than 2,000 local residents have signed a petition calling on Gov. Tom Wolf to sign the legislation into law if it arrives on his desk.The same legislation was passed by both the House and Senate in 2016, but vetoed by Wolf. ••

Tommy Thompson. He said the tour gives Walker a chance to win over state lawmakers outside of the Milwaukee area to try and get their support for a $3 billion tax incentive bill the Legislature must pass to seal the deal.While lawmakers have welcomed the prospect of new jobs in the state, some have been cautious of getting too excited before going over the proposed bill, which has yet to be released, with a fine-toothed comb.When a reporter asked Walker why Foxconn left Pennsylvania and why they wouldn't do the same to Wisconsin, Walker said the difference is ""simple.""""Pennsylvania changed governors.

The black market already is here.“Organized crime gangs are buying hundreds or thousands of gallons of diesel fuel, and reselling them to make an untraceable profit,” NPR reported in 2014. Such crime is prevalent, Glendale police Officer Dan Suttles told the network.In April 2012, then-Los Angeles Controller Wendy Gruel reported $7 million in missing city gasoline. That led a reader to contact the police about a city gardener, who later was arrested for allegedly selling thousands of dollars of city-owned gasoline on the black market, the Los Angeles Times reported.SIGN UPHelp us deliver journalism that makes a difference in our community.Our journalism takes a lot of time, effort, and hard work to produce.

An LAO report noted that in the two months before the tax increase took effect, tobacco tax revenue ran 24 percent and 37 percent above 2016 levels.But the extra revenue was quickly snuffed out. The May 2017 cigarette tax revenues dropped 64 percent from May 2016.

That's a problem — and it needs to change.Published onSign in to follow this author56th Governor of New York StateBy Governor Andrew M. Cuomo and Jostein Solheim , CEO of Ben & Jerry’sEmployers can often be hesitant to hire someone with a criminal conviction. Unsubstantiated rumors of increased violence in the workplace, theft, or incompetence often stand in the way of giving someone with a record a chance. Yet employers that do hire formerly incarcerated individuals end up reaping the benefits: loyal employees with higher retention rates, tax benefits, and increased economic mobility for their staff.70 million Americans have a criminal record—that’s 1 in 3 adults. There are currently 2.3 million people behind bars in this country, 95 percent of whom will reenter our communities. 640,000 people are released from prison each year, creating a huge untapped workforce available to fill jobs. Yet, in New York State, 53 percent of people on parole have yet to find a job. Employers are often uncomfortable hiring people who have been convicted of a crime—one study found that, in New York City, a criminal record reduced the likelihood of a callback or job offer by nearly 50 percent.This is a problem. Joblessness is the number one predictor of recidivism—the less likely it is for a formerly incarcerated person to find a job, the more likely it is that they end up back in prison, with all the costs associated with incarceration, including a price tag of $60,000 per inmate per year in New York. These barriers to reentry have a negative trickle effect not only on the lives of these individuals, preventing them from providing for themselves and their families, but on society as a whole. Studies have shown that excluding formerly incarcerated individuals from the workforce results in a GDP loss of $78-87 billion thanks to lost tax revenue, and that if states can reduce recidivism rates by just 10 percent, they could save an average of $635 million annually.That’s why my administration has launched the Work for Success Pledge —an online pledge in which companies, like Ben and Jerry’s or VICE Media, whose VICE Apprenticeship Program hires and trains formerly incarcerated people for production, editorial and creative jobs at the company, commit to consider hiring qualified candidates with criminal convictions. New York is the first state in the nation to develop such a pledge. So far, 80 companies have signed on and shown their commitment to hiring those with a criminal conviction—but we need more to pledge their support! It just makes good business sense.Companies like Ben & Jerry’s recognize that hiring formerly incarcerated individuals and working with suppliers that do the same is important for our business, our culture, and our bottom line. Studies have shown that those with a criminal conviction can often make the best employees—they are retained at higher rates than those with no criminal record, saving companies costs associated with hiring and training, which can be as much as $4,000 per employee. Additionally, companies that hire people with criminal convictions are eligible for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC), which provides a maximum tax credit of $2,400 per employee.Formerly incarcerated individuals are often the most motivated at work. A study of army enlistees found that enlistees with felony records were 33 percent more likely to be promoted to sergeant than those with no conviction history, a testament to their dedication and motivation.Ben & Jerry’s is incredibly proud of our long relationship with the Greyston Bakery in Yonkers. It was Ben who heard about the bakery and came up with one of our most successful flavors, Chocolate Fudge Brownie, specifically to allow our company to work with and expand the impact of the baker which, through its open hiring process, has helped thousands of returning citizens and their families rebuild their lives and their dignity. It is in part because of our long relationship with the Greyston Bakery that we’ve made changes to our hiring and recruiting process so that people are judged by their skill and qualifications, not the mistakes of the past. There is no doubt, with 1 in 3 Americans having been convicted of a crime, if we were to use criminal conviction as screen for recruiting, we would be leaving very qualified candidates out of our process. That’s just a bad business decision.Across New York, the Cuomo administration has long been dedicated to providing employment for those with criminal convictions. In 2012, we launched the Work for Success Program , which matches qualified and appropriately trained job applicants with criminal convictions to open job listings. In the last five years, we have placed more than 18,000 people in jobs, and each new company that signs on to our Work for Success Pledge also commits to listing job openings with the program.In 2015, the Council on Community Reentry and Reintegration took further steps to ensure equity in hiring by setting uniform guidelines that evaluate qualified applicants for state occupational licenses and adopting “fair chance hiring” for New York State agencies, meaning agencies will not ask about a job applicant’s criminal convictions until and unless the agency has interviewed the candidate and is interested in hiring him or her. As a result of Reentry Council efforts in 2016, New York is also the first in the nation to prohibit insurance companies from denying insurance coverage to businesses that hire people with criminal convictions.These are small steps that can make a huge difference. Together, by signing the Work for Success Pledge , businesses have a real opportunity to not only provide a helping hand to those who have been cut off from opportunities, but to also improve our bottom line. New York State is dedicated to creating a true “state of opportunity” for everyone.FollowFollowingUnfollowAndrew Cuomo

PETERSBURG — For nearly two years, the political stench of a sewage crisis has permeated City Hall.The city's dilapidated sewer system has released up to 186 million gallons of waste into Tampa Bay plus local waterways and streets. The crisis started in August 2015 and hasn't stopped. A federal probe ended without criminal charges, but the state investigation is still ongoing. The city also faces an $810,000 fine on top of the tens of millions needed to fix the problems.The blowback has also fired up the political rhetoric in this summer's mayoral election.SUNSHINE CITY SHOWDOWN: Keep up with the Tampa Bay Times coverage of the St. Petersburg mayoral race.FOR MORE COVERAGE: Click here to read all the Times coverage of the mayor's race.Former mayor Rick Baker rarely misses a chance to wedge the city's sewage woes into any stump speech or campaign statement.Incumbent Mayor Rick Kriseman, who has spent months wading through the mess, has found others to blame: Baker and his predecessor, former mayor Bill Foster.The current mayor has said both former mayors failed to adequately maintain the sewer system in the 14 years before he took office. Kriseman said he inherited their mess.So how do their records compare? Which mayor spent the most on sewers, and which mayor spilled the most sewage?The Tampa Bay Times decided to figure that out.Who spilled the most?One question has a clear answer: Under the Kriseman administration, the city says it has discharged nearly 186 million gallons of sewage over the last two summers. That dwarfs the 1.5 million gallons spilled over the eight years Baker spent in office from 2001-10.That means Kriseman is responsible for roughly 124 times as much sewage dumped as Baker.Kriseman acknowledged the sewage gap between his administration and the Baker administration. But, he said, Baker served during several dry years.""Clearly, there is no comparison in the numbers,"" Kriseman said. ""But we also had wet weather events that he did not experience. He went through significant periods of drought during his time as mayor.""When you don't have significant rain events, and you're still having spills, you still need to take a look at your system.""However, there were significant rain events during Baker's tenure as mayor, including the 2004 storm season when four hurricanes struck Florida (but missed the Tampa Bay area). And at least one-seventh of his discharge totals were due to a contractor error at the Southwest plant in 2002.Baker scoffed at Kriseman's position, saying the mayor's decision to move forward with the 2015 closure of the waterfront Albert Whitted sewage plant was behind much of Kriseman's troubles. The decision to close one of St. Petersburg's four sewage plants was actually made by a majority of the City Council in 2011, but when it was executed in 2015 it left the city with less capacity.Said Baker: ""He made a huge mistake and he has a dismal record and he's trying to do anything he can to push blame away from himself.""Who spent the most?The Times also wanted to figure out how much had been spent by each mayor on the city's sewer system — not what was budgeted, but what was actually spent.Instead of relying on budgets, the newspaper asked the city to provide actual expenditures including work done on sewage plants and pipes, lift stations and manholes.Both mayors spent lots of money during some years, not so much on others.Baker, who came into office in 2001 a few years after massive spills in the late 1990s, spent most of his tenure complying with a consent order from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. The city was released from the order in 2009.""We invested everything that was recommended to me by either my staff or FDEP under the consent order to get the system to the point where we didn't have spills,"" Baker said. ""It was absolutely a success, what we did.""The city spend the first few years studying the most efficient way to fix the system, Baker said, then did it.The highest year of sewer spending under Baker was 2005 when the city spent $38.5 million in inflation-adjusted dollars. By the end of his second term, when the city was free of state oversight, spending was less than $2 million a year.Kriseman said the Baker administration didn't spend enough to keep the system ahead of the natural curve of deteriorating pipes.""He had a consent order that had to be followed,"" Kriseman said. ""Logic would seem to say, what was spent was enough to satisfy the consent order.""But if it had been enough to bring the system up to future needs, we wouldn't have dealt with issues we dealt with.""Kriseman's sewer spending started out low, with just about $3.5 million in 2014, a budget year he shared with Foster. City spending under his tenure didn't ramp up until the spills began in 2015.Now, the city is in the midst of a $304 million sewer system fix, much of which is mandated by another pending state consent order. The city has spent $57 million so far this year — a high for both the Baker and Kriseman years.To blame or not to blame?Kriseman points to that spending as evidence that he is investing enough to keep the city's sewers operating safely for years to come. And, the mayor said, he wants to make clear that he's not interested in past mistakes, just fixing the current problems.""This is not a blame game, we don't have time to place blame,"" he said. ""We're trying to make progress.""Baker said Kriseman's desire to not place blame for the problem shows that he's not taking responsibility for his administration's mistakes:""This attitude reflects Kriseman's leadership style — spend two years blaming the weather, city employees and past administrations, never take responsibility for closing Albert Whitted in 2015 and dumping 200 million gallons of sewage and now crying foul when he's held accountable.""Contact Charlie Frago at [email protected] or (727)893-8459.

The effort ultimately failed tonight by a vote of 49 to 51. “Throughout this entire process, we have witnessed everything that’s wrong with Washington. The Senate had a real opportunity to dismantle the most damaging parts of Obamacare. As Republicans have railed against the failures of Obamacare for the last seven years, Democrats have failed to acknowledge any shortcomings of Obamacare and refused to try to fix a broken system.“Now, due to an unworkable budget process and politicians who put their political self-interests ahead of national interest, Obamacare remains the law of the land. This means that the poorest among us will continue to be fined because they can’t afford Obamacare. This means more than 300,000 Georgians below the poverty line will still not have access to the insurance Obamacare promised. Additionally, this means the Medicaid expansion will continue as an open-ended government program that cannot be sustained.“The American people should be outraged and should demand real change now. It is extremely important that we get this fixed. We have to make sure people have access to affordable health care, which they don’t under Obamacare. We have got to work to reduce premiums, which have skyrocketed and priced people out of the market. We have got to put Medicaid on a sustainable path and make sure preexisting conditions continue to be covered. Those are the big objectives and nothing has changed. Now, we have got to come together and get this done for the American people.”###Senator Perdue is the only Fortune 500 CEO in Congress and is serving his first term in the United States Senate, where he represents Georgia on the Armed Services, Banking, Budget, and Agriculture Committees.

Scott Walker wants state taxpayers to dole out up to $250 million annually in incentives to Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn to lure a manufacturing plant to Wisconsin that he claims will generate $181 million in tax revenue.Think about that. Gov. Walker proposes we pay about $70 million more a year in incentives to a foreign corporation than will flow back to our state coffers. Does that sound like a good deal to you?And this is just one detail that requires us to be wary about what is being described by proponents as the largest job announcement in Wisconsin history.There are plenty more.The actors involved in this deal, negotiated in secret, have the kind of track record that inspires suspicion, not trust.Foxconn has a long history of overpromising and under delivering on their claims of investments and job creation. For example, Pennsylvania is still waiting on hundreds of promised jobs created at a $30 million facility announced in 2013 that has yet to materialize.Are they really preparing to invest such huge sums in Wisconsin and create well paying jobs when they are lowering costs in factories in China by replacing workers making less than $4 per hour with robots?According to reports, in this year alone Foxconn has announced more in commitments for capital spending than their parent company has made in the last nearly quarter century.It certainly seem to be a stroke of luck that they found our Gov. Walker in full re-election mode, desperate to distract from his subpar jobs record, including a 2009 promise to create 250,000 jobs in four years that remains unfulfilled in 2017.Now the same administration whose economic development agency has bungled keeping track of its own funds, given state dollars to companies outsourcing Wisconsin jobs and failed to recover money given out for jobs not created is asking us to trust them to hold accountable a massive international corporation in a $3 billion deal.Not a comforting thought.In this situation any rational, objective person would demand due diligence and straight answers before giving this proposal their blessing.Wisconsinites are being asked to contribute massive resources that could otherwise be invested repaying funds taken from our K-12 public schools on Gov. Walker’s watch, fixing crumbling roads and bridges across our state, funding job training for workers to fill the jobs that already exist, or even helping the borrowers with student loan debt who invested in themselves.With so much of our money at stake, we ought to have iron clad assurances that those of us who are being asked to pay for Foxconn will be working at the jobs being promised. Wisconsin taxpayers shouldn’t have to pay to put people from Illinois or even other countries to work.There has been much talk about the wages of potential employees, with deal proponents touting “average salaries” over $50,000 per year. But averages can be massively skewed by huge executive salaries that more than make up for the majority of workers earning substantially less. Why have they not instead disclosed the median salary, the number that half of the workers will earn more than and half will earn less than?And what about assurances on working conditions, health care and other benefits from an employer that has, shall we say, a less than stellar reputation in this area?As one expert noted of Foxconn, when negotiating incentives, “They extract everything they can.” Due diligence is essential, because it looks like that is just what they are preparing to do to Wisconsin.# # #Scot Ross has served as Executive Director of One Wisconsin Now & the Institute since 2007.Recent PostsOne Wisconsin Now & the Institute staff begin every morning with an intense discussion about how we’re going to make and break news that day.

Breitbart News reported that Carlson said that AR-15s are not needed to “hunt or kill deer” and suggested they only serve to enable terrorists to carry out their attacks with greater efficiency. She quoted a December 2015 poll showing majority support for an “assault weapons” ban and said, “I’m with the majority today, taking a stand.”Interestingly, when confronted by Second Amendment supporters on Twitter, Carlson doubled down on her pro-ban stance, claiming that “the fact that you’re even using the Second Amendment as an argument against banning assault weapons shows me you’re ignorant. Don’t you know the 2nd Amendment was written before guns were even invented?”Asked to comment on her tweets, Carlson told Breitbart News that “at one point, I even asked myself what was the use of trying to prove why assault rifles are bad to these people when they clearly don’t possess the most fundamental knowledge of history? I felt like I was trying to teach nuclear physics to someone who’s illiterate. I mean, we have Google and the Internet today. How hard was it to Google ‘the 2nd Amendment of the Constitution of the United States?’ I mean, really.”“And what worried me even more,” she continued, “was the fact that it seemed like every single person that replied to my tweet was under the impression that they were right and I was wrong. So, I’m sitting there, thinking, ‘Ooookaaay, someone obviously wasn’t paying attention during history class – a lot of someones, apparently – hmm, they must have been distracted by thinking about how they were off emptying 30 rounds into some innocent animal.’”Carlson also added, “I mean, I know the education in our country isn’t the best in the world, but I figured we’d at least be able to each our kids the basics like math and history. But, I guess I was wrong. What’s the next thing I’m going to hear, that we somehow went to the Moon and that Elvis Presley is dead? Come on, I’m not buying it.”“Like, I can understand about the Second Amendment and maybe something else that happened way, way back, but the King being dead? I really don’t know who would believe that. Just last night I saw him on YouTube. You know YouTube? He was performing in Vegas and there were thousands of bearded and longhaired men in the audience, so it must have been a beard convention or something. I swear, sometimes I don’t believe how stupid Americans can be,” she said.Facebook

The amendment, introduced with Congressman John Faso (NY-19), would require New York State to take over the county portion of Medicaid by 2020 and would provide the largest property tax reduction ever to Western New York.“This was a long fought battle against the injustice in Albany and is a big victory for taxpayers,” said Congressman Collins.Federal law now permits states to share some of their costs with local governments, but New York is the only state that has imposed this level of burden on property taxpayers. Counties currently have no say in how local revenues are spent on Medicaid; they’re simply required to foot part of Albany’s bill. Local state leaders agreed that the inclusion of the amendment is important and welcome news for Western New York residents.""Mandate relief has been talked about in Albany for as long as anyone can remember - it certainly wasn't new when I was talking about it as mayor. It's not a headline-grabbing or attractive issue, so meaningful proposals on mandate relief are generally swept aside. But I can tell you that it's real. It's real for the local governments who deal with tight budgets and it's real for taxpayers who pay some of the highest property taxes in the nation. I applaud Congressman Collins for bringing this issue to the forefront. Ideally, this would have been a serious discussion at the state level, but having failed that, I'm pleased that we could possibly address the crippling burden placed on our local governments as part of larger, federal health care discussions,” said State Senator Ortt.“As a long-time supporter of curbing the costs of Medicaid, which would take a heavy burden off of local governments, I am proud to support Congressman Collins’ amendment. The impact on my assembly district and local taxpayers will be tremendous with estimated tax reductions of 49 percent in Orleans County and 35 percent in Genesee County. It is clear that New York’s outrageous Medicaid spending is one of the driving forces behind property and school tax increases and it is time for government to take that burden off our residents’ backs,” said Assemblyman Steve Hawley.""Western New Yorkers pay some of the highest property taxes in the state. Rep. Collins' amendment fixes this problem and protects upstate taxpayers from Albany’s unfunded mandates. Removing the unfunded county Medicaid mandate is key to reducing local property taxes and growing our economy,” said Assemblyman Ray Walter. ""This amendment is a blessing for upstate families, small businesses, and farms that’ve been crushed by the high taxes and unfunded mandates coming from Albany. The inclusion of this amendment is a win for our towns and villages and I appreciate Rep. Collins efforts to stand up for our taxpayers,” said Assemblyman Joseph Errigo. ""I'm pleased that the Senate has included Rep. Collins's amendment in the healthcare reform bill. This promises real relief for property tax payers in communities like Niagara County, and holds state government accountable to fund their mandates instead of passing on costs to the local level. Americans deserve access to the best healthcare possible, but it shouldn't fall to just homeowners to fund the system,” said Niagara County Legislature Chairman Wm. Keith McNall.""Congressman Collins' Medicaid proposal will provide historic “real” property tax relief for hardworking local taxpayers. Currently over 30 perfect of the Ontario County property tax levy currently goes towards paying for New York's unfunded Medicaid mandate. I look forward to working with Rep. Collins and the members of the Board of Supervisors as we continue our efforts to reduce the burden on hardworking taxpayers in our community,"" said Jack Marren, Chairman of the Ontario County Board of Supervisors.""This is an important step forward in our fight to reduce unfunded mandates and protect local taxpayers. This measure will reduce local property taxes and help ensure that our seniors can afford to stay in their homes,"" said Bob Green, Vice Chairman of the Ontario County Board of Supervisors.“We as a board supported a resolution in support of this measure because protecting property taxpayers is one of our prime concerns. This legislation will reduce an unfunded state mandate and help us deliver real tax relief to local homeowners,” said Eric Gott, Chairman, Livingston County Board of Supervisors. “We appreciate Rep. Collins efforts to relieve the counties of this extraordinary unfunded mandate. This will be a tremendous relief to local county property taxpayers and will allow us to invest in our infrastructure and other county services,” said Raymond Cianfrini, Chairman, Genesee County Legislature. “For years counties in New York have decried the use of property taxes to fund New York State’s expansive Medicaid program. We are optimistic that changes at the federal level can result in real, substantive, positive changes to the bottom line for county property tax payers,” said David B. Callard, Chairman, Orleans County Legislature.The Senate is expected to vote next week on their version of the Obamacare repeal bill. "

['Fake news', 'Islam']	https://politicalmayhem.news/	https://politicalmayhem.news/state-minnesota-just-handed-full-control-muslims-can-take-infidels/	2017/07/03	State Of Minnesota Has Just Handed Over FULL CONTROL To Muslims So They Can Take Down ‘Infidels’ByPrintThere is not a day that goes by that we don’t hear about a Muslim terror attack taking place somewhere in our world, but that hasn’t stopped leftists from defending them at every opportunity. Those of us that criticize the so-called “religion of peace” are subjected to ridicule and even being attacked for our belief of how dangerous Muslims are. In Europe, those that speak out against Islam are being imprisoned for their belief. Courts are actually sentencing people for “Islam anti-blasphemy” laws. While this may be par for the course in Europe right now, it is not the way we roll in America, until now. Minnesota has just established a similar law.Anti-blasphemy laws are a huge victory for Muslims because it ensures their protection and in turn, allows them to continue acting in whatever manner they please all the while marching towards Sharia Law.According to Minneapolis’ local newspaper, the Star-Tribune , the hotline was set up as a way to target Trump supporters, who Muslims believe are the group of people most likely to “harass them.” The Star Tribune reported:The city of Minneapolis has set up a hotline for residents to report hate-crime incidents and other acts of intolerance.The service, operated through the city’s 311 helpline, is aimed to aid targets of any “harassing behaviors motivated by prejudice,” according to a city news release issued on Monday.The announcement comes amid signs of a recent surge of such incidents affecting Muslims and Jews across the country, many of which go unreported. “Since the general election, many of us have experienced, witnessed firsthand or heard of actions of: racism, xenophobia, sexism and bigotry directed at people here and in cities across the United States,” Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city’s website. “In no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated.”The city’s Department of Civil rights along with mayor is leading the charge for this government-enforced fascism, as this new hotline will now encourage citizens to turn in their neighbors for holding opinions deemed forbidden by the state. This hotline flies right in the face of our United States Constitution, where it goes to the heart of denying American citizens their inalienable rights of the First Amendment, which governments CAN NOT DO.Of course, the rabid liberals controlling the city have little regard for the Constitution or the rights of Americans, as they are using their position to establish a soft version of anti-blasphemy laws. “In no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated,” Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city’s website.The Department echoes the unconstitutional sentiments of Minneapolis’ mayor, Betsy Hodges, who went on to blast President Trump, pushing her insane narrative of there being an epidemic of bigotry and hate in our country since he got into office. She stated:“I will not compromise the public safety of the people of Minneapolis to satisfy Trump’s desire to put politics before public safety. Minneapolis is being built and strengthened by people from all over the world and I am grateful for their commitment to our city. I stand with them today and will continue to take that stand as the President-elect prepares to take office.”The idea of an anti-blasphemy hotline in America is pretty absurd, but right up liberal’s alley. Why are they so willing to protect those that would seek to hurt us, don’t they want to protect their loved ones? This is only the beginning of the Democrats plans to take control of our country again, but what they don’t realize is that everyone will end up suffering if we continue to bow to Muslim’s demands.This “anti-blasphemy” hotline is just the start and will only get worse if we allow it. It is very similar to Nazi Germany’s approach in the 1930’s when they started to purge out anyone who was perceived as a threat. Trying to normalize the concept of turning in your neighbor for their opinion is nothing short of chilling and should be looked at as a major threat to our freedom. What do you think?

EDTTHE PRESIDENT: Good to have you all. Hello, Chairman. Great man, right here. Might be another one right there. We have some good ones. We had a wonderful meeting on healthcare, yesterday, you probably know about, and so we’re moving along. Hello, Thomas.Thank you very much for being here to discuss two crucial votes taking place in Congress tomorrow on vital safety and national security legislation.We’re joined by the Chairman of the House Judiciary, Bob Goodlatte, a friend of mine for a long time. Bob is one of the most skilled legislators in Congress — and you didn’t even tell me to say that, Bob, right — (laughter) — and he’s worked with law enforcement to write a series of critical immigration bills that will close the dangerous loopholes exploited by criminals, gang members, drug dealers, killers, terrorists.MS-13 is a prime target. They are bad people. And we’ve gotten many of them out already. You know, we’re pretty much at the 50 percent mark. We’re getting them out as fast as we can get them out, and we’re freeing up towns. We’re actually liberating towns, if you can believe that we have to do that in the United States of America. But we’re doing it, and we’re doing it fast.Also with us today are Congressman Peter King, another friend. Lou Barletta — where’s Lou? Lou, another friend. So you’re running for governor, Lou? Look behind you, Lou. You can make a big announcement — (laughter.) Lou Barletta, an early supporter. Thank you, Lou. And David Young.Tomorrow, the House will vote on the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act. It’s been in the works for a long time. People have wanted it, Bob, for a long time. But we were able to get this process going, and I hope you’re going to be successful. You’ll be successful, tomorrow, with the vote?REPRESENTATIVE GOODLATTE: We will.THE PRESIDENT: Good — which will cut federal grant money to cities that shield dangerous criminal aliens from being turned over to federal law enforcement.The House will also vote on Kate’s Law, named for Kate Steinle, who was killed by an illegal immigrant and who’s been deported five times. This law will enhance criminal penalties for those who repeatedly reenter the country illegally.Countless innocent Americans, including the loved ones of many families in the room — and many of these families are friends of mine — great friends of mine that I got to know over the campaign trail because they fought so hard for this. And they are with us. They’ve had members of their family killed by illegal immigrants and, really, people with multiple — in some cases, multiple deportations.I’m especially honored to be here with so many courageous families whom I did get to know so well over the past period of time. You know, here’s one right over here. Jamiel — a great, great man with a great son — great son, great family.You lost the people that you love because our government refused to enforce our nation’s immigration laws. And that’s even the existing immigration laws, without new laws. That’s existing immigration laws.For years, the pundits, journalists, politicians in Washington refused to hear your voices, but on Election Day, 2016, your voices were heard all across the entire world. Right? You better believe it. Nobody died in vain, I can tell you.Chairman Goodlatte has produced a package of truly key immigration enforcement bills. We’ve been waiting for these for a long time, and I want to thank you, Chairman, for doing that. Great job. And it’s just perfect.This package includes the Davis-Oliver Act, whose passage I called for nearly a year ago at my inauguration speech and immigration speech — both — the immigration speech taking place in Phoenix, Arizona. The Davis-Oliver Act was named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, who were gunned down in the line of duty by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. And everybody knew this person was big, big trouble, and they begged law enforcement to get him out. And they were unable to do that.Their incredibly brave widows honored — and they’re here with us, by the way — we’re honoring them today. And it’s honored — where are you please? The widow — where is — they’re here someplace. In the back of the room? Thank you, everybody. Thank you.We’re privileged to be joined by Melissa. Melissa —MS. OLIVER: Right here.THE PRESIDENT: That’s what I thought. Hello, Melissa. (Laughter.) Melissa Oliver. And I just want to say that your father was a true hero — and you know that — and a great gentleman, and we miss him. You miss him. We miss him.We’re calling on all members of Congress to honor grieving American families by passing these lifesaving measures in the House, in the Senate, and then sending them to my desk for a very rapid signature. I promise you, it will be done quickly. You don’t have to wait the mandatory period. It will be very quick, Melissa, in honor of your father and others, okay? And in honor of Jamiel.MR. SHAW: Thank you.THE PRESIDENT: It’s time to support our police, to protect our families, and to save American lives. And also to start getting smart.So with that, I’d like to ask each of the families invited, and some of the folks that I know that — and some I’ve gotten to know so well. I’d like to start with Jamiel, to tell just a quick story about how great your son was, perhaps what happened, so that other people can learn by it. I mean, your son was an incredible young man, incredible student and athlete. Tell us about your son, Jamiel.END

The Congressional Budget Office projects an additional $129 trillion of accumulated deficits over the next 30 years."""	mostly true	['Debt', 'Deficit', 'Federal Budget']	https://www.nytimes.com/	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/26/opinion/senate-health-care-bill.html?mcubz=2&_r=1	2017/06/30	Where the Senate Health Care Bill FailsBy Ron JohnsonImageProtestors against the Republican health care bill outside the Capitol on Wednesday.CreditAaron P. Bernstein/ReutersSpeaking at a rally for his wife’s presidential campaign last year, Bill Clinton called Obamacare “the craziest thing in the world.” As he put it, “The people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.”Mr. Clinton was right, and it’s why Republicans have been pushing to repair the damage done by Obamacare for so long. Our priority should be to bring relief, and better, less expensive care, to millions of working men and women.Unfortunately, the Senate Republican alternative, unveiled last week, doesn’t appear to come close to addressing their plight. Like Obamacare, it relies too heavily on government spending, and ignores the role that the private sector can and should play.As an accountant with more than 30 years’ experience in manufacturing, I assure you the private sector is much more effective at solving problems. Concepts like the “KISS” principle (“keep it simple, stupid”), pursuing continuous improvement and root-cause analysis are core ideas in private-sector problem-solving. From what I’ve seen in six years in office, these concepts are foreign to government.The decades-long health care debate is an example. Layer upon layer of laws, rules and regulations have made our health care-financing system a complex mess, separating patients from direct payment for health care.As a result, patients neither know nor care what things cost. We have virtually eliminated the power of consumer-driven, free-market discipline from one-sixth of our economy.The primary goals of any health care reform should be to restrain (if not lower) costs while improving quality, access and innovation. This is exactly what consumer-driven, free-market competition does in other areas of our economy. Look no further than how laser eye surgery went from exotic to affordable during the years it was not covered by most insurance.Washington believes that the solution to every problem is more money. But throwing more money at insurers won’t fix the lack of consumer-driven competition, combined with government mandates that artificially drive up the cost of care and insurance.Obamacare imposes enormous taxes and plans to spend nearly $2 trillion over the next 10 years to decrease the number of uninsured, mostly through Medicaid but also through taxpayer-subsidized exchanges. In doing so, Obamacare has largely destroyed an already struggling individual health insurance marketplace. It does this by mandating high-cost provisions as standard for every insurance policy, then forcing a small percentage of the population to shoulder the cost. These are the people Mr. Clinton was talking about.Prior to Obamacare, the individual market was already challenged by unequal tax treatment, which forced the forgotten to pay for insurance with after-tax dollars. The simple solution would have been to equalize the tax treatment, but President Obama chose to spend trillions and artificially increase premiums unaffordably. The result: Too many of those individuals who are “busting it” and who responsibly carried insurance can no longer afford it, have dropped coverage, are paying a penalty and are taking a huge risk.Once again, a simple solution is obvious. Loosen up regulations and mandates, so that Americans can choose to purchase insurance that suits their needs and that they can afford.Like many other senators, I had hoped that this was where things were headed during the last several weeks as the Republican bill was discussed. We’re disappointed that the discussion draft turns its back on this simple solution, and goes with something far too familiar: throwing money at the problem.The bill’s defenders will say it repeals Obamacare’s taxes and reduces Medicaid spending growth. That’s true. But it also boosts spending on subsidies, and it leaves in place the pre-existing-condition rules that drive up the cost of insurance for everyone.Instead, we should return more flexibility to states, to give individuals the freedom and choice to buy plans they want without Obamacare’s “reforms.” And we should look to improve successful models for protecting individuals with pre-existing conditions, models underway prior to Obamacare, such as those in Maine and Wisconsin.Only then can the market begin to rein in the underlying cost of health care itself and reduce the cost of taxpayer subsidies.We are $20 trillion in debt. The Congressional Budget Office projects an additional $129 trillion of accumulated deficits over the next 30 years. A truly moral and compassionate society does not impoverish future generations to bestow benefits in the here and now.Republican leaders have told us the plan unveiled last week is a draft, open to discussion and improvement. I look forward to working with Senate leadership and the president to improve the bill so it addresses the plight of the forgotten men and women by returning freedom and choice to health care.Ron Johnson is a Republican senator from Wisconsin.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A23 of the New York edition with the headline: Where the Health Care Bill Fails.

Former President Obama’s unlawful action was intended to grant five million illegal aliens in the U.S. lawful-presence status and allow them to apply for work permits.In early 2015, Attorney General Paxton led a 26-state coalition lawsuit against the Obama administration that succeeded in putting DAPA on hold as the case worked its way through the courts. Following a win in the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Texas, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s decision. Ultimately, Texas handed President Obama his biggest court defeat of all when his unilateral immigration policies were blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court last June.“I applaud President Trump for acknowledging what President Obama himself acknowledged over 20 times – the Obama Administration’s DAPA immigration edict was a violation of law and the separation of powers. I am proud to have led a 26-state coalition that went all the way to the Supreme Court to block this unlawful edict.”To view the Department of Homeland Security’s recession of memorandum providing for DAPA, click here . Related News

['Civil Rights', 'Pundits']	https://www.infowars.com/	https://www.infowars.com/flashback-tim-kaine-loretta-lynch-called-for-blood-death-in-streets/	2017/06/16	FLASHBACK: Tim Kaine, Loretta Lynch Called For Blood & Death In StreetsTop ranking leftists provoke violenceDan Lyman | Infowars.com - June 14, 2017 CommentsThe attempted massacre of dozens of Republicans highlights the Democrats’ constant promotion of violence against their ideological opponents – rhetoric that has been espoused recently by Senator Tim Kaine and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch.Failed vice presidential candidate Kaine appeared on MSNBC in January urging Democrats to “fight in the streets” in resistance against the Trump agenda and the will of the American people.“There’s so much going on here that we clearly see, you know, places where… we can criticize what the administration is doing, but how does the [Democratic] party rebuild?” asked host Mika Brzezinski. “How do you prevent a continuation of the bubble in a situation like this, and how does the party reclaim its reach across the country while fighting these battles?”“So, the way we get outside the bubble is we take advantage of this tremendous public outcry against the administration,” responded Kaine. “What we’ve got to do is fight in Congress, fight in the courts, fight in the streets, fight online, fight at the ballot box, and now there’s the momentum to be able to do this.”Kaine’s son, Linwood, apparently heeded his father’s advice and would later be arrested while attempting to disrupt a pro-Trump rally in Minnesota, and is now facing criminal charges .“When protesters began harassing people gathered at the Minnesota State Capitol, rally participants attempted to block the entrance to the rotunda where the rally was taking place,” reported the Daily Caller. “Protesters then tried to force their way down the stairs, using smoke bombs, mace and fireworks, and causing a need for some rally participants to be treated by paramedics.”“We love that our three children have their own views and concerns about current political issues,” said Kaine in a statement on the matter. “They fully understand the responsibility to express those concerns peacefully.”Lynch also used similarly incendiary language in a bizarre one minute video in which she seemed to call upon fellow ‘progressives’ to march, bleed, and die in the streets – also in resistance to the Trump agenda, which has been endorsed and Constitutionally mandated by the American people.“I know it’s a time of concern for people, who see our rights being assailed, being trampled on and even being rolled back,” she said. “I know that this is difficult, but I remind you that this has never been easy. We have always had to work to move this country forward to achieve the great ideals of our Founding Fathers.”“It has been people, individuals who have banded together, ordinary people who simply saw what needed to be done and came together and supported those ideals who have made the difference.”“They’ve marched, they’ve bled and yes, some of them died,” she continued. “This is hard. Every good thing is. We have done this before. We can do this again.”These are only two examples out of a stunning collection of calls to violence and murder from the intolerant, unhinged leftists in the Democrat party, mainstream media, Hollywood, and the spiderweb of interwoven organizations and cabals like Antifa and Black Lives Matter who have effectively transformed into domestic terrorists in Trump’s America.Text from RSC Chair Rep.

Gabby Giffords’ shooting	false	['Crime']	https://www.nytimes.com/	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/14/opinion/steve-scalise-congress-shot-alexandria-virginia.html?_r=0	2017/06/15	By The Editorial BoardJune 14, 2017America’s elected representatives enjoying America’s pastime on a ball field just across the Potomac from the Capitol: A particularly American form of terror changed that idyll early Wednesday morning into what Senator Rand Paul, who was there, called “basically a killing field.”A gunman with a rifle fired dozens of rounds at members of Congress and current and former aides, who dove for cover. “He was hunting us,” said Representative Mike Bishop, Republican of Michigan, who was at home plate when the gunman appeared. In all, four victims were hit, including Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the House majority whip, who was in critical condition Wednesday night after surgery on a bullet wound to his hip.An American would once have been horrified and shocked by such savagery. An American today would be right to be horrified — and not very surprised. This was one of two mass shootings in the United States on Wednesday. At a San Francisco UPS facility, a gunman killed three people and himself.ImageF.B.I. agents collecting evidence after the shooting at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park in Alexandria, Va.CreditAl Drago/The New York TimesNot all the details are known yet about what happened in Virginia, but a sickeningly familiar pattern is emerging in the assault: The sniper, James Hodgkinson, who was killed by Capitol Police officers, was surely deranged, and his derangement had found its fuel in politics. Mr. Hodgkinson was a Bernie Sanders supporter and campaign volunteer virulently opposed to President Trump. He posted many anti-Trump messages on social media, including one in March that said “Time to Destroy Trump & Co.”Was this attack evidence of how vicious American politics has become? Probably. In 2011, Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in a supermarket parking lot, grievously wounding Representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a 9-year-old girl. At the time, we and others were sharply critical of the heated political rhetoric on the right. Before the shooting, Sarah Palin’s political action committee circulated a map that showed the targeted electoral districts of Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs. But in that case no connection to the shooting was ever established.Conservatives and right-wing media were quick on Wednesday to demand forceful condemnation of hate speech and crimes by anti-Trump liberals. They’re right. Liberals should of course be held to the same standard of decency that they ask of the right.Was this attack evidence of how readily available guns and ammunition are in the United States? Indisputably. Mr. Hodgkinson, by definition, should not have had a gun, but he was licensed in his home state, Illinois. And in any event it would have been easy for him to acquire a weapon in Virginia, which requires no background checks in private sales, requires no registration for most weapons and has few restrictions on open carry.The reaction of some was that the only solution is yet more guns. Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama, who was among those who came under fire on Wednesday, said, “It’s not easy to take when you see people around you being shot and you don’t have a weapon yourself.”That’s an entirely reasonable reflex. All people in that situation, unarmed and under fire, would long to be able to protect themselves and their friends. Yet consider the society Americans would have to live in — the choices they would all have to make — to enable that kind of defense. Every member of Congress, and every other American of whatever age, would have to go to baseball practice, or to school, or to work, or to the post office, or to the health clinic — or to any of the other places mass shootings now take place — with a gun on their hip. And then, when an attack came and they returned fire, they would probably kill or wound not the assailant but another innocent bystander, as studies have repeatedly shown.That is the society the gun lobby is working toward. Is it the one Americans want?President Trump said just the right thing after the attack on Wednesday: “We may have our differences, but we do well in times like these to remember that everyone who serves in our nation’s capital is here because, above all, they love our country. We can all agree that we are blessed to be Americans, that our children deserve to grow up in a nation of safety and peace.”Yet he will not help create that nation if he continues to advocate easy access to lethal weapons.Correction: An editorial on Thursday about the shooting of Representative Steve Scalise incorrectly stated that a link existed between political rhetoric and the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords. In fact, no such link was established. The editorial also incorrectly described a map distributed by a political action committee before that shooting. It depicted electoral districts, not individual Democratic lawmakers, beneath stylized cross hairs.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion) , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A24 of the New York edition with the headline: America’s Lethal Politics.

We’re posting all the other sessions from Code to that feed on Apple Podcasts , Google Play Music , Spotify (mobile only), TuneIn and Stitcher .Kara Swisher: So now, we’re going to do an interview we’re very excited about. Walter, why don’t you ...Walt Mossberg: Uh, we are just ... I’m just going to do it. Hillary Clinton.[applause, cheers, Katy Perry plays, laughter]Swisher: I think they voted for you, I think they did, a lot of these people [HRC laughs]. Before we start, there’s a distillery in Washington, D.C. and I’ve heard you like whiskey.Mossberg: There is? In Washington?Swisher: Yes, there’s a new distillery.Hillary Clinton: I’ve been known to, yeah, right [laughter].Swisher: So we brought you Rodham Rye [HRC laughs], which is — people see it? — it’s actually Hillary Clinton rye made for you.Yes, that’s what they told me.Swisher: And if you’d like a drink at anytime during this ... [laughter].Well ...Mossberg: We brought cups.Swisher: Now let’s just get the alt right platform — Hillary Clinton has a drinking problem [HRC laughs]. But if you’d like a drink at any point, this is for you to take home.Well you know, it may depend upon how the interview goes.Swisher: Ok, all right. We’ll just put it right here, just go, “Give me a shot.”Yeah, but I was thrilled. I mean, hey, not in the White House but Rodham Rye is on the shelves. [laughter]Swisher: All right, great!Mossberg: It seems like a fair trade-off, I don’t know.Well, you know, you gotta take what you can get.Mossberg: So, we’re going to talk a lot about tech and politics and tech in our country, your views on it. We were talking backstage and I think this was the first election where tech sort of got weaponized in a way that directly affected the outcome of the election ...I agree.Mossberg: ... and I know you have stuff to say about it. But I have to ask you first, discounting all those outside forces which were obviously very important, what misjudgement did you make, and your staff, that thinking about it was something serious and that you wish you had done the opposite?Well you know, I’m writing a whole book, Walt ...Mossberg: Well I don’t want to wait for the book.Yeah, we don’t probably have enough time for everything, but look. The overriding issue that affected the election that I had any control over — because I had no control over the Russians, too bad about that, but we’ll talk about it, I hope — was the way that the use of my email account was turned into the biggest scandal since lord knows when. And you know, in the book I’m just using everything that anybody else said about it besides me to basically say this was the biggest nothing-burger ever. It was a mistake, I’ve said it was a mistake, and obviously if I could turn the clock back, I wouldn’t have done it in the first place, but the way that it was used was very damaging.Swisher: And you didn’t handle it? That’s a mistake on your part? Or they way it was used was a mistake on your part? Because we’re trying to get at what you think you misjudged.Well, if you went all the way back, doing something that others had done before was no longer acceptable in the new environment in which we found ourselves. And there was no law against it, there was no rule, nothing of that sort. So I didn’t break any rule, nobody said, “Don’t do this,” and I was very responsible and not at all careless. So you end up with a situation that is then exploited, and very effectively, for adverse political reasons. And it was maddening, because in the middle of a hard-fought campaign, it’s hard to stop and say, “Wait a minute, what you think you know about this is not accurate, let me tell you. You can still judge me, you can still hold me accountable, that’s fair game.” But there was so much else going on at that time.And the investigation that they conducted ended in July, it was over, and I have my complaints about former director Comey, but it was done. And then it was reignited and it became the major reason toward the end, based on the best analysis that I can find, that I lost ground and ended up losing. So obviously, turn the clock back. But what was done, and I think it was interesting, I know you had Dean Baquet here from the New York Times yesterday, and they covered it like it was Pearl Harbor. And then in their endorsement of me, they said, “This email thing, it’s like a help desk issue.” So it was always a hard issue to put to bed, but we put it to bed in July and then it rose up again.Mossberg: Okay, I want to do one more of these misjudgement things and then we’re going to go on. Goldman Sachs.Yeah.Mossberg: You knew you were going to run for president, or you thought you might, or probably, you were thinking about it — you had to be thinking about it as a possibility — why did you do those?Why do you have Goldman Sachs here? [laughter]Swisher: Because they pay us.They paid me [laughter and applause]. You know, look, again ...Mossberg: Let’s get serious ...But ...Mossberg: I know they paid you ...Yes.Mossberg: And they paid you a lot.Yes, yes.Mossberg: But you’re not somebody who needed that money for the next week’s shopping, and you knew you might run, so why do it?Well, I gave speeches to many, many groups. I spoke to camp counselors, I spoke to health-care executives, I spoke to, you know, just a wide range of groups, right? And not just in the United States but particularly in Canada and a few other places.And I was a Senator from New York. I knew these people and I knew what they did for the economy and I knew what they did to the economy. And I think that speaking to them, raising questions — which I did in 2008 and 2009 — you know, people have no reason to know this, but in the 2008 campaign before the Iowa caucus, I actually ran an ad about the looming mortgage crisis. So I have to say, Walt, I never thought that anybody would throw out my entire career of standing up and speaking out and voting against and voting in favor of what I thought are good policies, because I made a couple of speeches. When you’re the Secretary of State, people want to hear what you talk about. The most common thing that I talked about in all those speeches was the hunt for Bin Laden. You know, that was one of the central missions that I felt from the time the towers fell on 9/11 as a Senator from New York.And to be part of that, to be one of the very few people advising the president on that, that was a fascinating issue. And I thought I could tell that to a lot of different people, and you know, men got paid for the speeches they made. I got paid for the speeches I made. And it was used, and I thought it was unfairly used and all of that, but it was part of the background music.Swisher: So let’s talk about that ... but it was used. And I think we’ve discussed this, you and I have discussed this, this idea of ... how many years did you talk about the vast right-wing conspiracy?Um, about ... let’s see, it was probably ’98?Swisher: And at the time people thought you were ...A little crazy [laughter].Swisher: Right, okay. [WM laughs]. What is it like now? How do you look at it now? Because it is used. Because you’re someone that’s got to know that a target’s on your back almost every ... You know, right now every bot in Russia is working their way with the last 20 seconds of things you said.Yes, right. Well I hope we get into this because look, I take responsibility for every decision I made, but that’s not why I lost. So I think it’s important that we learn the real lessons from this last campaign because the forces that we are up against are not just interested in influencing our elections and our politics, they’re going after our economy and they’re going after our unity as a nation. So yes, back in ’98 — look, I have been watching this and have been, obviously, the target for a number of years. And what is hard for people to really — although now after the election there’s greater understanding — is that there are forces in our country — put the Russians to one side — who have been fighting rear-guard actions for as long as I’ve been alive, because my life coincided with the Civil Rights movement, with the Women’s Rights movement, with anti-war protesting, with the impeachment ... you know, the driving out of office because he was about to be impeached president ...Swisher: Let’s be specific.Yeah, let’s be very specific as if people didn’t understand what I was saying [laughter].And let’s talk about, you know, Watergate and all the stuff that we lived through. And we were on a real roll as a country despite assassinations, despite setbacks. You know, opening the doors of opportunity, expanding rights to people who never had them in any country, was frankly thrilling. And I believed then, and I believe now, that we’re never done with this work. And so part of the challenge is to maintain the energy and the focus to keep going forward. But you’ve got to recognize the other side is never, never tired either. They’re always looking to push back.And what we saw was, in the election particularly, and I appreciate what Walt said, the first time that you had the tech revolution really weaponized politically — before it was a way to reach voters, you know, collect fundraising, do things that would help the candidate who was behind the messaging — that changed this time, and it changed for a number of reasons we should talk about. You had Citizens United come to its full fruition. So unaccountable money flowing in against me, against other Democrats, in a way that we hadn’t seen and then attached to this weaponized information war. You had effective suppression of votes. Those of us who can remember the Voting Rights Act, the expansion of the franchise, and then I was in the Senate when we voted 98 to nothing under a Republican president, George W. Bush, to extend the Voting Rights Act.And the Supreme Court said, “Oh, we don’t need it anymore,” throws it out, and Republican governors and legislatures began doing everything they could to suppress the vote. So, that was before we get to the Russians, or Cambridge Analitica, or anything of the outside. And there were lots of factors at work and yeah, it was aimed at me, but it’s a much deeper, more persistent effort to try to literally turn the clock back on so much of what we’ve achieved as a country.Swisher: So talk about the weaponizing of it. Because one of the things that’s interesting ... Now you’ve recently, and we’ve talked about the uses of Facebook, the uses of — we can get into Donald Trump’s Twitter thing in a second, because that can be a whole conference, essentially. But how do you see how it was weaponized, and it begs the questions, why weren’t you weaponizing it? Like, why is the right wing so good at it?Mossberg: And not just you, but the Democrats.Well, look. Here’s how I see it, and I hope others will jump into this debate in the months ahead because there’s a lot we have to understand if we’re going to avoid this continuing assault on our sources of information. Here’s how I think about it. You know, I was very proud of my data and analytics team. They were largely veterans of the Obama campaigns, ’08, ’12, and then we brought in new people and brought in a lot of new expertise to build the next generation. And we had a lot of help from some people in Silicon Valley as well. And what we thought we were doing — here’s the arena we were playing in — was going to like Obama 3.0, you know, better targeting, better messaging, and the ability to both turn out our voters as we identified them, and to communicate more broadly with voters.Here’s what the other side was doing, and they were in a different arena. Through content farms, through an enormous investment in falsehoods, fake news, call it what you will ...Mossberg: How about “lies”?Lies? You’re really ... that’s a good word too [laughter and applause]. The other side was using content that was just flat-out false, and delivering it in a very personalized way, both sort of above the radar screen and below. And you know, look, I’m not a tech expert by any stretch of the imagination. That really influenced the information that people were relying on. And there have been some studies done since the election that if you look — let’s pick Facebook. If you look at Facebook, the vast majority of the news items posted were fake. They were connected to, as we now know, the 1,000 Russian agents who were involved in delivering those messages.They were connected to the bots that are just out of control. We see now this new information about Trump’s Twitter account being populated by millions of bots. And it was such a new experience. I understand why people on their Facebook pages would think, “Oh, Hillary Clinton did that, I did not know that. Well that’s going to affect my opinion about her.” And we did not engage in false content. We may have tried to put every piece of information in the best possible light, and explanations, but we weren’t in the same category as the other side.Mossberg: But, okay. So you weren’t going to lie.Right.Well ... Yes ... [laughter]Mossberg: I see you’re rethinking that [laughs].I’m not rethinking it, but everybody else better rethink it, because we have to figure out how to combat this.Mossberg: Okay, but that’s my point. My impression is that the left, the Democrats, liberals, whatever you want to call them, including Bernie Sanders’s folks and everybody on the Democratic side, which at once time, 12, 15 years ago, was ahead of the Republicans on tech as it existed then, is way behind now.Yeah, yeah.Mossberg: And it’s not just ... I mean, there’s a way to weaponize tech that doesn’t involve lying.Right.Mossberg: Or having Russians help you. But it is a political weapon, it’s a fact of life now.Swisher: So how do you do that?Mossberg: How do you do it? How do we do it going forward?Let me just do a comparison for you. I set up my campaign and we have our own data operation. I get the nomination. So I’m now the nominee of the Democratic Party. I inherit nothing from the Democratic Party.Mossberg: What do you mean nothing?I mean it was bankrupt, it was on the verge of insolvency, its data was mediocre to poor, nonexistent, wrong. I had to inject money into it ...Mossberg: This is the DNC you’re talking about.The DNC, to keep it going. Okay. Donald Trump, who did nothing about really setting up any kind of data operation, inherits an RNC data foundation that, after the Republicans lost in 2012, and they thought they had a very good operation with the setup that Romney did called ORCA, they thought that was really state of the art, they lose.So they raised — best estimates are close to a hundred million dollars, they brought in their main vendors, they basically said, “We will never be behind the Democrats again,” and they invested between 2012 and 2016 this hundred million dollars to build this data foundation. They beta tested it. They ran it ... somebody was able to determine about 227,000 surveys to double check, triple check, quadruple check, the information.So Trump becomes the nominee and he is basically handed this tried and true, effective foundation. Then you’ve got Cambridge Analytica and you know, you can believe the hype on how great they were or the hype on how they weren’t, but the fact is, they added something. And I think again, we better understand that the Mercers did not invest all that money just for their own amusement. We know they played in Brexit, and we know that they came to Jared Kushner and basically said, “We will marry our operation,” which was more as it’s been described, psychographic, sentiment, a lot of harvesting of Facebook information, “We will marry that with the RNC on two conditions: You pick Steve Bannon, and you pick Kellyanne Conway. And then we’re in.” Trump says, “Fine, who cares,” right? So Bannon, who’d been running the Breitbart operation, supplying a lot of the ... untrue, false stories ...Mossberg: You gotta start saying lies.Yeah. We know. So, they married content with delivery and data. And it was a potent combination. Now, the question is, where and how did the Russians get into this? And I think it’s a very important question. So, I assume that a lot of people here may have — and if you haven’t, I hope you will — read the declassified report by the Intelligence community that came out in early January.Mossberg: This is 17 agencies ...Seventeen agencies, all in agreement, which I know from my experience as a Senator and Secretary of State, is hard to get. They concluded with high confidence that the Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign, to influence voters in the election. They did it through paid advertising we think, they did it through false news sites, they did it through these thousand agents, they did it through machine learning, which you know, kept spewing out this stuff over and over again. The algorithms that they developed. So that was the conclusion. And I think it’s fair to ask, how did that actually influence the campaign? And how did they know what messages to deliver?Swisher: Who told them?Who told them? Who were they coordinating with, or colluding with? Because the Russians historically in the last couple of decades and then increasingly, you know, are launching cyber attacks, and they are stealing vasts amounts of information, and a lot of the information they’ve stolen they’ve used for internal purposes, to affect markets, to affect the intelligence services, etc. So this is different because they went public, and they were conveying this weaponized information and the content of it, and they were running ... You know, there’s all these stories of guys over in Macedonia who are running these fake news sites and I’ve seen them now and you sit there and it looks like a sort of low-level CNN operation ...Mossberg: Or a fake newspaper.Or a fake newspaper ...Mossberg: Like the Denver Guardian.Like a fake newspaper, and so the Russians — in my opinion and based on the intel and the counterintel people I’ve talked to — could not have known how best to weaponize that information unless they had been guided.Mossberg: Guided by Americans.Guided by Americans and guided by people who had polling and data information.Swisher: Who is that?Now let me just finish, because this is the second and third step. So we know that they did that. We understand it. Best example: So within one hour, one hour of the Access Hollywood tapes being leaked, within one hour, the Russians — let’s say WikiLeaks, something — dumped the John Podesta emails. Now, if you’ve ever read the John Podesta emails, they are anodyne to boredom [laughter]. But ...Mossberg: Yeah, we had him here once.Yeah, [laughter and applause], and forgive him for what he said about you. So, they were run-of-the-mill emails, especially run of the mill for a campaign.“Should we do this?” “What should she say?” You know, just the stuff that is so common, basic. Within one hour they dumped them, and then they began to weaponize them. And they began to have some of their allies within the internet world, like Infowars, take out pieces and begin to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you could imagine. And so they had to be ready for that, and they had to have a plan for that, and they had to be given the go-ahead. “Okay, this could be the end of the Trump campaign, dump it now. And then let’s do everything we can to weaponize it.”And we know it hurt us. Because as I explain in my book, you know, the Comey letter, which was, now we know, partly based on a false memo from the Russians. It was a classic piece of Russian disinformation — comprimat, they call it. So, for whatever reason, and I speculate, but I can’t look inside the guy’s mind, you know, he dumps that on me on October 28th, and I immediately start falling. But what was really interesting, since the mainstream media covered that, as I say like Pearl Harbor, front pages everywhere, huge type, etc. And all of the Trump people go around screaming, “Lock her up, lock her up,” and all of that. At the same time, the biggest Google searches were not for Comey, because that information was just lying out there, it was for WikiLeaks. And so voters who are being targeted with all of this false information are genuinely trying to make up their minds.What does it mean? And we know that the Google searches for this stuff were particularly high in places in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.Swisher: So, a couple of questions to this. That was fascinating actually. I was like riveted to that. Who was directing them, from your perspective? And do you blame — and I’m just going to use Facebook, because that’s where a lot of this was done, especially around the fake news, either the Pope was voting for Trump, or there was one particular one I got in an argument with Facebook people about, you being a lizard, that was going around. And they kept arguing about the gray area and this and that, and I remember being in a call saying, “She’s not a lizard!”Thank you, Kara, thank you [laughter].Mossberg: That’s actually a kind thing from Kara.I’m very touched!Swisher: But ... [laughter] do you blame ...I have that on a pillow, “She’s not a lizard.”Swisher: I don’t know if you’re a lizard or not but ... [HRC laughs] I’m guessing you’re not a lizard. But who do you think directed it? And do you blame Facebook, or any of these platforms, for doing nothing? What should they have done and are they culpable?Let me separate out the questions. First, we’re getting more information about all of the contacts between Trump campaign officials and Trump associates with Russians before, during and after the election. So I hope that we’ll get enough information to be able to answer that question.Swisher: But you’re leaning Trump.Yes ... yes. I’m leaning Trump. I think it’s pretty hard not to. I think that the marriage of the domestic fake news operations, the domestic RNC Republican allied data, you know, combined with the very affective capabilities that the Russians brought. You know, basically the group running this was the GRU which is the military intelligence arm of the Russian military and they have a very sophisticated cyber operation, in bed with WikiLeaks, in bed with Goosefer, in bed with DC Leaks.And you know, DC Leaks and Goosefer, which were dropping a lot of this stuff on me, they haven’t done anything since early January. Their job was done. They got their job done. So we’re going to, I hope, be able to connect up a lot of the dots, and it’s really important because when Comey did testify before being fired this last couple of weeks, he was asked, “Are the Russians still involved?” And he goes, “Yes, they are. Look, why wouldn’t they be? It worked for them!” And it is important that Americans, and particularly people in tech and business understand, Putin wants to bring us down. And he is an old KGB agent. I had, obviously, run-ins with him, because that in large measure prompted his animus toward me, and his desire to help Trump. But it is deeper than that, it is way beyond me.So with respect to the platforms, you know, I am again not exactly sure what conclusions we should draw. But here’s what I believe. I believe that what was happening to me was unprecedented and we were scrambling. We went and told everybody we could find in the middle of the summer, the Russians were messing with the election. And we were basically shooed away, like, “Oh you know, there she goes, vast right-wing conspiracy.” Now it’s a vast Russian conspiracy. Well, turned out we were right. And we saw evidence of it. We could track it. And we couldn’t get ... we could not get the press to follow it and we never got confirmation. Remember, Comey was more than happy to talk about my emails, but he wouldn’t talk about the investigation of the Russians. So people went to vote on November 8th having no idea that there was an active counter-intelligence investigation going on of the Trump campaign.So if I put myself in the position of running a platform like Facebook, first of all, they’ve got to get back to trying to curate it more effectively. Put me out of the equation, they’ve got to help prevent fake news from creating a new reality. That does influence how people think of themselves, see the world, the decisions that they make. I don’t know enough about what they could have done in real time. It’s not like we were not having conversations with them, because a lot of the people on my team were. I also think I was the victim of a very broad assumption I was going to win. “It doesn’t matter what you do to her ...”Swisher: Victim that you were going to win ...Yeah, just you know, everybody.Mossberg: You’re talking about Nate Silver and the Times. “She has an 88 percent ... No she has an 89 percent chance.”Yeah. And you know, I never believed that, I always thought it was going to be a close election because our elections are always close. And you know, if you have an R next to your name or a D next to your name, you end up often falling in line to vote for your candidate.So I think a lot of people ... “We’ll get to that after the election. We’re not going to worry about it right now.” And that turned out to be a terrible mistake.Swisher: So a victim that they thought you were going to win ... So what’s the difference?Well, I think that was part of it.Swisher: What about a financial element? That they made money from this?Oh I think... Well, look. The networks made more money than they’ve made in years, and we’ve got lots of network executives saying things like, “You know, he may not be good for the country but he’s good for business.” And there was that. And putting him on all the time. Calling in wherever he was from. And here’s a really telling statistic that has been validated. So, I had this old-fashioned idea that it really mattered what I would do as president [laughter]. And so I laid out very specific plans and I costed them out because I also think it’s important to be fiscally responsible.A number of people in this audience were helpful to me, and I thank you. And we had a really good ... we had a great tech program. We had a really good set of policies. Okay. In 2008, which was the last time you had a contested election, not somebody already in the White House, the policies put forth by President Obama, Senator McCain, got 220 minutes of air time, okay? In 2016, despite my best efforts and giving endless speeches and putting out all kinds of stuff, we got 32 minutes. That’s all.Mossberg: Total?Mossberg: Over like two years, or how long was ...?Well, over 18 months. Yeah. That was it. Total.Swisher: So does that signify that you need to think about campaign ... Not you in particular. Are you running again, by the way?No.Swisher: Okay. But you need to campaign differently, because you know, you were saying policy doesn’t matter, politics did. And Donald Trump ... Look, a lot of people say that he was a great campaigner, a bad president. You were a terrible campaigner, you would have been a great president kind of thing. But you have to win and not ...Look, let’s put the campaigning stuff on the table ...Swisher: But don’t you have to change? Or not?I won three million more votes than the other guy did [cheers, applause]. And I had a very, very close contest with President Obama. Basically, our votes were neck and neck. He ended up with more delegates and you know, depending on how you counted, I was slightly ahead, slightly behind. So we were absolutely on par when it came to actually getting votes. I won two Senate races in New York. So I never said I was a perfect candidate, and I certainly have never said I ran perfect campaigns, but I don’t know who is or did. And at some point it sort of bleeds into misogyny. And let’s just be honest, you know, people who have ... [applause] a set of expectations about who should be president and what a president looks like, you know, they’re going to be much more skeptical and critical of somebody who doesn’t look like and talk like and sound like everybody else who’s been president.And you know, President Obama broke that racial barrier, but you know, he’s a very attractive, good-looking man with lots of ...Swisher: Well, he’s likable enough.He’s likable enough, absolutely! [WM laughs] More than, more than. So the campaign ... Look, were there things we could have done differently? You can say that about any campaign.Swisher: But is campaigning going to change in the future?Mossberg: Yeah, but I want to ... I want to follow up on something while we’re on this bleeding over into misogyny thing, and it comes from the recent New York Magazine profile of you, which I thought was fascinating and interesting. But the part of it that just leapt off the page for me as a reader was you and some of your staff, folks were quoted in there as saying, “Okay, Bernie Sanders could get angry at the podium about the fate of the people who are trapped in the globalization/automation thing.” Trump certainly did that, oversimplifying, getting angry.You couldn’t do that because you’re a woman. And if a woman does that, it just backfires on her. And it made me think, are we never going to be able to have a woman in politics who can use that technique, which is an effective technique, which shows I’m emotionally with you just by oversimplifying and getting angry. Is that true? Do you really feel you couldn’t do that?Well, let me say this. You know, I have been on many speaking platforms with many men who are in office or running for office. And the crowd gets you going and you get up there and I watch my male counterparts and they beat the podium and they yell and the crowd loves it.And a few times I’ve tried then and it’s been less than successful, let me just say that [laughter]. And it’s a little maddening because I’m as angry about what’s going on as anybody because I’ve seen us go backwards as I said in the very beginning about so many things. Economic opportunity, advancements in human rights, civils rights, and the rest.Swisher: Health care.Health care. I care deeply about this. And I remember when I was doing health care back in the day, ’93, ’94, and we were trying to move an agenda forward and I went to the American Academy of Pediatrics. And I’ve always been particularly concerned about what happens to kids who don’t get the health care they need.Mossberg: Right.And I gave a really hot speech, and I got hammered for it, repeatedly. Because I don’t know what the way forward will be for others, Walt, but for me, trying to convey my commitment, my lifelong commitment, and not only that, what I’ve done.And you know, I’d put up against anybody who ran, or thought of running, what I’ve already accomplished compared to what they have on behalf of people. It just is very difficult to go from intensity, passion, emotion, to anger. So, yeah. Try and stay on the other side of that line.Swisher: So spinning it forward, what do you think a Democrat ... how do you assess the current Democratic scene in terms of tech, and also what will happen with this Russian investigation?I’m not going to speculate on who might end up running. We have to first win elections in New Jersey and Virginia in 2017, we’ve got to take the House back and keep our incumbents and maybe make progress in the Senate. Everything will change if we win in 2018.Mossberg: Do you really believe we can?Yes I do.Mossberg: I say “we,” I’m retiring soon.Yeah, we. Yes.Mossberg: We [laughter] can take the House back? [applause]Yes.Mossberg: We’ve got 20-something Senate seats that we have to defend. I mean seriously, come on. You’re really smart about this. Let’s be honest.Let’s look at the House. We have to flip 24 seats, okay? I won 23 districts that have a Republican Congress member. Seven of them are in California, Darrell Issa being one. If we can flip those, if we can then go deeper into where I did well, where we can get good candidates, I think flipping the House is certainly realistic. It’s a goal that we can set for ourselves.Mossberg: Is the party organized to do that?Well, we’re working on it. I’m working on it.Mossberg: We don’t have a lot of time here.Well you know, but we’ve got two very good political strategists running the Senate and the House for Democrats, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. They know how to win elections. They’re incredibly focused, tireless and effective. So honestly, I’m hopeful about the House. And I’m working on it. I have a new organization called Onward Together and I’m helping some of these new groups that have sprouted up online to recruit candidates, run candidates, help candidates go to town halls, expose Republican members for their hypocrisy and the like. So we’re working really hard on this.Mossberg: What about the Senate?I think the Senate is hard to make progress, but I think it’s possible to hold our own. All of this depends on what we’re talking about. So if the Republicans continue to make progress as they are in going into the next generation of personalization, message delivery, phony stories ... Go to Netflix and say you want to see a political documentary, eight of the top 10 — last time I checked a few weeks ago — were screeds against President Obama or me, or both of us.Now, I love Netflix. We’re not making the documentaries that we’re going to get onto Netflix.Mossberg: This is because Hollywood isn’t liberal enough? [laughter]No, it’s because Democrats aren’t putting their money there. You know, there’s a classic line. Democrats give money to candidates, they want a personal connection. So the classic line is Democrats like to fall in love, Republicans just fall in line. Republicans build institutions, Republicans invest in those institutions, Republicans are much more willing to push and cross the line, and Democrats ... I’ve talked to dozens of donors since my election experience and I’ve said, “Look, I’m all for you trying to figure out who you’re going to support in 2020, but what about 2017 and what about 2018 and what about helping the DNC try to leapfrog over its horrible data deficit, and how about supporting some of these new groups and see what they can do to generate some activity?”We are not good historically at building institutions. And we’ve got to get a lot better. And that includes content. We have a great story to tell. You know, I found when I started the campaign that I had to say in practically everyone of my speeches, “Barack Obama save the economy, and he doesn’t get the credit he deserves.” I had to say that because people had been told differently. They didn’t feel it yet. You know, income didn’t really start inching up until 2015, late 2015.Mossberg: Right.So I was swimming against an historic tide. It’s very difficult historically to succeed a two-term president of your own party, because you know, we’re itchy people, we like change in American, and I get it. So there was that, but he had done a good job.And you know, it was comparable ... I obviously think back to what my husband inherited, which at that time seemed to be an exploding deficit and an increasing debt. The debt of the country had been quadrupled the prior 12 years. So he had to do a lot of cleanup work, he paid a huge political price for it, lost the Congress in ’94, had to fight back for getting reelected, and then we all know what happened in the second term which was bloodsport of the worse kind. And then the Supreme Court, despite Al Gore winning 500,000 more votes rules for Bush. So Bush comes in, and I worked closely with him on 9/11, but honestly the financial crisis, the morass in Iraq, and a lot of the other decisions that were made were very damaging. So then we elect President Obama, he comes in, he inherits the worst economy since the Great Depression, and he has to do a lot of things that are not easy to get it back and moving.And it was like, “Okay, thank you very much, let’s get excited about somebody who’s going to really stir us up as opposed to do the job that needs to be done now.”Mossberg: Great analysis on the congressional at the national level [applause]. Let’s move down ballot for a second. One of the things that just depresses me all the time is where are the Democrats running ... You know, they’re mad at everybody. Every Democrat, every liberal, lots of moderates, even some moderate Republicans, are scared and angry about Trump.Right, right.Mossberg: I don’t see him running for school board, I don’t see him running for city council, I don’t see him running for state legislature ...That’s starting to change, Walt. It really is. I’ve got every finger and toe crossed. So among the groups I’m supporting is a group called Run For Something, started by a young woman who worked for me and my campaign.And they’ve had thousands of people go on the website to try to figure out what does it mean to run and then to put in information, “Here’s what I’m thinking of.” And they’re beginning to win some races. Another group that’s been around for a longer time called Emerge America supports women who run. Their grassroots operations invested in women in Nevada, we flipped both houses. I won Nevada, we won the House and the Senate of Nevada. So they’re playing catch-up and trying to be more progressive and smart about their policies. You’re absolutely right. We used to leave so many races uncontested, and we’re not going to do that anymore.Swisher: So when you think about that ... One of the things that we were also talking about last night is Republicans own local television stations, they own radio, they’re better at the internet, that got that cable going — although there’s some issues they have over there at Fox News these days. What do you do then? Where do you leapfrog?Because obviously the internet is the best way to leapfrog that. And let’s be honest, you have Hollywood on your side. There’s a progressive media, most people think of the media as progressive. Well you don’t, you think it’s not. Like the New York Times for example.Mossberg: The false equivalency.Swisher: Right, we try to be fair.Mossberg: I sense that that’s changing.I hope so.Mossberg: That memo has been received.I hope so. Because what ...Swisher: So where’s the in? Technologically?This goes back to the institution building. Because the media forces on the Republican side are entrenched and very effective. So you’ve got obviously Fox, but you also now have Sinclair buying 140-plus local stations. And they’re beginning to call the shots on those local stations.Swisher: Give the example of Montana we talked about.Yeah, well so you know Montana, those of you who saw the now newly elected member of Congress literally beating up, body slamming, pushing around, a young reporter, you know what happened.You know that it had a really terrible look to it. The guy should never have been doing that. I don’t know what enraged him so much being asked about health care. Sort of a strange trigger [laughter]. So the NBC affiliate in Montana, can’t remember which city, Missoula or Billings. Anyway, they’ve just been bought by Sinclair. So the NBC mothership in New York calls this station and says, “Can you send us the footage of what happened?” They said, “No, because that reporter was from a liberal paper, and we don’t think it’s a story we want to be part of.” Now, I find that terrifying. Because local news, yeah, there is the internet and how important it is and everybody who gets their news off of the internet, but local TV is still incredibly powerful.Mossberg: So what are we going to do about it?Well I’ve been ...Swisher: You and Walt, what are you going to do about it?Well I mean, we have a few ...Mossberg: I’ve got some time now.You would be a great adviser to one or more of our tech billionaires who want to buy some media.Mossberg: Eh, they don’t listen to me.Well then, we’re going to have to find other people who will compete against what is a considerable advantage on the other side.Swisher: What do you think about Jeff Bezos owning the Washington Post?I think that Jeff Bezos saves the Washington Post. I think his purchasing the Washington Post ... [applause] Which you know, I think a lot of people, a lot of his peers and friends thought, “Why would you buy this ancient medium called a newspaper?” But newspapers, like the Post, the Journal, the Times, a few others, still drive news. Drives news online, drives news on TV.And what Bezos has done, from what I’m told, and Walt and I were talking about this backstage, you know, he’s interested in making it a good proposition, but he’s hands off on the editorial and content front and he’s basically said, “Get out there and do investigations,” and they’re doing some of the best investigations about what’s going on with the White House now. So I think that was really a very good use of his financial resources because now we have a very good newspaper again operating in Washington and driving news elsewhere and doing kind of Whitewater-level investigations.Swisher: So we have to get to questions from the audience, and I don’t think we can get into covfefe right now because it’s a longer thing [WM laughs], but ...I thought it was a hidden message to the Russians [laughter].Swisher: Oh you did [laughs]. That is perfect, thank you so much for that. That’s going to be on our site in about five seconds [laughter].So there’s a lot of calls. One of the things that I’m struck by is a lot of some of the articles are like, “You’ve got to stop, you’ve got to move on, you’ve got to sunset yourself and go away.” How do you ... I’m offended by it, but what do you think? Because you seem mad as ever, which I love. You know what I mean?You know, look. I’m not going anywhere [applause]. I have a big stake in what happens in this country. I am very, you know, unbowed and unbroken about what happened, because I don’t want it to happen to anybody else. I don’t want it to happen to the values and the institutions that I care about in America. And I think that we’re at a really pivotal point. And therefore I’m going to keep writing and keep talking and keep supporting people who are on the front lines of the resistance.Swisher: Terrific. Question for Hillary Clinton.Mossberg: Why don’t we start over here.Guy Horowitz: Guy Horowitz, I’m from Israel. So if it’s any comfort, we also had an election decided by an election day weaponized social media case. I don’t know if it’s comforting at all.Swisher: No it’s not, it’s worse.Horowitz: That guy also had like a very questionable hairdo. But we survived. So my question to you is ... In Israel we look at everything that’s happening outside the U.S. and what Donald Trump is saying and doing from the Paris climate thing and everything else that’s happening. It looks like it’s a clear and present danger to the world. And we’re all talking here, which is good. But I don’t feel like we’re doing enough, maybe in the U.S., definitely in the world ...Swisher: So question ... I’m sorry ...Horowitz: ... to eliminate this clear and present danger.Mossberg: And the question?Horowitz: And the question is, what can we do right now?Yeah. You know, I’m really glad you asked the question because I do think what he’s doing is very dangerous to our position in the world, our leadership, and the stability of the world. I mean, when you give a blank check to the Russians and the Saudis, and others who are in engaged in authoritarian and dictatorial regimes, you are sending a message, “We don’t care what you do.” And that message will be heard. Now, we weren’t always able to control what others did, but we sure made it clear we didn’t think it was a good idea to engage in invasions and mass murders and other things that we see from the Philippines to the Middle East. When you turn on your allies and you treat them with such disdain and contempt, our democratic NATO allies who have stood with us, who came to our aide after 9/11, you are sending a message that you don’t care about history, or even about the current problems that we face. Now, the only comfort I can get out of having lost in the way that I did and having the Russians play such a role is that Necron was ready and able to rebut that. He said, “I’m the Hillary Clinton of this election.”And they had certain institutional and media predictions that we don’t have. But he also was really smart about how he dealt with it. And it also has given a lot of good understanding to Angela Merkel and her team as she moves towards her election, okay? And I think that is important because we need to reform democracies, we need to reform economies, we need to deal with some of the issues that are coming at us like artificial intelligence and robotics and what the heck we’re going to do with all these people who are not going to have jobs. There are lots of big questions that the democratic world has to face, including Israel.But we cannot stand idly by and allow Trump to continue to undermine the very strong foundation based on values that we in democracies share. Politicians come and go, but these values and the role that they play in stabilizing the world after the worst war in humanity, is critically important. You mentioned climate change, apparently they’re debating in the White House whether to pull out of the Paris agreement. There are only two nations in the world that are not signatories to the Paris Agreement: Nicaragua and Syria. For the United States to throw our lot in with the very, very small number of countries that have turned their backs on climate change, is not only a breach of an agreement ... Usually when you come into office you can try to reform, maybe tinker with agreements, but part of what keeps us going is that America’s word is good and you stand with your prior administration, whether it was of your party or not.They’re looking to throw all that out the window. But what’s really stupid about it is they’re throwing out the economic opportunities that being part of the Paris Agreement provide for the United States. That is what I find totally incomprehensible. Now, it is going to be interesting to see where they end up. The president is a very impulsive, reactive personality. So if we all like the Paris Agreement, he may decide to get out of it. Not even understanding one bit about what that means.Or understanding the economic costs of it. You know, somebody is going to really ... probably more than one somebody, will really have the market for clean energy exports. China is moving full speed ahead to be that country. Some of the European countries, particularly when it comes to wind, are already there. Israel I know has some great research being done, particularly on solar. I mean, there’s a huge market that somebody’s going to own, and we’re giving it up. There will be entrepreneurs and businesses, you will do your best to be competitive, but you won’t have the full force and support of your government, and I think that is incredibly foolish.Swisher: All right. Short questions so we can get to them.Alexia Bonatsos: Hi Hillary.Hi.Bonatsos: I’m Alexia Bonatsos. First off, thank you so much for what you have done for women [applause]. Thank you. So the present administration is very befuddling. This morning Spicer said that only the president and a small group of people knows what covfefe means. [WM and KS laugh] You’ve been a party to a lot of classified information.Right.Bonatsos: And you were at Donald Trump’s wedding.Yeah [WM laughs].Bonatsos: What do you know about him that we don’t, and how do you explain his bizarre behavior and appeal? [laughter, applause]Swisher: That’s such a good question!Ah, the small group explanation. You don’t have a high enough classification to know what covfefe mean [laughter]. You know, look. I was never even a social friend, it was kind of a lark to go to his third wedding [laughter, applause]. But I have to tell you, I sat behind Shaquille O’Neal, so I didn’t see anything [laughter, applause].But, seriously. The behavior that we are now seeing was always present, but it was sort of subordinated to real estate interests, right? He started attacking Ronald Reagan in 1988. You know, “Our government is a disgrace ..."" So he’s been an equal opportunity insulter going back many years. Started thinking about running for president in the ’90s. Latched onto the lie of the birther movement about President Obama, rode that as far as he could. But he does have a visceral grasp of America’s political underbelly.He really understands how to inflame people, how to motivate them, how to bond with them. Over whatever their grievance is. Whatever resentment or point of anger that you may have, if he can get into it, whether it’s race or sex or xenophobia or anti ... Islamophobia, whatever it is. And so we’re seeing it on a broader stage. And it is deeply troubling for not only our politics but for our position in the world. And I think the best thing we can do is to continue to stand up, continue to defend the truth. You know, I gave a commencement speech at my alma mater and I quoted my predecessor in the Senate, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, with that famous remark, “Everybody’s entitled to his own opinion but no one is entitled to his own facts.” And that’s why we need the media, we need the tech world, we need the online world.We need everybody to be calling them out on their outrageous lies and make it clear that we can have a debate about what is the best way to provide health care, we can have a debate about a budget, but when you present a budget with a trillion dollar mathematical error, it’s not like we’re going to ignore it. And I think the more voices that can be pushing back, especially in areas that you know things about, the better. And then I’ll just get back to politics and elections. We got to have your support here in California and across the country to try to take back the House and too, as Walt rightly says, field more people to run. And if you’ve ever been interested ... you know, Kara, if you’ve ever been interested in running, now is the time to get in there.Swisher: I’ve got it.And because I think people will be hungry for straight talking, common sense, factual information. We don’t want to act like the American public isn’t capable of making informed decisions. We just have to make sure the information we get is founded in evidence and reality. And then we can have a real debate.Swisher: And you also have to be good with the Twitter. But go ahead.Fred Davis: Hi, I’m Fred Davis, I live near you in New York. It’s the day before the election, maybe the morning of the election. From everything I’ve read, I hear you think you’re going to win.Yeah.Davis: Are those accounts accurate? Is the polling industry as inaccurate as we perceive it? And is there any quick suggestions to this crowd on how to fix it?Well, Fred, yeah, I did think I was going to win. I spent the night before the election, I started in Philadelphia. We had a 40,000-person rally with Barack and Michelle and the president had been following it closely.Those of you who know him, he was running his own polling, running his own analytics. And you know, and we thought we were going to win. That’s all I can tell you. We knew, I knew, that I’d taken a tremendous hit after the Comey letter. And then later I understood the role that WikiLeaks played in it. But the Comey letter was measurable. You could see my drop. So you know, I needed a big majority to come out of Philadelphia, which I got. Close to 500,000. And I needed about a 15 to 17 point lead to come out of the Philadelphia suburbs. Before the Comey letter, based on our polling, I had about a 22 point lead in the Philadelphia suburbs. After that letter, my momentum, particularly among women in the suburbs, stopped and dropped. So I won the suburbs, but I only won them by 10.And that wasn’t enough. I mean, Pennsylvania’s always a tough state and you’ve got to come out of the city and suburbs and Pittsburgh and a few other places. Which I won! I won Pittsburgh, I won the country there, I won Scranton, I won the county there. But I just got killed out in the country and my numbers couldn’t hold me up. So yeah, we did think... I think polling is going to have to undergo some revisions in how they actually measure people. How they reach people. The best assessments as of right now are that the polling was not that inaccurate, but it was predominantly national polling, and I won nationally. What was not as obvious was what was happening in states where I was under a lot of pressure from Comey, WIkiLeaks, voter suppression, fake news, all of that. And that’s kind of what happened.Swisher: Okay, Rob?Rob: Secretary Clinton, good to see you.Hey, Rob.Rob: As we discussed last night, you were originally on the Senate Watergate committee in the ’70s, so you know that part of it firsthand. What has to happen in 2018 to get robust activities in the House, particularly around an investigation? And to tie that back into your comments, how important is a democratic majority in your opinion to have a proper investigation into the Russia stuff and the kleptocracy and the other things that appear to be going on?Well it’s critical, Rob. Now one would hope that more Republicans, as they did during the Watergate investigation, because as Rob said, I was on the impeachment enquiry staff of the house judiciary committee, and Republicans then were not happy about investigating a president of their own party, but they were open to the evidence. And we ran under the great leadership of the late John Doar, a meticulous investigation and presentation of facts.We don’t have that right now in the Republican majority in the house, although they are continuing with the House investigation. And I’m hoping that that will building some momentum, because the Republicans have to be constantly pushed to put country above party. But I think it will more likely happen if we’re successful in taking back the house. That’s where investigations could come. Now, in the best of all worlds, if they would set up not a non-partisan, bi-partisan outside committee like we did for 9/11, and put people of unimpeachable integrity, both Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, but people who were willing to go where the facts led them, that would be ideal. I don’t see that happening right now.The only point I would make is if the Republican leadership begins to believe that Trump is a big political burden to them, then they will begin to be more open to a more thorough investigation.Mossberg: So what do you think the odds are that McConnell, not Ryan, but McConnell, will come to that conclusion?It all depends upon the numbers.Mossberg: You know this guy.Yeah, I do. And it all depends upon the numbers. I think that the Senate intelligence committee is working very well together from everything that I can see. You’ve got the Republican chairman, Senator Berg, working with the Democratic vice chairman, Senator Warner. They are pursuing a lot of leads. So I think both ... I mean, the House Committee is trying. I have to commend Adam Schiff, if any of you are in his district he’s doing an amazing job [applause]. He’s just so thorough and he’s so clear.So there are... there’s some movement. Now with the special prosecutor being appointed, and I served with him, when I was Secretary of State he was still at the FBI. He’s a man of great integrity. That will affect the pace of the investigation, it will affect what happened probably in the Congress, but it will move inexorably forward, because they will not be rebuffed the way that the Congress has been up until now.Nilay Patel: Hi, Nilay Patel, the Verge. I’m from Wisconsin. Why didn’t you spend more time in Wisconsin?Well, I will tell you. We thought we were doing really well in Wisconsin. I spent a lot of time in Pennsylvania, a lot of time in Florida. We sent a lot of great surrogates including Tim Kaine and others to Wisconsin.We watched up until the very end how Russ Feingold was winning. And you know, you make these scheduling decisions based on the best information that you have, and it turned out that our information was not as reliable as I wished it had been.Patel: Did you see that before, or is that in hindsight?That’s in hindsight, yeah. The other thing that’s in hindsight which is really troubling is — since you’re from Wisconsin you may find this particularly interesting — the AP did a really well-researched piece about voter suppression in Wisconsin. And they literally found people who showed up to vote and were turned away, because Wisconsin under the current governor, Scott Walker, has been one of the leaders in voter suppression, making it difficult. So the 85-year-old woman who doesn’t have a photo ID because she doesn’t drive anymore shows up with her medicare card and her utility bills and they turn her away.Or the African American. Or the veteran, also African American, who moves from Illinois to Wisconsin, registers to vote, gets on the rolls, but he still has his Illinois driver’s license, shows up, they turn him away. The best estimate is that 200,000 people in Wisconsin were either denied or chilled in their efforts to vote.I don’t think we believed at the time before the election that it would be anything like that, anything as big as that. So, I will also say that I referenced earlier, there were all these Google searches going on about WikiLeaks, and they were particularly prevalent, very high incidents, in certain counties in Wisconsin. So you had counties that had voted for Obama and were not particularly keen about voting for Trump but worried that I was going to jail, worried that I was running a child trafficking operation in the basement of a pizzeria, the kind of things that were in WikiLeaks [laughter].You laugh, people were obsessing over this stuff. Obsessing over it. And you put yourself in the position of a low-information voter, and all of a sudden your Facebook feed, your Twitter account is saying, “Oh my gosh, Hillary Clinton is running a child trafficking operation in Washington with John Podesta.” Well, you don’t believe it, but this has been such an unbelievable election, you kind of go, “Oh maybe I better look into that.”Swisher: Yeah, and you are a lizard.Yeah, and well, whatever I am, I’m everything. And so you being to get sucked into it. So some people stayed home, some people voted for Trump, some people stayed with me, and some people went third party, because they wanted to vote, they thought it was their duty, but they didn’t like Trump and now they thought I was as bad as they were being told. So it was a confluence of all kinds of things.Samantha Miller: My name is Samantha Miller, I’m known for founding one of the first cannabis labs in the U.S. And what I wanted to say to you is that I’m inspired by you as a leader, not as a woman.Mm, thank you, thank you very much [applause].Miller: And one of the questions I often get asked as an executive, what is some advice you can give to young women who want to attain success? I always say to them, the one thing that I point to for young women is if you can shed the need for external validation, because that’s the thing that often keeps you out of the board room, that’s a huge step to your success. So I would really appreciate what your advice to women is who are trying to achieve those heights of success.Well I would echo what you said. It is absolutely the case. You have to be better prepared than anybody. You have to know your stuff as well as you possibly can.You have to be brave because there’s going to be a lot of setbacks and push-backs and all the things that go with it. And you have to be aware of what, up until now, has been a pretty predictable pattern. You know, Sheryl Sandberg writes about this in “Lean In” and the research is convincing. So, as a man gets more successful, regardless of his personality, he gets more likeable. As a woman gets more successful, regardless of her personality, she gets less likeable. It is just inverse. And you have to ... Eleanor Roosevelt said, “If you’re going to be a woman in the public arena, you have to grow skin as thick as the hyde of a rhinoceros.” And you really do have to be prepared. And it’s not just in politics, it’s in business, it’s in, you know, the tech world, it’s everywhere. And it’s not easy.I mean, it’s really, really hard. And I just tell young women to develop more confidence in themselves. You know, I’ve hired lots of young people over the course of my long career, the private sector and the public sector, not-for-profit sector, and the conversation usually goes like this. You say to a young man, “I want to give you more responsibility, I want to give you a promotion, I want to pay you more.” And he goes, “Wow, great! I’m ready! Send me in!” Sometimes he says, “What took you so long?” in getting to that point.But for a young woman, it’s like, “You think I’m good enough? You really do? You think I can do it?” Well I wouldn’t be asking you if I didn’t. But there is still, even for upwardly mobile, successful young women, those doubts, that sense of insecurity. And then when you’re bombarded with expectations about how you’re supposed to look and how you’re supposed to act and what you’re supposed to say and all the rest of it, it can become very disorienting.So, I guess the final thing I would say is, it really is important both for men and women, for mothers and fathers, for employers of both genders, to be really ready to support young women, and to give them that confidence, that external confidence, but to do everything you can to help them weather all of the push-backs and knockdowns that are going to come their way. [applause]Mossberg: All right, we only have time for one more question, and it goes back over here.Swisher: So make it good.Mossberg: Yeah, make it good.Pete Pachal: All right, no pressure. Pete Pachal from Mashable. Looking at Twitter specifically, you spoke a little bit about Facebook, but on Twitter, if you weigh all its good qualities of bringing realtime information to pretty much everyone, and its bad qualities of basically rewarding sass over substance, and generally not having a lot of nuance, do you think it has been bad or good for our national discourse in the United States?Wow. Haha. Hmm. I think it has certainly provided, as you say, positive information, quick turn-around information, to a very large audience. But I think it has become victimized by deliberate efforts to shape the conversation, and push it towards conspiracies, lies, false information. And I think it’s the same problem that Facebook faces, that when you try to be all things to all people and you try to open up your platform so that people can come in, and you want to be influential because you expect people will actually tune you in and read and watch what you have, what do you do to try and contain the weaponization and manipulation of that information? I don’t think we know yet.And I have a lot of sympathy at this point. Kara doesn’t, but I do [KS laughs] for people trying to make these decisions. I would just urge them to hurry up. Because even if you err slightly more on the curating editorial decision-making, so some voices are going to be cut off, some fake news outlets, the guys in Macedonia are going to be denied entry into your platform, I’d rather see us erring on that side for a while to see what the effects are, instead of being kind of overwhelmed by the challenge, like, “What do you do?” I mean, how do you try and determine who should or shouldn’t be on your site? And so I think it’s a mixed bag.Let me just pose this question: Who is behind driving up Trump’s Twitter followers by the millions? We know they’re bots. Why? I assume there’s a reason for everything. Is it to make him look more popular than he is? Is it to try to influence others on Twitter about what the messaging is so that people get caught up in it and lose sight of what they’re trying to say?Mossberg: Well, it puts the Tweets on more feeds. More people’s feeds see the Tweets.Yeah, that’s my point. You’ve got millions of people ... the bots are coming in, you’ve got these repetitive arguments, you’re driving up his numbers. But what is it you’re trying to achieve? What is the message behind this? So you’re sitting in Moscow or Macedonia or the White House, wherever you are [laughter], and you’re saying, you know ... [WM laughs]Mossberg: Just three random places.That trip may not have worked out so well, you know, there’s no blowback.Mossberg: Really, pushing the guy. ..Pushing the guy, failing to reaffirm our commitment to NATO, all of that. And how do we recover from that? Well, we begin to divert people again. I mean, you can’t let Trump and his allies be a diversion. They are a threat. And they have been effective up until now. So Twitter is a perfect example. You’re going to drive up the numbers. You’ve got more people chasing rabbits down rabbit holes, you’ve got all kinds of stuff happening. Why? To divert attention. It’s like covfefe, trending, world wide. Maybe for a minute you’ll forget the latest accusations about them conspiring with Russia, or their trillion dollar mathematical mistake in their budget, or depriving 23 million people of health care.You know, it’s the circus. Right? It’s what a classic authoritarian does. It’s not just about influencing your institutions, your values. They want to influence your reality. And that to me is what we’re up against. And we can’t let that go unanswered, whether it’s on Twitter, Facebook, or anywhere else [applause].Swisher: Let’s end on that. That’s brilliant. Everybody, Hillary Clinton [applause].recode_divider"

So we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this (Paris) agreement."""	false	['Climate Change']	https://www.whitehouse.gov/	https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/06/01/statement-president-trump-paris-climate-accord	2017/06/05	Rose Garden3:32 P.M. EDTTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you. I would like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila. We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time. But it is really very sad as to what’s going on throughout the world with terror. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those affected.Before we discuss the Paris Accord, I’d like to begin with an update on our tremendous — absolutely tremendous — economic progress since Election Day on November 8th. The economy is starting to come back, and very, very rapidly. We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a million private sector jobs.I have just returned from a trip overseas where we concluded nearly $350 billion of military and economic development for the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. It was a very, very successful trip, believe me. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you.In my meetings at the G7, we have taken historic steps to demand fair and reciprocal trade that gives Americans a level playing field against other nations. We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you see that, you see it all over — from the previous administration, including getting many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against terror. Big, big contributions are being made by countries that weren’t doing so much in the form of contribution.One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the American people during my campaign for President –- whether it’s cutting job-killing regulations; appointing and confirming a tremendous Supreme Court justice; putting in place tough new ethics rules; achieving a record reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border; or bringing jobs, plants, and factories back into the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible. And believe me, we’ve just begun. The fruits of our labor will be seen very shortly even more so.On these issues and so many more, we’re following through on our commitments. And I don’t want anything to get in our way. I am fighting every day for the great people of this country. Therefore, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord — (applause) — thank you, thank you — but begin negotiations to reenter either the Paris Accord or a really entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers. So we’re getting out. But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. And if we can, that’s great. And if we can’t, that’s fine. (Applause.)As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of American citizens. The Paris Climate Accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American workers — who I love — and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production.Thus, as of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country. This includes ending the implementation of the nationally determined contribution and, very importantly, the Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States a vast fortune.Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Economic Research Associates. This includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs — not what we need — believe me, this is not what we need — including automobile jobs, and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely. They rely for so much, and we would be giving them so little.According to this same study, by 2040, compliance with the commitments put into place by the previous administration would cut production for the following sectors: paper down 12 percent; cement down 23 percent; iron and steel down 38 percent; coal — and I happen to love the coal miners — down 86 percent; natural gas down 31 percent. The cost to the economy at this time would be close to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs, while households would have $7,000 less income and, in many cases, much worse than that.Not only does this deal subject our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals. As someone who cares deeply about the environment, which I do, I cannot in good conscience support a deal that punishes the United States — which is what it does -– the world’s leader in environmental protection, while imposing no meaningful obligations on the world’s leading polluters.For example, under the agreement, China will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years — 13. They can do whatever they want for 13 years. Not us. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. There are many other examples. But the bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States.Further, while the current agreement effectively blocks the development of clean coal in America — which it does, and the mines are starting to open up. We’re having a big opening in two weeks. Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, so many places. A big opening of a brand-new mine. It’s unheard of. For many, many years, that hasn’t happened. They asked me if I’d go. I’m going to try.China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020. Think of it: India can double their coal production. We’re supposed to get rid of ours. Even Europe is allowed to continue construction of coal plants.In short, the agreement doesn’t eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States. The rest of the world applauded when we signed the Paris Agreement — they went wild; they were so happy — for the simple reason that it put our country, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very big economic disadvantage. A cynic would say the obvious reason for economic competitors and their wish to see us remain in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. We would find it very hard to compete with other countries from other parts of the world.We have among the most abundant energy reserves on the planet, sufficient to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty. Yet, under this agreement, we are effectively putting these reserves under lock and key, taking away the great wealth of our nation — it’s great wealth, it’s phenomenal wealth; not so long ago, we had no idea we had such wealth — and leaving millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness.The agreement is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries. At 1 percent growth, renewable sources of energy can meet some of our domestic demand, but at 3 or 4 percent growth, which I expect, we need all forms of available American energy, or our country — (applause) — will be at grave risk of brownouts and blackouts, our businesses will come to a halt in many cases, and the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life.Even if the Paris Agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree — think of that; this much — Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100. Tiny, tiny amount. In fact, 14 days of carbon emissions from China alone would wipe out the gains from America — and this is an incredible statistic — would totally wipe out the gains from America’s expected reductions in the year 2030, after we have had to spend billions and billions of dollars, lost jobs, closed factories, and suffered much higher energy costs for our businesses and for our homes.As the Wall Street Journal wrote this morning: “The reality is that withdrawing is in America’s economic interest and won’t matter much to the climate.” The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth. We’ll be the cleanest. We’re going to have the cleanest air. We’re going to have the cleanest water. We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to lose our jobs. We’re going to grow; we’re going to grow rapidly. (Applause.)And I think you just read — it just came out minutes ago, the small business report — small businesses as of just now are booming, hiring people. One of the best reports they’ve seen in many years.I’m willing to immediately work with Democratic leaders to either negotiate our way back into Paris, under the terms that are fair to the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects our country and its taxpayers. (Applause.)So if the obstructionists want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists. We will all sit down, and we will get back into the deal. And we’ll make it good, and we won’t be closing up our factories, and we won’t be losing our jobs. And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of the people that represent either the Paris Accord or something that we can do that’s much better than the Paris Accord. And I think the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of the world will be thrilled. But until we do that, we’re out of the agreement.I will work to ensure that America remains the world’s leader on environmental issues, but under a framework that is fair and where the burdens and responsibilities are equally shared among the many nations all around the world.No responsible leader can put the workers — and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, while empowering some of the world’s top polluting countries, should dispel any doubt as to the real reason why foreign lobbyists wish to keep our magnificent country tied up and bound down by this agreement: It’s to give their country an economic edge over the United States. That’s not going to happen while I’m President. I’m sorry. (Applause.)My job as President is to do everything within my power to give America a level playing field and to create the economic, regulatory and tax structures that make America the most prosperous and productive country on Earth, and with the highest standard of living and the highest standard of environmental protection.Our tax bill is moving along in Congress, and I believe it’s doing very well. I think a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised. The Republicans are working very, very hard. We’d love to have support from the Democrats, but we may have to go it alone. But it’s going very well.The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country’s expense. They don’t put America first. I do, and I always will. (Applause.)The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance. You see what’s happening. It’s pretty obvious to those that want to keep an open mind.At what point does America get demeaned? At what point do they start laughing at us as a country? We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers. We don’t want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore. And they won’t be. They won’t be.I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. (Applause.) I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve America’s interests. Many trade deals will soon be under renegotiation. Very rarely do we have a deal that works for this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation. The process has begun from day one. But now we’re down to business.Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, it includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund — nice name — which calls for developed countries to send $100 billion to developing countries all on top of America’s existing and massive foreign aid payments. So we’re going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else. Many of the other countries haven’t spent anything, and many of them will never pay one dime.The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars of which the United States has already handed over $1 billion — nobody else is even close; most of them haven’t even paid anything — including funds raided out of America’s budget for the war against terrorism. That’s where they came. Believe me, they didn’t come from me. They came just before I came into office. Not good. And not good the way they took the money.In 2015, the United Nation’s departing top climate officials reportedly described the $100 billion per year as “peanuts,” and stated that “the $100 billion is the tail that wags the dog.” In 2015, the Green Climate Fund’s executive director reportedly stated that estimated funding needed would increase to $450 billion per year after 2020. And nobody even knows where the money is going to. Nobody has been able to say, where is it going to?Of course, the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated. America is $20 trillion in debt. Cash-strapped cities cannot hire enough police officers or fix vital infrastructure. Millions of our citizens are out of work. And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us. So think of that.There are serious legal and constitutional issues as well. Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the world should not have more to say with respect to the U.S. economy than our own citizens and their elected representatives. Thus, our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of America’s sovereignty. (Applause.) Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the world, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. And I will.Staying in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States as we begin the process of unlocking the restrictions on America’s abundant energy reserves, which we have started very strongly. It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is the new reality we face if we do not leave the agreement or if we do not negotiate a far better deal.The risks grow as historically these agreements only tend to become more and more ambitious over time. In other words, the Paris framework is a starting point — as bad as it is — not an end point. And exiting the agreement protects the United States from future intrusions on the United States’ sovereignty and massive future legal liability. Believe me, we have massive legal liability if we stay in.As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to the American people. The Paris Accord would undermine our economy, hamstring our workers, weaken our sovereignty, impose unacceptable legal risks, and put us at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world. It is time to exit the Paris Accord — (applause) — and time to pursue a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country.It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania — along with many, many other locations within our great country — before Paris, France. It is time to make America great again. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.Thank you very much. Very important. I’d like to ask Scott Pruitt, who most of you know and respect, as I do, just to say a few words.Scott, please. (Applause.)ADMINISTRATOR PRUITT: Thank you, Mr. President. Your decision today to exit the Paris Accord reflects your unflinching commitment to put America first.And by exiting, you’re fulfilling yet one more campaign promise to the American people. Please know that I am thankful for your fortitude, your courage, and your steadfastness as you serve and lead our country.America finally has a leader who answers only to the people — not to the special interests who have had their way for way too long. In everything you do, Mr. President, you’re fighting for the forgotten men and women across this country. You’re a champion for the hardworking citizens all across this land who just want a government that listens to them and represents their interest.You have promised to put America First in all that you do, and you’ve done that in any number of ways — from trade, to national security, to protecting our border, to rightsizing Washington, D.C. And today you’ve put America first with regard to international agreements and the environment.This is an historic restoration of American economic independence — one that will benefit the working class, the working poor, and working people of all stripes. With this action, you have declared that the people are rulers of this country once again. And it should be noted that we as a nation do it better than anyone in the world in striking the balance between growing our economy, growing jobs while also being a good steward of our environment.We owe no apologies to other nations for our environmental stewardship. After all, before the Paris Accord was ever signed, America had reduced its CO2 footprint to levels from the early 1990s. In fact, between the years 2000 and 2014, the United States reduced its carbon emissions by 18-plus percent. And this was accomplished not through government mandate, but accomplished through innovation and technology of the American private sector.For that reason, Mr. President, you have corrected a view that was paramount in Paris that somehow the United States should penalize its own economy, be apologetic, lead with our chin, while the rest of world does little. Other nations talk a good game; we lead with action — not words. (Applause.)Our efforts, Mr. President, as you know, should be on exporting our technology, our innovation to nations who seek to reduce their CO2 footprint to learn from us. That should be our focus versus agreeing to unachievable targets that harm our economy and the American people.Mr. President, it takes courage, it takes commitment to say no to the plaudits of men while doing what’s right by the American people. You have that courage, and the American people can take comfort because you have their backs.Thank you, Mr. President.

NANCY PELOSI, D-CALI., MINORITY LEADER: How was he ever going to explain to his grandchildren what he did to the air they breathe?WALLACE: We’ll talk with one of the world's leading advocate on climate change, former Vice President Al Gore, who calls the president's withdrawal reckless and indefensible.Pruitt and Al Gore, live, only on ""Fox News Sunday.""Plus, former FBI Director James Comey testifies before Congress this week about his conversations with Mr. Trump. We’ll ask our Sunday panel about what promises to be a moment of high drama.All, right now, on ""Fox News Sunday.""(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: And hello again from Fox News in Washington.We begin with breaking news out of London, at least seven are dead and dozens injured after another terror attack targeted Britain's capital. This comes less than two weeks after a suicide bomber hit a pop concert in Manchester, England.In a few minutes, we’ll talk with Senator Roy Blunt, member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.But we begin with Fox team coverage, Catherine Herridge on what the intelligence community is saying. But, first, senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot live from our London bureau -- Greg.GREG PALKOT, FOX NEWS SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Chris, for the third time in three months, terror hits the U.K. and once again, it is ugly. It was on a busy Saturday night in London as the attackers spread across London Bridge in a rented van, driving up on the walkway, smashing into pedestrians. They then ditched that vehicle a few blocks away, and armed with long knives stabbed their way through bars and restaurants nearby, with some putting up a fight.All told, at least seven people were killed, 48 injured, many critically, including an off-duty police officer. Along with British citizens from France, Australia and elsewhere were targeted. No word yet on whether any Americans were involved.Now, police caught up with the attackers just eight minutes later, shooting that all three, at least one had a beard, camouflage pants and a fake suicide vest. When one attack he reportedly screamed out: Praise to Allah -- the Arabic word for God.Here is what U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May had to say today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: As a country, our response must be what it has always been, when we have been confronted by violence. We must come together, we must pull together and united we will take on and defeat our enemies.(END VIDEO CLIP)PALKOT: Police now say they have arrested 12 people following raids in eastern London, said to be the home of one of the attackers. It is a sign that authorities might be on the trail of the terrorist. Police also doing a thorough forensic search of the entire terrorist site, but what is next?Prime Minister Theresa May also said today terror breeds terror -- Chris.WALLACE: Greg Palkot, reporting from London -- Greg, thanks for that.Now, let's bring in chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge with the latest on who was behind the attack -- Catherine.CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Chris, no group is claiming responsibility this morning. But within minutes of the attack, a senior ISIS affiliated social media account pushed out slick propaganda on using vehicles as weapons, threatening more violence. It's not clear whether the ISIS posts were opportunistic or the terror group played a role. This morning, U.S. and U.K. intelligence are focused on the suspects and whether they acted alone or had a terror network behind them.British security sources reporting that very early indications suggest the attack may have been pulled together at short notice. With the rising homegrown threat, British police are trained to quickly neutralize suspects as they did last night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CRESSIDA DICK, LONDON METROPOLITAN POLICE COMMISSIONER: That vehicle continued to drive from London Bridge to the borough market. The suspects then left the vehicle and a number of people were stabbed. The suspects were shot dead by armed officers.(END VIDEO CLIP)HERRIDGE: Homeland Security is saying that at this time they have no information to indicate if specific credible threat to the United States. Secretary Kelly told Fox last night he worries we are, quote, right around the corner from having a similar attack but for the efforts of DHS and law enforcement agencies.President Trump was briefed last night and spoke with the British prime minister, expressing his condolences and praising the heroic response of London police and first responders.The president also seeming to make a political point that the attack bolstered his travel ban: We need to be smart, vigilant and tough, he tweeted. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the travel ban extra level of security -- safety.Questions are being raised this morning about a possible intelligence failure after the British government recently lower the threat level, Chris.WALLACE: Catherine, thank you.WALLACE: Joining me now, Roy Blunt, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.Senator, welcome back.SEN. ROY BLUNT, R-MISSOURI: Good to be with you.WALLACE: What can you add to what we just heard from Catherine Herridge?BLUNT: Well, you know, I think what we are seeing is such a broad band of potential attacks. We hear from our own intelligence community and have for years, more threats for more directions than ever before. You see the terrible Manchester bombing, those young people, mostly young women, young girls, with a fairly sophisticated bomb, based on published reports on that.These guys have a van and kitchen knives. We think other groups are looking at more advanced kinds of attacks. So, clearly, this is from all directions, is tends to take credit for the things that you can steal a truck, get your van, drive in a car, terrorized people with very little planning or backup. Other groups we believe are looking at other things and we are constantly have to be vigilant, I think Secretary Kelly is right when he says that only because we have been fortunate and worked hard to prevent this have we not had these kinds of attacks here.WALLACE: I want to play a clip from British Prime Minister May today. Here it is.(BGEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAY: While the recent attacks are not connected by common networks, they are connected in one important sense. They are bound together by the single evil ideology of Islamist extremism.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Any explanation as to why we have seen three fatal terror attacks in Britain in less than three months?BLUNT: I don't know if there's any real explanation for that, but in Paris and London and Western Europe, generally, it got people who came there to do jobs that were allowed to stay in enclaves, never became part of the society. You see the second generation of those families often turning to what the prime minister mentioned, you know, we need to say, we need to talk about it, our friends who are Muslim need to admit that this extreme sense of Islam that results in these attacks has to be called for what it is and we have to try to do what we can to intervene.WALLACE: Do we have -- I’ve heard the argument that because we are beginning to roll back ISIS in the so-called caliphate in Iraq and Syria, that there is an increased emphasis on these attacks, these kind of low technology attacks in the West. Do you think our success in one place is creating more of a threat?BLUNT: I think you can. You know, somebody made the observation that long ago that sometimes countries implode. Syria seems to have exploded. That as things change in Syria, people have access to Europe in ways that you would otherwise want to try and do something about.There's no way to do background checks on people that come in from communities that no longer exist, jobs that were jobs months or years ago. And so, I think we do see that. And, you know, like so many of the things that happened in Northern Africa, what people initially thought would be the result would turn out to be just the opposite.WALLACE: As a member of the Senate Intelligence committee, any indication of an increased terror threat here in the U.S.?BLUNT: I think the terror threat is real. You know, one of the things -- when we've seen things like San Bernardino, more often than not, U.S. officials, the FBI and others talk to these people, after months of surveillance decided they no longer needed to be under the level of watch they were and then suddenly these kinds of things happen.I do think, again, that you've got some groups that are looking at a big play like taking down an airliner. You've got others who need very little support, very little planning, and can do incredible damage, which is actually in many ways almost more of terrorism because you go anywhere, do anything, you wonder what could happen at any moment. It could happen here --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: -- in London Bridge on a Saturday night.BLUNT: London Bridge, the Westminster Bridge, the concert.WALLACE: The concert, yes.BLUNT: All of these things are true terror targets. They’re not -- it's not like going after the U.S. embassy.WALLACE: Right.BLUNT: They are true terror targets.WALLACE: As Catherine mentioned just after the news broke about this terror attack, President Trump tweeted another call for his travel ban. That case is now before the U.S. Supreme Court. Do you think the justices should pay attention to the kind of thing that is happening in England and other parts of the world as they make that decision?I mean, the fact is, in Britain, most of these terrorists have been homegrown. They've been U.K. citizens.BLUNT: They have been. And, you know, looking at where people like that who come to our country have been is important. I’m not nearly as concerned as a lot of people are about the visa waiver program, because the visa waiver program just triggers that you can spend more time on people who you have reason to believe may have been in Libya, may have been in Syria, may have become radicalized.I don’t know what the court will decide. I’m not a lawyer. I think my view is the president does have certainly the right to put in place extreme vetting. And, Christ, it’s been four -- it's been four months since I said they needed four months to put that in place. I think you can do that without a travel ban and hopefully we are.WALLACE: I want to talk to you about another hat as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. A lot of anticipation about the testimony this week from FBI -- former FBI Director James Comey, what you expect to hear from him? What questions do you have for him?BLUNT: Well, I think it's important that we talk to everybody who should be talk to about this. I do believe that the Senate Intelligence Committee is the most likely place to bring this investigation to conclusion with whatever the conclusion turns out to be. You know, we used to dealing with each other on issues like this, so we are used to classify documents, we’re used to coming together to protect the country. Hopefully, that's what we will be able to do --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: What are you looking to ask (ph) from Comey?BLUNT: We -- what Comey says and how he says that I think will be important. I haven't frankly understood much of what Comey has done since about a year ago. And his decisions have been, I think, highly questionable. We’ll see what -- why he was prepared for that meeting the way he was, said he had a round of murder board kind of questions before he went to see the president, why he thought it was important to immediately download that, and what other meetings he had that frankly he didn't think were so important to download what happen.WALLACE: Finally, do you think that President Trump has a legitimate claim to executive privilege to block Comey from testifying? And as a practical matter, do you think he should invoke it?BLUNT: I think the president is better served by getting all this information out. Sooner rather than later, let's find out what happened and bring this to a conclusion. You don't do that I think by invoking executive privilege on a conversation you had apparently with nobody else in the room. You know, most stories have two sides to them. At some point, we’ll hear the president’s side. But I frankly think we need to hear Mr. Comey's side and find out what other questions we need to ask after he answers the questions this week.WALLACE: Senator Blunt, thank you. Thanks for your time this Sunday. And thank you for coming in on short notice.BLUNT: Glad to be here.WALLACE: Up next, President Trump's dramatic decision this week to pull out of the Paris climate accord. We’ll talk with EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, a key player in the president's deliberations.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: A look outside the beltway at Pittsburgh. The president said he's looking out for residents of the former steel town in pulling out of the Paris climate deal.International leaders, business executives and people around the world are still reacting to President Trump's decision this week. In a few minutes, we’ll talk with former Vice President Al Gore, a leading advocate on climate change.Joining me now is Scott Pruitt, Mr. Trump's administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency and a key player in the president's decision.Mr. Pruitt, welcome back to ""Fox News Sunday.""SCOTT PRUITT, EPA ADMINISTRATOR: Good morning, Chris.WALLACE: I want to start with a question that you were asked repeatedly on Friday. Here it is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARY BRUCE, ABC NEWS: Yes or no, does the president believe that the climate change is real and a threat to the United States?PHILIP RUCKER, WASHINGTON POST: Does the president believe today that climate change is a hoax?PRUITT: What's interesting about all the discussions we had through the last several weeks have been focused on one singular issue: is Paris good or not for this country?(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Let me get this straight, you and the president spent weeks discussing whether he should pull out of the Paris climate deal and you never discussed climate change?PRUITT: It was about the merits and demerits of the deal, Chris.(CROSSTALK)PRUITT: That’s what the focus.Look, when you look at what this country has achieved since the late 1990s-2000 time frame, we've seen an 18 percent reduction in CO2 footprint from 2000 to 2014. We’re at pre-1994 levels.You know, what's interesting about all this criticism from the left, environment left, is if you go back to the time when the Paris deal was cut, those same groups -- in fact, James Hansen, former national scientist, called it a fake and a fraud. The general counsel of the Sierra Club was critical of what was achieved in Paris because it didn't hold China, it did not hold India accountable, and the United States agreed to 26 percent to 28 percent reductions, in CHD (ph).(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: We’re going to get into all of that, but what I’m asking you is, as the president’s EPA administrator, as his point person on the environment, isn’t that a conversation that over the last few months that you have to have, whether or not climate change is real or a hoax, as the president suggested, and whether or not human activity contributes to it? Are you saying you've never had that conversation with him?PRUITT: The focus of the last several weeks was centered --WALLACE: I’m asking you over the last few months --PRUITT: -- was centered on the merits and demerits of the Paris agreement. The president said -- said actually back during the campaign, that climate change occurs. I’ve said -- I’ve said during my confirmation process that climate change is occurring. That human activity contributes to it.WALLACE: He also said it was a hoax.PRUITT: Well, Chris, the point here, and to your question, this is something over the last several weeks, the president has received much information about the impact on jobs and also the impact on the environment. You know, we have nothing to be apologetic about as a country with respect to what we've done in reducing our CO2 footprint. It’s also --WALLACE: I don’t want to be a --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: -- but you’re not going to tell me whether or not the president believes climate change is a hoax and whether or not human activity -- it's a simple question.PRUITT: The president has indicated that the climate changes. It's always changing. I’ve indicated the same.WALLACE: Well, that’s the same --(CROSSTALK)PRUITT: What's important, Chris, here -- what’s important is what the president did on Thursday is put America first and say to the United States and say to the world that we’re going to remain engaged, but we’re also going to make sure that as we remain engage, we put America’s interest first.WALLACE: As you pointed out, the president justified pulling out of the Paris deal largely on economic terms. Here he is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: But the study that the president cited was funded by two groups that are dramatically opposed to environmental regulation and the study itself acknowledges it does -- this is a quote from the study -- it does not take into account the potential benefits from avoided emissions. The study results are not a benefit-cost analysis of climate change.PRUITT: Well, there were several --WALLACE: Administrator, it is a worst-case scenario.PRUITT: There were several studies that were actually published in response to Paris. NERA, the Heritage study, the Global Policy publication --WALLACE: You specifically quoted NERA.PRUITT: There were several and -- that were sourced aspects as part of the speech.And what we know from the Paris agreement objectively is that it was a $2.5 trillion contraction to our economy over ten years. What we do know is it impacted up to 400,000 jobs in this country. What we do know is it impacted both the manufacturing base and energy sector jobs.You know, since last -- the fourth quarter of 2016, Chris, we've had almost 50,000 jobs created in the mining and coal sector alone. In fact, in the month of May, almost 7,000 jobs.So, these individuals that are -- I think what’s also being missed here is that when you look at how we generate electricity in this country, the power grid. We need to feel diversity. We need coal, natural gas, hydro, renewables, nuclear, as part of that mix, because it provides stability and strength to our grid and lower cost. Our price per kilowatt compared to Germany, our price per kilowatt compared to Europe is far better and it helps us grow jobs in this country.WALLACE: Mr. Pruitt, aren’t you focusing on the wrong thing?I want to put up some, I’m going to say, surprising statistics. Take a look at this -- the U.S. now employs more than double the number of people in the solar industry than it does in coal. Aren’t you and the president talking about protecting the horse and buggy business just as cars come online?PRUITT: Absolutely not, because as I just indicated, we need hydro -- we need hydrocarbon stored on-site at utility companies across this country to address something, attacks on our grid, attacks on infrastructure, if we have peaked demand needs, you want a diversity of fuels that generate electricity. It is bad business -- it is bad business for a country to limit the --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: President Trump talks about protecting the people of Pittsburgh. The mayor of Pittsburgh said we’re not a steel town anymore, we’re a green town and, in fact, he rejected what the president said. And the mayor of Pittsburgh, the city he specifically cited, said, we’re going to comply with the Paris climate accord.PRUITT: This president has said that we truly need an all-of-the-above approach. We should not penalize sectors of our economy, Chris. Government regulation shouldn't be used to pick winners and losers. The past administration declared a war on coal and there were several coal facilities across the country shut down because of their past efforts. That is not what government regulation should be about.Government regulation should be about making things regular, not picking winners and losers, and making sure we have fuel diversity and generating electricity in this country. And as I indicated, the jobs numbers show already, already, that this president's deregulatory agenda, his leadership in the energy space is making a difference for jobs across this country, almost 50,000 in the coal sector --WALLACE: I want to go to another issue, because the president also said that the Paris climate accord and pulling out of it isn't going to make all that much difference on the environment. Here he is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: With total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree -- think of that, this much.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: But the people behind the MIT study, that study that he just cited say that he took a number from 2014 before the targets for the Paris accord were even reached. And the cofounder of the program said this about the White House: They found a number that made the point they want to make. It’s kind of a debate trick.The people behind the study the president cited say, look, Paris isn’t going to solve everything. It isn’t going to solve global warming, but it makes an important contribution.PRUITT: What short memories these folks have. What short memories they have.James Hansen, former NASA scientist, the father of climate change, he's been called, called Paris a fake and a fraud, because of the very things the president cited. Two-tenths of one -- there are other studies. The Global Policy publication came out criticizing --WALLACE: Are you going to speak to what the MIT authors --(CROSSTALK)PRUITT: Look, it’s very fishy to me that MIT updated their study or their results after we started citing it. No one is questioning their methodology. Nobody’s questioning their findings.WALLACE: Well, in fact, you didn’t cite their study after Paris. You cited their study before Paris, in 2014.PRUITT: What's interesting, Chris, is during the time before Paris, before Paris, this country reduce their CO2 footprint by over 18 percent, from 2000 to 2014. What does that demonstrate? It demonstrates that American innovation, American technology is leading the way with respect to reducing the CO2 footprint, not government mandate.If China and India want to reduce their CO2 footprint, they should learn from us.WALLACE: Well --PRUITT: India, by the way, in the Paris agreement, talk about the merits of the deal, Chris, conditioned any steps that they would take on receiving $2.5 trillion of aid. China agreed to make no steps until the year 2030. They’re the largest polluters in the world.WALLACE: Let me -- let me pick up on that because you've taken me exactly where I want to go.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Yes, this is working together.The president had one more big complaint about Paris and he said that it treats the U.S. unfairly.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can't build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: But here again, sir, the reality is different, is very different from what the president said. China has canceled plans for more than 100 coal plants and promises 20 percent of its energy consumption will be green by 2030. India has pledged 40 percent of its energy will be renewable by 2030. And it’s set to pass Japan this year as the world's third-largest market for solar power.So, it may not mandate it in the Paris agreement, but, in fact, China and India are going green already.PRUITT: You know, what’s interesting -- one of the keywords that was up on the screen was plans. China was actually building over 360 new coal generation facilities and had 800 planned, Chris. So, maybe they've drawn back on the number that are planned, but they’re burning coal. And they’re going to continue to burn coal.WALLACE: Well, we are burning coal.PRUITT: Just for foreseeable future.We’ve got a contraction with respect to our grid, quite substantially. We used to be well above 40 percent. We’re now down around 30 percent, if not less.So, this country has frontloaded its costs. The rest of the world said, hey, we’ll get to that later. They applauded when -- when we joined Paris, the rest of the world applauded, not because of climate reductions, but because it put this country at an economic disadvantage. We -- the Clean Power Plan alone, the Clean Power Plan alone represented almost $300 million of compliance cost to our economy.So, why wouldn’t Paris -- excuse me, why wouldn’t France and these other countries want us to stay in that kind of deal? It's a bad deal for this country. The president didn't say, by the way, that we weren’t going to continue engagement. The president -- he said Paris represents a bad deal for this country.WALLACE: He also said we’re going to renegotiate and all of the leaders around the world, certainly in Europe, said: forget it.PRUITT: Well, then, he also said, either a new deal or as part of the Paris agreement.But we’re already part -- look, we are the United States, Chris. We don't lose our seat at the table. We joined the treaty in 1992, called the UNFCCC, with respect to climate change.WALLACE: All right.PRUITT: And that is still there. We’re going to remain engaged internationally, but we’re going to make sure that as we make deals, that we put the interest of America first. This was applauded by small business.You know, it was interesting. The New York Times yesterday had an article that a small business that applauded --WALLACE: I don't want you to filibuster so we can't get to Al Gore. We want to get to him.PRUITT: OK.WALLACE: You brought up a lot of legitimate points I’m going to ask him about.Mr. Pruitt, thank you for your time. Always good to talk with you.PRUITT: Thank you.WALLACE: And thank you for answering our questions.PRUITT: Thanks, Chris.WALLACE: That's what it's all about.Up next, former Vice President Al Gore on Mr. Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris accord.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Coming up, former FBI Director James Comey is set to testify before Congress this week about his conversations with the president.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-SOUTH CAROLINA: I hope this hearing doesn't become a hitch on President Trump. There's a cloud over the presidency that needs to be removed.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: We’ll ask our Sunday panel what to expect.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Former Vice President Al Gore's breakthrough documentary, ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" brought the topic of climate change to the forefront. Not surprisingly, he is one of the sharpest critics of Mr. Trump's decision this week. We welcome him for what we believe is his first appearance on Fox News since the 2000 campaign.Mr. Vice President, good to have you back.AL GORE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Great to be back, Chris. Thank you for inviting me.WALLACE: Before we get to climate change, I want to ask you about this terrible attack in London. How do we stop these attacks on the west and is President Trump's travel been part of the answer?GORE: Well, most of the attacks, both in England and here in the United States, have been by homegrown terrorists. And, of course, the courts will deal with the travel ban. They've already been struck down. We’ll see what the Supreme Court does.This surge of terrorism, we -- we have to defeat it, but we have to defeat it not only with the force of arms, but with the force of our values. And I truly believe that giving people around the world a sense that the world’s got our act together and we’re going to move forward to a bright future is one of the important tasks at hand.WALLACE: Let's turn to the subject at hand.You met with President-elect Trump during the transition to discuss climate change and afterwards you said this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GORE: I had a -- a lengthy and very productive session with the president-elect. It was a sincere search for areas of common ground.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: You also talked with Mr. Trump, we’re told, last month about staying in the Paris climate deal. Did you misjudge the president?GORE: Well, I've kept my communications with him confidential. I think that's the right way to handle it. But none of it would surprise you. I did my best to persuade him it was in our country's best interest to stay in the Paris agreement. I -- I thought there was a chance that he would do that. I'm sorry that he made the other decision.WALLACE: How do you explain it?GORE: Well, you’d have to ask him for the explanation. It makes no sense to me. I think that it was a reckless decision, and indefensible decision. I think it undermines our nations standing in the world and isolates us and threatens to harm humanity's ability to solve this crisis in time.But, make no mistake about it, the -- this country is going to continue to solve the climate crisis. Governors like Jerry Brown and Andrew Cuomo, Jay Inslee, many others, mayors, Mike Bloomberg’s doing a great job rallying mayors around the country. We are going to continue reducing emissions. Atlanta just decided to go 100 percent renewable and there are many, many others.WALLACE: Let’s talk -- and I -- you heard me challenge Scott Pruitt. I’m going to challenge you. Let's talk about some of the concerns that people have about Paris. President Trump talked about one.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: It includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United States through the so-called ""green climate fund,"" nice name.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Under the Paris Accord, 37 developed countries agreed to provide $100 billion to developing countries. Why is that fair?GORE: Well, you know, when the Marshall Plan was launched by the United States after World War II, it ended up benefiting us tremendously, as well as making the world a better place. We would have been -- we would be 11th on the list of nations per capita in -- in helping the country to meet this climate challenge. And, by the way, one of the opportunities for us is to export our products and create more jobs here. You showed some jobs in the solar industry earlier. Solar jobs are now growing 17 times faster than other jobs. It's the brightest spot. If we get out there in the economy, if we get out there and help lead the sustainability revolution, it benefits our economy.WALLACE: But here's the thing -- problem I think a lot of people have. Countries like the U.S., which have been developing an industrial economy since the 19th century, the argument is that somehow we owe something to countries that didn't.GORE: Well, it’s a global challenge in the world community as a whole has to -- has to face up to it. This administration has said there's no such thing as a global community. Actually, there is, because we, as a civilization, are putting 110 million tons of heat trapping global warming pollution up into the sky every day as if it's an open sewer.And, you know, the climate crisis is real, Chris. I -- I’m -- I'm sure you know that. President Trump won't say whether he believes it's real or not. But -- but it is real. And you don't have to rely on the virtually unanimous opinion of the scientific community anymore. Mother nature is telling us every night on the TV news now is like a nature hike through the book of Revelation. People are noticing this, these downpours and historic floods. We’ve had 11 once in a thousand year downpours in the U.S. just in the last ten years. We’ve got these wildfires that become mega fires now. We’ve got a -- 70 percent of Florida’s in drought today. Missouri declared an emergency just a couple of days ago because another -- of another one of these. And they keep on coming.WALLACE: But let me pick up on that because let's say that we agree and you know a lot of people don't, some people don't. Some people that watch Fox News don't.GORE: Right. Of course.WALLACE: Even if you believe in greenhouse gas and climate change, there’s some questions about how effective the Paris Accord is --GORE: Yes.WALLACE: In dealing with it. Here's what EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said on Friday about the effectiveness of the U.S. target, which is to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by a quarter under 2005 levels. Here he is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRUITT: Paris, it set targets at 26 to 28 percent with the entire agenda of the previous administration, we still fell 40 percent short of those targets. It was a failed deal to begin with.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: You would agree that even if all 195 nations, now 194, met their targets, it still wouldn't solve the problem.GORE: That is correct. However, it sends a very powerful signal to business and industry and civil society, and countries around the world. And since the Paris agreement was reached, look at what has happened. You talked about China earlier. China has now reduced its emissions four years in a row. It's reduced its coal burning three years in a row. India is now in the midst of a massive shift from coal to solar. Unbelievably, India just announced two weeks ago that within 13 years, 100 percent of their automobiles are going to have to be electric vehicles. We’re seeing this in this country as well. I went to one of the most conservative Republican cities in America, Georgetown, Texas, in an oil state. They have just completed a transition to 100 percent renewable energy.WALLACE: But -- but -- but that’s part of the argument, Mr. Vice President, and it's a philosophical argument, do you need government regulations or will the economy -- will the market work? And -- and we took the case of solar, which has now doubled, pretty astonishing.GORE: Yes.WALLACE: Well, actually, we got some stats here, so we’ll do it. Greenhouse gas emissions already declined 12 percent below 2005 levels.Between 2004-2015, investment in green, clean energy rose from $10 billion to $56 billion. And as we point out now, twice as many jobs in solar as in coal. Isn't the country, isn’t the world going green on its own? Does it need this government -- this international regulation?GORE: The -- the answer is yes and yes. We’re in the midst of a sustainability revolution that has the magnitude of the industrial revolution, but the speed of the digital revolution. But, yes, we still need good policies because we have to move faster. We’re in a race against time here. We’re seeing very encouraging changes. But we have to change faster.The late economist Rudi Dornbusch, I’m sure you knew him, he once said, things take longer to happen than you think they will and then they happen much faster than you thought they could. And the Paris agreement was a successful effort to send the signal, this train is leaving the station, everybody on board. The U.S. should be on board. States and cities and businesses and civil society leaders are on board. If we had the president onboard an end good policy, we could move even faster.WALLACE: I fact-checked Mr. Pruitt. I’m going to fact-check you.GORE: OK.WALLACE: After your movie ""An Inconvenient Truth"" came out in 2006, you made the following comments as part of our publicity for the -- the movie. You said unless we took, quote, ""drastic measures,"" the world would reach a ""point of no return"" within ten years and you called it a ""true planetary emergency."" We’re 11 years later.GORE: Oh.WALLACE: Weren’t you wrong?GORE: Well, we have seen a decline in emissions for the first -- on -- on a global basis for the first time they've stabilized and started to decline. So some of the responses of the last ten years have helped.But, unfortunately, and regrettably, a lot of serious damage has been done. Greenland, for example, is losing 1 cubic kilometer of ice every single day. I went down to Miami and saw fish from the ocean swimming in the streets on a sunny day. The same thing was true in Honolulu just two days ago, just from high tides because of the sea level rising. Now, we are going to suffer some of these consequences, but we can limit and avoid the most catastrophic consequences if we accelerate the pace of change that’s now beginning.WALLACE: Mr. Vice President, we should point out, you have a sequel coming up called ""An Inconvenient Sequel,"" in July, and I understand that you’re going to have to rewrite the ending because of the decision the president was made -- just made.GORE: The -- the -- the directors, Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk, are putting a -- a new segment at the very end of the movie and I think that’s appropriate.WALLACE: Thank you. Thanks for joining us. Let's not wait another 17 years.GORE: Deal.WALLACE: OK.Up next, we’ll bring in our Sunday group to discuss a moment of high drama this week when former FBI Director James Comey testifies before the Senate Intelligence Committee.Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about what we can expect to learn from Comey. Just go to Facebook or Twitter @foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)QUESTION: Is the White House going to invoke executive privilege to prevent James Comey from testifying before the Senate Intelligence Panel next week?SEAN SPICER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The date for that hearing was just set. I have not spoken to counsel yet. I don't know what -- what that -- what they’re going to -- how they’re going to respond.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer not answering whether the White House will try to block the former FBI director from talking to Congress on Thursday.And it’s time now for our Sunday group, Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume, columnist for The Hill, Juan Williams. Julie Pace, who covers the White House for The Associated Press, and Jason Riley from The Wall Street Journal.Well, Julie, as we say, the White House refuses to say, it The New York Times is reporting over the weekend that the president is unlikely to invoke executive privilege to block Comey from testifying, one, because it would be a P.R. disaster and, two, because his legal case is kind of weak. Question, what are you hearing from your sources?JULIE PACE, ASSOCIATED PRESS: Well, as recently as this morning, what I’ve heard is that the president is leaning toward not invoking executive privilege for Comey’s testimony, but this is still an open decision. This is something that is going to be discussed in the coming days. And as we all know, with this president, it's not a final decision until it really comes --WALLACE: Why are they fooling around with this?PACE: I -- well, I think there are a couple reasons. I think, one, it actually is a discussion because they are worried about what Comey could potentially say, but they also recognize that if you do invoke executive privilege, just the optics of that makes it look like you're hiding something, makes it look like whatever Comey might say is going to be problematic for the president.They think they have a little bit of a wiggle room here. I think if they don't invoke executive privilege and Comey does say something that is damaging to the president, what you’re going to hear administration officials point out is that in previous testimony that Comey has -- has done on Capitol Hill, the FBI has had to correct it. There have been questions about things that he said. I think that’s the argument that they’re going to be starting to make.But, again, leaning toward ""no."" Still an open discussion.WALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel and we got a bunch on just this issue. Here’s one we got on Twitter from hatedirtypolitics. ""Why did he,"" Comey, ""wait so long to come out and say he was threatened by POTUS? Why after he was fire? And is this revenge for being fired?""Jason, I have to say, a lot of our viewers are asking, why didn't Comey either resign or blow the whistle as soon as he believed the president was somehow trying to impede his investigation?JASON RILEY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: It’s an excellent question. Instead, he simply took some notes and share them with a few people. But if he really thought that Trump had engaged in obstruction of justice, I think he had a duty to come forward and report that to higher officials in the Justice Department and certainly go public with it. He didn't do that, which suggest to me that he didn't think what Trump did really amounted to obstruction of justice, right?BRITT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Remember, this, Chris, about obstruction of justice. There has to be -- it has to be an impeding investigation in a corrupt way, which is to say for political reasons or some other illegitimate reason, to ask and FBI director is -- what we know of the meeting, that if it’s -- you know, if he can’t see -- if he could see his way clear to letting the investigation go, since this is about Mike Flynn—WALLACE: On Mike Flynn.HUME: Flynn had just been fired. My guess is, if Comey looked at that and took -- took the view that it was -- he was being asked if he could do it, if he could -- in his view was he couldn't see his way clear to do that. He didn't do it. And then you later had testimony from him and also from his deputy that said there’d been no real effort -- no effort to impede the investigation. So I suspected, as Jason says, Comey did not think he was -- there was obstruction of justice involved here or he would have said so. And this is a guy that’s proved more than once that he’s always ready to threaten to quit. He does that all the time. And, by the way, you’re -- you’re -- the viewers’ question said, did he threaten Comey? He didn’t threaten Comey that we know of.WALLACE: Juan.JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think if Comey had come forward and done that at that moment it would have been grandstanding and it would have imped the ongoing investigation. So I don’t think -- even if he saw it as constituting obstruction of justice, it wouldn’t have been appropriate. What was appropriate as to make it part of the investigation and see where it went from there.I -- I think, though, you know, at this point, there’s so much fear in the White House of what is coming. They have now formed their own group to try to get ahead of this curve. But this remains a dark cloud over the president.WALLACE: You know, Britt, there’s -- there’s a -- the legal issue as to whether it’s obstruction of justice. There’s also the political issue. You and I have covered a lot of these big hearings for all of Washington. And a lot of the country stops to wait to see the -- the key witness raise his hand and take the oath. How potentially politically damaging, maybe not legally -- not a case -- a case for prosecution -- but how politically damaging could this potentially be?HUME: It could be damaging if -- but I -- I don't think Juan's explanation holds up very well and I don't think Comey’s in any position to come in and say, yes, he tried to obstructed justice and I kept quiet about it. I don’t -- that won’t work, in my view.And the other factor we have to keep in mind --WALLACE: No, but if he just says what he supposedly wrote in this memo, it’s damaging.HUME: Yes, but it’s --WALLACE: Not -- not -- I don’t mean it’s a legal case, but --HUME: But that’s -- but that's already -- but that’s already out there, whatever damage has been done on that is -- it might be reinforced for a couple of days, but that doesn't really change the -- change the atmosphere or move the ball very much.And remember this, Chris, he will be under the same strictures as he was when he was in office about discussions of an ongoing investigation. He really can't do that much, which -- which is why I think this hearing, like so many others before it, will probably not quite live up to its (INAUDIBLE), although the coverage is going to be unbelievable.PACE: Well, I think we’re -- and one of the important things to keep in mind is that the amount of damage that this hearing creases is tied to how the president responds. The president is going to be watching the hearing like everybody else and we've seen that he has an inability to prevent himself from reacting. So if he is tweeting in real time, if he is giving interviews afterward where he’s weighing in --WALLACE: Yes, Comey does that (INAUDIBLE).PACE: You know, as a journalist, we always like to hear -- we always like to hear from the president.WALLACE: You’d like that, wouldn’t you?PACE: But -- but some of the damage will be within his control.WALLACE: Jason.RILEY: That's the damage. Sean Spicer, the White House press spokesman, came out and said, we want to talk about infrastructure this week. How much are we going to be talking about infrastructure with his hearing going on this week? That's the political damage. It keeps this in the news and instead of being focused on advancing an agenda on whether it's infrastructure or health care reform or tax reform, we’re talking about the drip, drip, drip from this investigation.WILLIAMS: You know it wouldn’t -- this would -- Bob Mueller would not be a special counsel in this deal if we didn't have word of just this kind of interaction between Comey and the president and the pressure on Jeff Sessions.HUME: I don't think we have any way of knowing if that's true.WILLIAMS: I think that’s true.HUME: Remember, Juan --WILLIAMS: No.HUME: This is primarily -- and has always been, and has always been described as a counterintelligence investigation --WILLIAMS: Correct.HUME: To get to the bottom of what the Russians tried to do to hack the election. And, of course, as a part of that, but just a part, was the question of whether there had been collusion between the --WILLIAMS: Correct.HUME: Between the Trump campaign and the Russians. So that’s a piece of it, but it’s not the main thrust of it, necessarily.WILLIAMS: But it is and it has tremendous political damage --HUME: It isn’t. It is not.WILLIAMS: Tremendous collateral damage for the president. And the reason we’re discussing obstruction of justice and whether or not it would have been inappropriate for Jim Comey to come forward at that moment is because this investigation continues. In fact, it’s escalated, Britt.HUME: I would agree with that entirely. It would tell -- which is another reason why I’ve said and will say again that this case has traveled farther on less evidence -- I'm talking about the collusion piece of it -- than any scandal I think I've ever seen.WALLACE: All right --WILLIAMS: So you know that, in fact, that what intelligence agencies have said, Russia definitely interfered in the election.WALLACE: OK.HUME: What's the underlying crime? What’s the crime?WILLIAMS: The underlying crime potentially -- and that’s why I disagree with you, would be obstruction of justice by the president of the United States.HUME: There’s been one crime identified and Mike Flynn was the victim of the -- of the leaking of his unmasked name.WILLIAMS: That’s the -- you think that's the crime?HUME: That’s the only crime that’s been so far identified.WILLIAMS: Oh, I see. And Mike Flynn meeting with the Russian ambassador --HUME: That’s --WILLIAMS: To try to undercut the Obama sanctions, that doesn't bother you? Come on.HUME: That’s not a -- that's not a crime.WILLIAMS: Oh, OK.WALLACE: All right. In any case -- you know, this is kind of a -- a Fox News Sunday panel classic, Juan and Brit back at it again.As we mentioned earlier, President Trump made a new push last night for his travel ban in a tweet while the attack in London was still unfolding. He's taking the case to the Supreme Court. Here's what Vice President Pence had to say this week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The ability to come into the United States of America is a privilege, not a right.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Jason, does this latest attack add new impetus to the president's call for a travel ban?RILEY: I -- I don't think it does. He clearly does. I mean he was linking it in -- in his tweets. But the United Kingdom is not part of the -- the list of countries that would be subjected to the ban, a, and -- and, b, again, as -- as -- as previous guests earlier said, Senator Borne (ph), I believe, mostly these are homegrown folks. That Manchester bomber was someone who had been born and raised in Manchester and so on. And here, domestically, a lot of you talked to the homeland security officials. That's what they're worried about, people already here being radicalized.And then you see the timeline that the administration laid out for this temporary ban. They wanted several months -- they’ve had several months. So, no, I don’t -- I don’t think -- what -- what struck me about this, though, is -- is Trump, again, tweeting and -- and -- and -- and talking about this publically. And that has been a problem in these court cases that have come up so far. The judges have been throwing his words back at him, saying they speak to a state of mind here. And I think that -- again, he has to be more disciplined in how he talked about this issue.WALLACE: Julie -- Julie, I want to pick up on that because the whole band, which was -- which was put out, the original ban, on January 27th, one week in, talked about 90 day delay, 120 day delay while they put together an extreme vetting plan. We’re now 130 days into this administration. Why didn't they put together the extreme vetting plan so they don’t have to worry about a ban?PACE: It's a great question. That extreme vetting plan is essentially nowhere. And what we were told at the end of the first week is that the rushed rollout of the original ban was because the threat was so urgent. And certainly I think that argument has been undermined by the fact that there hasn’t been a major attack in the U.S. during that period and that the administration has not moved quickly on the extreme vetting.And just to Jason’s point there, and it ties back into what we were talking about with Comey, the White House has been focused on this idea that this is not a travel ban. They don't want to use this language. And then the president, last night, puts that language back out on the table.WALLACE: Panel, thank you. See you next week. And we’ll be right back with a final word.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: For the latest on the terror attack in London, please stay tuned to this station and Fox News Channel.And that's it for today.

It disgusts me to know that state economic development dollars were used to support a project where goods were manufactured in China, when we have companies like Feldmeier Equipment that produce products like this right in the Mohawk Valley. New York should put its money where its mouth is and support our state workers and state companies first, before they ship taxpayers money right out the door to China, Brindisi said.It simply makes no sense to export economic development dollars to China, when by definition this funding is supposed to grow jobs here in New York. New York has many long-time manufacturers like Feldmeier that are more than willing to produce quality products, and these companies deserve a chance to do business with the state, Miller said.As we struggle to improve the economy of upstate New York, I think this administration has missed a tremendous opportunity to secure employment opportunities here in Little Falls and the Mohawk Valley. Im truly disappointed that a highly regarded company like Feldmeier has been by-passed by this process, and in particular when state funding is a part of the project. We must take steps to insure that does not happen again in the Mohawk Valley or anywhere in New York State, Butler said.It is extraordinarily disappointing in light of all of the efforts my partners in government and I are putting toward keeping jobs local and invigorating the upstate economy that more effort did not go into ensuring these incentives went to Feldmeier, a company that has been in Little Falls for more than six decades, said Little Falls Mayor Mark Blask.Brindisi says the Buy New York Act ( A.5510 ) he is sponsoring, which is supported by Miller and Butler, would require state agencies to give preference to buying goods and services produced in New York State when handing out tax dollars, as well as requiring the use of New York State iron, steel, and manufactured products for many government contracts.Enclosed is the text of the letter the three Assembly members have written on the issue to Governor Andrew Cuomo and Empire State Development President, CEO and Commissioner Howard Zemsky:Dear Governor Cuomo and Commissioner Zemsky:While it has been exciting to see the interest generated in the Erie Canal over the recent shipment of beverage tanks to the North American Brewery Facility in Rochester, the event has generated some strong concerns for us here in Herkimer County and the Mohawk Valley.As you know, the tanks were manufactured in China and then shipped here for delivery. We believe you can understand that the fanfare for this event was less than enthusiastic in the City of Little Falls, where Feldmeier Equipment, Inc., has a production facility that specializes in tanks of this nature. While there have been statements that Feldmeier did not submit a bid for the project, we are led to believe the opposite is true. In fact, we are absolutely convinced that Feldmeier submitted a proposal for the project and had asked for your support.Gentlemen, this was a $50 million project which included approximately $9.5 million in state assistance ($4.5 million in performance based Excelsior Jobs Program Tax credits and up to $5 million in Upstate Revitalization Initiative) assistance provided by the taxpayers of New York State, Herkimer County and the residents of the City of Little Falls. We feel we must express our surprise and disappointment that there were no conditions placed on the expenditure of this state funding.This project had the potential to be a great win for New York with the attention it drew to the canal, the development of additional brewing capacity for the Rochester area, and the production of the new tanks for an upstate New York Company. Feldmeier has an outstanding reputation for this kind of work and has, in fact, done other work for the Genesee Brewing Company in Rochester.As things now stand, we must express our strong disappointment that this highly-regarded local company was not given more consideration in this project. We would hope, in the future, New York companies and businesses will receive stronger support from this administration.Sincerely,

President Trump saying that the White House would name James Comey's replacement as soon as this upcoming Friday. That is the day Mr. Trump heads overseas for his foreign trip as President. The Justice Department is interviewing candidates, they interviewed eight candidates so far this weekend with a few other names reportedly in the mix. All of this taking place as James Comey says he's willing to testify before Congress, however, he only will do it in public, not behind closed doors. Newt Gingrich, the Former White House Speaker, the author of the book Understanding Trump, he's also a Fox News Contributor and he joins me right now. Mr. Speaker, always a pleasure. Thanks so much for joining us this morning.NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, it's great to be with you and Happy Mother's Day.BARTIROMO: I want to - I want to ask you - thank you so much and to you as well and your wonderful wife. Let me ask you about some of the headlines I just mentioned. Number one the FBI replacement, who would you like to see in there? What kind of pedigree do we need to see as Lead for the FBI?GINGRICH: Well, I think we need somebody who's very experienced and who has focus on law enforcement as part of their career and ideally somebody who can go before the Senate and answer questions in a very direct way. We - you know, the FBI has been a remarkable institution for a hundred years. It has done amazing things. It's the preeminent investigative organization in the world and you need somebody there who is stable, calm, professional, dedicated to the rule of law and frankly going to count the facts as they are. He shouldn't be loyal to the President and he shouldn't be loyal to the Congress, he should be loyal to the United States and to the constitution or she should. I mean, I think we - you could easily - a first-class woman who is committed to the rule of law and who has an experience in enforcing the law and I think there are a number of good candidates who are women as well as men.BARTIROMO: Yes. I wonder if the President considered Condi Rice?GINGRICH: I'm not sure Condi wants to do that -BARTIROMO: Right.GINGRICH: But she - but she'll be a kind of personality, very smart, vert dedicated and impeccable honesty, nobody would doubt that she was going to call him exactly as the cards fall.BARTIROMO: Would Trey Gowdy be too political? I hearing a lot about Trey Gowdy. I'm also - I understand sources tell that the President called Ray Kelly, former NYPD commissioner. What do you think about those two candidates, Trey Gowdy and Ray Kelly?GINGRICH: Well, look, Trey Gowdy is terrific whether or not as a Republican partisan member of Congress that would make the most sense, he's certainly is a very qualified person, he was great attorney back when he was -- practices law, great prosecutor and I think in that sense, has a great reputation. I really think that Ray would be terrific. You know, the New York City Police Department is the largest city police force in the world. They do an astonishing job. They protect the U.N., they protect all the different countries that have people, they protect all the dignitaries who visit. And they have an outstanding tradition of enforcing the law and of having a very sophisticated intelligence program.BARTIROMO: And Ray Kelly would probably get confirmed easily on both sides of the aisle -GINGRICH: I would think so.BARTIROMO: - as well. Let me move on to the other headline that I want to get your take on. Jim Comey says he's willing to testify but not in - not in private only in public. Newt, we know what happened when you're in public. Sally Yates and Jim Clapper over and over again last week saying, I know the answer but I can't tell you. Yes, I know the answer to that but I'm not going to reveal it in a public setting. Is that what Jim Comey wants? He wants to be in public setting so that he could say I can't reveal anything?GINGRICH: No, I think what Jim Comey wants is to avoid one or two people leaking their version of what he said. If I were Comey, I absolutely would insist on testifying in public. I wouldn't trust either side because the democrats are going to take anything he says that seems to hurt Trump and they're going to distort it and leak it. The republicans will take anything he says which seems to exonerate Trump, they'll distort it and leak it. We live in a period unfortunately where we are surrounded by 24-day leaks and I think we're much better off to have these things out in the open. Let it flow and let Comey tell his side of the story and just let it be out there. I'm not worried about the kind of ""oh, I can't tell you because this or that"" and frankly on some of the things that they won't tell you about because it affects the ability of doing it and goes out to sources and our methods. I don't want him to particularly say that in private either because you know it'll leak.BARTIROMO: Well, we know that there were leaks and we know that it is illegal to pass information on that is critical information to the media and where is the investigation around that? This whole idea that these agencies have become politicized has been outrageous, Newt. I spoke with Rand Paul the other day - not sure if you heard what he told me on Fox News on Thursday, but listen to this. This is something I have to get your take on. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. RAND PAUL, R-KY.: I've gotten two reporters that came up which says they have multiple sources, some of this has been published already saying that the Obama administration was looking at my private information and there are rumors of other people who ran for President as well. I'm trying to get to the bottom of this. I've asked the White House to look at the logs of all the previous Obama administration people to see if are they were searching my name and unmasking me in any way. I know one of the senators who's already confided to me that he was surveilled by the Obama administration including his phone calls.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Another senator revealing to Rand Paul, confiding in him that he, in fact, was also spied on by the Obama administration. What's going on here, Newt?GINGRICH: Look, you had an enormous breakdown in the rule of law. You had it with the Clinton foundation, you had it with Hillary Clinton, you had it with Barack Obama, you had it with his staff. I mean, when you send the National Security Adviser out to lie on six different television shows about Benghazi, the Sunday after an American ambassador is killed, and she knows she's lying. You can tell that there's a collapse of any kind of honesty and any kind of measure of enforcing basic sound principles. I'm not at all surprise that the - that the Obama administration was prepared to flout the rules. And look, their core model was a radicalism going back Saul Alinsky in which middle-class rules and middle-class laws don't count. And I think that we ought to take seriously what their intellectually pedigree is. I do believe we need a serious investigation, I do believe this administration ought to be more aggressive in going after these things and more aggressive in going after these leaks. But the truth is, you now have a news media that's totally out of control and that thinks it's more important than the President of the United States, it's more important than the constitution, it's more important than the rule of law and at some point there's going to be a collision over that. And I actually applauded what the President said the last few days. I think it might be very healthy for the White House Press Corps to suddenly not have a space, to suddenly not have the daily opportunity to taunt whoever the spokesperson is. You know, let him go over the Starbucks and drink coffee and re- speculate in what's happening in the White House. But the game that we now have going on is really sick.BARTIROMO: Right.GINGRICH: And it actually weakens the ability of the American people to know what's going on.BARTIROMO: Yes. And I'm just wondering if that's one of the reasons the President fired Jim Comey because here we are constantly hearing about this charade of an investigation over potential collusion between Trump and the Russians with no evidence whatsoever and yet where is the investigation of the unmasking? Where's the investigation of the passing of classified information to the media? Is it happening?GINGRICH: Well that's right. Now, remember, 95 percent of all donations by federal employees went to Hillary Clinton. 97 percent of all donations at the Justice Department went to Hillary Clinton and 99 percent of all the donation at the State Department went to Hillary Clinton. So, what do you think the culture is like?BARTIROMO: Wow.GINGRICH: This is not a neutral culture, it's not an obey the president culture, this is an anti-Trump culture of people who will do everything they can to undermine or weaken the elected legal President of the United States.BARTIROMO: Right. So if Jim Comey knew that his boss Loretta Lynch really did not want him to cover the Hillary Clinton conflict, really did not want him to do it. I mean, everyone in the FBI knew because you knew where the donations were going, what should he have done, step down? Can he have just said look, ""I'm stepping down? I'm not going to have this on my shoulders?"" Rather than becoming the judge, jury, and the executor during the election.GINGRICH: Well, first of all - first of all, the minute that Attorney General Lynch met in private on an airplane with Bill Clinton, she in effect should have been rescued, at that point, Comey's assignment and Will Barr wrote a great essay on this, a former U.S. Attorney General who explained this. At that point, Comey's job was to report to Deputy Attorney General who I think at the time was Yates.BARTIROMO: Right.GINGRICH: But it's not Comey's job to take upon himself as FBI Director the job of the Attorney General. That's what he did.BARTIROMO: Yes.GINGRICH: And I think, that was an enormous arrogation of power. Frankly, I finally lost total faith in Comey at that hearing about a week ago where he goes off on how it almost made him nauseous to do this. And that I thought you know, we don't need psychotherapy on national television. The Director of the FBI ought to be somebody who knows what they're doing, he's prepared to defend it, does it with dignity and is willing to take the consequences.BARTIROMO: Right. That was too much. Mildly nauseous. What an ego. Mr. Speaker, always a pleasure. Thanks very much.GINGRICH: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We appreciate your time this morning. Newt Gingrich joining us there. And we'll continue this conversation with Jim Kallstrom coming up. A new White House Commission now investigating voter fraud after President Trump claim that millions of people illegally voted in the 2016 election. Kansas Secretary Kris Kobach is Vice Chair of that Commission, he will join me next live. And then remember, follow me on Twitter @mariabartiromo, @sundayfututres, let me know what you'd like to hear from our line-up of guests today. We've got a big show. Stay with us. We're looking ahead right now on ""Sunday Morning Futures"" this Mother's Day.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back, President Trump launching a new Commission on election integrity. The move coming after President Trump raised questions about widespread voter fraud in the2016 election. Kris Kobach is the Kansas Secretary of State and Vice Chairman of the new Presidential Commission on Election Integrity. Sir, it's good to have you on the program this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.KRIS KOBACH, KANSAS SECRETARY OF STATE: Great to be with you. Happy mother's day!BARTIROMO: Then to you. Tell us what you're looking at and how you believe you can actually get to the bottom of this whether or not there was a widespread fraud?KOBACH: So the Commission is looking at more than just the 2016 election. It's looking at the entire issue of voting irregularities and fraud and registration problems. So what we'll be doing is for the first time in our country's history, we'll be gathering data from all 50 states and we'll be using the federal government's databases which can been very valuable. The Social Security Administration has data on people when they pass away. The Department of Homeland Security knows of the millions of aliens who are in the United States legally and that data that's never been bounced against the state's voter rolls to see whether these people are registered. So, we'll be doing like that that have never been done before and we'll try to get some numbers, some actual statistics because you know, this debate is so contentious but often times the debate doesn't have enough facts in the - in the debate and we're going to be providing those facts, putting them on the table and letting the people decide in going where the facts take us.BARTIROMO: Yes. I think it's terrific that you're doing this especially after all of the conversations surrounding this issue in the last couple of elections. Let me ask you, how do they do it? Somebody dies and then they just get their name, they - and they use their identity? How do they do it? What's the typical track that these people are taking?KOBACH: You know, I think voting the names of deceased people, although that's, you know, sort of the subject of lore in Chicago and places you hear about people talking about that. I think that's one of the less frequent forms of voter fraud, but I could be wrong. We'll find out. But the way that would happen is a person dies for whatever reason the county doesn't know that and the name remains on the voter roll and then somebody - it's a matter of public record the voter role, somebody discovers that so-and-so's name is still on the voter roll and then benefits the state the state without photo I.D., they can just walk out and say I am that person. But the more common forms of voter fraud - I think the most common that I have seen in Kansas is double voting. People voting twice in the same election. Either in Kansas and in another state or in two different counties of Kansas.BARTIROMO: Or you can also argue that what we've been talking about in terms of spying on people is also a form of voter fraud. Right? I mean, we have just been talking about this situation where Rand Paul says he was surveilled and another senator has confided in him that he too was spied on by the Obama administration reading the record of their phone calls and their correspondents, etcetera. Doesn't that fall under the umbrella of voter fraud during the election?KOBACH: It might very well be a crime and it certainly is in the case as you've described but well, depending on the circumstances of whether he had - whether there was consent and who was doing the spying. But in - we usually don't define those as voter crimes. You're right that it might have some direct effect in the election. But the voter crimes are classically ones where you are trying to vote in somebody else's name, you're trying to alter a ballot, you're trying to commit vote by mail fraud. We'll be looking at - you know, the things that are classically defined as election fraud.BARTIROMO: Well, Secretary, what about for example the IRS targeting conservatives? I mean, the IRS was targeting conservatives, right? And we know that John Koskinen is still in charge of the IRS. A lot of people scratching their heads about that one. How is he still in that job after we know that targeted conservatives. Is that under the umbrella of voter fraud?KOBACH: Probably not because again - and by the way, these are great topics that you know, maybe deserving of their own commission to look into it. But the subject of voter fraud is itself pretty vast. I mean, you're talking about maybe eight or ten different forms of fraud. We'll also be looking at the effect on voter participation. You know, one of the argument you hear from people that oppose things like photo I.D. which we have here in Kansas is they say, well, depresses participation rates. We haven't seen that in Kansas but we'll look at the evidence from the other 49 states and see what it shows. So we're trying to keep it - you know -BARTIROMO: Well, I don't understand that. How is it possible that in some areas of the country you don't need an id to vote? I mean, you need an I.D. for everything. You need an I.D. to buy a beer and you don't need your I.D. to participate in a Presidential Election?KOBACH: I agree. I mean, look, you need an I.D. to get on a plane, you need I.D. to enter a federal building, to open a checking account and pretty much need photo I.D. to function in an American society. You even need - you need one to buy kind of suit of feds that work too if get a call.BARTIROMO: So, how does that fly -- how does that even fly? That OK, we're going to use - we're going do away with I.D.'s and that's politically incorrect. I don't understand the thinking.KOBACH: Well, so, I mean, what happened in those states is they didn't have I.D. requirement for the - or you know, the early years of the 20thcentury going all the way to1980's and then states started realizing that voter fraud was happening. And so, state by state we starting adapting. So now, you've got about a dozen states like Kansas that have a very strict voter I.D. requirement. And you've got another maybe six or eight states that had ones with loopholes in them and then there's a whole bunch of states, in fact, the majority still don't have it. And our constitution allows the states to define the rules of voting. I - we'll see if more states adopt it and maybe this commission can shed some light on the subject.BARTIROMO: When are you expecting to go report your findings, Sir?KOBACH: We're expecting to do so in a year, so next spring, maybe May but the Commission stays in existence for up to two years. If for some reason we have to go later, we can. But our hope is one year.BARTIROMO: An early look at what you will produce, can you give me an expectation of where you're going to be providing some evidence?KOBACH: Well, I can't forecast what the conclusions would be but I can give you some idea of what we might do. So, one thing that's never been done before that I eluded to earlier is the Department of Homeland Security has a database of all known aliens, green card holders, temporary visa holder in the United States. And that is never been bounced against the state's voter rolls to say well, hey, how many of these people with these names these date of birth so you can get an exact match. How many of them are registered to vote in state A or state B. We can do something like that again which would be very informative and I don't know what the results will yield but I know that for example in Kansas, we have seen a large number of noncitizen register on voter rolls and that's one of the subjects were actually locked in battle of the ACLU in court right now.BARTIROMO: Wow. Yes.KOBACH: Because we require proof of citizenship in our state.BARTIROMO: Great. Well, very informative indeed. Kris Kobach, come back soon. We'll be watching with the development. Thanks so much.KOBACH: Thank you.BARTIROMO: We appreciate it.This morning the FBI looking for a new Director after the firing of James Comey. What is next for the Bureau? What about those allegations the Obama administration spied on Rand Paul and another senator? FBI Assistant Director Jim Kallstrom next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Now this news are all breaking news. The search for the new Director of the FBI, Merrick Garland reportedly the choice of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. He will make that recommendation to President Trump. This according to the Senator's Chief of Staff who spoke on Fox News Sunday today. James Kallstrom is the former Assistant Director of the FBI, he joins me now to talk more about it. And Jim, it's always a pleasure to see you.JAMES KALLSTROM, FBI FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Nice to be with you.BARTIROMO: You've been very critical with me over the - over the last year of Jim Comey, of the politicization happening or that has taken place at the FBI. First, what do you think about the Merrick Garland idea, who would you like to see as the leader at the FBI?KALLSTROM: I don't think that's a good idea at all. The leader at the FBI should be someone who's really vested in experience in investigation, a solid person, smart, articulate, a good communicator. Someone who can motivate the agents to excel, you know, for the good of the country. Somebody who can deep - get deep down into gut of patriotism. You know, the FBI works for the American people, it doesn't work for either party, it never should. And that was Jim Comey's big mistake. Was big mistake, that's criminal referral comes over briefly you know, and says, you know, you can't call it criminal, no grand jury. He needs to stand up at that point in time, have a press conference and resign from the FBI. The FBI, you know, cannot be whiplashed around for political reasons. As soon as it does, you know, that's the end of it. That can't happen.BARTIROMO: And that's really what you have been saying for several months now. That the FBI had become too politically oriented. I mean, look, granted, Jim Comey in a tough -- was in a tough spot when his boss Loretta Lynch has meeting in tarmac with Bill Clinton and it was obvious that everybody knew where Loretta Lynch was on the election, where Barack Obama was on - they wanted Hillary. So he really need to step down, Jim Comey.KALLSTROM: Yes. I mean, it was obvious to anybody with a brain that they were never going to indict Hillary Clinton ever. No matter what the evidence, ever. It was never going to happen. So what was Jim Comey thinking five months down the road when he has this sort of shallow investigation, but there was so much evidence that they found files of it anyway and that they articulated. You know, really, a lot of evidence.BARTIROMO: I mean she said, she was incredibly careless, she sent thousands of emails to Anthony Weiner, you know, she had all of these things in terms of conflicts around her but we wouldn't recommend.KALLSTROM: Well, because he made the point no intent which is crazy. There was - you know, like a 100-mile long train of intent. You know, and the notion that Hillary Clinton was not a right mind to understand that she was really violating the law. You know, she - I mean, come on.BARTIROMO: But what was the point of the private server in your basement anyway?KALLSTROM: To violate the law.BARTIROMO: Exactly.KALLSTROM: Yes. And to have your own communications - I mean it's plane - I mean, it can't be any plainer.BARTIROMO: Convenience to have a server at home -KALLSTROM: You know, and then all the different thins Comey did, you know, releasing things on Friday afternoon like the bad guys do and, you know, all this other stuff made no sense. I mean, a smart guy, lacking in common sense, and just wasn't built to be the FBI Director.BARTIROMO: So, takes us back, what happened to the FBI to make it so political over the years. I mean, a lot of people talk about the Muslim brotherhood as part of the issue here. What's your take?KALLSTROM: Yes. I mean, I've spoken about that and a lot of people don't want to hear this. But you know, right after 9/11 in my view, Bob Mueller who was then the Director, you know, sort of the equiest with care which is actually a front group in my view of the Muslim brotherhood. And there's a lot of connections of the Muslim brotherhood.BARTIROMO: They really infiltrated.KALLSTROM: In the White House.BARTIROMO: Yes, in the White House.KALLSTROM: In the White House, without getting in the detail. And the FBI really took away from the training materials of the FBI the whole history of radical fundamentalism. I mean, it can it be like, OK, we're not going to - we're not going to know anything about (INAUDIBLE) we're not going to know about their habits or why they do things. I mean, it's just nonsense.BARTIROMO: So you weren't allowed to study the background of Islam?KALLSTROM: How can agents investigate radical fundamentalist without knowing the whole history, where they are coming from, what their mindset, you know, that they want to - basically infiltrate the United States and take the country over along with killing people.BARTIROMO: But that's what you're saying. Mueller took away the tools to do that.KALLSTROM: He took away the tools and he kept - he kept them away.BARTIROMO: And Comey kept that up.KALLSTROM: And Comey kept that up and the agents you know, training - well, basically not the agents were dumb, the materials were dumb. You know, and basically, this blanket of political correctness tied behind the back at least one arm of the FBI, made it really impossible for the FBI to better protect the United States of America without question. You know, you look back to the Boston - you look at the Boston marathon and all those other cases, right? It turns out that the FBI knew about those people, right? But they kind of dropped them off the side. Well, yes, in the FBI, there was a culture of, boy, you better not get too out there. You better not lean too forward too much on somebody's people.BARTIROMO: Why? I don't understand why.KALLSTROM: It would take all the psychiatrists in world to figure it out.BARTIROMO: Because they just buy the narrative?KALLSTROM: You know, and why and how the political elite went along with this is just really disgusting. You know, it's conspiracy of numbness and stupidity that has really harmed the ability to have the FBI to protect the United States of America.BARTIROMO: And you have to say that that continued just recently with this whole Russia probe. So this Russia probe has been on-going for ten months. We still don't have any evidence of collusion between the President and the Russians.KALLSTROM: Guess what, Maria?BARTIROMO: And where's the investigation of the leaks?KALLSTROM: Guess what, the Russian probe is being conducted by the foreign counterintelligence division of the FBI. It's not a criminal investigation. It's not a criminal investigation. Where's the crime? All you democrats out there, there is no crime.BARTIROMO: Right.KALLSTROM: There's no articulated crime. It's an intelligence matter.BARTIROMO: But we know that it's a crime to release and leak information that's classified to the media. Where is that investigation?KALLSTROM: I don't know where that is. That's a major big-time crime. You know --BARTIROMO: Is that why he got fired? One of the reasons.KALLSTROM: Well, I think one of the reasons. I think there's a whole host of reasons. You know, and that reason, the leaks - and then look at this unmasking of - it's reported -- thousands of names of people. I mean, that is a huge, huge scandal and a huge violation of the privacy laws of the United States, a huge violation of the very laws that enabled the FBI to protect the country.BARTIROMO: Should that be the priority number one for the incoming FBI director?KALLSTROM: That - I mean, that's right up there. Priority number one, the leaks, that thing is just outrageous. The new FBI director, you know, should be someone, you know, that has the intestinal fortitude to protect this country regardless of people that want to politically bend that away from certain things.BARTIROMO: Is that going to be easy? I mean, how tough is it now to turn this ship around with all of the politicization?KALLSTROM: No, I think - I think what I just 90 - I think what I just said, 98 percent of the people that want to be the FBI director are not qualified. They're not qualified in a lot of ways. You know, just because you're an attorney or you worked in the justice department, let's get away from that. Let's put someone in there that understands investigations. Let's put someone in there with -BARTIROMO: And law enforcement.KALLSTROM: -- with a strong intestinal fortitude. Let's get someone in there who can motivate police officers, FBI agents, Secret Service agents, everybody to be a better person to protect this society. We live in a very dangerous world. Now is the time, Mr. President, we've got to pick the right person for this job and they've got to get rid of this political correctness.BARTIROMO: Really, really great insights from you, as always, Jim, thank you so much.KALLSTROM: Thank you.BARTIROMO: Jim Kallstrom joining us there. The U.S. and China are working out a brand new trade deal. We'll talk with Wilbur Ross, Commerce Secretary, next. Right here.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The Trump administration not mincing words about North Korea after it test fired yet another ballistic missile early this morning. The White House says that that the ""rogue regime"" has been, quote, ""a flagrant menace for far too long."" The tough talk raising the question if more sanctions against the rouge regime are on the way. Joining us right now is Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Mr. Secretary, always a pleasure to see you. Thanks so much for the time this morning.WILBUR ROSS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF COMMERCE: Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO: So I want to talk about this new deal with China, for sure. But first, let me get your reaction to North Korea firing another missile this morning. Would this be the kind of event that will trigger more sanctions against North Korea?ROSS: Well, I don't know exactly what action the President will take. The White House did put out a press statement indicating that the missile actually landed a lot closer to Russia than to Japan. So whether that will give the Russians some interest in doing something, I don't know.BARTIROMO: Very important point that you make there. So I know that the President and yourself have been talking with China in terms of a lot of issues, not just the North Korea issue, but certainly on trade and getting American companies a better foothold than China. Listen to what former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told me this week when she joined me on my morning show on the Fox Business Network, Sir. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CONDOLEEZZA RICE, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: China is really the only country with any influence, I don't think complete influence, but some influence with the North Koreans. They've always been reluctant to do really tough things with the North Koreans because they worried about the collapse of the regime more than they're worried about a nuclear North Korea. The administration is saying to them, worry more about a nuclear North Korea because if you can't do something about the path that they are on, we will have to.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO: Do you think China is getting it at this point, Secretary Ross, in terms of participating, working with the Americans to rein in North Korea and then perhaps hoping that a better trade deal, better participation with America will also be part of an arrangement?ROSS: Well, at Mar-a-Lago we initiated two dialogues, a strategic dialogue which deals importantly with North Korea, and the economic dialogue which is the part that I've been involved with. In terms of the strategic, it's my impression that what the Chinese are worried about is if the regime does collapse, there would be a huge flood of refugees into China, and they really don't want that. And they're already getting quite a little flow just because of the turmoil. So, I can understand they're in a very tricky position.BARTIROMO: Yes, sure. Understood. They want to see change, they want to see a nonnuclear North Korea but they don't want it to mean a democratic North Korea, changing leadership in that regard, they don't want to see refugees flowing into China. I understand they have a balance to walk. Having said that, the U.S. and China agreed to take action by mid-July to increase access for U.S. financial firms and expand trade in beef and chicken among other steps as part of the drive to cut its trade deficit with Beijing. Tell us what's most important in this most recent trade deal with China, Wilbur, and what you're expecting out of China in terms of working with the U.S. on trade?ROSS: Well, the most important things that we got from the Chinese were the deal on beef. China already is a $2.5-billion a year market for beef but that represents a very, very small amount per person. About $1.70 per person. So, with the rising standards of living there, it's pretty clear that this already big $2.5-billion market could grow very rapidly. It's been quite a few years that there's been discussion about opening that market. We finally have gotten them to agree to a precise state by which the beef imports into China would start from America. So the American livestock industry is quite thrilled with that.BARTIROMO: Wow.ROSS: Second thing that we got is LNG Exports. As you probably remember, LNG prices have been very depressed in the U.S. but now we're opening it up that there could be even long-term contracts to supply China. And China is the world's largest consumer of LNG than the world's largest importer, so while there have been a few scattered little spot shipments, the idea of having big, long-term contracts is very, very attractive to our industry. And then, the third and fourth and fifth things that we've got where they had sort of banned our credit card companies from doing dual currency, dual label cards with the Chinese banks. Now, they've agreed to let them do that, and to take on the U.S.-based electronic payment services. So, that helps the service industries.And then lastly, they've agreed to grant two licenses to foreign-owned firms in order to underwrite bonds and to clear the trades. And then lastly, in food biotechnology, there are quite a few applications. I think something like Eight Pending and we've agreed on a protocol for going forward with them where by the end of May, those fellows will know if there are any remaining problems in their application, if not, it will go forward. So, it's --BARTIROMO: Yes.ROSS: -- it dealt with a lot of sectors but there's a lot more to do.BARTIROMO: Yes. And lot more because a lot of people wonder if American companies will ever get a shot to actually own something in China rather than just being part of a joint venture where a financial firm can only own 49 percent because American companies want to sell to the 1.1 billion people of China.ROSS: Right. And that's certainly one of the --BARTIROMO: Go ahead, sir, sorry.ROSS: Yes. That's certainly one of the issues, the intellectual property rights are an issue, the oversupply and overcapacity in steel and aluminum and other products. There's a host of issues. But, strategy here was get a few quick kills, a few tangible deliverable items that could be done quickly, make sure that there was actual performance on them because many of these things had been premised for a long time. Now, it's time for delivery, assuming that those are delivered, then we'll go into a one-year program of negotiations. If that produces more deliverables, we'll go into a longer-term period of negotiation.BARTIROMO: Secretary Ross, it's great to see you. Thank you so much for walking us through it. We'll be watching.ROSS: Thank you, Maria. Thank you.BARTIROMO: Secretary Wilbur Ross joining us there. President Trump's revised travel ban, meanwhile, back in court tomorrow morning with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. But, is this case inevitable headed for the Supreme Court? The Attorney General from one of the states supporting the ban, Ken Paxton of Texas will join us next. We're looking ahead right now in ""Sunday Morning Futures."" Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to hear arguments tomorrow on President Trump's revised travel ban after a judge in Hawaii blocked it.Joining us right now is the Attorney General of Texas, Ken Paxton. His state is one of the many backing the travel ban. Good to see you, sir. Thanks very much for joining us.KEN PAXTON, TEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL: Happy Mother's Day.BARTIROMO: What do - and to you, thank you. What are you expecting from tomorrow's hearing in terms of this travel ban?PAXTON: You know, it's hard to say, you know, every court has their little different nuance. And this, if you'll remember the judge in Hawaii found a constitutional right for non-resident aliens based on the first amendment, we don't think that's right, so we're hopeful that they'll overrule that, and instead, base it on clear federal statutes that gives the president the authority to do this.BARTIROMO: You know, most people are scratching their head, saying, look, the President has the authority to come out with his executive orders, and he's being blocked left and right. I mean, this immigration ban can't get past go, what do you make of this?PAXTON: Well, it's interesting for us because we filed a lawsuit based on the Syrian refugees coming to our state without us knowing much about it. Now, we were told by a federal judge that the federal government has complete authority over immigration. And so, it's a little surprising to us that now that we're with a different President, that we have courts all over the nation saying the President doesn't have - does not have the authority to do that when we think clearly under federal statute that he does.BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly. So, I mean, obviously the Ninth Circuit has been against the president. And so, it keeps coming from the Ninth Circuit but can the Ninth Circuit keep this up and actually create a barrier for the President to get his executive order on immigration to throw it all?PAXTON: Well, you make a good point. We had - you know, we had the first travel ban, the lawsuit was in Washington State, which was the Ninth Circuit, then the second one was in Hawaii, which is the Ninth Circuit. Obviously, there's a reason they're filing it in Ninth Circuit, tends to be more liberal court. But ultimately, I expect this to go to the U.S. Supreme Court. I think the Supreme Court, obviously, now that it has all nine justices, we're, you know, more hopeful that we're going to get ruling on this.BARTIROMO: Tell me what you're doing in Texas at this point, Mr. Attorney General, because we know that, you know, you have been supportive of this ban, and actually are trying to create borders and ensure that the law is being followed?PAXTON: So, you know, we actually filed a lawsuit, as I said on this - related to Syrian refugees and we basically pulled out of the program, the federal program because we had no way of monitoring who was coming into our state. So the program still continues for us but we're not part of that as a state, and the reason we're not part is our governor did not feel comfortable saying that we were going to be part of a program where we could not vet these people and know who was coming into our state. So, we're very concerned about this, and obviously, we have a huge issue here with crimes in our state with illegals, and so, we want to make sure that this is resolved.BARTIROMO: In terms of the vetting process, what would you like to see? You're right there at the border and have a good idea in terms of what needs to be done and where we're lacking. What can you tell us?PAXTON: Well, we don't get any information. So, we'd love to have background checks, so we know the history of these people so that we know if they have terrorist ties, so that if they're going to come in to our state, we can at least track what's going on, we find out where they're going, where they're at, so that we have some idea of the thousands of refugees that have come to our state, we literally know nothing about them.BARTIROMO: Attorney General Paxton, thanks so much for joining us this morning. We appreciate it.PAXTON: Thank you. Have a great day.BARTIROMO: Good to hear from you, Ken Paxton joining us there.We're going to take a break. When we come back, the Comey firing sending shockwaves throughout Washington. The fall-out continues, our panel is next. We're talking with Ed Rollins and Garry Kasparov as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back. President Trump looking to move quickly on naming a new FBI director, saying an announcement could come as soon as this Friday. I want to bring in our panel, Ed Rollins, former White House adviser to President Reagan and a Fox News Contributor; Garry Kasparov is chairman of the New York-based Human Rights Foundation, former world chess champion, and author of the new book, ""Deep Thinking"". Great to see you, both. Thank you so much for joining us.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.BARTIROMO: What a week it was. Let's look back and look ahead, Ed Rollins.ED ROLLINS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND FORMER WHITE HOUSE ADVISER: Well, as I sit here with Garry, who's one of the world's great strategist in his book called ""Deep Thinking"", we need some deep thinking in this White House. I think this -- and we need a strategy. This was the worst week, I think, this President has had, and it's all self-inflicted. He could have gotten rid of Comey on January 20th, he couldn't gotten - remember Comey this last week and what he should have done is sat down, as Jim said, I want to make a change, you want to resign by the end of the week or I'm going to fire you, and even firing him, he should have said thank you for your service and move on. The problem is he made it into a much bigger story than needed to be. The White House staff basically is all over the place. When they start comparing you to Carter and Nixon as a former President, that's not a good place to be.BARTIROMO: No.ROLLINS: In my sense, is he goes on his first international trip that shows this week should be all about what he's going to accomplish as he leaves this country. And again, there's no strategy in what he wants to accomplish.BARTIROMO: What would be - what should be the strategy, Garry? But you know what, you make a good point because he turned it into a fight and he threatened, oh, there are tapes. If you - but that's because Jim Comey obviously leaked to the New York Times what was said at dinner.GARRY KASPAROV, HUMAN RIGHTS FOUNDATION NEW YORK CHAIRMAN: But the moment you say tapes, it reminds people of Richard Nixon.ROLLINS: Right.BARTIROMO: You're right.KASPAROV: And it says - I just followed what Ed had said, there's no strategy. Comey's story is questionable, the timing, of course, but then receiving Russian foreign minister and Russian Ambassador in the Oval Office and allowing Russian photographer to make pictures that go around the world. That's - this -BARTIROMO: That was insane.KASPAROV: People start combining it. By the way, receiving Kissinger at the same time. You want more connections to Nixon, you receive Kissinger. So, it created - it created an atmosphere of suspicion, and of course, because we have the story with this ongoing investigation, so people are just trying to put one-on-one together, and it looks very bad for the White House.BARTIROMO: Now, you made a good point during the commercial break that on the same day that he met with Russians, he also met with the head of - the Ukraine Ambassador.KASPAROV: But nobody knows about it.BARTIROMO: Why not?KASPAROV: It's amazingly that it's compared to Obama administration, Trump administration is doing some right things about Ukraine but is kind of a secret. I don't know why, this is a good thing, this is the right things to do, and maybe, you know, they didn't want to upset Russians in public. We don't know. But it's amazing that bad things are publicized, good things --BARTIROMO: Yes.ROLLINS: So, what he needs to do is he needs to quit looking back. He won the presidency, she won 3 million more votes, that's not going to change. Commissions (INAUDIBLE) the rest of it. He basically has to focus on the future. And this next week, these foreign leaders will look him in the eye and they're going to make a judgment, and the judgment had better be that he -- this is a significant leader, he can take this country in a new direction. And I think if he doesn't do that, it fails on that front because he's distracted by all the rest of this stuff, it'll be a terrible, terrible month here, and I think it's very key at this point.BARTIROMO: And he's going to be meeting with the King of Saudi Arabia, and the crown prince of Saudi Arabia.ROLLINS: And the leaders of Israel which are very important.BARTIROMO: And -- yes, of course.ROLLINS: And then - and then you follow up with NATO. I mean, it's just - - this is going to be a measurement week. The leaders are going to look him in the eye, and make a judgment on him.KASPAROV: But it's also important to remember that the American credibility has been so severely damaged by the Obama administration, and now, there was an opportunity to restore it and Trump so far is missing so many good moments to actually show the leadership and to demonstrate that America is back in the world stage.ROLLINS: Three weeks ago when he fired the missiles at Syria -BARTIROMO: That was maybe his best week.ROLLINS: It was his best week. And people basically said, this is a new game, a strong leader, we need to take him seriously. And my sense is this week's stumbling around, blaming your staff, all the rest of it, and talking about getting rid of your staff, is absurd at this point in time. Right now, focus on your foreign trip, talk about what you wanted to accomplish and come back with a victory.BARTIROMO: Turn the conversation into what you're going to do.ROLLINS: What you're going to do.BARTIROMO: And why you're on this first international trip as President and why you chose Israel than Saudi Arabia first.ROLLINS: Absolutely. Absolutely.BARTIROMO: Great conversation, guys. Thank you so much.ROLLINS: Great. Thank you very much.BARTIROMO: Garry Kasparov, Ed Rollins, joining us. That'll do it for us on ""Sunday Morning Futures."" I'll see you tomorrow morning on the Fox Business Network, ""Mornings With Maria"" 6:00 a.m. Eastern.

And I really hate coming downtown at night with all the darkies afoot and everything.”Before the monument could be removed, police had to clear the immediate area of demonstrators — both supporters of the monuments and those who want them taken away. Barricades were used to keep the sides separated, NOLA.com reported. The news outlet said chants by monument supporters included “Where’s Mitch?” while opponents chanted, “Hey hey, ho ho, white supremacy has got to go.”As Fox news reported earlier, the mayor’s plan calls for the Davis statue to be melted down and cast into smaller statues of Black Lives Matter leaders.Facebook Comments

I have people brief me on great intel every day,” Trump said, according to an official with knowledge of the exchange.Trump went on to discuss aspects of the threat that the United States only learned through the espionage capabilities of a key partner. He did not reveal the specific intelligence gathering method, but described how the Islamic State was pursuing elements of a specific plot and how much harm such an attack could cause under varying circumstances. Most alarmingly, officials said, Trump revealed the city in the Islamic State’s territory where the U.S. intelligence partner detected the threat.The Washington Post is withholding most plot details, including the name of the city, at the urging of officials who warned that revealing them would jeopardize important intelligence capabilities.The Post reports that according to U.S. intelligence officials, the “disclosures jeopardized a critical source of intelligence on the Islamic State.” A U.S. official stated that “This is code-word information,” and added that Trump “revealed more information to the Russian ambassador than we have shared with our own allies.” Officials fear that Trump’s identification of the city location risks Russia’s being able to identify the U.S. ally or intelligence capabilities which “could be useful for other purposes, possibly providing intelligence on Russia’s presence in Syria. Moscow and would be keenly interested in identifying that source and possibly disrupting it.” Reuters, which has confirmed the story, provides more details on the nature of the intelligence at issue, corroborating the Post’s reporting that Trump’s conversation disclosed information about “an Islamic State terrorist threat related to the use of laptop computers on aircraft”:U.S. officials have told Reuters that U.S. agencies are in the process of drawing up plans to expand a ban on passengers carrying laptop computers onto U.S.-bound flights from several countries on [sic] conflict zones due to new intelligence about how militant groups are refining techniques for installing bombs in laptops.So serious are assessments of the increased threat that Washington is considering banning passengers from several European countries, including Britain, from carrying laptops in a cabin on U.S.-bound flights. The United States has consulted about the intelligence with allied governments and airlines.One source familiar with the matter told Reuters at least some of the intelligence that went into the planned laptop ban expansion came from a U.S. commando raid on an al Qaeda camp in Yemen in which a U.S. special operator was killed.Deputy national security advisor Dina Powell has denied the story as false. Notably, national security advisor General H.R. McMaster limited his denial to the fact that, “At no time were any intelligence sources or methods discussed and no military operations were disclosed that were not already known publicly.” Likewise, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has denied disclosure of any information on “sources, methods or military operations.” These are both very carefully worded statements that leave open the possibility that classified information was disclosed other than sources and methods or that classified information was disclosed which might be used as a basis to infer sources and methods not directly disclosed. Typically, policies related to the safeguarding of classified information treat both sources and methods information and information pertaining to or related to sources and methods in the same category.In a hastily-convened press conference outside the White House, McMaster further stated :The story that came out tonight, as reported, is false. The president and foreign minister reviewed a range of common threats to our two countries including threats to civil aviation. At no time … were intelligence sources or methods discussed. And the president did not disclose any military operations that were not publicly known … I was in the room, it didn’t happen.Again, this statement is carefully worded. The declaration that the story “as reported” is untrue leaves plenty of room for the administration to pinpoint discrepancies in the Post story without denying the substance. And once again, McMaster does not deny that an egregious breach of national security information was revealed, merely that “intelligence sources or methods [were] discussed” and that the President “disclose[d] any military operations that were not publicly known.” The Post’s Greg Miller, one of the two reporters who broke the story, accused the White House of “playing word games” in response to McMaster’s press conference. And indeed, if McMaster meant to be denying that anything harmful was said in the Oval Office, then it is hard to understand why (as the Post reports) “senior White House officials took steps to contain the damage, placing calls to the CIA and the National Security Agency,” or why the Post agreed not to publish certain details of the plot discussed in the Oval Office after “officials” warned that doing so would “jeopardize important intelligence capabilities."" There may be disclosures yet to come. According to one current U.S. official quoted in Buzzfeed, the situation is “far worse than what has already been reported.” The New York Times writes that “sharing the information without the express permission of the ally who provided it ... could jeopardize a crucial intelligence-sharing relationship.”This is perhaps the gravest allegation of presidential misconduct in the scandal-ridden four months of the Trump administration. This story is likely to be immensely consequential. Below are some initial thoughts based on the facts available about what this story is, what it isn’t, and what we do and do not yet know.First, this is not a question of “leaking classified information” or breaking a criminal law. Let’s dispense with one easy rabbit hole that a lot of people are likely to go down this evening: the President did not “leak” classified information in violation of law. He is allowed to do what he did. If anyone other than the President disclosed codeword intelligence to the Russians in such fashion, he’d likely be facing a long prison term. But Nixon’s infamous comment that “when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal” is actually true about some things. Classified information is one of them. The nature of the system is that the President gets to disclose what he wants.The reason is that the very purpose of the classification system is to protect information the President, usually through his subordinates, thinks sensitive. So the President determines the system of designating classified information through Executive Order, and he is entitled to depart from it at will. Currently, Executive Order 13526 governs national security information.The Supreme Court has stated in Department of the Navy v. Egan that “[the President’s] authority to classify and control access to information bearing on national security ... flows primarily from this Constitutional investment of power in the President and exists quite apart from any explicit congressional grant.” Because of his broad constitutional authority in this realm, the president can, at any time, either declassify information or decide whom to share it with.In short, Trump did not violate any criminal law concerning the disclosure of classified information here. The question of criminality, however, is by no means the end of the analysis.Second, this is not a garden variety breach, and outrage over it is not partisan hypocrisy about protecting classified information.There is a semi-regular partisan food fight over the other party’s handling of classified information. There are too many examples of hypocrisy and faux-outrage on both sides to count. So Republicans can point to any number of statements by Democrats minimizing the significance or severity of disclosing classified information; Democrats, meanwhile can do the same with Republican statements underscoring the importance of protecting classified information.This debate, which we assume to be inevitable, is a distraction and should be ignored.The information allegedly disclosed here appears to be of an extremely sensitive nature. According to the Post, President Trump’s own aides “appeared to recognize immediately that Trump had overstepped and moved to contain the potential fallout” by contacting the directors of CIA and NSA. The Post does not report whether the White House also notified the foreign ally who provided the information of the compromise.The information in question is of particular significance both because the Russians might be able to infer sources and methods, notwithstanding General McMaster’s careful statement that sources and methods were not “discussed,” and because it was shared with the United States by a foreign partner. Indeed, the Post story discusses the concern of U.S. officials that the Russians might inferentially “identify the U.S. ally or intelligence capability involved, and one official is quoted as saying that “Russia could identify our sources or techniques” based on what was disclosed. If true, Trump did not just jeopardize our own intelligence sources, but those of another country. Intelligence sharing relationships are critical to U.S. security interests around the world, and in particular in the fight coalition against ISIS. The United States intelligence community and military are simply not able to access every relevant source of intelligence and thus depends on a network of intelligence sharing partnerships. Breaching the trust of a foreign partner could substantially harm that relationship moving forward and could undermine the confidence of other foreign governments in the U.S. government’s ability to safeguard information.Consider Israeli media reports from shortly before the inauguration that “Israeli intelligence officials [were] concerned that the exposure of classified information to their American counterparts under a Trump administration could lead to their being leaked to Russia and onward to Iran.” At the time, Haaretz wrote , on the basis of reporting in the Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot:The intelligence concerns, which have been discussed in closed forums recently, are based on suspicions of unreported ties between President-elect Donald Trump, or his associates, and the government of Vladimir Putin in Moscow.As Russian intelligence is associated with intelligence officials in Tehran, highly classified information, such as Israel's clandestine methods of operation and intelligence sources, could potentially reach Iran. Such information has been shared with the United States in the past.To the extent foreign partners were already concerned, this episode seems to confirm their worst fears.Third, it is important to understand the nature of sources and methods information in order to fully understand the gravity of the breach.In general, a Top Secret classification is applied to information “the unauthorized disclosure of which could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to national security…” Of course, as discussed above, if the President disclosed the information it is not “unauthorized” within the technical meaning. Setting aside the technicalities, however, it is important to recognize that not all Top Secret information is created equal. The most sensitive category by far is that related to the protection of “sources and methods,” which relates not just to the substance of intelligence but to the manner by which it was obtained. If sources and methods information is revealed, it risks losing the method of collection in the future, which poses much larger long-term security consequences.The Post reports that the “information the president relayed had been provided by a U.S. partner through an intelligence-sharing arrangement considered so sensitive that details have been withheld from allies and tightly restricted even within the U.S. government."" This is why Trump aides moved quickly to ensure that the information was “stricken from internal memos and for the full transcript to be limited to a small circle of recipients” in order to prevent further dissemination or leaks and to limit the damage from the disclosure.For an illustration of the sensitivity of sources and methods, note that the U.S. intelligence community assessment of Russian hacking in the U.S. election opens by notingThe Intelligence Community rarely can publicly reveal the full extent of its knowledge or the precise bases for its assessments, as the release of such information would reveal sensitive sources or methods and imperil the ability to collect critical foreign intelligence in the future.The Obama administration took considerable criticism for failing to provide underlying information in that report, but ultimately was unwilling to risk compromises to sources and methods despite the exceedingly high stakes. That tells you something about how vital it is to protect sources and methods. Fourth, it really matters why Trump disclosed this information to Russian visitors. The story is vague on this point. But the question of why Trump acted as he did will matter a great deal to how the political system absorbs this news. The implication of the Post story is that Trump acted impulsively and in a boasting kind of way. If that’s right, the matter is egregiously bad.But there are important questions on which Congress and the public will need clarity before deciding how to act. Did the disclosure serve a national security purpose, even in Trump’s mind? That is, if the President made a strategic judgment to release certain information in exchange for some anticipated gain, even if that judgment is wildly wrong, that is potentially less bad that if this is merely an example of loose lips sinking other countries’ ships–and our own country’s intelligence relationships. In other words, what Trump thought he was doing might well inflect whether we should see this as an act of carelessness, an act of carelessness bordering on treachery, or an act of judgment (even if misjudgment) of the sort we elect presidents to make.Fifth, this may well be a violation of the President’s oath of office. Questions of criminality aside, we turn to the far more significant issues: If the President gave this information away through carelessness or neglect, he has arguably breached his oath of office. As Quinta and Ben have elaborated on in some detail , in taking the oath President Trump swore to “faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States” and to “preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States” to the best of his ability. It’s very hard to argue that carelessly giving away highly sensitive material to an adversary foreign power constitutes a faithful execution of the office of President.Violating the oath of office does not require violating a criminal statute. If the President decided to write the nuclear codes on a sticky note on his desk and then took a photo of it and tweeted it, he would not technically have violated any criminal law–just as he hasn’t here. He has the constitutional authority to dictate that the safeguarding of nuclear materials shall be done through sticky notes in plain sight and tweeted, even the authority to declassify the codes outright. Yet, we would all understand this degree of negligence to be a gross violation of his oath of office.Congress has alleged oath violations—albeit violations tied to criminal allegations or breaches of statutory obligations—all three times it has passed or considered seriously articles of impeachment against presidents: against Andrew Johnson (“unmindful of the high duties of his oath of office”), Richard Nixon (“contrary to his oath”), and Bill Clinton (“in violation of his constitutional oath”). Further, two of the three articles of impeachment against Nixon alleged no direct violation of the law. Instead, they concerned Nixon’s abuse of his power as President, which, like the President putting the nuclear codes on Twitter, is an offense that can only be committed by the President and has thus never been explicitly prohibited in criminal law.There’s thus no reason why Congress couldn’t consider a grotesque violation of the President’s oath as a standalone basis for impeachment—a high crime and misdemeanor in and of itself. This is particularly plausible in a case like this, where the oath violation involves giving sensitive information to an adversary foreign power. That’s getting relatively close to the “treason” language in the impeachment clauses; it’s pretty easy to imagine a hybrid impeachment article alleging a violation of the oath in service of a hostile foreign power. So legally speaking, the matter could be very grave for Trump even though there is no criminal exposure.This approach to sensitive information does not appear to be a one-off. President Trump has previously taken heat for his cavalier attitude towards safeguarding classified information, for example when he openly reviewed plans related to a North Korean nuclear test in the Mar-a-Lago dining room in full view of other diners or when he appeared to inadvertently confirm the authenticity of leaked CIA documents on Fox News.Sixth, it matters hugely, at least from an atmospheric point of view, that the people in the room were Russian and one of them was Sergey Kislyak of all people.Take a step back and remember where we stand on L’Affaire Russe . Trump is currently under a tremendous amount of political pressure for his decision to fire the FBI Director, who was in the midst of conducting an investigation into possible collusion between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign in the Russian effort to influence the U.S. presidential election. He has admitted on national television that his decision to dismiss Director James Comey was linked to Comey’s investigation. Four associates of Trump have been asked to hand over documents chronicling their conversations with Russian officials to the Senate Intelligence Committee, and one of those associates—former national security advisor Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn—has been subpoenaed .It’s particularly striking that among the Russian officials with whom Trump may have discussed classified information is none other than Kislyak, who has a habit of holding inopportune meetings with high-ranking members of the Trump team. It was conversations with Kislyak over the possible lifting of sanctions that led to Flynn’s resignation, and revelations of undisclosed meetings with the Ambassador during the campaign pushed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from the FBI’s ongoing investigation into the Russia connection. This matter may or may not have any connection whatsoever to the Trump-Russia story, which is playing out concurrently. But it will inevitably get mashed together with it. It’s important, however, to keep the issues mentally separate. After all, this conduct would be equally inexcusable if the recipients were not Russian, but say, Chinese. At the same time, the question of whether it’s a mere coincidence that the President disclosed codeword classified material to the Russian government, having spent the last few months deriding the idea that he had any connection to Russia as #FakeNews is one the White House cannot avoid.Seventh, Trump’s screw-up with the Russians in the Oval Office raises the stakes for whether he records conversations there. Last week, Trump tweeted that “James Comey better hope that there are no ""tapes"" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!” This threat set off a raft of speculation about whether Trump records Oval Office conversations and, if so, what his legal duties are to preserve those recordings. The speculation continued through today, when Sean Spicer studiously declined to address whether any such recording system exists. If such a recording system does exist, the conversations recorded could go a long way towards answering the mysteries above regarding why the President gave this information to the Russians, and whether he violated his oath or some other law in the process. We thus expect the incident with the Russians to put even more pressure on the White House to answer the question whether the recording system exists.Eighth, this episode raises the stakes on the nomination of the FBI Director to replace Comey. Ben and Jack explained this morning why Trump must not appoint a political figure for the job, but rather must replace Comey with someone apolitical with law enforcement expertise and a reputation for independence. One reason for the conclusion, but only one, was the need for absolute vigilance, and the appearance of vigilance, in the investigation of the DNC hack and the Trump campaign and administration. Trump’s intelligence spill in the Oval Office to senior Russian officials is but the latest and perhaps greatest piece of evidence of extraordinarily suspicious behavior by the Trump team—this time the President himself—and Russian officials. The episode will make it yet harder to have a legitimate and credible resolution to the Trump-Russia investigation, and thus makes it all the more critical to have an FBI Director who is independent and enjoys bipartisan support. Finally, Trump’s alleged screw-up with the Russians reveals yet again what we have learned many times in the last four months: The successful operation of our government assumes a minimally competent Chief Executive that we now lack. Everyone else in the Executive Branch can be disciplined or fired or worse when they screw up by, say, revealing classified information or lying about some important public policy issue. But the President cannot be fired; we are stuck with him for 3-1/2 more years unless he is impeached, which remains a long-shot.The Post reports:“It is all kind of shocking,” said a former senior U.S. official who is close to current administration officials. “Trump seems to be very reckless and doesn’t grasp the gravity of the things he’s dealing with, especially when it comes to intelligence and national security.”Bottom line: It matters who we have running the most powerful institution in the world.Topics: The Russia ConnectionJack Goldsmith is the Henry L.

Chu Decries ""Heartless"" ACA Repeal VoteMay 4, 2017Press ReleaseWASHINGTON, DC – The House of Representatives today voted 217-212 to pass H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act (AHCA), the Republican plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Initial estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that the underlying legislation will take away coverage from 24 million Americans over the next decade, including seven million Americans currently covered by their employers. The bill cuts $838 billion from Medicaid, and will dramatically increase out-of-pocket costs, particularly for lower-income families and older Americans. An ""age tax"" imposed on those ages 50-64 will force this age group to pay up to five times as much as a younger person for coverage. It also completely defunds Planned Parenthood for one year, further restricting low-income women’s access to affordable healthcare for pregnancy tests, cancer screening, and family planning. All of these cuts to middle class Americans’ health care are used to finance a $1 trillion tax cut for the wealthiest families, insurance companies, and insurance executives. The version that passed today was amended to allow states to create high risk pools instead of requiring insurance companies to cover those with pre-existing conditions. Rather than protecting those with pre-existing conditions, high-risk pools leave sick people vulnerable to skyrocketing costs, long waiting lists, and annual or lifetime caps. The bill also allows states to opt out of requirements to cover essential health benefits, like doctor and emergency room visits, mental health services, and prescription drugs. Rep. Chu voted against the bill and released the following statement:“I am incredibly saddened and outraged that Republicans ignored the expressed opposition from doctors, hospitals, patient advocates, health experts and even members of their own party to pass this heartless bill. It is unconscionable to me that they would charge ahead with – and then celebrate – a vote that they know will force millions off their insurance and raise prices for people with preexisting conditions. Worse, their rush to vote on this bill meant there wasn’t even time for the Congressional Budget Office to score the fiscal and human costs of the final version. The haste to act and then immediately hop on a bus to the White House shows that they were more concerned with helping Trump keep a campaign promise than with actually improving healthcare.“This bill will have serious consequences for the people of California in particular. One provision of this bill would deny subsidies to any healthcare plan that covers abortion. Meaning that in California, where all plans are required to cover abortion, healthcare costs will rise astronomically because Californians will be ineligible for tax credits. This bill also threatens to kick 7 million veterans off their insurance, shortens the life of Medicare, allows people aged 50-64 to be charged 5 times more than young people, and eliminates coverage for 24 million Americans, including nearly 2 million Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders across the country. It defunds Planned Parenthood for one year, and would once again allow being a rape or domestic violence victim to be a pre-existing condition. This bill creates a 'women’s tax' that would permit insurance companies to charge women more than men for essential coverage like pregnancy. Trumpcare would cut $838 billion from Medicaid, endangering care for individuals with disabilities, low-income children, and seniors in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. In the midst of the worst opioid epidemic our nation has ever seen, it rips mental health and addiction services away from those who need it most. Trumpcare does all this while giving the 400 richest families in America an annual tax break of $2.8 million.“As we have said in the past, Democrats remain willing and eager to work to improve the Affordable Care Act. But this was not an improvement. This was a cruel attack on vulnerable Americans, especially those with preexisting conditions. An improvement is a plan that will increase access for all Americans, keep costs down, and ensure that being sick or a woman or a senior is not an excuse to be denied coverage.” "

Among the witnesses expected to testify Friday are Jones’ parents, who live in Austin.Read the full report on Thursday’s testimony here on mystatesman.com.Earlier: Alex Jones teared up on the stand Thursday afternoon and in an emotional outburst, told his ex-wife’s attorney that he has “no decency, zero.”“You sit here and twist things, I’ve never seen anything like it in all of literature or the movies,” Jones said, his face wrought with emotion, to Bobby Newman, an attorney for Kelly Jones, seated a few feet in front of him. “You have won the award sir. No decency, zero.”Newman had just described how their son had been distraught for three days after not being able to visit with his mother.But Jones said that was because Kelly Jones had spurned the son’s visit, sending him home with his father, and that Newman’s version turned the facts on their head.FIRST READING: Alex Jones: `We’re the most bona fide, hard-core, Real McCoy thing there is.’Newman is attempting to show that Jones has been responsible for their children’s alienation from their mother. Jones has insisted that he bent over backwards — if anything tried too hard — to make the children visit and get along with their mother, to no avail.“I should not have pushed as hard as I did,” he said.But when Newman asked to describe Kelly Jones’ good qualities as a mother, Jones asked, looking at his ex-wife, “that women or now.”“I cannot perjure myself,” Jones said. “She doesn’t have any good qualities.”Later, he qualified that, saying she has some good qualities but, “any good is sandwiched with bad.”“There’s a term, `no good,’” he said. “It doesn’t mean there’s no good in it. It means no good comes out of it.”Jones completed his testimony for the day around 4:45 p.m. He is expected to be back on the stand on Friday.Earlier: Alex Jones, under cross-examination at his child custody trial, said he brings “none of the bombasity, none of the rage” he displays on Infowars home with him when he is parenting his three children.“None of the adult type content, that’s not taken home,” Jones said under questioning from Bobby Newman, an attorney for his ex-wife, Kelly Jones.Newman’s cross-examination of Jones began on a cordial note.“Good morning, Mr. Jones,” Newman said.“Hi, howya doin?” Jones replied.But it went quickly downhill from there.“You haven’t had any chili this morning?” Newman asked Jones.“Is that a serious question?” Jones asked Newman.It was. Newman was referring to Jones’ statement in a March 4 affidavit attributing his inability to remember the names of some of his children’s teachers to having just eaten a “big ol’ bowl of chili, yah.”“The Chili Parlor’s right over there,” Jones said, gesturing.Jones said that he had two breakfast tacos in advance of today’s testimony, and no chili.Newman, as restless and hyperkinetic a figure as Jones, set about trying to undermine the portrait of Jones as a near-perfect father presented under examination by Randall Wilhite, one of his attorneys.Newman used that same March affidavit to tie Jones up in knots about whether he had acknowledged having sex with a woman, who remains a friend, even after his new wife, Erika, moved into his home following their engagement in November 2015.In the affidavit, Jones acknowledges that he continued having sex with that other women until about March 2016. But, when Newman pressed Jones to confirm his previous testimony, Jones offered a befuddled look and said, “I’d have to see a calendar.”Newman pressed on but Jones continued to say, “I don’t have a calendar in front of me,” refused to confirm that the sex continued after his fiance had moved in, and said that in any case, his new wife — who is eight-plus months pregnant — knew all about the other relationship.Jones also acknowledged that he had smoked marijuana in Texas, in violation of state law, in the last year-and-a-half or two years. He said it was part of his practice to test marijuana once a year so that he can determine its strength, a practice that he said had led him to believe it is too strong and and should not be legalized but simply decriminalized.And then, in a flourish that echoed his Infowars broadcast, he said that the legalization campaign was a dangerous path being funded by liberal philanthropist George Soros. Soros, a frequent target, is at the center of Jones’ mapping of a pernicious global elite.Of his marijuana testing protocol, Jones said, “That’s what police do. They smoke it once a year too.”“I talked about it on the air,” Jones said of his smoking in Texas.Earlier this year, Jones smoked marijuana on Joe Rogan’s podcast in California, where it is legal.Earlier: Returning to the witness stand Thursday, Alex Jones described an emotionally harrowing New Year’s Eve 2016 when his children spent the day with his ex-wife, Kelly Jones, who he said was brow-beating them to change their testimony in what would be the child custody trial now in its fourth day.In a series of panicked phone calls to him, he said his children begged him to come get them and bring them home and asked, apparently in response to what their mother had told them about why he had custody of them, “Is it true that you bought off the courthouse and Donald Trump is doing all this?”Jones’ attorney, Randall Wilhite, said the testimony and a tape of one of the phone calls was vivid evidence of Kelly Jones’ episcodic “emotional dysregulation,” which Jones said could leave her “locked in a room for three days, absolutely manic or driving through both lanes of traffic for an hour-and-a-half, absolutely manic.”It is that emotional dysregulation — defined in court as an episodic tendency to respond in a manner and with an intensity out of proportion to the circumstances — Wilhite and Alex Jones said, that has made it impossible for her to gain greater access to the children.Earlier: Alex Jones, the Austin-based broadcast personality with a global audience in the millions, is expected to take the stand for a second day Thursday in a custody trial to determine whether his ex-wife, Kelly Jones, will gain custody of their three children.Alex Jones testified Wednesday afternoon that he means what he says on his show, Infowars, though he often uses satire and comedy.Jones is often brusque and at times antagonistic and threatening on his show. Kelly Jones’ attorneys will cross-examine Alex Jones Thursday. They have argued that his on-air persona is no different than Alex Jones as a parent.State District Judge Orlinda Naranjo banned electronic devices from the courtroom effective Wednesday afternoon, but the American-Statesman will still provide periodic updates throughout the day.About the AuthorJONATHAN TILOVE Jonathan Tilove is the American-Statesman's chief political writer.Popular in News

Trump is simply lying: the negotiations being discussed are not a 'bailout', but would help provide desperately needed access to healthcare for seniors and children on the island. Instead of using Puerto Ricanfamilies as scapegoats and bargaining chips for the disastrous Republican budget process that will likely lead to a government shutdown, he should pay back the nearly $33 million he owes Puerto Rican taxpayers after yet another one of his businesses defaulted on the island."" Background: In another typical day at the White House, Donald Trump spread falsehoods on Twitter, this time about giving a 'bailout' to Puerto Ricans. The budget item being discussed would actually give healthcare access to Puerto Ricans, in particular to children and seniors. Puerto Ricans pay many taxes, including the same rates of payroll, Medicare and Social Security taxes as stateside Americans. However, residents on the island receive a fraction of healthcare funding as the 50 states. Puerto Ricans are calling for equal treatment, not a bailout. NBC News, April 27th, 2017: Puerto Rico Officials Slam Trump for Tweets on Island 'Bailout' Meanwhile, Trump conveniently left out the fact that his golf course on the island defaulted, like so many of his other failed business schemes. The failure left Puerto Rican taxpayers with a nearly $33 million bill, another example of Trump's many scams that make him wealthier and con hardworking families. Puerto Rico es la última víctima de las mentiras y bullying de Donald Trump Johanna Cervone, vocera del Partido Demócrata la Florida, dio la siguiente declaración sobre las falsedades de Donald Trump en relación a Puerto Rico: ""Los puertorriqueños pagan impuestos y son ciudadanos americanos, aunque no es nada sorprendente que Donald Trump no sepa estos hechos no alternativos. La verdad es que Trump está mintiendo: las negociaciones que se están discutiendo no son un 'rescate financiero', sino que proveerían ​acceso a cuidado de salud que tantos niños y personas mayores en la isla desesperadamente necesitan. En vez de usar a las familias puertorriqueñas como chivos expiatorios y fichas de negociación para el desastroso presupuesto Republicano que probablemente llegue a un cierre del gobierno, Trump debería de pagar los casi $33 millones que le debe a los contribuyentes de Puerto Rico después que aún otro más de sus negocios quebró en la isla"". Información Contextual: En otro día típico en la Casa Blanca, Donald Trump divulgó falsedades por Twitter, esta vez sobre un 'rescate financiero' para los puertorriqueños. En realidad, el tema discutido daría acceso a cuidado de salud a los puertorriqueños, en particular a los niños y las personas mayores. Los puertorriqueños pagan varios impuestos, incluyendo las mismas tazas impositivas de Medicare, Seguro Social e impuestos laborales. Pero, los residentes en la isla reciben tan solo una fracción de los fondos de salud que reciben los 50 estados. Los puertorriqueños demandan trato igualitario, no un 'bailout'. NBC News, 27 de abril de 2017​ Puerto Rico Officials Slam Trump for Tweets on Island 'Bailout' Mientras tanto, Trump convenientemente omitió el hecho de que su campo de golf en la isla quebró, como tantos otros de sus negocios fracasados. La quiebra dejó a los contribuyentes puertorriqueños con una factura de $33 millones, aún otro ejemplo más de las tantas estafas que dejan a Trump más rico y defraudan a familias trabajadoras. "

The share was just 11% in 1960.These “breadwinner moms” are made up of two very different groups: 5.1 million (37%) are married mothers who have a higher income than their husbands, and 8.6 million (63%) are single mothers. 1The income gap between the two groups is quite large. The median total family income of married mothers who earn more than their husbands was nearly $80,000 in 2011, well above the national median of $57,100 for all families with children, and nearly four times the $23,000 median for families led by a single mother. 2The groups differ in other ways as well. Compared with all mothers with children under age 18, married mothers who out-earn their husbands are slightly older, disproportionally white and college educated. Single mothers, by contrast, are younger, more likely to be black or Hispanic, and less likely to have a college degree.The growth of both groups of mothers is tied to women’s increasing presence in the workplace. Women make up almost of half (47%) of the U.S. labor force today, and the employment rate of married mothers with children has increased from 37% in 1968 to 65% in 2011. 3The impact the recession may have had on this trend is unclear. 4 However, a Pew Research Center survey conducted in November 2012 found that mothers’ views about whether and how much they would like to work had changed significantly since 2007 (before the recession officially began). The share of mothers saying their ideal situation would be to work full time increased from 20% in 2007 to 32% in 2012. And the share saying they would prefer not to work at all fell from 29% to 20%.A new Pew Research Center survey finds that the public remains of two minds about the gains mothers have made in the workplace–most recognize the clear economic benefits to families, but many voice concerns about the toll that having a working mother may take on children or even marriage. About three-quarters of adults (74%) say the increasing number of women working for pay has made it harder for parents to raise children, and half say that it has made marriages harder to succeed. At the same time, two-thirds say it has made it easier for families to live comfortably.While the vast majority of Americans (79%) reject the idea that women should return to their traditional roles, 5 the new Pew Research survey finds that the public still sees mothers and fathers in a different light when it comes to evaluating the best work-family balance for children.About half (51%) of survey respondents say that children are better off if a mother is home and doesn’t hold a job, while just 8% say the same about a father.On the topic of single mothers, most Americans (64%) say that this growing trend is a “big problem”; however, the share who feel this way is down from 71% in 2007. Also,young adults are less concerned than older adults about the trend. About four-in-ten adults under age 30 (42%) view it as a big problem, compared with 65% of those in their 30s and 40s and 74% of adults who are 50 and older.The public’s opinions about unmarried mothers also differ by party affiliation and race. Republicans (78%) are more likely than Democrats (51%) or independent voters (65%) to say that the growing number of children born to unwed mothers is a big problem. Whites are more likely than non-whites to view it as a big problem (67% vs. 56%). The views of men and women on this issue are the same.Data for this report are mainly from Pew Research analysis of multiple years of Census Bureau data as well as a recent Pew Research survey conducted by landline and cellular telephone April 25-28, 2013, among a nationally representative sample of 1,003 adults living in the continental United States. More detailed information about the data sources can be found in Appendix 2.Other Key FindingsBoth groups of breadwinner mothers, married and single, have grown in size in the past five decades. Of all households with children younger than 18, the share of married mothers who out-earn their husbands has gone up from 4% in 1960 to 15% in 2011, nearly a fourfold increase. During the same period, the share of families led by a single mother has more than tripled (from 7% to 25%).The total family income is higher when the mother, not the father, is the primary breadwinner. In 2011, the median family income was nearly $80,000 for couples in which wife is the primary breadwinner, about $2,000 more than it was for couples in which husband is the primary breadwinner, and $10,000 more than for couples in which spouses’ income is the same.Married mothers are increasingly better educated than their husbands. Even though a majority of spouses have a similar educational background, the share of couples in which the mother has attained a higher education than her spouse has gone up from 7% in 1960 to 23% in 2011. In two-parent families today, 61% have a mother whose education level is similar to her husband’s, 23% have a mother who is better educated than her husband, and 16% have a father who is better educated than his wife.Most people reject the idea that it is bad for a marriage if a wife out-earns her husband. When asked if they agree or disagree that it is generally better for a marriage if a husband earns more than his wife, some 28% of survey respondents say they agree and 63% disagree. When a similar question was asked in 1997, 40% said they agreed. In the new survey, adults with a high school diploma or less were twice as likely as those with a college degree (35% vs. 18%) to say it is generally better for a marriage if a husband out-earns a wife. There were no significant differences between men and women on this question.Today’s single mothers are much more likely to be never married than were single mothers in the past. The share of never married mothers among all single mothers has increased from 4% in 1960 to 44% in 2011. During the same period, the share of single mothers who had children from previous marriages has gone down from 82% to 50%.Never married mothers have a distinctive profile. Compared with single mothers who are divorced, widowed or separated, never married mothers are significantly younger, disproportionally non-white, and have lower education and income. Close to half of never married mothers in 2011 (46%) are ages 30 and younger, six-in-ten are either black (40%) or Hispanic (24%), and nearly half (49%) have a high school education or less. Their median family income was $17, 400 in 2011, the lowest among all families with children.Based on Pew Research Center analysis of 2011 American Community Survey, the unit of analysis is the household head, single mothers who are not the head of household (e.g., single mothers living with parents) are not included in the count. Similarly, married couples in which neither of the spouses is a household head are not included in the analysis. ↩The income gap between the two groups remains when using personal income as the measure. The median personal income of married mothers who out-earn their husbands was $50,000 in 2011, compared with $20,000 for single moms. Both personal and family income was self-reported. There is a small difference between the median personal income of single mothers and their family income.

In October, he even posted a ""100-day Plan to Make America Great Again."" The list included, among other things, repealing and replacing Obamacare and cleaning up corruption in Washington.So, just a few days shy of the 100-day mark, what can we say? Was Trump the agent of change he vowed to be? The simple answer is no. With the exception of appointing a Supreme Court justice and opting out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Trump has failed to deliver on most of his promises.Almost nothing in the way of legislation has been accomplished. Compared with his predecessors, Trump’s first 100 days have been a dud. He’s done what he could do without the support of Congress and the judiciary, but that, it turns out, isn’t much.In this interview, I talk to H.W. Brands, a professor of history at the University of Texas. Brands is the author of dozens of books, including biographies of Woodrow Wilson , Andrew Jackson , and Benjamin Franklin , and he’s written extensively about the history of the American presidency. Here, we talk about Trump’s first 100 days, what his election represented, and how historians might judge this era 50 years from now.Sean IllingThe 100-day metric is a little silly, but it’s nonetheless become a kind of ritual in this country. Where did it come from?H.W. BrandsThe model for an ambitious and accomplished 100 days is Franklin Roosevelt's first three months. This was almost by accident: Roosevelt called a special session of Congress [in March 1933] to deal with the banking emergency. He figured he would present a bill that would shore up the rapidly failing banking system, Congress would pass it, and everybody would go home because Congress was not scheduled to gather for several months more.He got them to Washington, they were willing to vote and approve his emergency bill without even reading it, so he said, ""Gee, I've got them here. They seem to be cooperative. Let's send them some more stuff."" He sent them some more, and some more, and some more, and every time they just basically rubber-stamped it. By the time he ran out of ideas, it just coincidentally happened to be 100 days, so he looked at a calendar and said, ""Whoops, it's been 100 days."" So Roosevelt sent them home.Sean IllingAs a standard, though, 100 days is unrealistic, right?H.W. BrandsWell, Roosevelt sent Congress 15 major pieces of legislation and Congress passed every one. This was the foundation of the modern welfare state; this was the New Deal. What Roosevelt did became a kind of standard, but it was something that almost by its very nature could not happen again.Sean IllingDonald Trump invited this scrutiny on himself, boasting about his first 100 days long before he got elected. And now, apparently, he plans to hold a big rally celebrating his first 100 days.H.W. BrandsIf Hillary Clinton had gotten elected in 2016, we would not be having this conversation, because she didn't say, ""Elect me, I'm going to change everything."" But Donald Trump did. He said that he would change everything on day one. He's the one who set up a timetable.Sean IllingSo what’s your judgment as a historian of Trump’s first 100 days?H.W. BrandsVery little has been done. Nothing of legislative accomplishment. The big deal was going to be repeal and revision of the Affordable Care Act — that didn't happen. There was some thought that maybe a tax reform bill would get passed, but no, that's not going to happen. The things that President Trump has done so far are things that a president can do by himself with just the stroke of a pen. These are not nothing, though.He has repealed or prevented from taking effect various Obama administration regulations. Those mean something to certain groups, but they don't have the kind of broad impact that legislation has, that programs that are approved by Congress have, because the fact that they can be rescinded by a stroke of a president's pen means they can be reimplemented with the stroke of another president’s pen.Furthermore, they don't have legitimacy, the credibility, of having the approval of more than just one person. If you get major legislation passed, it has the approval of Congress and the presidency, and that means a whole lot more than if it's just the preference of a president.1936: Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882–1945), the 32nd president of the United States.Keystone Features / Getty ImagesSean IllingHas the Trump administration been as abnormal as the Trump campaign, or do you think he’s been moderated by the institutions and the various checks on power?H.W. BrandsI think he's been moderated by the institutions and the expectations and the practices of American politics and the presidency. He discovered what every president-elect discovers, and that is that presidents are less constrained by what they want to do than what the world will let them do, and the world includes Congress. The world includes the courts. The world includes the rest of the world.Presidents with little or no background in government often think that our problems are attributable to the misguided thinking of their predecessor. Sometimes that's the case, but more often it's the case that there are hard problems in the world. Trump might think he was going to solve the Syrian problem overnight, but that’s not how the world works. The Syrian problem is a hard problem, and this president [faces] the same kind of restraint that the previous president did, and China is as intractable in its own way. And for that matter, so are domestic constituencies.Candidate Trump, President-Elect Trump, can talk about tax reform and he's going to change the corporate tax structure, he's going to do this and that, but he is discovering that the tax code is the way it is because it has constituencies. And there are people who like the tax code the way it is, and every time you modify something, you're up against this group that says no, they don't want to do that. They rarely come out against you in a campaign, and so somebody who's defending a particular corporate loophole is not going to campaign against you on that. They know that the way to get or keep what they want is just to lie low, wait for it to be proposed, and then sink it at the committee level in Congress or if it comes to a vote in Congress.The forces of the status quo have a great advantage over the forces of change because they're defending interests, and interests are easier to defend than they are to secure for the first time.Sean IllingOf course the job of judging Trump is complicated by the fact that he promised to do a bunch of big (and often stupid) things but never explained how he would do [them].H.W. BrandsTrump's genius in campaigning was don't get too specific. Just say that we're going to do X and it's going to be beautiful, it's going to be great, we're going to make America great again. Donald Trump was blessedly ignorant on this stuff. Even if you pressed him on something, he didn't know enough to get specific about exactly what he was going to do because he didn't know what he was going to do.I think Donald Trump is somebody who doesn't have a core set of policy principles that he's following. He was an improviser on a campaign trail, and what got a response is something he repeats and amplifies, but I don't think he went into the campaign saying, ""Okay, these are the five policy items I want to accomplish.""Sean IllingBefore the election, and still today, a lot of people worry that Trump is an existential threat to our constitutional democracy. What’s the historical perspective here?H.W. BrandsA president who has very firm and enthusiastic beliefs can be a danger to the principles and practices of this country. But it's hard to identify anything that Donald Trump believes is really worth fighting for. Trump doesn't seem to have enough passion for what he says to really fight for it, and to turn the screws really tight, to push people to the wall. Another thing is you have to be willing to take chances with your popularity, and Trump seems to value his popularity more than he values anything in the way of accomplishment.Photo by Ron Sachs-Pool/Getty ImagesSean IllingCan you think of a good counterexample to Trump on this front? Someone who put policy achievements over political self-interest?H.W. BrandsA good counter example of this is Lyndon Johnson, who was elected with a huge majority in 1964. He really valued what he wanted to do, and he gathered his team at the beginning of his term in '65, the one where he was elected in his own right, and he said, ""We've got this huge majority, but we're going to lose it soon. We'll probably have 18 months or two years to accomplish everything we want because the stuff we're going to do is going to be hard and will ruffle feathers.""Johnson knew he would pay a price for big changes and that he would be unpopular by the end of this time, but he also knew he would have accomplished something.With Trump, the balance between those two seems just the opposite. He would rather stay popular and be unaccomplished than be accomplished and become unpopular.Sean IllingWe've had a lot of what you might call backlash elections in American history, and often these are on the heels of great upheavals in society or things just changed too fast for too many people, and there was a reaction. How do you explain Trump’s ascendance?H.W. BrandsThere are a lot of Trump voters who thought that pretty much everything was broken with the status quo, and what they wanted to do was send a message to the establishment: ""We're not going to stand for it anymore."" Hillary lost — although she won the popular vote, and that’s important to keep in mind — but still, a minority sentiment in the country was that anything was preferable to the status quo.Now, they didn't all agree on how it didn't work, so a lot of people who voted for Trump were people who were doing fairly well economically, so if you ask them what's your complaint, sometimes their complaint was, ""I don't feel I'm getting the respect that I used to.""Trump had a big chance, and the big chance included people that Hillary Clinton very mistakenly called deplorables, which simply confirmed them. Trump was also very slow to disavow racists. He wanted the racist vote. Now, he could have said, ""If you're racist, I don't want you to vote for me."" But of course he wanted them to vote for him. Any candidate would if they thought they could get away with it. More precisely, if they thought they could get the racist vote without alienating another constituency.Sean IllingWhat’s the historical lesson from 2016?H.W. BrandsThe lesson of Trump's election was that in November 2016, there were just enough people sufficiently dissatisfied with the status quo and they lived in just the right places to win him the electoral vote. I don't think you can say a whole lot more than that. I don't think his has become a model for a campaign in 2020.Sean IllingSo you still see Trump as an anomaly?H.W. BrandsI do. A lot of it is Trump himself, and so if Ted Cruz had tried to mimic Donald Trump earlier, would it be President Cruz now? I don't think so at all. Part of it has to do with the very fact that Trump had no track record in government. When you're campaigning against government, the last thing you want is a record of votes where people can say, ""You did this and this."" Nobody can hold that against Trump.Trump did have this brazen ability to get away with saying one thing today and something else tomorrow, and that’s because his supporters simply didn’t care, or they didn’t hold it against him, in any case. Politicians are constantly hammered for flip-flopping. Trump flip-flopped all over the place, and it didn't seem to hurt him.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesSean IllingIt was really a perfect storm of nebulousness for Trump. He was a tabula rasa without a record in politics, and his spectacle-driven campaign gave him the freedom to be vague about ... everything. The idea, as far as I can tell, was to just let people project onto him whatever they needed to project.H.W. BrandsIn an odd way, he mirrored the election of Barack Obama in 2008. Obama had little in the way of a track record. He was a first-term senator, and his campaign slogan was ""Yes, we can."" Well, yes, you can what? He let people fill in the blanks for themselves. Obama was pretty good at not saying exactly what he was going to do, and his timing was good in its own way because it was amid the financial crisis and people were frustrated and scared.The key to a successful candidacy is often allowing voters to project on you their hopes or in some cases their fears for what might happen if you're not elected, and don't get too specific, because every time you get specific, then you risk alienating people or disillusioning them. It's in the nature of democracy, within American democracy, that candidates often win with disillusioned voters.Of course, they become disillusioned after a while, and the real question now, during and after the 100 days, is how long does it take Trump supporters to become disillusioned when they discover he's not delivering on what he promised to deliver? That's an interesting question. Trump has been very good until now in shifting the blame onto somebody else, but I don't think he can do that forever.We'll see.Sean IllingImagine you’re writing a historical dispatch 50 years from now. What do you think it would say about the Trump era?H.W. BrandsI think it'll say that he was a one-term president, who was elected on this wave of revulsion against the status quo. He came in with vague promises, most of which he wasn't able to fulfill, and Americans decided after four years that they needed to turn back to the people who did this for a living, the people who really took governing seriously.In this Storystream"

Here’s What You Need to Know.April 26, 2017All NewsWe have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to do something big. President Trump has made tax reform a priority, and we have a Republican Congress that wants to get it done. This is something that Democrats should support too because it’s good for the American people.The President is going to seize this opportunity by leading the most significant tax reform legislation since 1986 – and one of the biggest tax cuts in American history.The President has focused on three things since his campaign: job creation, economic growth, and helping low and middle-income families who have been left behind by this economy. He understands that there are a lot of people in this country that feel like they work hard and still can’t get ahead. They are sick of turning their paychecks over to Washington and having no idea how their tax dollars are spent. They are frustrated by a tax code that is so complicated that they can’t even do their own taxes.That’s why tax reform is such a big priority for this President. He cares about making the economy work better for the American people.We are going to cut taxes for businesses to make them competitive, and we are going to cut taxes for the American people – especially low and middle-income families.In 1935, we had a one-page tax form consisting of 34 lines and two pages of instructions. Today, the basic 1040 form has 79 lines and 211 pages of instructions. Instead of a single tax form, the IRS now has 199 tax forms on the individual side of the tax code alone. Taxpayers spend nearly 7 billion hours complying with the tax code each year, and nearly 90% of taxpayers need help filing their taxes.We are going to cut taxes and simplify the tax code by taking the current 7 tax brackets we have today and reducing them to only three brackets: 10 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent.We are going to double the standard deduction so that a married couple won’t pay any taxes on the first $24,000 of income they earn. So in essence, we are creating a 0 percent tax rate for the first $24,000 that a couple earns.The larger standard deduction also leads to simplification because far fewer taxpayers will need to itemize, which means their tax form can go back to that one simple page.Families in this country will also benefit from tax relief to help them with child and dependent care expenses.We are going to repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). The AMT creates significant complications and burdens by requiring taxpayers to do their taxes twice to see which is higher. That makes no sense; we should have one simple tax code.Job creation and economic growth is the top priority for this Administration, and nothing drives economic growth like capital investment. Therefore, we are going to return the top tax rate on capital gains and dividends to 20 percent by repealing the harmful 3.8 percent Obamacare tax. That tax has been a direct hit on investment income and small business owners.We are going to repeal the death tax. The threat of being hit by the death tax leads small business owners and farmers in this country to waste countless hours and resources on complicated estate planning to make sure their children aren’t hit with a huge tax when they die. No one wants their children to have to sell the family business to pay an unfair tax.We are going to eliminate most of the tax breaks that mainly benefit high-income individuals. Home ownership, charitable giving, and retirement savings will be protected – but other tax benefits will be eliminated.This is not going to be easy. Doing big things never is. But one thing is for certain: I would not bet against this President. He will get this done for the American people.Gary Cohn is the chief economic advisor to President Donald J. Trump and Director of the National Economic CouncilThe White House

However, the White House does not generally reveal whom he plays with.Just because Mr. Trump is at a golf course, it does not necessarily mean he’s playing golf, Sean Spicer, White House press secretary, said in March, citing a “mini Cabinet” meeting at Mr. Trump’s golf club in Virginia.Trump Has Spent Half of His Weekends at Mar-a-LagoDays at Private GetawayPrivate residences include Mar-a-Lago for Mr. Trump, Chicago for Mr. Obama, and Crawford, Tex., for Mr. Bush.

This comes just hours after a man was dragged off of an overbooked United Airlines flight when he refused to get off the plane. He was pulled out of his seat and thrown into the aisle as seen on a video released on Monday.The baby, whose name has not been released, was left with a welt mark across his face due to the assault. Eyewitnesses say the little boy was screaming for about 38 minutes straight and the parents were asked by the flight attendant several times to “quiet that annoying ass baby down.”After the 4th attempt to get the parents to comply, the flight attendant erupted into a rage grabbing the baby from the mother’s arms and slapping him in the face. It took several passengers to subdue the United Airlines employee.The flight attendant was restrained in the back of the plane until the Pilot could make an emergency landing in Missouri. United Airlines released a statement saying the employee acted in a way that does not represent their company and has been fired.The little boy is said to be in stable condition with no life-threatening injuries.

Ayala, the state attorney in Florida who announced she would not seek the death penalty in murder cases.CreditZack Wittman for The New York TimesORLANDO, Fla. — Gov. Rick Scott of Florida overreached last month when he issued an executive order stripping a state attorney of her authority to prosecute a man charged with killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend and an Orlando police officer. On Monday, he also removed her from 21 other murder cases .Mr. Scott’s executive orders appear to be without precedent in Florida. They are meant to punish the state attorney, Aramis D. Ayala, Florida’s first black elected prosecutor, for announcing she would no longer seek the death penalty because it was not in the best interest of her jurisdiction, which stretches from Orlando to Kissimmee.Ms. Ayala rightly argued that capital punishment does not deter crime, nor does it protect police officers. Instead, it often leads to protracted appeals, and rarely delivers closure to the victim’s family. “Punishment is most effective when it happens consistently and swiftly,” she said. “Neither describe the death penalty in this state.”In retaliation, Governor Scott reassigned the cases to a prosecutor who will most likely seek executions.This is not just a dispute over the death penalty. It’s also about the governor’s brazen lack of respect for prosecutorial independence, which is critical to the functioning of the legal system. Not only is it unclear whether the governor has the authority to make these reassignments, but in substituting his judgment for Ms. Ayala’s, he is also sending a dangerous message to prosecutors in Florida that politics will supersede their discretion.The governor’s action also got ahead of the normal judicial process. Pre-emptively calling the death penalty “justice” wrongly presumes the defendants should be executed without consulting the families of the victims or considering any mitigating evidence about the accused.Governor Scott must quickly reverse his executive orders. I do not say this lightly. I was appointed to lead the Florida Senate criminal justice committee, a rare privilege for a Democrat in the Republican-controlled legislature. I sponsored legislation, signed into law last month by Governor Scott, to require a unanimous jury vote for the death penalty, after the Florida and United States Supreme Courts last year struck down Florida’s capital punishment system as unconstitutional.While I may not agree with Ms. Ayala’s decision to reject the death penalty in all cases, I strongly affirm her right to make that choice.Florida prosecutors, like all prosecutors, have broad discretionary power. That was the central argument in a letter protesting the governor’s overreach, which was signed by more than 150 prosecutors, judges and law professors. “Florida’s entire criminal justice system is premised on the independence of prosecutors,” they wrote. Ms. Ayala “is solely empowered to make prosecutorial decisions for her circuit.”Although Ms. Ayala’s critics have denounced her actions as dereliction of duty, they cannot point to a single law or statute that she has violated. That’s because she hasn’t. There are no federal or state laws that say prosecutors must seek death sentences. And the United States Supreme Court has banned all state laws that make executions mandatory for murders.The governor‘s executive order also undercuts the will of the people who last fall elected Ms. Ayala to serve them. Moreover, a poll last year found that nearly two-thirds of Floridians prefer life imprisonment over the imposition of the death penalty. So do people who live in Central Florida , where her district is, 58 percent to 36 percent.As a black man, I see the death penalty as a powerful symbol of injustice in which race often determines who lives and who dies, especially in Florida. The state has the second-largest number of death row inmates in the country, after California, and African-Americans are grossly overrepresented on Florida’s death row. This disproportionality was a driving force behind my bill. And while I felt that Florida was not ready to relinquish the death penalty, I tried to make it more fair.Ms. Ayala’s arguments for rejecting the death penalty were compelling and well reasoned; they were drawn from the stark racial disparities in the criminal justice system that she confronts every day. Yet Ms. Ayala has always said that she would hold the guilty accountable, including, if he is convicted, the defendant in the first case from which she was removed, Markeith Loyd.Understandably, the issue of how to punish people who kill police officers remains highly charged, especially among law enforcement officials. Many believe that the only proper resolution for the death of Lt. Debra Clayton, the Orlando police officer Mr. Loyd is accused of killing, is an eye for an eye. I get that.But for others, including Stephanie Dixon-Daniels, the mother of Mr. Loyd’s slain ex-girlfriend, who has also experienced a devastating loss, Ms. Ayala’s sentencing choice made sense. The death penalty will continue “to drag us back in court and relive this violent, hideous act,” Ms. Dixon-Daniels said. Instead, she wants closure.Ms. Ayala demonstrated leadership when she made her decision. “An analysis of the death penalty must be pragmatic,” Ms. Ayala concluded. “It must be realistic and not simply theoretical, impulsive or emotional.”It’s disappointing that the governor abandoned the same dispassionate examination. It’s not justice Governor Scott is delivering by forcing the death penalty upon us all. It’s vengeance.Randolph Bracy is the chairman of the Florida Senate criminal justice committee.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A27 of the New York edition with the headline: Florida’s Vengeful Governor.

This makes pending legislation that would set up Education Freedom Savings Accounts a natural fit for New Hampshire families.The first two words here are key: Education Freedom.The current, outdated model of public education is based on funding government bureaucracies that in turn make decisions best left to families, such as decisions on where kids will go to school and what classes they can take.The proposed accounts would instead fund students directly and let parents make those decisions. If for whatever reason a public school isn’t working for their child, they can find a better fit in another school. They also can access the funds for online classes, tutors and supplies. Or if they are the parents of a student with disabilities, they can use the funds for approved therapies critical to their child’s development.These accounts are an acknowledgement that parents, not government institutions, are the best decision makers for children. They love them the most, know them the best and are the ones most vested in their future success. And therefore, they should be given the freedom and resources to pursue the right education options for them.This legislation is not an attack on public schools. It simply is an acknowledgment that kids are unique individuals and one size does not fit all. Nor will this legislation hurt public schools. In fact, a large body of research, including that done in my home state of Florida, indicates quite the opposite. When public schools face increased competition, they get better and kids learn more. Education Freedom Savings Accounts not only would benefit the children whose parents take advantage of them, but also the children who remain in their traditional public schools.The approach was first introduced in Arizona in 2011, focused on the parents of students with disabilities. In subsequent years, the program was expanded to include students zoned in low-performing schools, the students of military personnel and students living on Native American lands. Based on their success, Arizona lawmakers are now considering making them available to every student.Other states have taken notice. Mississippi, Tennessee, Florida and Nevada all have approved versions of the program, each with its own eligibility requirements. In 2015, Nevada became the first state to make the accounts available to all parents. I encourage New Hampshire to follow suit.Empowering parents with the freedom to choose encourages positive change because the right to educate their children no longer can be taken for granted. It must be earned. I commend state Sen. John Reagan, state Reps. Joseph Pitre and Glenn Cordelli for introducing this legislation, and Gov. Chris Sununu, who has been a passionate advocate for school choice.The issue boils down to this: Do we trust mom and dad, or not?(Jeb Bush, a former governor of Florida, is founder, president and chairman of the board of directors of the Foundation for Excellence in Education.)Sports

Judge Andrew Napolitano thinks they likely will. On ""Fox & Friends"" this morning, Napolitano said there are two things at play: United's civil obligations and the actions of the security officers. ""By dislodging this passenger against his will, United violated its contractual obligation,"" Napolitano said. ""He bought the ticket, he passed the TSA, he was in his seat, he has every right to stay there."" As for the police response, Napolitano said they should not have violently dragged the man off the plane just because United officials asked them to. ""If the reason for their call is not a crime, they should leave,"" Napolitano said. ""They have no right using violence to resolve a civil a dispute. ... If the passenger is politely or reasonably sitting there, waiting for the flight to take off, he's not committing a crime, he's not engaged in violence, he's not doing anything that justifies police force."" He said the man ""absolutely"" has a case against United if he files a lawsuit, because of the ""inconvenience and public humiliation."" Napolitano added that the police could also face a lawsuit, because they used excessive force in a situation in which no force was required.

This bill, which is supported and endorsed by FAIR, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, would impose a 2% fee on all remittances headed south of the US border. Remittances, or wire transfers, are commonly used by illegal immigrants to move money from the US to their home countries. In 2014, Mexico alone received over $24 billion in remittances sent from the US, while other South and Central American countries received over 15% of their GDPs in the form of remittances. “President Trump has made it very clear that he intends to complete a wall along our Southern border. As a senior member of the Homeland Security committee, I have long supported the border wall, which will protect Americans.” Rogers said. “In order to jumpstart the funding of the wall, I have introduced a bill to impose a 2% fee on remittances sent south of the border. This bill is simple – anyone who sends their money to countries that benefit from our porous borders and illegal immigration should be responsible for providing some of the funds needed to complete the wall. This bill keeps money in the American economy, and most importantly, it creates a funding stream to build the wall,” Rogers said.

Rick Scott failing to help Florida House protect consumersThe Florida House has chosen to stand with the people of Florida and address workers' compensation reform and assignment of benefits reform, says Speaker Richard Corcoran, R-Land O'Lakes.By Richard Corcoran, special to the TimesPublished: April 3, 2017Updated: April 3, 2017 at 09:15 PMDid you know that Florida's businesses and homeowners are facing hundreds of millions of dollars in insurance rate hikes and tax increases? These increased costs threaten our state's economy and your job.The two most significant cost drivers are the state's workers' compensation system and a property insurance issue known as ""assignment of benefits."" The Florida House of Representatives has been aggressively working to solve these problems, but so far we have been fighting the good fight alone.Fifteen years ago, Florida had the highest workers' compensation rates in the nation. In 2003, the Legislature reformed the system, which reduced workers' compensation rates by 61 percent and saved Florida's businesses over $3 billion in insurance premiums. Last year, the Florida Supreme Court, continuing a recent trend of judicial activism, struck down parts of the state's workers' compensation law. Due to these rulings and other rising costs, Florida's businesses are faced with a 14.5 percent increase in workers' compensation insurance rates, and potentially larger increases are on the horizon.The $552 million extra dollars that Florida's businesses have to spend on workers' compensation insurance is money that was not spent on business expansion, new employees or raising salaries or benefits for current employees. Every new dollar a business has to spend on overhead puts our small and family-run businesses one step closer to failure.""Assignment of benefits"" may be an unfamiliar phrase, but if you own a home this issue is likely to drive up your property insurance bill. Property insurance rates are projected to climb by over $385 million next year and $2.1 billion over the next five years.These issues present the most immediate crisis but they are only one a part of the Florida House's pro-jobs agenda. We are also attempting to lower the cost of automobile insurance in Florida, prevent a back-door property tax increase, eliminate job-killing regulations at the state and local level, and expand the homestead exemption for property taxes by an additional $25,000. In the Florida House, we understand that for Florida to prosper we must make our state an affordable and attractive place to live, work and raise a family.Unfortunately, your representatives in the Florida House stand alone in this fight. Gov. Rick Scott has been indifferent at best on these issues. We would hope the governor would work with the House to save jobs by preventing Florida's businesses and families from having to pay hundreds of millions more in insurance and tax increases. Instead, he has spent the last few months traveling the state attacking House members for putting the welfare of the people of Florida ahead of corporate welfare.The governor has used every ounce of his political capital on his obsession with Enterprise Florida. If you're against Enterprise Florida, he argues, you're against jobs. For those of you not familiar with Enterprise Florida, it is a state agency pretending to be a ""public-private partnership,"" which means that taxpayers foot the bill while the people running the program spend extravagantly. Enterprise Florida writes corporate welfare checks. It subsidizes big companies with over 1,000 employees to compete against our small businesses, which make up 98.9 percent of all businesses in the state and employ nearly half of the state's private sector workforce and who almost never receive a penny of government money. It's an organization that picks winners and losers in the economy, and the losers are always Florida businesses.We're near the halfway point of the 2017 legislative session, and we have to decide what really matters. We have to decide whether this session will be about protecting the wasteful, extravagant spending of Enterprise Florida or about preventing Florida's businesses and homeowners from being buried under an avalanche of unnecessary rate hikes.The Florida House has chosen to stand with the people of Florida and address workers' compensation reform and assignment of benefits reform. We hope the governor will accept our invitation to set our past differences aside and join with us to ensure that these issues are resolved once and for all during this legislative session.The people of Florida can't afford for us not to succeed.Richard Corcoran, R-Land O'Lakes, is speaker of the Florida House.Trending Now"

We’re only 11 weeks in, but already my administration has achieved historic progress for the American people – in fact, 93% of our domestic manufacturers have expressed optimism in the future, a record. The confidence we are seeing in our Nation is about jobs and opportunity – but it’s also about safety and security. Security begins at the border – as a candidate, I pledged to take swift and decisive action to secure the border, and that is exactly what I have done. We inherited a full-fledged border crisis – it was a disaster. Yet, with quick and bold steps, we have so far exceeded even the most bullish predictions for the progress we could make in so short a period of time. Last month, we saw a 64% reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border. At the same time, we are conducting enforcement actions across the country to remove dangerous criminal aliens from our society – and they’ll be gone. In just the last few days our Nation’s ICE officers have arrested 153 criminal aliens in south Texas, 84 criminal aliens in the Pacific Northwest, and 31 criminal aliens in Long Island, New York – these arrests include aliens convicted of robbery, burglary, aggravated assault, sexual assault against a child, smuggling, drug dealing, and many more. Much work needs to be done to reverse decades of harm caused by open border policies from Washington – but, with time, dedication, and effort, we will get the job done, and save countless lives in the process. Providing security for the American People also means restoring America’s standing in the world. From the very start of my Presidency, I have worked to strengthen our alliances and improve our relationships all around the globe. This week, I was honored to welcome the President of Egypt and the King of Jordan to the White House. Now, I am hosting a summit with President Xi of China at the Southern White House to address the many critical issues affecting our two peoples. In our dealings with other nations, our conversations have been candid, open, and grounded in mutual respect. I have been clear about advocating for the national interests of the United States, something so important to me, and so important to our people – one of the reasons, certainly, that I got elected. And I want to ensure that the decisions we make truly serve the safety and security of our citizens. In matters both economic and military, we understand that a strong America is in the best interests of the world – that is why it is so important that as we strengthen international partnerships, we ensure these partnerships deliver real results for Americans and the American people. Our decisions will be guided by our values and our goals – and we will reject the path of inflexible ideology that too often leads to unintended consequences. A future of peace, safety, and prosperity – that is our guiding light, and always will be. Together, we will bring about this future for the land we love, and for the people who call it home. We love our country, and we love the American people. Thank you.

Young IV (PennLive file) Unfortunately, state government is headed down that same path. Facing a deep budget deficit, some in Harrisburg are desperately looking for a quick fix that can only put the state even deeper underwater.Ironically, this is the same approach that has led to a looming $3 billion deficit and painful cuts to important priorities - starting with adequate funding for our public schools.It is the same reckless search for a quick fix that is driving the latest reckless push to privatize and/or outsource the PA Liquor Control Board.Lawmakers will consider two bills this week that will weaken this valuable asset - while creating more profits for the privateers.Combined, bills respectively sponsored by Reps. Mike Reese, R-Somerset , and Adam Harris, R-Franklin , would dramatically increase the number of retail liquor stores by allowing every nuisance bar and corner store willing to pay a fee to sell liquor to go.The Reese bill ( HB438 ) would allow more than 12,000 current licensees to sell spirits to go.This legislation is not designed to increase consumer convenience. It is yet another attempt to cripple the PLCB for purely political reasons. The bill would reduce foot traffic into Wine and Spirit stores, reducing sales and profit - which benefit all taxpayers.The Harris bill ( HB991 ) would allow some existing retailers to operate a ""franchise store"" which is a liquor store operating inside of an existing retail shop.Just think of a mini liquor store next to the potato chips at your corner grocery store. The bill could lead to the opening of as many as 2,000 new liquor stores.Proponents are ignoring basic math and well-documented history. Carving out these sales from the PLCB will obviously reduce the agency's revenue.Reese's bill would allow more than 12,000 current licensees to sell spirits to go. Foot traffic into Wine and Spirit stores will be reduced and profits will be surrendered to the private sector.Last year, the PLCB transferred roughly $626 million to taxpayers in total taxes, profits and other transfers.The PLCB generates real revenue for the state - revenue that might just come in handy in a financial crisis. There is simply no way that the modest license fees for these expanded outlets will ever match the revenue that the PLCB provides ... right now.Every state that has gone down this path has experienced a dramatic loss of revenue and, ultimately, the loss of a valuable public asset. The private interests are peddling a mythical ""windfall"" for the state as they eye greater profits.It is important to note that the PLCB employs 5,000 of our fellow Pennsylvanians, including 3,200 men and women who are among the 21,000 men and women I am proud to represent in Pennsylvania.A crisis is a time to focus on long-term solutions to fix seemingly intractable challenges and there are several viable options on the table.Lawmakers need to raise the state's minimum wage, which would raise the incomes of more than one million Pennsylvanians -- and create at least $225 million in savings in the state Medicaid program.The added spending sparked by a higher minimum wage would create as many as 6,000 new jobs statewide.Finally, virtually every single poll conducted in recent years shows that voters overwhelmingly support a statewide tax on the Marcellus shale drillers. A fair tax would create at least $200 million in new revenue.Quick fixes never work.Wendell W. Young IV is the President of UFCW Local 1776, which represents 22,000 Pennsylvanians in a variety of service, retail, light manufacturing and food processing businesses.

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/06/donald-trump/trumps-environmental-awards-closer-look/	"""I've won awards on environmental protection."""	half-true	['Environment']	https://www.whitehouse.gov/	https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/04/remarks-president-trump-and-vice-president-pence-ceo-town-hall	2017/04/06	South Court Auditorium10:41 A.M. EDTTHE VICE PRESIDENT: It’s a great privilege to be able to welcome you to the White House. Thank you so much. I want to thank everyone involved in the Partnership for New York City — Michael Corbat, Stephen Schwarzman. It’s an honor to have the leaders that are gathered in the room here with us today. I know the President is on his way over, and it’s my great privilege this morning to share a few thoughts, in the midst of this important conversation on the topics that you’re covering before I introduce my friend and the 45th President of the United States.But let me say first and foremost, though, the companies represented in the Partnership for New York City are all American success stories. You have our admiration. You have our appreciation. Your businesses account for more than 7 million jobs and you add over $1 trillion to our economy each and every year.What’s more important is the people behind the numbers, and the topics that you’ve covered today are all about creating more jobs and more opportunities for Americans who are anxious to climb the ladder of success in the organizations that you represent and in companies all across this country.So, first and foremost, on behalf of the President and the whole team that you’ve heard from this morning, and distinguished members of our Cabinet, thank you. Thank you for what you do.Thank you for your leadership.I think as you will hear this morning in the dialogue that is about to commence that America has elected a businessman as President of the United States, and he is committed to being the best friend business has ever had in the White House. (Applause.)We’ve already seen the results. Since literally when the election was called at — I think it was about 4 a.m. in the morning, wasn’t it, Ivanka, that we were all together — literally we’ve seen renewed energy and dynamism in the American economy. The first two jobs reports, as I’m sure you are aware, thanks in no small part to the leadership represented in businesses here in the room today, the first two jobs report show that under President Trump, nearly 500,000 new jobs have been created in the first two months of this year.Businesses and consumers haven’t been this optimistic in decades. In fact, we just learned from the National Association of Manufacturers that in their historic quarterly report, 93 percent of manufacturers are optimistic about the future. That represented almost a 40-point increase in optimism since the last report. (Applause.)We think that is evidence of a vote of confidence in our new President and in his vision to get this economy moving again by putting common-sense principles into practice. From the very outset of this administration, the President has been energetically working to roll back excessive regulation and red tape. Leaders in Congress — and I see Leader McCarthy, who is with us today — have been producing under what’s known as the Congressional Review Act, legislation to roll back onerous regulations that emerged in the waning days of the Obama administration. And in the coming days, President Trump will be signing even more bills into law, rolling back that avalanche of red tape.The President has also taken decisive executive action on expanding American energy — the Keystone pipeline and the Dakota pipeline. We continue to work earnestly with Congress for a new future on healthcare reform. The President and I remain confident that working with the Congress we will repeal and replace Obamacare with healthcare reform that will work for the American people and work for the American economy. And of course, in the offing before we reached the end of the year, the President is determined to roll his sleeves up, work with the Congress and pass the largest tax reform in a generation.Business — as I said in those numbers about optimism — business has clearly gotten the message. But today’s conversation is all about learning from job creators represented in this room how we can continue to build on the momentum in this economy, particularly focusing on infrastructure, government modernization and workforce.I can tell you that the subject that I came in at the end of and I know was much a topic today with Ivanka and with Wilbur, having to do with improving the quality of our workforce, expanding opportunities for what is known as career and technical education — what we back in Indiana call vocational education — is a real passion for our new President. And we look forward to partnering with you in ways that we can continue to encourage investment and create opportunities for expanded career and vocational education.So today is all about really giving you an opportunity to share your thoughts. It’s part of an ongoing conversation this administration has commenced since the very first day the President took office — listening to business leaders, listening to everyday Americans about ways that we can bring about his agenda to make America Great Again and to have our economy growing and expanding in a way that is consistent with the most powerful economy in the history of the world.I think the President is in the side chamber, so let me say to all of you, the opportunity you have today is to hear from a man who I have a chance to sit with every day. What you’re going to see firsthand is what I see each and every day, and that is not only just a businessman made President, but you’re going to see a leader, informed, focused, decisive, and absolutely committed to Make America Great Again.It is my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce to all of you my friend, the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mike. Good morning. Hello, Ivanka.MR. CORDISH: I know you know a few of the people in this room.THE PRESIDENT: I do. I do. All the killers from New York — I’m looking at all those competitive — those great, great talents, great builders.MR. CORDISH: I have to give you a heads-up that Ivanka chaired one of the sessions before this — tough act to follow.THE PRESIDENT: Oh, she’s tough. Very tough.MR. CORDISH: Vice President Pence listed some of the amazing accomplishments that have taken place since your election and your 75 days in office. The stock market has had almost unprecedented sustained growth, unprecedented confidence from our manufacturing sector and other business sectors, leading to massive private sector investment in job growth. You have gotten rid of regulations that were unnecessary and were job-stifling. You have strengthened our borders and strengthened our military. You’ve nominated a great — superb Supreme Court justice, amongst many other things. How does all that feel?THE PRESIDENT: And we’re getting unbelievable credit for what we’ve done, other than the mainstream media, which just gives us no credit whatsoever. But we are getting tremendous credit. And if you look at the real estate industry, the mining industry, the farming industry — if you look at any of the major industries you see what’s going.In fact, even today I was very happy as I read this morning early that our trade deficit with others has gone down very considerably in the last short period of time. It’s having a big impact.And, as you know, I’m meeting with the President of China on Thursday and Friday in Palm Beach, Florida, and I think we’re going to have a very interesting talk. We’re having — have a lot of respect for him. I’ve spoken to him numerous times. But we have to do better, because our deficit with China, as you know, $504 billion. That’s a year. That’s enough for a lifetime. Even Steve would say that. But that’s a year.So we’re going to have a great meeting, I’m sure we’re going to have a fantastic meeting. Andwe’re going to talk about a lot of things, including, of course, North Korea, a problem. And that’s really a humanity problem. So we’re going to be talking about that also.MR. CORDISH: You have made it a driving force in this administration to bring in the best minds we can from the private sector, to listen intently to them and to take decisive action. How important is that, and how important is it to reform government to bridge the gap between the private and public sectors?THE PRESIDENT: Well, I did, I brought you, I brought Gary Cohn, I brought a lot of very great people — my friend, Steve, is helping us out. We have a superstar committee of 22 people. And every time somebody calls me I say, Steve, put them on — no, we want to keep it at this level. The heads of the biggest companies, they all want to be on our committee, right, Stephen? But Steve likes to keep it very small. But they will go off and they’ll disappear and we’ll put others on. But we’ve had some great meetings and we’ve all learned a lot.One thing that did come up, and it came up yesterday, was Gary Cohn — where’s Gary? Is he here? Could you bring that chart, please? Do you mind? Let me see that chart. So this was just something — this is sort of incredible. That’s so beautiful. Yeah, no, you’re not quite — this is to build a highway in the United States — now, this was just done yesterday. I saw it for the first time. I said, I’m speaking to some of my friends who are builders, really great builders, and they’ve gone through the process — we’ve all gone through it in New York — we call it the zoning process in New York.But you start up here and this is anywhere from a 10 to 20-year process. You have — is it 17 agencies. You have hundreds and hundreds of permits. Many of them are statutory, where you can’t even apply for the second permit until six months go by. So this is to build a highway. This is a simple highway. And these are the agencies — so it’s 17 agencies. How many different steps is it?Q: Sixteen different approvals.THE PRESIDENT: Sixteen.Q: Twenty-nine different statutes. Five different executive orders that all apply to this process. This is indicative, so this is not a specific project, but this is the type of process that a government — this is a state government — would have to go through to permit a highway federally. This is just federal, not state regulations.THE PRESIDENT: So it can take anywhere from 10 — if you’re really good, 10 years to 20 years. And then they vote, and you lose. They don’t want it. (Laughter.) And it costs sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars just to go through the process.Thank you very much. That was a great job you did. Be careful, don’t fall. I don’t want to have you fall. You’ll be a big story in the paper if you go down. (Laughter.)So I just saw that yesterday. Gary Cohn walked in and he showed it to me, and — for no reason. I said, you have to do me a favor. But a lot of you, you’re such pros, some of the best pros in the world sitting in this room, you understand it. It’s a process.Now, I’ve always liked it because it gave people that could go through that process an advantage, like Jerry, but it gave us an advantage if you could get through the process. But getting a building approved in New York is a horrible, horrible thing. And that’s nothing compared to when you get into the highways and the dams — they don’t even talk about dams anymore. Hydropower is a great, great, form of power — we don’t even talk about it, because to get the environmental permits are virtually impossible. It’s one of the best things you can do — hydro. But we don’t talk about it anymore.So we’ve come to a halt. We have a tremendous person that we put in charge of EPA, Scott Pruitt, who is an environmental person. He wants clean air, he wants clean water, but he doesn’t thing it takes you 26 years to get a permit to build a building and to have jobs, at which time those companies are usually gone, out of business, et cetera.So we’re really speeding up the process. We’re going to try and take that process from a minimum of 10 years down to one year. I said can’t we make it four months? Can’t we do it in four months? And there is a certain logic to that, but we’ll be satisfied with the year — but it won’t be any more than a year.So we have to build roads. We have to build highways. We’re talking about a very major infrastructure bill of a trillion dollars — perhaps even more. And when we have to do — our jobs — I mean, if we say, we’re giving to New York City hundreds of millions of dollars to build a road someplace, it doesn’t help if they can’t start because it’s going to take seven and a half years to get the permits. Even to redo a road takes years to get the permits. You know, you have a road that’s there and you want to redo it, and you have to get new permits for the kind of asphalt you’re using, the kind of concrete you may want to use.And if we’re going to give all of this money — you know, there was very large infrastructure bill that was approved during the Obama administration — a trillion dollars — nobody ever saw anything being built. I mean, to this day, I haven’t heard of anything that’s been built. They used most of that money — it went, and they used it on social programs. And we want this to be on infrastructure.I’m working with Steve Roth and with Richard LeFrak — two friends of mine that are very good builders. They’re great builders. And they know to get things done. They know how to cut red tape. We’re going to give them the advantage of having what we have. I see Elaine is here, so important, who is doing an incredible job, by the way — Secretary of Transportation. And Elaine will be working. But we’re going to set up a committee headed by Steve and Richard, and we’re going to cut a lot of red tape.But we don’t want to send a billion dollars to New York and find out, five years later, the money was never spent, because we’re going to be very strong that it has to be spent on shovels, not on other programs. And in the last case, a lot of it was spent on other programs. But we’re going to say, if you don’t spend the money — if you don’t start — if you have a job that you can’t start within 90 days, we’re not going to give you the money for it. Because it doesn’t help — doesn’t help us. And we’re going to be very strong on that. They have to be able to start within 90 days.MR. CORDISH: Mr. President, we have some of the great business leaders in the country here. If okay with you, they have a few questions, if that’s —THE PRESIDENT: Sure.THE PRESIDENT: Hello, Jerry. (Laughter.)MR. SPEYER: Hi, Mr. President. (Laughter.)THE PRESIDENT: He didn’t have to say his name. He was ready to say his name — we know. Jerry Speyer, everybody.MR. SPEYER: Mr. President, you’re doing a great job, and we’re all really grateful to you for the sacrifices you’re making. Hope you heard that.THE PRESIDENT: That sounds much better.MR. SPEYER: I think from New York’s point of view we send a lot of money into the economy. As a number of people have said, it’s over a trillion dollars. We’re worried we’re going to have a problem with Congress.THE PRESIDENT: With the deductions, right?MR. SPEYER: Well, that, too. That, too. But we’re worried about various programs that help the city. The city is doing fine right now — even the Yankees are doing fine. But what we’re really concerned about is the future. Do you have any advice for us?THE PRESIDENT: Look, I love New York. And in some ways we’re all lucky that I’m from New York,, because New York has unique problems. So does Los Angeles, so does Chicago. There are places that have unique problems. One of the problems that you have is debt and deductibility. That’s a big one, because a lot of the states that don’t have debt or have very little debt–like in the case of Mike Pence, where he did such a good job in Indiana, and it’s a AAA-rated bond, one of the strongest in the country, and deductibility is not that big of a deal because they don’t have that much to deduct.And over here, in New York, when you look at what’s going on with us, we don’t know in terms of the municipality and in terms of the state, we don’t know if it can even make it if you don’t have that. Are people going to buy? So it’s a very big problem.And the problem I have is that there are many places throughout the country that are in the exact opposite position. And they consider that a gift to the state and a gift to the people. And we know New York does things that a lot of people don’t read about. You look at what — the money they contribute to our economy, to our country, and people don’t know about that. They don’t maybe want to know about that. So you do have — I call it a tale of two cities. You have different interests.But I am watching over everybody, Jerry. You’re in good hands, okay? You’re in good hands, believe me. You can tell the people of New York. Even though I didn’t win New York State. I should have won New York State, but I didn’t. (Laughter and applause.)MS. ENGELBERT: Mr. President, Cathy Engelbert with Deloitte. I want to return to a conversation we just had with Ivanka, Dina and Wilbur on jobs, the workforce of the future. And so as we think about that and we think about our skillsets, in New York City alone our high school — public high school graduation rate is at 70 percent, but the readiness of our students for college and careers is only 37 — it’s assessed at 37 percent.So as we look at the pace of change, we look at the digital transformation we all see in business and the marketplace, and we look at the skills that — this disconnect between what employers need and what our students coming into our workforces are prepared to deliver. It would be great to get your thoughts on the priorities of the administration around education, around, again, what I like to call not the future of work but the work of the future. Because the future of work sounds a little ominous, but the work of the future actually sounds pretty visionary. So if you could give us those priorities —THE PRESIDENT: Okay, so before you sit, so you’re giving me numbers from New York. You’re a proud New Yorker, but you’re giving me numbers — why is it doing so badly? Tell me. Why are the numbers so horrific in terms of education? And what happens when somebody goes through school and then they can’t read after — they graduate from high school and they can barely read. So what’s the answer?MS. ENGELBERT: Yes. So, first, I would say that as we look at New York, New York has made enormous progress in a decade. By the way, that 70 percent was 50 percent, so a 40 percent increase. So we’re making enormous progress in making an impact on —THE PRESIDENT: See how quickly she’s changing? See that? (Laughter.)MS. ENGELBERT: Making enormous progress, but we’re not done. We have a lot of work to do. And I think — we talked earlier about public/private partnerships, apprenticeship models, which — we have a beautiful apprenticeship model that works and brings them our next generation of leaders. So I do think there’s a lot we can do through relooking at funding programs. We talked earlier about consolidating the many programs that are out there. We’re all trying to make our individual impact and we can make a huge impact together.THE PRESIDENT: Sure. I know you work very hard on it and you have made progress. Charter schools are another thing that people are talking about a lot, and some of the charter schools in New York have been amazing. They’ve done incredibly well. People can’t get in. I mean, you can’t get in. I don’t call it an experiment anymore, it’s far beyond an experiment.If you look at so many elements of education, and it’s so sad to see what’s coming — what’s happening in the country. Even the numbers, as good — you say we’re doing better, but the numbers in New York, the numbers in Chicago are very rough. The numbers in Los Angeles, the cities, it’s a very rough situation. Common Core — I mean, we have to bring education more local. We can’t be managing education from Washington.When I go out to Iowa, when I go out to the different states and I talk, they want to run their school programs locally, and they’ll do a much better job than somebody — and look, these are some very good people in Washington, but you also have bureaucrats that make a lot of money and don’t really care that much about what they’re doing or about the community that they have never seen and they’ll never meet, and they never will see.And I like the fact of getting rid of — Common Core to me is — we have to end it. We have to bring education local. To me, I’ve always said it, I’ve been saying it during the campaign. And we’re doing it. Betsy DeVos is — she’s doing a terrific job, highly respected, tremendous track record. But she’s got one of the toughest jobs of any of our secretaries, to me. She’s got one of the toughest jobs. There’s some pretty tough jobs out there, but she’s got one of the toughest jobs.We’re going to spend a lot of money and a lot of expertise. We’re going to have great talent having to do with education, because there’s nothing more important than education. And we’ve got to get those numbers in New York better, and I think they will be better. And a lot of people — a lot of the greatest people I know in New York, they’re totally involved, including Ivanka and Jared, they’re so much involved, and it’s so important to them, the word “education.” And it’s happening, and I see it happening in New York very much.But it’s happening elsewhere, too. I think we’re going to have a great four years.MR. CORDISH: Mr. President, I know you have —THE PRESIDENT: Prior to running again.MR. CORDISH: — a pressing issue to deal with. Steve and Mike I think just wanted to thank you for attending today, and maybe make a final comment on behalf of —MR. SCHWARZMAN: Well, thanks a lot for being here. And thanks for everybody for being here. It’s been a really interesting day, and you’ve had everybody of importance at the event. I think it’s terrific in terms of the stuff you’re trying to do to modernize the government, educate, and so forth. And I think we have to keep a focus on that, because the outside world doesn’t always get the message that that’s really what’s going on — because you’re doing profound things, taking on enormous embedded issues.And I think with the kind of effort that can be marshaled, you can do amazing things. And that’s on behalf of Mike Corbat and myself who chaired the Partnership — it’s sort of trust, and gets rotated from person to person every two years.I want to wish you really good luck with the Chinese. That’s an important thing, as we all know. And I think there’s a real opportunity to make progress with them. And you should have a good time in Florida. I hope the weather is good.THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, the weather will be beautiful. Thank you, Steve.I just want to finish by saying that we are absolutely destroying these horrible regulations that have been placed on your heads over not eight years, over the last 20 and 25 years. You have regulations that are horrendous. Dodd-Frank is an example of what we’re working on, and we’re working on it right now. We’re going to be coming out with some very strong — far beyond recommendations — we’re going to be doing things that are going to be very good for the banking industry so that the banks can loan money to people that need it.I speak to people all the time. They used to borrow money from banks to open up — there’s one in Nevada — to open up a pizza shop here, three shops — he had a bank, and he said, you know — at that time he called me “Mr. Trump” because I hadn’t won yet — but he said, “Mr. Trump, I can’t open up anything; I can’t do anything. The banks don’t even — I had a bank for 20 years; now they don’t even take my phone call. And I was always a very good customer. So I haven’t been able to do what I do.” They can’t do it. I mean, the banks got so restricted.And I’ve always said — and some people get insulted — but, you know, it’s not necessarily the man that’s making a lot of money that’s running the bank. You look at the folks from government that are running all over the banks, they’re running the banks. And the people that are really the head people, they’re petrified of the regulators. They’re petrified. They can’t move. The regulators are running the banks.So we’re going to do a very major haircut on Dodd-Frank. We want strong restrictions, we want strong regulation, but not regulation that makes it impossible for the banks to loan to people that are going to create jobs. But we’re doing — that’s just one example. We’re doing so many cuts on regulations. And we have a book on regulations, and if you add them all up, it goes up to the ceiling three times over. It’s just one after another after another. It’s just like that chart. I thought that chart was so descriptive. And every industry is just like that chart, and that’s to build a simple roadway or highway that’s what you have to go through. And we’re going to be able to get rid of 90, 95 percent of that and still have the same kind of protection.And we want safety and we want environmental — we want environmental protection. I’ve won awards on environmental protection. I’m a big believer, believe it or not. But we want that kind of protection. We want clean air and we want clean water, but we shouldn’t have to get the approvals from 16 different agencies for almost the same thing.So we have a country with tremendous potential. We have the greatest people on Earth, but we have to use that potential and we have to let those people do their thing.And with that, I just want to thank you all. I think you’re going to see a very much different environment than you’ve been used to over the last, again, 20, 25 years. We’re going to unleash the country. And I’m willing to take the heat, and that’s okay. I’ve been taking the heat my whole life. But in the end, I know it’s the right thing to do.And we’re going to create a lot of jobs. We have 100 million people, if you look — the real number is not 4.6 percent. They told me I had 4.6 percent last month, I’m doing great. I said, yeah, but what about the 100 million people. A lot of those people came out and voted for me. I call them the forgotten man, the forgotten woman. But a lot of those people, a good percentage of them, would like to have jobs, and they don’t.One of the statistics that to me is just ridiculous — so the 4.6 sounds good, but when you look for a job, you can’t find it and you give up — you are now considered statistically employed. But I don’t consider those people employed. If you look at what’s happened with Ford and with General Motors and with Fiat-Chrysler and so many other car companies, you see what they’re doing back in Michigan and Ohio — they were leaving. They were going to Mexico and many other places. They’re now staying here.Now, I did say — Reed knows this very well, because you’ve seen me say it many times to the big auto companies at meetings — it’s okay, enjoy your new plant; please send me a picture, I’m sure it’s going to be lovely. But when you make your car or when you make your air conditioner, and you think you’re going to fire all of our workers and open up a new place in another country, and you’re going to come through what will be a very strong border, which is already — you see what’s happened; 61 percent down now in terms of illegal people coming in. Way, way down in terms of drugs pouring into our country and poisoning our youth. Way down. General Kelly has done a great job. But when you think you’re going to sell that car or that air conditioner through our border, it’s not going to happen. You’re going to have a tax. And the tax may be 35 percent.And you know what, every single major company that I’ve had that conversation with has said, you know, we’ve decided to stay in the United States. It’s amazing. And you would have thought they would have said this, frankly, for years. But nobody has ever said it. And we’ve lost close to 70,000 factories over a relatively short period of time — 70,000. You wouldn’t believe it’s possible, Reed, to lose 70,000 factories — 70,000. You know, you look at a map of the United States — how many factories can you lose? We lost almost 70,000 factories.And I will tell you, that’s not happening, because now they’re staying here and they’re all expanding here. Ford announced last week a massive expansion of three of its plants. That was not going to happen, believe me, if I didn’t win.So, good luck, everybody. Enjoy yourselves. You’re my friends. You’re amazing people. And we’re going to put you to work. Thank you. (Applause.)END

With no trace of Thompson, one officer continued to search for him as the other two pried opened three locked deep freezers. Upon their discovery, 11 decapitated bodies were found frozen, while the heads where in ziplock freezer bags. All of the bodies appeared to have been Caucasian women, possibly in their early to mid-20’s. The heads that were found all had the words “Black Lives Matter” carved into the foreheads. The bodies were were preserved, possibly from being stored in the deep freezers.The police radioed for back up and the other freezers were opened where 8 more bodies in similar condition were found, however one of the women was still alive. Authorities at the scene helped the woman out of the freezer and waited for paramedics to arrive.“I was kidnapped by this Black guy after I left work earlier today. We talked for while at Starbucks, where I work, before everything happened. At first he seemed pretty nice but he had this weird twitch that happened every couple of minutes. He asked if he could walk me to my car and I said yes, but that is when everything went dark. When I woke up, I was in this basement and I saw that guy I was with earlier taking saws up the stairs. I cried for help and that is when he stuffed me into a freezer where I saw dead bodies. I must have passed out from shock or something but I am happy you guys found me,” said to police by the victim.Officer Douglas, who was searching for Thompson, found him in a crawl space in the basement. Police ran a background check on him and discovered that he was arrested during a protest for the police involved shooting death of Laquan McDonald. Thompson had no prior criminal record according to authorities.The names of the victims have not been released. Thompson was taken into custody by police and had later tested positive for PCP which authorities believe may have lead to Thompson’s crimes.Related Items:

And the United States Supreme Court has banned all state laws that make executions mandatory for murders."""	true	['Death Penalty', 'Legal Issues', 'States']	https://mobile.nytimes.com/	https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/opinion/floridas-vengeful-governor.html?smid=tw-share&_r=0&referer=https://t.co/iZ7UYSvvxi	2017/04/06	April 4, 2017ImageAramis D. Ayala, the state attorney in Florida who announced she would not seek the death penalty in murder cases.CreditZack Wittman for The New York TimesORLANDO, Fla. — Gov. Rick Scott of Florida overreached last month when he issued an executive order stripping a state attorney of her authority to prosecute a man charged with killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend and an Orlando police officer. On Monday, he also removed her from 21 other murder cases .Mr. Scott’s executive orders appear to be without precedent in Florida. They are meant to punish the state attorney, Aramis D. Ayala, Florida’s first black elected prosecutor, for announcing she would no longer seek the death penalty because it was not in the best interest of her jurisdiction, which stretches from Orlando to Kissimmee.Ms. Ayala rightly argued that capital punishment does not deter crime, nor does it protect police officers. Instead, it often leads to protracted appeals, and rarely delivers closure to the victim’s family. “Punishment is most effective when it happens consistently and swiftly,” she said. “Neither describe the death penalty in this state.”In retaliation, Governor Scott reassigned the cases to a prosecutor who will most likely seek executions.This is not just a dispute over the death penalty. It’s also about the governor’s brazen lack of respect for prosecutorial independence, which is critical to the functioning of the legal system. Not only is it unclear whether the governor has the authority to make these reassignments, but in substituting his judgment for Ms. Ayala’s, he is also sending a dangerous message to prosecutors in Florida that politics will supersede their discretion.The governor’s action also got ahead of the normal judicial process. Pre-emptively calling the death penalty “justice” wrongly presumes the defendants should be executed without consulting the families of the victims or considering any mitigating evidence about the accused.Governor Scott must quickly reverse his executive orders. I do not say this lightly. I was appointed to lead the Florida Senate criminal justice committee, a rare privilege for a Democrat in the Republican-controlled legislature. I sponsored legislation, signed into law last month by Governor Scott, to require a unanimous jury vote for the death penalty, after the Florida and United States Supreme Courts last year struck down Florida’s capital punishment system as unconstitutional.While I may not agree with Ms. Ayala’s decision to reject the death penalty in all cases, I strongly affirm her right to make that choice.Florida prosecutors, like all prosecutors, have broad discretionary power. That was the central argument in a letter protesting the governor’s overreach, which was signed by more than 150 prosecutors, judges and law professors. “Florida’s entire criminal justice system is premised on the independence of prosecutors,” they wrote. Ms. Ayala “is solely empowered to make prosecutorial decisions for her circuit.”Although Ms. Ayala’s critics have denounced her actions as dereliction of duty, they cannot point to a single law or statute that she has violated. That’s because she hasn’t. There are no federal or state laws that say prosecutors must seek death sentences. And the United States Supreme Court has banned all state laws that make executions mandatory for murders.The governor‘s executive order also undercuts the will of the people who last fall elected Ms. Ayala to serve them. Moreover, a poll last year found that nearly two-thirds of Floridians prefer life imprisonment over the imposition of the death penalty. So do people who live in Central Florida , where her district is, 58 percent to 36 percent.As a black man, I see the death penalty as a powerful symbol of injustice in which race often determines who lives and who dies, especially in Florida. The state has the second-largest number of death row inmates in the country, after California, and African-Americans are grossly overrepresented on Florida’s death row. This disproportionality was a driving force behind my bill. And while I felt that Florida was not ready to relinquish the death penalty, I tried to make it more fair.Ms. Ayala’s arguments for rejecting the death penalty were compelling and well reasoned; they were drawn from the stark racial disparities in the criminal justice system that she confronts every day. Yet Ms. Ayala has always said that she would hold the guilty accountable, including, if he is convicted, the defendant in the first case from which she was removed, Markeith Loyd.Understandably, the issue of how to punish people who kill police officers remains highly charged, especially among law enforcement officials. Many believe that the only proper resolution for the death of Lt. Debra Clayton, the Orlando police officer Mr. Loyd is accused of killing, is an eye for an eye. I get that.But for others, including Stephanie Dixon-Daniels, the mother of Mr. Loyd’s slain ex-girlfriend, who has also experienced a devastating loss, Ms. Ayala’s sentencing choice made sense. The death penalty will continue “to drag us back in court and relive this violent, hideous act,” Ms. Dixon-Daniels said. Instead, she wants closure.Ms. Ayala demonstrated leadership when she made her decision. “An analysis of the death penalty must be pragmatic,” Ms. Ayala concluded. “It must be realistic and not simply theoretical, impulsive or emotional.”It’s disappointing that the governor abandoned the same dispassionate examination. It’s not justice Governor Scott is delivering by forcing the death penalty upon us all. It’s vengeance.Randolph Bracy is the chairman of the Florida Senate criminal justice committee.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A27 of the New York edition with the headline: Florida’s Vengeful Governor.

(FILE)Over a dozen county commissioners from Pennsylvania’s northern tier are working to organize around an issue that directly impacts their constituents: natural gas drilling.Organizers said Harrisburg often neglects the interests of its more far-flung counties. They described their keynote speaker as someone who’s gone against that trend– York County Republican senator and gubernatorial hopeful , Scott Wagner, has supported natural gas drilling since he was elected.Wagner noted repeatedly that this wasn’t a campaign event, though that didn’t stop a few speakers from remarking that it would be nice to have a governor who would reduce regulations on the gas industry.Amid his calls to get pipelines flowing, Wagner did take the opportunity to lay out some policy proposals–and try out some catchphrases.“There’s a huge difference between an active environmentalist and an environmental activist,” he said, using a line he reiterated multiple times. “I love the outdoors, I grew up around the outdoors, I love fishing–I am in favor of drilling on state lands.”This year, the commonwealth is expecting about $80 million in royalties from drilling in state forests .Wagner said he thinks there are too many redundant restrictions on the oil and gas industry that need to be studied and pared down–a popular position among the rural county commissionersHe also took the stance that climate change is probably happening, though–citing scientifically unsound evidence–he maintained that the US shouldn’t worry too much about emissions.“I haven’t been in a science class in a long time, but the earth moves closer to the sun every year–you know the rotation of the earth,” Wagner said. “We’re moving closer to the sun.”He added, “We have more people. You know, humans have warm bodies. So is heat coming off? Things are changing, but I think we are, as a society, doing the best we can.”Bradford County commissioner, Doug McLinko, said Wagner has been a great help in efforts to organize various rural counties, noting that the senator has always been eager to visit the northern tier and see the drilling and its impact for himself.TagsImpactAbout StateImpact PennsylvaniaStateImpact Pennsylvania is a collaboration among WITF , WHYY , WESA , and the Allegheny Front .

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/30/jeff-sessions/jeff-sessions-misleads-saying-inspector-general-fo/	"""Just last May, the Department of Justice inspector general found that these (‘sanctuary city’) policies also violate federal law."" "	mostly false	['Crime', 'Criminal Justice', 'Homeland Security', 'Immigration']	https://www.justice.gov/	https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-jeff-sessions-delivers-remarks-sanctuary-jurisdictions	2017/03/30	Attorney General Jeff Sessions Delivers Remarks on Sanctuary JurisdictionsWashington, DC~Monday, March 27, 2017Good afternoon. The Department of Justice has a duty to enforce our nation’s laws, including our immigration laws. Those laws require us to promptly remove aliens when they are convicted of certain crimes. The vast majority of the American people support this common-sense requirement. According to one recent poll, 80 percent of Americans believe that cities that arrest illegal immigrants for crimes should be required to turn them over to immigration authorities.Unfortunately, some states and cities have adopted policies designed to frustrate the enforcement of our immigration laws. This includes refusing to detain known felons under federal detainer requests, or otherwise failing to comply with these laws. For example, the Department of Homeland Security recently issued a report showing that in a single week, there were more than 200 instances of jurisdictions refusing to honor Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer requests with respect to individuals charged or convicted of a serious crime. The charges and convictions against these aliens include drug trafficking, hit and run, rape, sex offenses against a child and even murder. Such policies cannot continue. They make our nation less safe by putting dangerous criminals back on our streets. We all remember the tragic case of Kate Steinle, the 32-year-old woman who was shot and killed two years ago in San Francisco as she walked along a pier with her father. The shooter, Francisco Sanchez, was an illegal immigrant who had already been deported five times and had seven felony convictions. Just eleven weeks before the shooting, San Francisco had released Sanchez from its custody, even though ICE had filed a detainer requesting that he be kept in custody until immigration authorities could pick him up for removal. Even worse, Sanchez admitted that the only reason he came to San Francisco was because of its sanctuary policies. A similar story unfolded just last week, when Ever Valles, an illegal immigrant and Mexican national, was charged with murder and robbery of a man at a light rail station. Valles was released from a Denver jail in late December, despite the fact that ICE had lodged a detainer for his removal. The American people are justifiably angry. They know that when cities and states refuse to help enforce immigration laws, our nation is less safe. Failure to deport aliens who are convicted for criminal offenses puts whole communities at risk – especially immigrant communities in the very sanctuary jurisdictions that seek to protect the perpetrators. DUIs, assaults, burglaries, drug crimes, gang crimes, rapes, crimes against children and murders. Countless Americans would be alive today – and countless loved ones would not be grieving today – if the policies of these sanctuary jurisdictions were ended. Not only do these policies endanger the lives of every American; just last May, the Department of Justice Inspector General found that these policies also violate federal law. The President has rightly said that this disregard for the law must end. In his executive order, he stated that it is the policy of the executive branch to ensure that states and cities comply with all federal laws, including our immigration laws.The order also states that “the Attorney General and the Secretary [of Homeland Security] . . . shall ensure that jurisdictions that willfully refuse to comply” with the law “are not eligible to receive Federal grants, except as deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes by the Attorney General or the Secretary.”Today I am urging all states and local jurisdictions to comply with all federal laws, including 8 U.S.C. Section 1373. Moreover, the Department of Justice will require jurisdictions seeking or applying for Department grants to certify compliance with Section 1373 as a condition for receiving these awards. This policy is entirely consistent with the Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs (OJP) guidance issued last July under the previous administration. This guidance requires state and local jurisdictions to comply and certify compliance with Section 1373 in order to be eligible for OJP grants. It also made clear that failure to remedy violations could result in withholding of grants, termination of grants, and disbarment or ineligibility for future grants.The Department of Justice will also take all lawful steps to claw-back any funds awarded to a jurisdiction that willfully violates Section 1373. In the current fiscal year, department’s OJP and Community Oriented Policing Services anticipate awarding more than $4.1 billion dollars in grants. I urge our nation’s states and cities to consider carefully the harm they are doing to their citizens by refusing to enforce our immigration laws, and to re-think these policies. Such policies make their cities and states less safe, and put them at risk of losing valuable federal dollars.The American people want and deserve a lawful immigration system that keeps us safe and serves our national interest. This expectation is reasonable, and our government has a duty to meet it. And we will meet it.Speaker:

The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 gave the President overall responsibility for budget planning by requiring him to submit an annual, comprehensive budget proposal to the Congress; that act also expanded the President’s control over budgetary information by establishing the Bureau of the Budget (renamed the Office of Management and Budget in 1971). By contrast, the Congress lacked institutional capacity to establish and enforce budgetary priorities, coordinate actions on spending and revenue legislation, or develop budgetary and economic information independently of the executive branch.Conflict between the legislative and executive branches reached a high point during the summer of 1974, when Members of Congress objected to President Richard Nixon’s threats to withhold Congressional appropriations for programs that were inconsistent with his policies (a process known as impoundment). The dispute led to the enactment of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 in July of that year.That act reasserted the Congress’s constitutional control over the budget by establishing new procedures for controlling impoundments and by instituting a formal process through which the Congress could develop, coordinate, and enforce its own budgetary priorities independently of the President. In addition, the law created new legislative institutions to implement the new Congressional budget process: the House and Senate Budget Committees to oversee execution of the budget process and the Congressional Budget Office to provide the Budget Committees and the Congress with objective, impartial information about budgetary and economic issues.

It's time to Finish the Job.Signed into law in 1993, the Brady Bill put in place criminal background checks at federally licensed dealers designed to prevent dangerous people from purchasing guns.What is a Brady background check?When an individual goes to a retailer to purchase a firearm, the retailer contacts the FBI to run a background check on each gun purchaser. The FBI checks the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to see if they are a prohibited purchaser. Prohibited purchasers include felons, fugitives, domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill. Simply put, the effective Brady Law prevents guns from getting into the hands of dangerous people.Since taking effect in 1994, the law has blocked more than 3 million gun sales to prohibited purchasers including felons, domestic abusers, and other dangerous individuals.The bottom line: background checks work. But today, experts estimate that 1 out of 5 gun sales occur in “no questions asked” transactions that often take place over the Internet or at gun shows where, in most states, background checks are not required. This dangerous loophole puts thousands and thousands of guns in the hands of dangerous people like domestic abusers, felons and the dangerously mentally ill.What is being done about the gun sales not subjected to Brady background checks?Unchecked sales occur at gun shows across the country and over the Internet every single day. Current legislation (H.R. 3411) pending in the U.S. House of Representatives would solve this problem by expanding Brady background checks to all gun sales including sales made over the Internet and at gun shows The Brady Campaign isn’t waiting for Congress to act. Since 2013, six states have passed new laws expanding Brady background checks to all gun sales. This is tremendous momentum ultimately Congress won’t be able to ignore the will of the people as more and more states act.This is unprecedented momentum across the country. Most recently, Oregon and Washington expanded Brady background checks to all gun sales, and in 2016 both Nevada and Maine citizens will cast their votes to expand Brady background checks. After Maine and Nevada, there are 14 more states that where we can pass ballot initiatives to expand Brady background checks to all gun sales.Take Action Now91% of Americans support Brady background checks. Join them and tell Congress it's time to Finish the Job by expanding Brady background checks and making this the safer nation we all deserve.

It has made offers in 89 other cases, according to the letter; 71 of the offers would make the defendants, who already have served 35 years or more, eligible for immediate parole.According to a separate court filing by the Defender Association of Philadelphia, one of the three facing a life sentence once again is Andre Martin, who was 15 years old when he shot a police officer, John Trettin, dead in 1976. philadelphia InquirerSept. 26, 1976, coverage of the murder trial of Andre Martin, who was 15 years old and had an IQ of 80 when he shot police officer John Trettin. Both the defense lawyer and the prosecutor at the time were intent on making their names on this case, ""a crime that shocked the city.""District Attorney's Office spokesman Cameron Kline said he could provide no information on the three cases, but he offered a statement: ""District Attorney Williams has said that he prefers not to seek sentences of life without parole, but there will always be exceptions. The office looks at each case individually and makes sentencing offers based on the evidence, defendant's history, and the law, among other factors."" Bradley Bridge of the Defender Association, which is representing more than two-thirds of the city's juvenile lifers, said the reversal surprised him. He said he learned of it just weeks before a hearing, set for March 6, in which a panel of judges is scheduled to consider questions of law that will guide future resentencings in Philadelphia.""I’m perplexed as to why individual district attorneys might be seeking a life sentence upon resentencing, when Seth Williams, the district attorney, has committed to not seeking life upon resentencing,"" he said.In June, Williams told the Inquirer that he had taken to heart the Supreme Court’s pronouncement, in the cases Miller v. Alabama and Montgomery v. Louisiana, that life without parole must be reserved for the ""rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption.""Martin's case was a high-profile one in its time, shot through with issues of race and police-community relations that still resonate today. According to Inquirer coverage from 1976, Martin had an IQ of 80 and was high on Valium and marijuana when he shot a police officer through the window of an apartment in a public-housing project.

Nelson’s Filibuster FalsehoodBefore Senator Nelson’s meeting w/ Judge Gorsuch today, it’s important to take a look back at his filibuster flip-flop. In 2006, Nelson opposed the use of a filibuster for the nomination of Justice Alito, but now has adopted a different stance. See below for more…FLIP: In 2006, Senators Nelson joined a small handful of Democrat Senators who opposed an unprecedented effort by fellow Democrats like Clinton, Obama, Kennedy, etc. to filibuster Justice Alito’s nomination. Nelson voted for cloture (against the filibuster), then voted against Alito’s nomination (no on the up-or-down vote), standing by the principle of not filibustering SCOTUS nominees. ( Link to vote )FLOP: Following the nomination of Judge Gorsuch, Senator Nelson changed his tune on the filibuster, maybe under pressure from Schumer, and is now calling for 60 votes for Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation. This from the Tampa Bay Times :“… Nelson opposed a filibuster of Samuel Alito’s Supreme Court nomination in 2006, calling for an up-or-down vote (he was ultimately against Alito) but today stands with Democrats in insisting on a 60-vote threshold. “You bet I do. The filibuster has always forced the political extremes to come of the middle to build consensus,” Nelson said…”FACT CHECK: The Washington Post gave “Two Pinocchios” to Senator Nelson’s Democrat colleagues who called this ’60-vote threshold’ the standard for Supreme Court nominees, saying that the Senate Democrats are “being slippery with their language.”PolitiFact gave Senator Baldwin the rare “Full Flop” for making the same claims Senator Nelson is making now: previously supporting a speedy confirmation process for SCOTUS nominees but now trying to obstruct the nomination of Judge Gorsuch.While at least nine other Democrats have called for an up-or-down vote of Judge Gorsuch, Senator Nelson appears to be succumbing to pressure from his party’s leadership and left-wing activists.Take Action!Stand up to greedy trial lawyerskilling Missouri jobs

EMILY MICHOT emichot@miamiherald.comTrump blames wrong president for most Guantánamo ‘back to battlefield’ releasesBy Carol RosenbergMarch 07, 2017 07:57 AMGUANTANAMO BAY NAVY BASE , CubaPresident Donald Trump broke his White House silence on the topic of Guantánamo Tuesday, incorrectly blaming Barack Obama, not George W. Bush, for the release of more than 100 captives whom U.S. intelligence agencies consider recidivists.122 vicious prisoners, released by the Obama Administration from Gitmo, have returned to the battlefield. Just another terrible decision!The president’s tweet, just after 7 a.m., correctly referred to an Obama-era report from the Office of the Directorate of National Intelligence as citing 122 former captive as “re-engagers.”But it failed to note that 113 of the men described by Trump in his tweet as “vicious prisoners” were released by the George W. Bush administration. The report, released in September, said nine captives sent to other countries by the Obama administration were confirmed to re-engage, the term for what is colloquially called having gone back to the fight.SIGN UPHelp us deliver journalism that makes a difference in our community.Our journalism takes a lot of time, effort, and hard work to produce.

Emily Michotemichot@miamiherald.comThe so-called recidivist rate may have interested the new president because of the Pentagon’s disclosure a day earlier that a U.S. air strike in Yemen had killed a captive repatriated by the Obama administration in December 2009.MORE NEWS: Pentagon says U.S. airstrike in Yemen killed ex-Guantánamo detaineeTrump’s vow to keep Guantánamo open and add new prisoners was a popular soundbite during his campaign. He had not spoken about the prison since moving to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue; only alleged draft versions of proposed detention policy have leaked.Congress established the regular reporting mechanism by the intelligence community on what has become of captives released from Guantánamo in 2012.It breaks down the report between the 532 transferred to other nations’ custody during the Bush administration and those by the Obama administration, which transferred 182. Those release figures don’t include the seven captives who died at Guantánamo and the Tanzanian man serving life in prison after a federal trial in New York.As it happens, the national intelligence directorate issued an updated report hours after Trump’s tweet. It dropped the confirmed figure of those found to reengage to 121. Of them, 113 were released by the Bush administration and eight during the Obama years.It also reported that 31 were dead, one more than in the report the president referenced. The report as of Jan. 15 doesn’t identify the dead. But the intelligence community might have added a former British captive who reportedly killed himself in a suicide bombing in Iraq at an undisclosed date. The Bush administration repatriated the British citizen in 2004.

Recently, several hundred of Johnson’s constituents held a town hall in Madison, Wisconsin with an empty chair where Johnson would have been sitting.“How can he be our voice in Washington when he’s not here listening to the voices of the state he represents?” Madison resident Stephanie Kurtz said.After enough pressure from constituents, Johnson finally responded, but not in a way they would hope. In a cease-and-desist letter Johnson’s office sent to one constituent who made regular calls and visits to Sen. Johnson’s office, the Wisconsin senator threatened to call the police and order the constituent’s arrest if they didn’t stop calling and visiting.“Our office has done all that we can to assist you with your concerns.

A petition shall have been signed by the petitioning electors not more than 150 days after an affidavit has been filed with the State Board of Elections providing notice of intent to circulate a petition to recall the Governor. The affidavit may be filed no sooner than 6 months after the beginning of the Governor's term of office. The affidavit shall have been signed by the proponent of the recall petition, at least 20 members of the House of Representatives, and at least 10 members of the Senate, with no more than half of the signatures of members of each chamber from the same established political party. (b) The form of the petition, circulation, and procedure for determining the validity and sufficiency of a petition shall be as provided by law. If the petition is valid and sufficient, the State Board of Elections shall certify the petition not more than 100 days after the date the petition was filed, and the question ""Shall (name) be recalled from the office of Governor?"" must be submitted to the electors at a special election called by the State Board of Elections, to occur not more than 100 days after certification of the petition. A recall petition certified by the State Board of Elections may not be withdrawn and another recall petition may not be initiated against the Governor during the remainder of the current term of office. Any recall petition or recall election pending on the date of the next general election at which a candidate for Governor is elected is moot.

Names of candidates for the successor election must be submitted to the electors at a special successor election called by the State Board of Elections, to occur not more than 60 days after the date of the special primary election or on a date established by law. (d) The Governor is immediately removed upon certification of the recall election results if a majority of the electors voting on the question vote to recall the Governor.

On behalf of the Government of Canada, I am writing back to let you know that I wholeheartedly agree: Poverty is Sexist.Women and girls are less likely to get an education, more likely to be impoverished, and face greater risk of disease and poor health. I am grateful to groups like ONE, who work toward ending extreme poverty and gender inequality around the world, while also holding global leaders accountable.I accept your challenge to lead. As a feminist, I know that women must be treated equally everywhere. That is why, as one of my first actions as Prime Minister, I named a gender balanced Cabinet. It is my hope that this will set an example for governments around the world.The Government of Canada is taking another important and concrete step: we will host the Global Fund replenishment conference in Montreal in September. We have also raised our contribution by 20% to $785 million CDN.Investing in the Global Fund – which fights HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis – is critical, particularly for young women, who account for a shocking 74% of all new HIV infections among adolescents in Africa. Canada’s increased investment means more mosquito nets and medicine, and greater access to treatment and therapy, all of which will help the Global Fund meet its ultimate goal of saving an additional eight million lives and averting an additional 300 million new infections by 2019.This commitment could not come at a more important time. The world has a unique opportunity to make lasting progress. By fast-tracking investments and building global solidarity, we can bring an end to three devastating epidemics – HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis – that have tragic and far-reaching impacts on the most vulnerable people around the world.Canada’s commitment to the Global Fund is the first step on a path toward a new global policy that prioritizes equal treatment of girls and women. Investing in health will enable girls and women to survive and flourish, including by making key contributions to ending extreme poverty for everyone.But no one leader can make this happen alone. Canada can play an important role, but we need other leaders around the world to step up, too. And that’s where you come in.Please continue to use your voice to ask for more from all leaders around the world. Please ask them to come to the Global Fund Replenishment Conference with ambitious goals, investments, and innovations in support of girls and women everywhere.And please know that your call has been heard and that the Government of Canada is taking action.Thanks, and see you soon.Justin Trudeau Je vous remercie de la lettre que vous m’avez transmise à l’occasion de la Journée internationale de la femme, et d’avoir demandé aux dirigeants du monde de reconnaître le lien incontestable entre l’inégalité des sexes et l’extrême pauvreté. Au nom du gouvernement du Canada, je vous réponds afin de vous dire que je suis entièrement d’accord avec vous : la pauvreté est sexiste.Les femmes et les filles sont moins susceptibles d’obtenir une éducation, plus susceptibles de vivre dans la pauvreté et courent un plus grand risque d’être atteintes par la maladie et d’avoir des problèmes de santé. Je suis reconnaissant envers les groupes comme ONE, dont le travail vise à mettre fin à l’extrême pauvreté et à l’inégalité des sexes à travers le monde, tout en demandant aux dirigeants du monde de se responsabiliser.J’accepte votre défi d’agir comme leader. En tant que féministe, je sais que les femmes doivent être traitées équitablement, peu importe où elles se trouvent. C’est pourquoi j’ai nommé un nombre égal de femmes et d’hommes au sein de mon Cabinet. Il s’agit de l’un des premiers gestes que j’ai posé en tant que premier ministre et j’espère que nous pourrons servir de modèle pour les gouvernements du monde entier.Le gouvernement du Canada franchit un autre pas important et concret : nous accueillerons la Conférence sur la reconstitution des ressources du Fonds mondial à Montréal, en septembre prochain. Nous avons également augmenté notre contribution financière de 20%, qui s’élève maintenant à 785 millions de dollars canadiens.Les investissements dans le Fonds mondial, qui lutte contre le VIH/SIDA, le paludisme et la tuberculose, sont d’une importance cruciale. Ceci est particulièrement vrai pour les jeunes femmes, qui représentent 74% de l’ensemble des nouvelles infections par le VIH totalisées parmi les adolescents d’Afrique. L’investissement accru du Canada permettra d’augmenter la quantité de moustiquaires et de médicaments distribués, en plus de garantir un meilleur accès aux traitements et aux thérapies. Toutes ces mesures aideront le Fonds mondial à atteindre son objectif ultime qui consiste à sauver huit millions de vies supplémentaires et à éviter 300 millions de cas de nouvelles infections d’ici 2019.Cet engagement ne pouvait être pris à un moment plus important. Le monde se voit offrir une occasion unique de réaliser des progrès durables. En accélérant les investissements et en bâtissant la solidarité à l’échelle mondiale, nous pouvons mettre fin à trois épidémies dévastatrices : le VIH/SIDA, le paludisme et la tuberculose. Ces maladies ont des conséquences tragiques et profondes sur les personnes les plus vulnérables du monde.L’engagement du Canada envers le Fonds mondial est le premier pas vers l’élaboration d’une nouvelle politique d’envergure mondiale qui fait du traitement égal des femmes et des filles une priorité. Les investissements dans la santé permettront aux filles et aux femmes de survivre et de s’épanouir, notamment en apportant d’importantes contributions en vue de mettre fin à l’extrême pauvreté pour tous.Mais aucun dirigeant ne peut atteindre un tel objectif en agissant seul. Le Canada peut jouer un rôle important, mais nous devons veiller à ce que d’autres dirigeants des quatre coins du monde s’engagent à leur tour. Et c’est ici que vous intervenez.Je vous prie de continuer à faire entendre votre voix pour exiger davantage de la part des dirigeants du monde. Demandez-leur de venir à la Conférence de reconstitution du Fonds mondial en présentant des objectifs, innovations et investissements ambitieux pour appuyer les filles et les femmes du monde entier.Et sachez également que votre appel a été entendu et que le gouvernement du Canada passe à l’action.Merci, et au plaisir de vous voir bientôt.Justin TrudeauJoin the fight against extreme povertyName

[cheers and applause] ♪ ♪ hi, i'm bill o'reilly. thanks for watching us tonight. as we continue our coverage of the democratic national convention, the theme this evening hillary clinton's history of helping children and families. now, that's not a child there. that is a clinton advocate telling us why she is worthy to be president. her husband, the former president, will be speaking in the 10:00 hour. and will put forth the reasons why his wife should be president. otherwise, the speakers fairly low profile today with the exception of actress lena dunham the star of program girls.5:01 pmhow dunham ties in with kids and families i'm not quite sure unless she is promoting tattoos for them. anyway, let's not be catty. counsel countering donald trump. it's clear this convention is designed to portray mr. trump who will join us in a few minutes as a man unworthy of political office. to me that's a waste of time. everybody knows mr. trump even the dimmest among us can formulate an opinion on his worthiness. what is important, however, is how the democratic leadership is positioning the party. last night, michelle obama said. this. >> that is the story of this country, the story that has brought me to the stage tonight. the story of generations of people who felt the lash of bondage, the sting of segregation but who kept on striving and hoping and doing what needed to be done so that today i wake up every morning in a house5:02 pmthat was built by slaves. don't let anyone ever tell you that this country isn't great. that somehow we need to make it great again. because this right now is the greatest country on earth. >> the first lady directly repudiating the republican mantra that the u.s. is in decline. by the way, i will deal with mrs. obama's slave white house analysis in the tip of the day later on. senator elizabeth warren also spoke last night she had little to say other than trump is bad and hillary is good. senator warren continues to like socialism as well. but not as much as bernie sanders. a socialist standard bearer who is a bit disappointed the way the whole thing turned out. >> i understand that many people here in this convention hall and around the country are disappointed about the final results of the nominating process. i think it's fair to say5:03 pmthat no one is more disappointed than i am. but to all of our supporters here and around the country, i hope you enormous pride in the historical accomplishments we have achieved. talking points not sure what historical accomplishments have been achieved. it is stunning that 43% of democratic primary voters want a socialist in the white house. again, that's not an accomplishment. that is a mystery. to be sure, bernie sanders is not a phony, is he a feisty, honest guy, he would absolutely take over the private economy if he were president. telling each and every american what they can earn, what they can keep. ened anyway, bernie sanders history for the moment. and hillary clinton has received her party's nomination for president.5:04 pmthe first american woman in history to do so. like her or not, that is an accomplishment. but whether she can effectively counter donald trump is all that matters right now. and that's the memo. now for the top story. just a few hours ago i spoke with mr. trump who was in florida. >> so the democratic convention so far has been to counter you and your themes. number one is that president obama saved the country from a depression, that he inherited such a bad economic condition in 2008 that the economy is not his fault and he actually saved us from armageddon. you buying any of that? >> no, because it was going to work out, bill. it always works out. we always have bad periods. and that was a bad period. but we have had many of them. frankly it works out. they could have done things a lot differently. and our recovery has been a very weak recovery. you look at the recovery, it's the weakest recovery in history. it's the weakest recovery on record. and you look at joblessness,5:05 pmand i'm not talking about the phony 5% number. i'm talking about the 21% or 22% real number where people can't find jobs. they can't find work. we are losing our jobs in our factories and everything else to other countries, including mexico. so, you know, you know the real numbers. you see the real numbers. >> it's an interesting argument because it's speculative and you can't deny how bad it was with lima brothers folding and all of that and a lot of panic. on the other hand, you know, 8 years is 8 years. i tend to agree that the economy should be better than it is now. what about the minimum wage? you got hammered on that by bernie sanders last night. what's your vision for federal minimum wage? how much? >> well, he lied last night. i mean, it was a total lie, and everybody said it, in fact, some of the folks on your network said wow, that was really a lie, he said i want to do go less than minimum wage is a new one. i'm the republican that said in some cases we have to go5:06 pmmore than minimum wage. >> give me a number. >> no. let me give you a concept because i think it's a good concept. you go with the states. let the states make the determination. because if you take new york, it's very expensive to live in new york. and they need more than, you know, 7, 8, $9, you go with the states. >> the states have the authority now to do that. >> they do. >> there has to be a federal minute mum wage. what would you set the federal minimum wage at? >> there doesn't have to be. i would leave it and raise it somewhat. you need to help people. i know it's not very republican to say. >> give me 10 bucks? >> i would say 10. i would say 10. but, with the understanding that somebody like me is going to bring back jobs, i don't want people to be in that $10 category for very long. but, the thing is, bill, let the states make the deal. >> they're not doing that right now because you could have a state that raises it to 15 and i would also, and this is just an aside, teenagers could make a little bit less, you know, first job if you are 17, you5:07 pmknow, to get them in the workforce. anyway, let's go on to -- >> -- let me just finish because a friend of mine is a very tremendous employer. and what he did is he said by raising it and by doing certain things it took the incentive. he pays people incentive basis if they are really good he gives them incentive. nobody has ever heard of this before and a lot of companies do it. by raising it they already get the incentive. no, i believe it should be raised but when bernie sanders said i want to go less than what the minimum wage, i mean, honestly, bill, these people are lying so much. and every fact checker said trump never said that. i never did say it. >> $10 minimum wage federally and states can do what they want. >> you have me on record saying the states are going to raise it higher than that. >> and they can if they want. climate change, they said that you called climate change a hoax. is that true? >> i want clean air and i want clean water. and if you look at what's going on in china and all of these other countries that talk with you they laugh behind our back at what5:08 pmwe're doing, we want clean air, clean water, i have gotten many environmental awards. believe me, i know what i'm talking about. but i want -- we have to have crystal clearwater and crystal clean air. >> did you ever call climate change a hoax? >> i might have because when i look at. so things going on and when you look at europe they had their pig summit people were sending out emails scientists practically calling it a hoax and they were laughing at it so, yeah, i probably did. i see what's going on and you see what's going on. >> fossil fuels and gases have eroded the environment so that the sun is more intense on earth? because that's the basic thing? do you believe that's happening? >> well, they are saying man made and i say it could have a minor impact but nothing, nothing to what they're talking about. and what it's doing is putting us at a tremendous disadvantage as a country. because other countries are5:09 pmnot adhearing to the rules. we are. it makes it impossible to compete. we are adhering to strict rules. you look at china and all of these other countries practically all of them they are not adhering to the rules. our jobs are being jeopardized -- not jeopardized being taken away. our companies are unable to compete. >> nato, you made some controversial comments. i want you to clarify them because i hate taking it from the press, because i agree with you that you are not going to get a fair shot in the press ever. you got small countries in eastern europe that putin might mess around with. that would trigger a response from the united states. and you kind of seem to indicate that maybe you wouldn't respond. >> well, i think i have been treated fairly, you know, reasonably on that. and the ""new york times"" covered it fairly accurately, which is unusual for them because usually they don't. the fact is we are protecting so many countries that are not paying for the protection. they are not living up to the bargain. they are not living up to their agreement. we have an agreement.5:10 pmwe're going to protect countries. and i like nato. i like the concept of nato. it's obsolete because we don't cover terrorism. i have been saying that for a while and now all of a sudden because i have been saying it, they have a division where they start really covering terrorism. >> i think that was because of me not you. >> wait a minute, bill. >> it was because of me. it wasn't because of you in this case and you know that. [ laughter ] >> the other thing because it was obsolete. and now all of a sudden they have a division now, wait a minute. when a country isn't paying us and these are countries in some cases in most cases that have the ability to pay, and they are not paying because nobody is asking. >> got to kick them out. >> we are funding 73% of the cost of nato. so we're protecting all of these countries. they have an agreement to reimburse us and pay us and they are not doing it and if they are not going to do that. we have to seriously rethink at least those countries. it's very unfair. right now, you have five countries that are paying their share. five. >> okay. i agree if they're not paying their share then they5:11 pmget booted out of the alliance. >> you know, bill, what's been hang, people are saying well, we have a treaty. we do have a treaty. we have a treaty both ways. they are supposed to be paying. they are not paying. the reason they are not paying is because we are not asking for the money. this isn't 40 or 50 years ago where we can do whatever we want to do. we owe $19 trillion. going to be 21 trillion very soon because of the horrible budget that was just made. we owe owe $19 trillion. we are paying for all of these countries. they are not living up to their obligation. we are supposed to get into world war 3. let me just tell you, a lot of people first they really didn't like what i was saying. now so many people are starting to agree with me, they are saying you know what? trump was right. >> now they have to pay. >> you watch. hillary clinton will now come out and say countries have to pay and people are going to forget it just like she did today. just like today, she came out today with nativity i have been say would he go have to renegotiate with nafta and get out because they are taking our jobs.5:12 pmtoday for the first time out of all these years that she worked on this and her husband signed it one of the worst things ever signed from an economic development standpoint came out today and said well we are going to have to start renegotiating our deals. i have been saying this for a long time. she just came out. because you know why? what i have been saying makes sense to a lot of people. >> there is another reason it's a sop to bernie sanders, that brings me my last question. have you ever spoken to bernie sanders? have you ever talked to him? >> no, i haven't. >> ever in your life talked to him? >> is he a tired man. he is exhausted. i think, frankly, in terms of his legacy. he wants to go home. >> there is only maybe two or three -- >> -- he is quite a bit older. he wants to go home and wants to go to bed. >> how do you know if you have never spoken to him. >> how do you know if you have never spoken to im. >> is he exhausted. for his legacy, he would have been better off playing it out. is he exhausted. he wants to go home and go to bed. bernie sanders people are5:13 pmgoing to come to me, because you know why? i'm the best there is on trade. i'm going to make new trade deals and bring our jobs back to our country. >> all right. well, we always appreciate you making time for us. we know how busy you are. we have your running mate mike pence on tomorrow. that should be interesting. we will get him to define his view of the world. mr. trump, as always, thank you very much. >> thank you very much. thank you. >> never boring. and, again, mike pence will be with us on the factor tomorrow evening, next on the rundown tonight, why are the democrats avoiding mentioning the isis terror group? and, later, watters asking democrats about illegal immigration up ahead.5:14 pm5:16 pm5:17 pmcontinuing now with our coverage of the democratic convention in philadelphia. joining us from that city kirsten powers. it's a little slow there right now. nothing much going on. everybody waiting for bill clinton talking the 10:00 hour. anything about donald trump's q and a that caught your attention? >> well, i have to say i'm getting a little tired of this thing that he is doing calling everybody tired and so now he is saying bernie sanders is exhausted and is he tired nothing to suggest this is true and hillary clinton needs a nap. by all accounts they have more energy than probably anybody that we know. so, you know, this kind of weird childish disses, you know, i just think are getting a little old. >> a little humorous that bernie is a little tired and needs a happen? don't you think it's a little humorous? >> i don't think it's humorous. this is like the low energy jeb thing. i don't think he is doing it to be humorous. i think is he trying to cast them as being old and tired. >> how old is bernie? do you know?5:18 pm74? 7 a? >> i think he is about 74. and like i said, he has as much energy as anybody i can think of. >> bernie has a lot of energy, that's for sure. >> yeah. >> what was interesting to me teddy and today as well though we haven't tallied it all up. no mention of isis terrorism, even though there is a mention of terrorism in the news today. none. platform doesn't deal with it nothing. like it doesn't exist worldwide terrorism. what's that all about? >> so i talked to the clinton campaign and what they said was last night wasn't about foreign policy. it was really focused much more on economic issues. but that coming up in other nights, probably tomorrow night that there will -- they will talk about national security. i did ask, are you going to talk specifically about isis? and they said they couldn't say for sure whether isis would be specifically named but definitely national security would be talked about because hillary clinton is going to be talking about how she is running on day one and how dangerous donald trump is. >> it's a pretty big issue. wouldn't you like to hear what nina dunham thinks5:19 pmabout isis into sn she could have thrown out a few% what she would have- ---few materials on what she would have few pearls on terrorism. >> do you know what it is defeating worldwide terrorism? >> hillary clinton gave a speech yesterday. about her plans for combating isis. essentially, what she has said is not that different than one of the things donald trump has said which is she is going to focus on intelligence-gathering and trying to expand intelligence gathering. unlike trump she would not say she is going to bomb the hell out of people so she is not talking about any kind of military intervention but that seems to be like the primary thing that she is focused on. >> intelligence gathering. what do you do with the intelligence if you don't have the will to use ground troops? what good does it do? >> i'm not convinced that hillary clinton doesn't have the will to use ground troops. >> you can point to anything that's indicated she might? >> just having followed her5:20 pmfor the last 20 years i have a pretty good sense she likes military interventions like the iraq war and libyan intervention. she isn't somebody who is really hesitant in my experience, unfortunately, i'm sorry? >> you think she is going to be tougher than president obama on that. >> tougher is a values judgment and suggest it would somehow be better. >> more aggressive. >> more likely to use the military i think he has actually been pretty aggressive. i think we disagree with this a lot in terms of using the drone warfare and expanding that war. but, yes. my sense is that she thought there was public support. i think she is a pretty hawkish person. and i think one of my concerns about her frankly. >> in her speech if thee she gets specific but i doubt she will. democrats don't have the heart for the fight at this point. that might change but right now they don't have the heart for it in my opinion. >> most americans don't want to use ground troops. >> i have got to go because i have to take a nap. and now -- >> -- i say that about you all the time. you are very tired, bill.5:21 pm>> and i'm old and i need a nap desperately. but i can't take a nap before i talk to karl rove another old guy also in the city of brotherly love. you got your little board there, don't you? just show us i know you have your little board. >> there i do. you want to see that board you need that board. >> there it is. the board is basically and don't bore us with the board, that's a little pun spelled differently. the board basically says that trump did get a bounce from theonvention last week, right? >> yeah. >> he did get a bounce. >> yeah. >> it's all over the place? >> let's be careful we jumped on the cnn number which shows him rising six and hillary dropping four for a shift of 10 points but at the same time we had a cbs poll that shows him up four, her up three for a shift of 1 point. i think the best way to look at it real clear politics average which shons he has grown 5 points since the beginning of the republican convention. she has grown 1.1.5:22 pmthat give him about 4% bounce. that's slightly below what the average republican has received since 1964. but, above the bounce that mitt romney got four years ago. in fact, he got no bounce coming out of the convention. >> okay. now, historically, do the democrats do well coming out of their convention? yeah, look, since 1964 the democrats have had an offering bounce of about 5.9%, call it 6% and the republicans have had a bounce of about 4.9 or 5 points. they have historically had a bigger bounce coming out of their convention. look, it's all over the board. in 2000, al gore had an 8 point bounce and so did george w. bush. but they quickly melted away. that's the thing about these bounces we have got to be careful about. they are transitory. it is a result of people tuning in, primarily independents, tuning in and watching the convention, tuning in to politics briefly and then tuning out. and it's also about the consolidation of whatever5:23 pmelements of the party that haven't sort of accustomed themselves or acclimated themselves to the nominee himself or herself. >> okay. >> they are transitory. >> i haven't given much coverage to the bernie sanders protests and they are out there again today yelling. i don't know what they're really yelling about. it's all over. yes, it was rigged. it was and all that but, bernie sanders -- i can't imagine bernie sanders supporters trump says he thinks he is going to get some of those people. i can't imagine that. can you? >> well, i think i can differentiate between the people who are in this audience and the people who voted for him. you have got a lot of independents, particularly in states with open primaries who are not that glued in to politics, are drawn by personalities, and might have been excited by bernie and not really hopped up on hillary clinton. here is the deal, bill, we won't know what that group looks like until we start to get more stability in the pulling. that is not happening now in july. that's going to happen in5:24 pmfive weeks when we get close to alicia day. close to labor day polling begins to reflect the dime knack nics of the fall campaign. suspicion is we'll likely see some defections from the democrats. but historically the democrats have had more defections than the republicans. republicans win when they get 91, 92% of the republicans. and the democrat gets 88%, 87%. that is to say they have half as many more people defecting from them as they are defecting from the republicans. we won't know until labor day whether that's the dynamic that might be in play in fall. >> after the first debate then the polls really kick in strong. >> absolutely. particularly since bill, we have this year the highest number of undecides that we have had since 1992. those debates are going to be high profile and high impact. >> that will be fun. directly ahead the democrats and illegal immigration. very touchy subject for the party. we have waters, juan williams, lisa booth on the case and donald trump and lawsuits. is it legal has been5:25 pmanalyzing that situation. the factor is coming right back. ♪ ♪ hey! i've made plans for later in case this date doesn't go well. likewise! but, funny story. on top of that? my mom is my best friend. uh oh. yeah. oop! there's the rescue text from my roommate saying she needs me. wouldn't it be great if everyone said what they meant? the citi double cash card does. it lets you earn double cash back: the citi double cash card. spending the day with my niece. that make me smile. i don't use super poligrip for hold, because my dentures fit well. before those little pieces would get in between my dentures5:26 pmand my gum and it was uncomfortable. even well fitting dentures let in food particles. just a few dabs of super poligrip free is clinically proven to seal out more food particles so you're more comfortable and confident while you eat. so it's not about keeping my dentures in, it's about keeping the food particles out. try super poligrip free.5:27 pm5:28 pmcampaign 2016 segment tonight, one of the big issues will be illegal immigration in the campaign. republican party and donald trump support a massive wall on the southern border as you know. deportation of aliens in this country without documentation. last night i talked with the congressman luis gutierrez about how he would secure the southern border. >> what's the democratic party's vision on securing the border? what are they going to do? here's what we do, bill. as parts of immigration reform we take part of those here in the country and give them a background check. fantasy to think we are going to deport them all. >> i'm trying the third time, congressman. how do you secure the southern border? what do you do? >> here's what you do. you make sure that in our agricultural industry and, bill, i have traveled to florida. i have traveled to georgia.5:29 pmi have traveled to california, you and i both know that there are millions of undocumented workers that work hard, sweat soil every day. to put the food on our table. >> you are not answering the question. i'm going to ask it the fourth time. >> he didn't. joining us now from philadelphia, lisa booth and juan williams. so, juan, i men, the congressman is obviously doblegging a very simple question. why do you think he did that? >> well, i think it's a symbolic issue for republicans. it's pretty clear in the polls, two thirds of americans oppose a wall. but if you want an answer and i think bill o'reilly deserves a concrete answer i would say guess what? we get more agents, we use high resolution cameras and use drones. but, bill, all of that has already been in bills you are doing the same thing gutierrez did. i'm going to speak slowly. >> you go. >> why didn't the congressman answer the5:30 pmquestion? i think he chose not to enat question in the way that you wanted. >> an it how would you secure the border and he wants to touring a gri cull turelg land. >> i saw that interview. you said a $10,000 fine would do the trick. he said he wanted pack ground checks. >> you are blathering. lisa why don't you think that congressman guterres wouldn't answer the question. >> the democratic party supports lawlessness when it comes to immigration. we have seen that with the 340 sanctuary cities across the country or the fact that the supreme court and lower courts struck down president obama's illegal executive action on immigration. even hillary clinton herself gave illegal immigrants a platform at the democratic national convention yesterday and one of those illegal immigrants facing deportation order from the federal government that she is egg for she doesn't want5:31 pmto deport them. do you believe in open borders, congressman? no. that was the only question he answered in the six minute interview. no. okay. only one he answered. all right. i said okay. you don't believe in it. how would you secure the border? and then he telling me travel to kansas, he went to alberta, canada. once he visited that hit at this, my head is exploding. >> okay, look, you wanted. >> i wanted how are we going to secure the border, juan? >> no. no but anybody can tell you how to do it. >> but he wouldn't, juan? he didn't. >> the wall 2,000 miles long and pay billions of dollars and you are not hearing this but you should hear it once is that this is not a realistic answer even more drones, all that we said about more agents, obama the doubled the budget. they think immigration is to blame for every problem.5:32 pm>> see if you agree with me, lisa. the real problem congressman guterres didn't answer the simple question of how would you secure the border is because he wants a border that's open. he wants it. >> exactly. >> they don't want any ini had bations on people coming in here. they want a europe where anybody that's what they want. go ahead, lisa, you are absolutely right. he doesn't want to secure the border. democrats don't want to secure the border. they don't have the stomach or care about the issue. that's a big problem because we should be looking at what is happening to europe. their immigration problem. and we should be taking notes. because the reality is that terrorists have been apprehended at the southern border. that is fact. you also just look -- that fact. look at the criminal justice system. one in four inmates are i will locally immigrants. this is a problem we faces a the country but the democratic party including juan himself do not care about the issue and they don't want to address the issue because they support lawlessness. >> anything in the platform, the democratic platform and i don't think hillary clinton is going to say a word about how she would5:33 pmsecure the border. it's the same thing with the isis thing. they are not going to say how they would do it. they will say we don't like isis and going to get them but not say how. >> do you say that to trump? does trump tell you how is he going to take on isis? >> is he going to take their oil and then is he going to take their socks take their socks so they can't walk in the desert it's going to be too hot on their feet. >> there we go. you and lisa bring in terrorism. you are far away from the idea that we should find a solution. >> according to federal documents apprehended at the southern border. >> you guys can continue yelling at each other but i have to go. all right. but, again, i will tell you and i don't think there is going to be any border security or any isis in the democratic platform. i hope i'm wrong. now, let's go to waters. we asked him to sample opinion from some democratic folks in philly about the illegal alien problem. >> is.5:34 pm>> i love your hat. >> thank you my hat loves. >> you the feeling is mutual. >> take it and like it. >> do you support open borders? >> i believe in a borderless planet. i also believe in a commerce free planet. it's a bunch of bs. >> hello, fellow, you nor the speaking my language. >> i believe people should come here and we should accept them with open arms. our farmers wouldn't be able to survive without them. >> are you talking about dangerous people coming through the border? that's going to happen and they are coming through anyways. more so good people are going to come through the borders. educated people. people who want a better life for themselves. my parents came here and we overstayed our visa and ronald reagan allowed us to be citizens. >> ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba. >> i just helped a couple people that just immigrated from canada. what makes them not illegal immigrants? >> what about you and canada? >> how do you have a country5:35 pmif you don't have a border? >>. in crickets chirping] >> very good i thought it over. >> do you think a wall on the southern border would work? >> no. >> why not? >> i think a wall around trump tower would work just great. >> mexico is going to pay for the wall. >> what would do you to secure the southern border? >> nothing. borders are the problem. >> >> we are a land of immigrants opening and welcoming everybody. that's how you grow and diversify the economy. >> we need to have adequate security. you would have to pass immigration reform so you don't have border security overwhelmed with chasing people 300 miles inland and breaking up families. >> you have a good day. >> we are on a schedule, thank you. >> illegal immigration is not a hot topic for me. you know, you want to ask me about bernie policies. i'm all about that. things important to republicans are not important to me. do you know who kate steinle was?

>> i -- you know -- i -- i would not mind supporting something to that effect. >> yea. >> it's time. >> many people say o'reilly is a genius on fox news.

no, and they don't want to admit it. bottom line is, bill, they want illegal immigration because hispanics generally support democrats. that's the big secret. everyone knows it. but no one wants to admit it. >> did they all tell you that off the record? because what i got was they just don't care about the issue. let everybody in. i want a borderless world. let them all in and that's it. i really believe that is a5:38 pmbig part of the democratic party. >> one gentleman told me we should give back texas to mexico because we illegally not our land. >> did she say that today?

We are better prepared to give all children access to a quality education, help our wounded warriors when they come home, and support our aging population.We got this done because the disability community knew what Hillary Clinton knows: we are stronger together. We brought together Republicans and Democrats, businesses, and advocates. We stood up to fear and irrational prejudices. We are a better nation because of the ADA. But we still have a way to go to build a truly inclusive America.When, 26 years later, 70 percent of adults with disabilities aren’t in the workforce, it’s time to take action. That’s why Hillary Clinton wants to ensure people with disabilities are judged by their potential and have the tools to secure competitive integrated employment.When, 26 years later, employers are still allowed to pay people with disabilities below minimum wage, it’s time to change the law! Hillary Clinton will fight to eliminate the subminimum wage, and ensure that a fair day’s work earns a fair day’s pay.When, 26 years later, Medicaid still keeps people with disabilities in nursing homes, it’s time to pass Sen. Chuck Schumer’s Disability Integration Act, so our fellow Americans can live where they want — a bill Hillary Clinton will sign into law as president!Only one person seeking the presidency understands the disability community’s phrase, “nothing about us without us.” As president, Hillary Clinton will bring people with disabilities to the table for a more inclusive America.I learned sign language from my brother, Frank, who was deaf. I want to teach you a beautiful sign now. Take your hands, intertwine the fingers, and move them in a circle. This is the sign for “America!”We are all connected. No one is left out in the constant circle of life in America. This is the America we all want, disabled and non-disabled, and it is the America President Hillary Clinton will fight for, where every person is respected, valued, and treated with dignity.

The first time I saw her, we were, appropriately enough, in a class on political and civil rights. She had thick blond hair, big glasses. Wore no makeup. And she exuded this strength of self-possession I found magnetic.After the class, I followed her out, intending to introduce myself. I got close enough to touch her back, but I couldn’t do it. Somehow, I knew this would not be just another tap on the shoulder, that I might be starting something I couldn’t stop. I saw her several more times the next few days but still didn’t speak to her. Then one night in the law library talking to a classmate who wanted me to join the Yale Law Journal, he said it would guarantee me a job at a big firm or a clerkship with a federal judge. I really wasn’t interested — I just wanted to go home to Arkansas.Then I saw the girl again, standing at the opposite end of that long room. Finally, she was staring back at me. So I watched her. She closed her book, put it down, and started walking toward me. She walked the whole length of the library, came up to me, and said, “Look, if you are going to keep staring at me, we at least ought to know each other’s name. I’m Hillary Rodham, who are you?” I was so impressed and surprised that, whether you believe it or not, momentarily, I was speechless.Finally, I sort of blurted out my name and we exchanged a few words, and she went away. Well, I didn’t join the Law Review, but I did leave that library with a whole new goal in mind. A couple days later, I saw her again, wearing a long, white, flowery skirt, and I went up to her and she said she was going to register for classes for the next term. I said I would go too.We stood in line and talked — you had to do that to register back then. I thought I was doing pretty well until we got to the front of the line and the registrar looked up and said, “Bill, what are you doing here? You registered this morning.”I turned red and she laughed that big laugh of hers and I thought, well, heck, since my cover has been blown, I asked her to take a walk down to the art museum. We have been walking, and talking, and laughing together ever since.And we have done it in good times, through joy and heartbreak. We cried together this morning on the news that our good friend and a lot of your good friend, Mark Weiner, passed away early this morning. We built up a lifetime of memories. After the first month and that first walk, I drove her home to Park Ridge, Illinois, to meet her family and see the town where she grew up, a perfect example of post-World War II middle-class America. Street after street of nice houses, great schools, good parks, a big public swimming pool. And almost all white.I really liked her family, her crusty, conservative father, her rambunctious brothers, all extolling the virtue of rooting for the bears and the cubs. And for the people of Illinois here, they even told me what waiting for next year meant — could be next year, guys.Now, her mother was different. She was more liberal than the boys. She had a childhood that made mine look like a piece of cake. She was easy to underestimate with her soft manner and she reminded me all over again of the truth of that old saying that you should never judge a book by its cover. Knowing her was one of the greatest gifts Hillary ever gave me.I learned that Hillary got her introduction to social justice through her Methodist youth minister, Don Jones. He took her downtown to Chicago to hear Martin Luther King Jr. speak and he remained her friend for the rest of his life. This will be the only campaign of hers he ever missed.When she got to college, her opposition to the Vietnam War compelled her to change parties and become a Democrat. And then between college and law school, on a total lark, she went alone to Alaska and spent time sliming fish.More to the point, by the time I met her she had already been involved in the law school’s legal services project and she had been influenced by Marian Wright Edelman. She took a summer internship interviewing workers in migrant camps for Sen. Walter Mondale’s subcommittee. She had also begun working in the Yale New Haven hospital to develop procedures to handle suspected child abuse cases.She got so involved in children’s issues that she actually took an extra year in law school working at the child studies center to learn what more could be done to improve the lives and futures of poor children. She was already determined to figure out how to make things better.Hillary opened my eyes to a whole new world of public service by private citizens. In the summer of 1972, she went to Dothan, Alabama, to visit one of those segregated academies that enrolled over a half a million white kids in the South. The only way the economics worked was if they claimed federal tax exemptions to which they were not legally entitled. She got sent to prove they weren’t.So she sauntered into one of these academies all by herself, pretending to be a housewife that just moved to town and needed to find a school for her son. And they exchange pleasantries and finally, she said, “Look, let’s get to the bottom line. If I enroll my son in this school, will he be in a segregated school? Yes or no?” And the guy said “Absolutely.” She had him. I’ve seen it a thousand times since.And she went back and her encounter was part of a report that gave Marian Wright Edelman the force they needed to keep working to get the Nixon administration to take those tax exemptions away and give our kids access to an equal education.Then she went down to South Texas, where she met one of the nicest fellows I ever met, the wonderful union leader Franklin Garcia, and he helped her register Mexican-American voters. I think some of them are still around to vote for her in 2016. And then, in our last year in law school, Hillary kept up this work. She went to South Carolina to see why so many young African-American boys — I mean, young teenagers — were being jailed for years with adults in men’s prisons. She filed a report on that, which led to some changes too. Always making things better.Meanwhile, let’s get back to business. I was trying to convince her to marry me. I first proposed to her on a trip to Great Britain, the first time she’d ever been overseas. We were on the shoreline of this wonderful lake, Lake Ennerdale. I asked her to marry me and she said, “I can’t do it.”So in 1974, I went home to teach in law school and Hillary moved to Massachusetts to keep working on children’s issues. This time, trying to figure out why so many kids counted in the census weren’t enrolled in school.She found one of them sitting alone on her porch in a wheelchair. Once more, she filed a report about these kids and that helped influence ultimately the Congress to adopt the proposition that children with disabilities, physical or otherwise, should have equal access to public education. You saw the result of that last night when Anastasia Somoza talked. She never made fun of people with disabilities. She tried to empower them based on their abilities.Meanwhile, I was still trying to get her to marry me. The second time I asked, I tried a different tactic. I said, “I really want you to marry me, but you shouldn’t do it.” She smiled and looked at me like what is this boy up to. She said, “That is not a very good sales pitch.” I said, “I know but it’s true.” And I meant it. It was true. I said, “I know most of the young Democrats our age who want to go into politics, they mean well and they speak well, but none of them is as good as you are at actually doing things to make positive changes in people’s lives.”So I suggested she go home to Illinois or move to New York and look for a chance to run for office. She laughed and said, “Are you out of your mind? Nobody would ever vote for me.” So I finally got her to come visit me in Arkansas. And when she did, the people at the law school were so impressed, they offered her a teaching position. And she decided to take a huge chance.She moved to a strange place, more rural and conservative than anywhere she had been. Where she knew good and well that people were wondering what in the world she was like and whether they could or should accept her. Didn’t take them long to find out what she was like.She loved her teaching. She got frustrated when one of her students said, “What do you expect, I’m just from Arkansas.” She said, “Don’t tell me that. You’re as smart as anybody. You just have to believe in yourself and work for it and set high goals.” She believed anyone could make it. She also started the first legal aid clinic in northwest Arkansas, providing legal aid services to poor people who couldn’t pay for them.One day, I was driving her to the airport to fly back to Chicago when we passed this little brick house that had a for-sale sign on it and she said, “Boy, that’s a pretty house.” It had 1,100 square feet, an attic fan and no air conditioner in hot Arkansas, and a screened-in porch. Hillary commented on what a uniquely designed and beautiful house it was.So I took a big chance. I bought the house. My mortgage was $175 a month. When she came back, I picked her up and said, “You remember that house you like?” I said, “While you were gone, I bought it, and you have to marry me now.” The third time was the charm. We were married in that little house on October 11, 1975. I married my best friend.I was still in awe after more than four years of being around her at how smart, and strong, and loving, and caring she was, and I really hoped that her choosing me and rejecting my advice to pursue her own career was a decision she would never regret. A little over a year later, we moved to Little Rock when I became attorney general and she joined the oldest law firm west of the Mississippi. She started Arkansas Advocates for Family and Children. It’s a group that is still active today.In 1979, just after I became governor, I asked Hillary to chair a local health committee to help expand health care to isolated mountain areas. They recommended to do that partly by deploying trained nurse practitioners in places with no doctors to provide primary care that they were trying to provide.It was a big deal then — highly controversial and very important. And I got the feeling that what she did for the rest of her life, she was doing there. She just went out and figured out what would help people and if it was controversial, she just tried to persuade people it was the right thing to do. It wasn’t the only big thing that happened that spring, my first year as governor. We found out we were going to be parents.And time passed. On February 27, 1980, 15 minutes after I got home from the National Governors’ Conference in Washington, Hillary’s water broke, and off we went to the hospital. Chelsea was born just before midnight. And it was the greatest moment of my life. The miracle of a new beginning. The hole filled for me because my own father died before I was born and I had the absolute conviction that my daughter had the best mother in the whole world.Through nursing school, kindergarten, T-ball, soccer, volleyball, and her passion for ballet. Through sleepovers, summer camps, family vacations, and Chelsea’s own very ambitious excursions, from Halloween parties in the neighborhood to a Viennese waltz gala in the White House, Hillary first and foremost was a mother. She became, as she often said, our family’s designated worrier. Born with an extra responsibility gene.We rarely disagreed on parenting ,although she did believe that I had gone a little over the top when I took a couple days off with Chelsea to watch all six Police Academy movies back to back. When Chelsea was 9 months old, I was defeated for reelection in the Reagan landslide and I became overnight, I think, the youngest former governor in the history of the country. We only had two-year terms back then.Hillary was great. Immediately she said, “What are we gonna do? Here is what we are going to do: We’re gonna get a house, you’re gonna get a job, we’re gonna enjoy being Chelsea’s parents, and if you want to run again you have to go talk to people and figure out why you lost, tell them you got the message, and show them you still have good ideas.” I followed her advice.Within two days we had a house. I soon had a job. We had two fabulous years with Chelsea and in 1982, I became the first governor in the history of our state to become elected, defeated, and elected again. My experience is, it’s a pretty good thing to follow her advice.The rest of the decade flew by it as our lives settled into a rhythm of family and work and friends. In 1983, Hillary chaired a committee to recommend new education standards for us in response to a court order to equalize school funding.And a report by national experts said our woefully underfunded schools were the worst in America. Typical Hillary, she held listening tours in all 75 counties with our committee. She came up with really ambitious recommendations. For example, that we be the first state in America to require elementary counselors in every school because so many kids were having trouble at home and they needed it.So I called the legislature into session, hoping to pass the standards, pass the pay rate for teachers, and raise the sales tax to pay for it all. I knew it would be hard to pass, but it got easier after Hillary headed the education committee and the chairman, a plainspoken farmer, said, “It looks to me like we elected the wrong Clinton.”Well, by the time I ran for president nine years later, the same expert who said we had the worst schools in America said that our state was one of the two most improved states in America — and that is because of those standards that Hillary recommended.Now, two years later, Hillary told me about a preschool program developed in Israel, called HIPPY: Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youngsters. The idea was to teach low-income parents, even those who couldn’t read, to be their children’s first teachers. She said she thought it would work in Arkansas. I said, “That’s great, what are we going to do about it?” She said, “I already did it. I called the woman in Israel and she’ll be here in about 10 days to help us get started.”Next thing you know, I’m being dragged around to all these little preschool graduations. Keep in mind this is before many states even had universal kindergarten, and I’m being dragged to preschool graduations, watching these poor parents with tears in their eyes because they never thought they would be able to help their kids learn.Twenty years of research has shown how well this program works to improve readiness for schools and academic achievement. There are a lot of young adults in America who have no idea Hillary had anything to do with it, but are enjoying better lives because they were in that program.She did all of this while being a full-time worker, a mother, and enjoying our life. Why? Well, she is insatiably curious, she’s a natural leader, she’s a good organizer, and she’s the best darn change-maker I have ever met in my entire life.So, look, this is a really important point for you to take out of this convention. If you believe in making change from the bottom up, if you believe the measure of change is how many lives are bettered, you know it is hard and some people think it is boring. Speeches like this are fun. Actually doing the work is hard. So people say, well, we need to change.She has been around a long time. She sure has. And she has sure been worth every single year she has put into making people’s lives better. I can tell you this — if you were sitting where I am sitting and you heard what I have heard and at every dinner conversation, every lunch conversation, on every long walk, you would say, “This woman has never been satisfied with the status quo in anything.” She always wants to move the ball forward. That is just who she is.When I became president with a commitment to reform health care, Hillary was a natural head to the health care task force. You all know we failed because we couldn’t break a Senate filibuster. Hillary immediately went to work on solving the problems the bill sought to address one by one.The most important goal was to get more children with health insurance. In 1997, Congress passed the Children’s Health Insurance Program, still an important part of President Obama’s Affordable Care Act. It insures more than 8 million kids. There are a lot of other things in that bill she got done piece by piece, pushing the rock up the hill.In 1997, she also teamed with the House minority leader, Tom DeLay, who maybe disliked me more than any of Newt Gingrich’s crowd. They worked on a build together to increase adoptions of children out of foster care. She wanted to do it because she knew that Tom, for all of our differences, was an adopted parent and she honored him for doing that. The bill that they worked on was passed with an overwhelming bipartisan majority and led to a big increase of children out of foster care, including not infant kids and special needs kids. It made life better, because she is a change-maker. That is what she does.Now, when you are doing all of this, real life does not stop. 1997 was the year Chelsea finished high school and went to college. We were happy for her but sad for us to see her go. I will never forget moving her into her dorm room at Stanford. It would have been a great little reality flick. There I was, in a trance, just staring out the window trying not to cry, and there was Hillary on her hands and knees, desperately looking for one more drawer to put that liner paper in. Finally, Chelsea took charge and told us ever so gently that it was time for us to go. So, we closed a big chapter in the most important work of our lives. As you will see Thursday night, when Chelsea speaks, Hillary has done a pretty fine job of being a mother. And as you saw last night beyond a shadow of a doubt, so has Michelle Obama.Now fast-forward, in 1999, congressman Charlie Rangel and other Democrats urged Hillary to run for the seat of retiring senator Pat Moynihan. We had always intended to go to New York after I left office and commute to Arkansas, but this had never occurred to either one of us. Hillary had never run for office before but she decided to give it a try. She began her campaign the way she always does things, by listening and learning. And after a tough battle, New York elected her to the seat once held by another outsider, Robert Kennedy.And she did not let him down. Her early years were dominated by 9/11. By working to find the recovery. Then monitoring the health of and providing compensation to victims and first- and second-responders. She and Sen. Shuman were tireless and so were the house members.In 2003, partly spurred on by what they were going through, she became the first senator in the history of New York ever to serve on the Armed Services Committee. So she tried to make sure people on the battlefield had proper equipment. She tried to expand, and did expand, health care coverage to members of the National Guard. She got longer family leave working with Senator Dodd for people caring for wounded servicemembers and she worked for more extensive care for people with traumatic brain injury.She also served on a special Pentagon commission to propose changes necessary to meet our new security challenges. Newt Gingrich was on that commission. He told me what a good job she had done. I say that because nobody who has seriously dealt with the men and women in today’s military believes they are a “disaster.” They are a national treasure of all races, all religions, all walks of life.Now, meanwhile, she compiled a really solid record, totally progressive, on economic and social issues. She voted for him against a proposed trade deal. She became the de facto economic development officer for the area outside of New York City. She worked for farmers, for winemakers, for small businesses and manufacturers. For upstate cities and rural areas that needed more ideas and more new investment to create new jobs. Something we have to do again in small town and rural America, in neighborhoods that of been left behind to our cities, in Indian country, and, yes, in coal country.When she lost the hard-fought contest to President Obama in 2008, she worked for his election hard. But she hesitated to say yes when he asked her to join his Cabinet, because she so loved being a senator from New York. So like me, in a different context, he had to keep asking. But as we all saw and heard from Madeleine Albright, it was worth the effort and worth the wait.As secretary of state, she worked hard to get strong sanctions against Iran’s nuclear program. And in what the Wall Street Journal called a “half-court shot at the buzzer,” she got Russia and China to support them. Her team negotiated the new START treaty with Russia to reduce nuclear weapons and establish inspections. And she got enough Republican support to get two thirds of the senate, the vote necessary to ratify the treaty.She flew all night long from Cambodia to the Middle East to get a ceasefire that would avoid a full-out shooting war between Hamas and Gaza, to protect the peace of the region. She backed President Obama’s decision to go after Osama bin Laden. She launched a team — and this is really important today — she launched a team to fight back against terrorists online and built a new global counterterrorism effort. We have got to win this battle. In the mine field.She put climate change at the center of our foreign policy. She negotiated the first agreement ever with China and India, officially committed to reduce their emissions.And as she had been doing since she went to Beijing in 1995 and said, “Women’s rights are human rights and human rights are women’s rights,” she worked to empower women and girls around the world and to make the same exact declaration on behalf of the LGBT community in America and around the world.And, nobody ever talks about this much — nobody ever talks about this much, but it is important to me. She tripled the number of people with AIDS in four countries whose lives are being saved with your tax dollars. Most of them in Africa, going from 1.7 million lives to 5.1 million lives and it did not cost you any more money. She just bought available FDA-approved generic drugs, something we need to do for the American people more.Now, you do not know any of these people. You don’t know any of these 3.4 million people, but I guarantee, they know you. They know you because they see you as thinking their lives matter. They know you, and that’s one reason the approval of the United States was 20 points higher when she left the Secretary of State’s office than when she took it.Now, how does this square? How does this square with the things that you heard at the Republican convention? What is the difference in what I told you and what they said? How do you square it? You can’t. One is real, the other is made up.And you just have to decide which is which, my fellow Americans. The real one had done more positive change-making before she was 30-years-old than most politicians do with a lifetime in office. The real one, if you saw her friend Betsy Ebeling from Illinois today, has friends from childhood through Arkansas, where she has not lived for more than 20 years, who have gone all across America at their own expense to fight for the person they know.The real one has earned the loyalty and respect and the fervent support of people who have worked with her in every stage of her life, including leaders around the world who know her to be able, straightforward, and completely trustworthy. The real one calls you when you’re sick, when your kid’s in trouble, or when there is a death in the family. The real one repeatedly drew praise from prominent Republicans when she was a senator and secretary of state.So what is up with this? Well, if you win elections, on the theory the government is always bad and will mess up a two-car parade — a real change-maker represents a real threat. So your only option is to create a cartoon. A cartoon alternative. Then run against the cartoon. Cartoons are two-dimensional. They’re easy to absorb. Life in the world is complicated and real change is hard. And a lot of people even think it is boring. Good for you, because earlier today you nominated the real one.We have to get back on schedule — look, I have lived a long, full, blessed life. It really took off when I met and fell in love with that girl in the spring of 1971. When I was president I worked hard to give you peace and shared prosperity, to give you an America where nobody is invisible or counted out. But, for this time, Hillary is uniquely qualified to seize the opportunities and reduce the risks we face and she is still the best darn change-maker I have ever known.You could drop her in any trouble spot. Pick one. Come back in a month and somehow, some way, she will have made it better. That is just who she is. There are clear, achievable, affordable responses to our challenges. But we will not get to them if America makes the wrong choice in this election. That is why you should elect her.And you should elect her because she will never quit when the going gets tough. She will never quit on you. She sent me in this primary to West Virginia, where she knew we were going to lose, to look those coal miners in the eye and say, “I am down here because Hillary sent me to tell you that if you really think you can get the economy back that you had 50 years ago, have at it, vote for whoever you want to. But if she wins, she is coming back for you to take you along on the ride to America’s future.”And so I say to you, if you love this country and are working hard, are paying taxes, and obeying the law, and you’d like to become a citizen, you should choose immigration reform over somebody who wants to send you back. If you are a Muslim and you love America and freedom and you hate terror, stay here and help us win and make the future together.We want you. If you are a young African American disillusioned and afraid, we saw in Dallas how great our police officers can be. Help us build a future where nobody is afraid to walk outside, including the people who wear blue to protect our future.Hillary will make us stronger together. You know it because she spent a lifetime doing it. I hope you will do it. I hope you will elect her. Those of us who have more yesterdays than tomorrows tend to care more about our children and grandchildren. The reason you should elect her is that in the greatest country on Earth, we have always been about tomorrow. Your children and grandchildren will bless you forever if you do. God bless you.Thank you.

Trump said he hopes Russia does have her emails. Clinton’s lawyers had turned over work-related emails, but deleted thousands which she said were about personal matters. “They probably have her 33,000 e-mails that she lost and deleted because you'd see some beauties there,” he said.

A forceful and at times flippant Trump engaged with reporters for about an hour as he bashed Clinton over her emails stored on private servers in her New York home. FBI Director James Comey said earlier this month that Clinton should have known that some of the emails were classified, but concluded there wasn’t enough evidence that she intentionally mishandled classified information. Although the Justice Department declined to prosecute, Trump has used the investigation to attack Clinton on the campaign trail and ramped that up Wednesday. Trump said it gave him pause that “crooked Hillary Clinton” deleted 33,000 emails. If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton's 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI!— Donald J. If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton's 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI! “That gives me a big problem,” Trump said. “After she gets a subpoena! She gets subpoenaed, and she gets rid of 33,000 e-mails? That gives me a problem. When Katy Tur, an NBC reporter, asked Trump whether he was encouraging a foreign country to hack into emails, Trump snapped back: “Be quiet. I know you want to save her,” a reference to Clinton. The Clinton campaign was quick to respond Wednesday. Said advisor Jake Sullivan: “This has to be the first time that a major presidential candidate has actively encouraged a foreign power to conduct espionage against his political opponent. That's not hyperbole, those are just the facts. Trump questioned how Clinton could get security briefings when one of her longtime aides is Huma Abedin, wife of Anthony Weiner, a New York congressman who was caught in a sexting scandal. “I don't like Huma going home at night and telling Anthony Weiner all of these secrets, OK?” Trump said. Trump faced several questions about whether he has ties to Russia — which he denied — and his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. “I never met Putin,” he said. “I don’t know who Putin is. He said one nice thing to me. Donald Trump called on Russia to find Hillary Clinton’s missing emails at Trump National Doral in South Florida. “Russia, if you are listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” Trump said. In a separate email controversy, Trump attacked the Democratic National Committee over thousands of leaked emails published by WikiLeaks Friday. Those emails showed its leaders — including party chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Weston — were working to favor Clinton over rival Bernie Sanders. Two days later Wasserman Schultz, who represents a South Florida district in Congress, announced she would step down from her party post. Trump said that Wasserman Schultz “rigged” the race for Clinton. “It was Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and believe me, as sure as you're sitting there, Hillary Clinton knew about it,” Trump said. “She knew everything. Vice presidential candidate Mike Pence issued a statement Wednesday morning saying that the FBI will get to the bottom of who is behind the hacking. “If it is Russia and they are interfering in our elections, I can assure you both parties and the United States government will ensure there are serious consequences,” he said. “That said, the Democrats singularly focusing on who might be behind it and not addressing the basic fact that they've been exposed as a party who not only rigs the government, but rigs elections while literally accepting cash for federal appointments is outrageous. The American people now have absolute and further proof of the corruption that exists around Hillary Clinton. 3/7 To be clear, Mr. Trump did not call on, or invite, Russia or anyone else to hack Hillary Clinton’s e-mails today. The Trump briefing was open to the media but not the public, and was one of a few events Trump held in South Florida the past 24 hours, including a fundraising dinner where he served, of course, Trump Steaks. He also held a small group meeting with a few Hispanic leaders where they talked about Cuba, Latin America and how to attract more Hispanics to vote for Trump. ▪ He said Clinton’s running mate U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine “did a terrible job in New Jersey. First act he did in New Jersey was ask for a $4 billion tax increase and he's not very popular in New Jersey. And he still isn't. ▪ He faced a few questions related to the deaths of black men at the hands of police including in Louisiana and Minnesota. Trump defended law enforcement. “If the police do 100,000 great jobs and they have one, either rogue policeman or a cop who was poorly trained or did a bad job, you see that incident on television for weeks,” Trump said. “You don't see the good work that they do but if they make one mistake out of 100,000, out of more than that, it’s on television night after night after night.

And now, we need to elect the person who will finish the job.Howard Dean’s remarks at the 2016 Democratic National ConventionRemarks as prepared for deliveryDemocrats, Independents, and to the millions of Republicans who don’t recognize the party they saw and heard in Cleveland, and can’t support their party’s nominees for President and Vice President: 25 years ago, I got to know Hillary Clinton when she worked to achieve a goal a century in the making, universal health care. Between the aspiration ofHarry Truman and the accomplishment of Barack Obama, there was Hillary, poised and persistent.When her first attempt at health reform didn’t work out, Hillary could have given up. Instead, she fought the way she always does. She did her homework, persevered, never forgot who she was fighting for. Thanks to her effort, the State Children’s Health Insurance Program was born. And she worked just as hard to ensure that states actually signed up, joining with Republican governors to get it done.Today, 8 million more children have health insurance, as a result. That’s 8 million children whose families don’t have to choose between paying the rent and taking them to the doctor. When President Obama took office, he picked up the fight. And with the Affordable Care Act passed, we expanded insurance to 20 million more people. Today, 90 percent of Americans are covered.We’ve made so much progress. And now, we need to elect the person who will finish the job. Hillary has a plan to drive down health care costs. Hillary has a plan to stand up to the drug companies and lower prescription drug prices. And Hillary has a plan to take us that last mile and finally achieve health care for all. That’s what Hillary will do.Now, Donald Trump has a plan, too. He would rip up Obamacare; throw 20 million people off their health insurance; take us back to a time when insurance companies could deny you coverage if you have a preexisting condition, or charge you more for being a woman. And what’s he going to replace it with? “Something so much better.” “Yuge,” no doubt. That’s it. That’s the plan.His Vice Presidential pick is no better. Mike Pence voted against expanding the Children’s Health Insurance program Hillary helped start. He voted against requiring insurance plans to cover mental health and addiction treatment. He voted to end Medicare as we know it.By the way, Mike Pence once said that when both parents work, children end up facing “stunted emotional growth.” I’m a doctor. Let me tell you what actually stunts children’s growth. Not having access to health care. Inadequate funding for school nutrition programs. Guns — the ultimate public-health crisis.Also cigarettes. I hear Governor Pence missed the memo, but they do in fact cause cancer and no amount of tobacco company contributions can change that, Governor. The choice in this election is clear.We need a president whose decisions are rooted in facts. We need a president who will defend our interests around the world — not with ignorant bluster and bombast, but with toughness and resolve. We need a president who will ensure that the wealthiest among us play by the same rules as hardworking, middle-class Americans. And yes, we need a president who will never stop fighting to ensure that universal health care is a basic human right.If that’s the president we want, if that’s the America we believe in, then don’t wait until November to make your voice heard. Go to HillaryClinton.com to donate right now and help make history. And volunteer, because this race is going to be won on the ground.In Colorado, and Iowa, and North Carolina, and Michigan, and Florida, and Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and then we’re going all the way to Washington, D.C.

""We have thousands of people next door. We have a fire marshal who said, 'Oh, we can't allow more people.' And it really is so unfair to the people. I'm so sorry. I have to apologize, but it's not my fault.""Officials from the university and Fire Marshal Brett Lacey both fired back.""We weren't the ones that picked the venue. I would say it was just poor planning,"" Lacey said. ""All the facilities in town, when they're designed and built, they have an occupant load limit.""UCCS Chancellor Pam Shockley-Zalabak said the 1,500-person capacity of Gallogly Events Center was included in the contract signed by Trump's campaign. An overflow room was set up in nearby Berger Hall for 1,000 people to watch the speech on television.""The campaign handled all the ticketing and more tickets were issued than the space available,"" Shockley-Zalabak said.A source familiar with the campaign's plans said 10,000 tickets were issued online for the event.Trump went to the overflow room and addressed the crowd. ""If you get the worst report that you have diarrhea, if you have one week to live, I don't care. Get out and vote,"" he said, after his speech. ""If everyone gets out and votes, we can't lose.""Trump accused Lacey of supporting Hillary Clinton.Lacey took it in stride.""I did get a phone call requesting an increase in the load, so we allowed a 10 percent increase,"" he said. ""That's not a huge amount, but it allowed 150 more in the one building and 100 more in the other.""Brian Pharies, 54, raved about the presidential hopeful's decision to address people in the overflow room. ""That was absolutely brilliant,"" Pharies said. ""He's a very people person.""Others who waited in vain for hours to see Trump weren't as supportive of the campaign.With both the main event hall and the overflow room at capacity, Victor Dirello, 21, stood next to Trump supporters as they argued with and yelled at protesters opposed to Trump's visit. He got tickets Wednesday to ensure he had a spot.""I really wanted to see my man,"" said Dirello, of Colorado Springs. ""I figured they would have done it in a better spot.""Asked if he still supported Trump despite being left out of the event, Dirello wasted no time.""Oh yeah."""

But no matter whom Trump picks, he already has an ideological soul mate on the Republican ticket with him in Nevada, Congressman Heck. Yesterday, the Cortez Masto campaign released a report highlighting how on issue after issue, Donald Trump and Congressman Heck share the same reckless agenda that is good for the special interests funding their campaigns but devastating for Nevada families.It’s no wonder Congressman Heck says he has “high hopes” for Donald Trump – they share the same policy agenda. Just on the issue of immigration alone, it is next to impossible to find a policy difference between Trump and Congressman Heck.Both Donald Trump and Congressman Heck:· Opposed the 2013 Senate comprehensive immigration reform bill.· Would stop DACA & DAPA, risking deportation for millions of immigrants.· Would end birthright citizenship and repeal the 14th Amendment.· Opposes the DREAM Act and providing immigrants access to education.· Praised Arizona’s immigration law that would promote racial profiling.· Campaigned with Joe Arpaio, who is best known for inhumane treatment of immigrants.“Donald Trump and Congressman Heck’s anti-immigrant agenda would tear families apart and keep millions of undocumented immigrants in the shadows,” said Zach Hudson, spokesperson for Catherine Cortez Masto for Senate. “As Nevada’s next Senator, Catherine Cortez Masto will work with Republicans and Democrats to solve problems like keeping families together and finally passing comprehensive immigration reform. In contrast, Congressman Heck shares Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant policies that would be devastating for Nevada families.”###

The decision to place the capital on land ceded by two pro-slavery states-Virginia and Maryland-ultimately influenced the acquisition of laborers to construct its public buildings. The D.C. commissioners, charged by Congress with building the new city under the direction of the president, initially planned to import workers from Europe to meet their labor needs. However, response to recruitment was dismal and soon they turned to African Americans—both enslaved and free—to provide the bulk of labor that built the White House, the United States Capitol, and other early government buildings.A slave coffle passing the Capitol grounds, 1815, published in A Popular History of the United States, 1876.Library of CongressShow Me MoreStonemason Collen Williamson trained enslaved people on the spot at the government's quarry at Aquia, Virginia.

Let's take back our country and restore democracy.Jul 9, 2016Debbie Wasserman Schultz Has a Sweet Tooth and It’s No Laughing MatterTim Canova, candidate for the Democratic primary in Florida’s 23rd Congressional District, and Professor of Law and Public Finance at Nova Southeastern University, Shepard Broad College of Law, in Davie/Fort Lauderdale.My opponent, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, doesn’t want you to know that she is part of the problem. She says that any criticism of her environmental record is “laughable.” She wants you to believe that only Republicans like Florida Gov. Rick Scott are really to blame for the toxic algae bloom which has left a swath of bacteria, disease, and death in its path from Lake Okeechobee all the way to the Florida coastlines. I visited the Saint Lucie River and Estuary last weekend and I was sickened by what I saw. Manatees and fish stranded in the filth, gasping for air and dying. It’s no laughing matter at all and neither is Wasserman Schultz’s record.Unfortunately, Wasserman Schultz’s response to the crisis is to divert attention and blame to others. She doesn’t want voters to see that she’s been taking lots of campaign contributions from the Big Sugar companies and other agribusinesses that have created this environmental crisis by polluting Lake Okeechobee with chemical fertilizers, particularly phosphorous and nitrates, and pesticides . Nor does she want us to know that she has voted for huge subsidies for the sugar industry and other agribusinesses, as well as for delays in cleanups, while failing to deliver federal funds for any real solution.Big Money from Big Sugar and AgribusinessesLet’s start with the campaign contributions from Big Sugar that have flowed for years to Wasserman Schultz, Rick Scott, and so many other Florida politicians, Republicans and Democrats alike. As of her most recent FEC filing, the largest corporate donor to Wasserman Schultz’s campaign was the Fanjul Corporation, a massive, multinational sugar empire that has been repeatedly linked to exploitative labor practices characterized as “modern-day slavery.”Actually, Wasserman Schultz has taken over $133,000 from Big Sugar companies in the past eight years, with those donations increasing dramatically over time, from $6000 in 2004 to $20,200 to date for the 2016 cycle . In this election cycle, she has so far taken $38,900 from the Agribusiness industry, according to the Center for Responsive Politics .And it’s not like Wasserman Schultz has even needed all this money. Prior to this year, she had never been challenged in a primary, while running in a safely Democratic district. Perhaps she has helped steer Big Sugar money to other members of Congress to help grease her rise in the party establishment. And as chair of the Democratic National Committee, she overturned President Obama’s 2008 ban on corporate lobby donations to the DNC, opening the door wider to enhancing Big Sugar’s political clout.Wasserman Schultz Dithers and Delays Needed ReformsAs a member of Congress, Wasserman Schultz has voted, on multiple occasions, for hefty federal subsidies to the sugar and agricultural industries. These subsidies — more than $100 million a year to the two largest sugar companies — are some of the worst forms of corporate handouts in America today, with taxpayers propping up industries that now threaten to drown much of South Florida in endless pollution .Wasserman Schultz blames Gov. Scott, who she says has “dithered, delayed and derailed responsible steps to restore our famed Everglades.” But her own record of dithering and delay goes back much further than Scott’s. As a member of the Florida Senate, Wasserman Schultz voted in 2003 for an amendment to the Everglades Forever Act that delayed Big Sugar’s deadline to clean up the Everglades for years and placed a greater burden on ordinary taxpayers for cleanup costs, rather than making polluters pay .Wasserman Schultz has lauded her vote to appropriate funds for relatively minor Everglades restoration projects, such as some bridges on the Tamiami Trail, so far south of Lake Okeechobee as to be completely insignificant to the problem now confronting us. She also lauds her vote to restore the same dikes that have diverted immense amounts of filthy water from Lake Okeechobee west through the Caloosahatchee River toward Fort Myers and Sanibel Island, and east through the Saint Lucie River toward Stuart.According to numerous scientists and policymakers, to truly address this crisis will require allowing the waters of Lake Okeechobee to flow south into the Everglades, where natural marshland and plant life, such as bulrush and hydrilla, would filtrate phosphorous and other toxins. But literally standing in the way of this solution are the large sugar farms south of the lake. In 2008, then Florida Gov. Charlie Crist announced a massive deal, under which Florida would purchase 187,000 acres of land and facilities from the sugar companies for a fair market value of $1.8 billion, and convert such land into marshland and reservoirs.When the state was not able to find the money to make this happen, Florida voters approved Amendment 1 in 2014 — with 76 percent of the vote statewide — to use hundreds of millions of dollars a year in real estate taxes for conservation and land purchases. Yet, Gov. Scott continued to protect the Big Sugar companies — eager to keep their annual federal subsidies — by diverting those Amendment 1 funds to other purposes and projects.On the campaign trail, I have heard a number of apologists for Debbie Wasserman Schultz suggest that we need to keep her in Congress because of her seniority, power and influence. Incredibly, she has not used her influence to introduce any legislation to fund these land purchases. In fact, she has failed to cosponsor the Everglades Land Acquisition Act of 2016, which was introduced by Rep. Curt Clawson, a Florida Republican, and would appropriate $500 million for the land purchases that had been contemplated by the Charlie Crist plan. Last week, U.S. Senator Bill Nelson called for a similar solution: eminent domain proceedings. Wasserman Schultz’s response was apparently to remain silent and go away on a cruise.Unfortunately, Wasserman Schultz’s delay and dithering is characteristic of her record as a legislator. Last year, she missed more votes than anyone else in Florida’s U.S. House delegation and she has one of the highest absentee rates in Congress. And her record is not any more impressive when she is in attendance. In 2015, she introduced only five bills, among the lowest number in the House; and not one of her bills ever got a committee vote or made it to the floor of the House — the lowest among the Florida delegation, among House members serving 10 years or more, among House members with safe seats — in fact, among all Representatives.Wasserman Schultz’s inaction certainly serves the interests of the Big Sugar and big agribusinesses that have lined her campaign war chests for years. Why sell your land to the state for an important public purpose when you can stay in business and receive hundreds of millions of dollars a year in guaranteed federal subsidies — supported by Wasserman Schultz and so many other incumbent members of Congress.An Even Bigger Crisis: Our Drinking WaterUnfortunately, the stakes of Wasserman Schultz’s inaction are even greater. The rising sea levels from climate change have increased the salinity of South Florida’s aquifer. Without replenishing the natural water flow from Lake Okeechobee into the Everglades — the so-called River of Grass — and Florida Bay, the very quality of our drinking water could be imperiled, and we could be facing a crisis of enormous proportions in the years to come — the kind of crisis that leads to a migration and internal refugee catastrophe.Wasserman Schultz claims to be acting for the environment while saying that I’m just all talk. She has tried to deflect attention from her own record by suggesting I’m not a real Floridian. True, I grew up in New York — on the Great South Bay on the south shore of Long Island — as did she and so many of my neighbors here in South Florida. But apparently unlike Wasserman Schultz, I have enjoyed the ocean and waterways of South Florida as a certified scuba diver and sailor for more than two decades. I love the beauty and majesty of our waterways, seashore and coral reefs, and I am alarmed by the growing threat to their existence. I know very well that so much of our economy in South Florida is based on tourism and recreation, industries that have already been greatly harmed — along with real estate — on Florida’s Treasure coast and the Sanibel Island area by this pollution. If the dark waters of the algae bloom continue to migrate south along the coastline, it may not be long before we feel the pain right here along our own beaches and waterways in my home district.These issues are of enormous proportions and they merit debate. But Wasserman Schultz has dodged debates in this campaign. In fact, she has never had to debate a primary opponent in her entire Congressional career. She is clearly afraid to debate because she cannot defend her record of bathing in corporate money and ignoring the interests of her constituents and neighbors.It’s time for Wasserman Schultz to realize that there’s more to politics than serving corporate interests and her own career advancement, that life and livelihoods are now at stake. Voters should tell her that this is not a laughing matter.

Nearly one million have been forced from their homes by violence; some 400,000 have left school because of the fighting and more than a third of all children are malnourished. These are the stories of six of South Sudan’s five year olds.© UNICEF/UNI203954/EverettGatchang Moet, 5, from Bentiu, in the Bentiu Protection of Civilians site.I want to be an airplane driver,” Gatchang answers without delay, standing in the center of the room that he shares with eight members of his family.Gatchang, his grandfather says, was born on a particularly hot day and can’t remember a time without conflict. When Gatchang was barely two years old his town was all but destroyed in the outbreak of civil war. His family fled to the safety of a UN-controlled Protection of Civilians camp and he has spent most of his life inside the heavily guarded site.© UNICEF/UNI203953/EverettMadadr Tuok, 5, from Bentiu, at the Lich Primary School, Bentiu Protection of Civilians site.“My mother helps me with my buttons every day before school,” Madadr says as he stands up to show off his small suit.The school is one of eight operated by UNICEF inside the Bentiu Protection of Civilians site. With a population of over 90,000, and, with over 60% of the residents under the age of 18, the demand for education in the camp is overwhelming.Speaking of an empty tin of cooking oil, he continues “I carry it as my stool from home each day.

You can see, he is a good boy.”© UNICEF/UNI203951/EverettAber Beatrice, 5, and her mother Ida, in the restaurant that Ida runs in Magri, South Sudan.“I want to be a doctor,” Aber offers, and then adds “to help the people here in Magri.”Aber’s father, like many South Sudanese, lived for years as a refugee in Uganda during the long civil war for independence, and it was there he met his Ugandan-born wife, Ida. The family moved back to South Sudan just before independence, where Aber was born. With the income from the small family restaurant she runs, Ida sends her daughter to school. She hopes Aber will finish high school, and perhaps go to university.© UNICEF/UNI203956/EverettSusan Andua, 5, outside her mother Florence’s house in Nimule, South Sudan.“One day she asked her teacher what makes those planes in the sky go,” Florence says with a laugh when she hears her daughter say she wants to be pilot. “Her teacher said that it was people who go to school a lot and at that point Susan decided to become a pilot.”Only about 10 percent of girls in South Sudan complete primary school, and the typical age of marriage in rural areas is rarely over 15. As a result, more teenage girls die in childbirth than finish high school.© UNICEF/UNI203958/EverettElection Lowata, 5, from Lomolo Village, at a transit centre in Adjumani, Uganda.“Never!

After two years of failed crops, and persistent cattle raiding by rival tribes, the family ran out of options. Now, in the year in which she and her country turn five, Election and her family have been forced to cross into neighboring Uganda.

The Census Bureau has changed the methodology for computing median income over time. The Census Bureau has computed medians using either Pareto interpolation or linear interpolation. Currently, we are using linear interpolation to estimate all medians. Pareto interpolation assumes a decreasing density of population within an income interval, whereas linear interpolation assumes a constant density of population within an income interval. The Census Bureau calculated estimates of median income and associated standard errors for 1979 through 1987 using Pareto interpolation if the estimate was larger than $20,000 for people or $40,000 for families and households. This is because the width of the income interval containing the estimate is greater than $2,500.We calculated estimates of median income and associated standard errors for 1976, 1977, and 1978 using Pareto interpolation if the estimate was larger than $12,000 for people or $18,000 for families and households. This is because the width of the income interval containing the estimate is greater than $1,000. All other estimates of median income and associated standard errors for 1976 through 2011 (2012 ASEC) and almost all of the estimates of median income and associated standard errors for 1975 and earlier were calculated using linear interpolation.Thus, use caution when comparing median incomes above $12,000 for people or $18,000 for families and households for different years. Median incomes below those levels are more comparable from year to year since they have always been calculated using linear interpolation. For an indication of the comparability of medians calculated using Pareto interpolation with medians calculated using linear interpolation, see Series P-60, Number 114, Money Income in 1976 of Families and Persons in the United States (www2.census.gov/prod2/popscan/p60-114.pdf).Select a date that will equal 100 for your custom index:U.S. recession:or Enter date as YYYY-MM-DDDisplay integer periods instead of dates (e.g. ...,-1,0,1,...) with the value scaled to 100 at period 0.Integer start/end"

Kashmir nevertheless remains the site of the world's largest and most militarized territorial dispute with portions under the de facto administration of China (Aksai Chin), India (Jammu and Kashmir), and Pakistan (Azad Kashmir and Northern Areas); UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan has maintained a small group of peacekeepers since 1949; India does not recognize Pakistan's ceding historic Kashmir lands to China in 1964; India and Pakistan have maintained their 2004 cease-fire in Kashmir and initiated discussions on defusing the armed standoff in the Siachen glacier region; Pakistan protests India's fencing the highly militarized Line of Control and construction of the Baglihar Dam on the Chenab River in Jammu and Kashmir, which is part of the larger dispute on water sharing of the Indus River and its tributaries; to defuse tensions and prepare for discussions on a maritime boundary, India and Pakistan seek technical resolution of the disputed boundary in Sir Creek estuary at the mouth of the Rann of Kutch in the Arabian Sea; Pakistani maps continue to show the Junagadh claim in India's Gujarat State; since 2002, with UN assistance, Pakistan has repatriated 3.8 million Afghan refugees, leaving about 2.6 million; Pakistan has sent troops across and built fences along some remote tribal areas of its treaty-defined Durand Line border with Afghanistan, which serve as bases for foreign terrorists and other illegal activities;

more than 1 million displaced in northern Waziristan in 2014; individuals also have been displaced by repeated monsoon floods) (2017)Trafficking in persons:current situation: Pakistan is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking; the largest human trafficking problem is bonded labor in agriculture, brickmaking and, to a lesser extent, fishing, mining and carpet-making; children are bought, sold, rented, and placed in forced begging rings, domestic service, small shops, brick-making factories, or prostitution; militant groups also force children to spy, fight, or die as suicide bombers, kidnapping the children or getting them from poor parents through sale or coercion; women and girls are forced into prostitution or marriages; Pakistani adults migrate to the Gulf States and African and European states for low-skilled jobs and sometimes become victims of forced labor, debt bondage, or prostitution; foreign adults and children, particularly from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, may be subject to forced labor, and foreign women may be sex trafficked in Pakistan, with refugees and ethnic minorities being most vulnerabletier rating: Tier 2 Watch List – Pakistan does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so; the government lacks political will and capacity to fully address human trafficking, as evidenced by ineffective law enforcement efforts, official complicity, penalization of victims, and the continued conflation of migrant smuggling and human trafficking by many officials; not all forms of trafficking are prohibited; an anti-trafficking bill drafted in 2013 to address gaps in existing legislation remains pending, and a national action plan drafted in 2014 is not finalized; feudal landlords and brick kiln owners use their political influence to protect their involvement in bonded labor, while some police personnel have taken bribes to ignore prostitution that may have included sex trafficking; authorities began to use standard procedures for the identification and referral of trafficking victims, but it is not clear how widely these methods were practiced; in other instances, police were reluctant to assist NGOs with rescues and even punished victims for crimes committed as a direct result of being trafficked (2015)Illicit drugs:significant transit area for Afghan drugs, including heroin, opium, morphine, and hashish, bound for Iran, Western markets, the Gulf States, Africa, and Asia;

Nationally, crime has dropped 23 percent since 2006, according to a Brennan Center analysis released last month.A separate Center study saw crime drop in two-thirds of cities analyzed last year. However, it also noted the murder rate is up in some major cities, driven largely by problems in Baltimore, Chicago, and Washington, D.C.“Overall, crime rates remain at historic lows. Fear-inducing soundbites are counterproductive, and distract from nuanced, data-driven, and solution-oriented conversations on how to build a smarter criminal justice system in America,” said Ames Grawert, a counsel in the Brennan Center’s Justice Program. “It’s true that some cities saw an increase in murder rates last year, but it’s too early to say if that’s part of a national trend.”Likely to touch on crime from the podium tonight are former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke, Jr., Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Sen.

(Official White House photo by Lawrence Jackson)Hello, San Diego! God, I love this city. When I die, I want to be reborn here.I was telling my granddaughters, who are on this trip with me, that you used to be able to say — I think I’m wrong by one city — but more days of sun here than any other major city in the United States. I keep saying that. I think there’s one other. But at any rate. But what a great, great city. And what an incredible port.The fact is that you’ve been tired of hearing me over the last eight years and even before that talk about infrastructure, and talk about the need for us to modernize our ports throughout the United States of America. My wife, representing the Administration, led a delegation down to the opening of the new locks in the Panama Canal. I had taken a number of my Republican and Democratic friends, governors and senators, down to see the locks. It’s like the Eighth Wonder of the World, if you’ve been down — if you haven’t seen it. Because when these post-Panamax ships, if you go on the East Coast from actually the Gulf of Mexico all the way to Maine, there’s only two ports that can berth them. It is absolutely bizarre that we are not doing more for infrastructure.But here in San Diego, you’re ahead of the curve for a whole range of reasons.And one of the things — and let me say to the military that’s here, thank you for your service and thank you for all you do for us. I mean that sincerely. We’re a military family. And God bless you, man.And also — if you excuse the point of personal privilege, I’m a union guy. For the unions that are here, thank you. One of the things the President and I have tried to do — not just us — a lot of people is we got to figure out how to restore the middle class after this godawful recession and the hit it’s been taking over the last 20 or more years.And one of the ways to do that — the best way is good-paying jobs. The reason why this port and so many other ports are so critically important and why we should be expanding them. I realize this is a topic for another speech, port expansion, but it’s because you can actually make a living wage working in the port. You can actually — and let me explain what I mean by middle class — being able to own your own home and not have to rent it; send your kid to a local park and be confident they’ll come home safely; and being able to send your kid to a local high school, and they do well, they get to college. And if they get to college, you’ll find a way to get them there. And when one of your elderly parents passes away, you’re able to take care of the other. That’s not asking a whole hell of a lot. That’s the basis. They’re the folks who built this country.And when the middle class does well, everybody does well. The wealthy do even better, and the poor have a way up.Vice President Joe Biden delivers remarks on trade enforcement at the Port of San Diego, July 13, 2016. (Official White House photo by Lawrence Jackson)And that’s the underlying subtext of everything I want to talk to you about today. And, Randa, thank you by the way. It’s obviously a woman is running things here it’s running so well.Marshall, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for everything. Actually, he’s the one who said that to me when he introduced me to Randa.America’s economic might and dynamism — and our ability to compete with the rest of world — depends on our ability to access world markets. There’s that old joke. They asked Willie Sutton why does he rob banks. He said, “Because that’s where the money is.”Well, why do we need ports that are efficient, competent, able to get products to market quickly, able to get raw materials to manufacturers quickly? It’s because if you don’t, folks are going to go somewhere else. They’re going to go somewhere else.One of the reasons why we’re in such good shape right now is that America is in a better place — there is an outfit called AT Kearney. Every year they do a survey for the past I think 18–20 years. And they ask the 300 largest industrialists in the world: Where is the best place in the world to invest your money? And for the fourth year in a row by a margin larger than any time the survey has been kept, they say the United States of America. And that’s for three reasons.One, we have the most productive workers in the world, and we do. Number two, we’re in a situation where we’re going to be energy independent the remainder of this century. The epicenter of energy is North America. It is not the Arabian Peninsula. It is not Africa. It is not South America. It is the United States of America, Canada, and Mexico.And so, folks, we also have the single-best research universities in the world. That’s why almost every new invention, every new breakthrough has stamped on it: Made in America. We’re the most innovative people in the world.And thirdly, we’re in a situation where we have venture capitalists that are prepared to invest in things that work. But, ladies and gentlemen, the fact is that if you think about it, compared to the rest of the world, we are better positioned. We’ve created more jobs than all the rest of the industrial world combined — combined — since this godawful recession. We still have a long way to go. We’ve gone from crisis to recovery. We’ve on the verge of resurgence.But the point is, of all of this, is that trade matters. This is a global economy. Now all the effects of globalization are good.But what Americans have always done is they’ve always bent reality to the benefit of Americans and American workers. With every new industrial change in the world, we have adapted.And, ladies and gentlemen, the fact of the matter is that right here in San Diego that dynamism flows through this port — 58,000 direct and indirect jobs are related to this port. As the chairman pointed out, nearly $8 billion in economic activity, not just for the companies involved in trade, but for businesses, and workers, from customers, from local diner, to gas stations, to hotels. It’s all across the region.But to ensure American workers and businesses have a fair shot and equal access to those world markets and aren’t put at a competitive disadvantage by cheating, we have to enforce the rules the road that govern global trade.Since day one, our administration has enforced our trade laws aggressively, more aggressively than any administration in the past, using more tools and going after bigger cases than ever before.Today, I want to talk about a couple of ways we’ve done that and why we have to continue it for the benefit of the American worker.First, we’ve filed 21 cases with the World Trade Organization, the group that settles trade disputes among 160 countries that belong to the WTO.There’s a lot at stake. We need to sell to customers abroad; 95 percent of the world’s customers are over there. They’re beyond our shores — 95 percent of the world’s customers. We have the best products in the world, so we have to make sure they have equal access both here and abroad.Exports support 10 million jobs, around one-eighth of our gross domestic product. Today, I’m here to announce that the 13th WTO case we’re filing against China, and it’s the 22nd one we have filed since 2009. And we’ve won every single case that’s been decided by the WTO. And I’m confident we’ll win this one.Here’s what’s happening. When companies in China ship raw materials abroad, they put a tax on the raw material that comes from China. That drives up the cost of those materials for the buyers in other countries and puts American companies at a disadvantage in competing the sell the products that need those raw materials.Let’s say you’re an American manufacturer that needs graphite to make refrigerators or batteries. You have to import because we don’t produce graphite here at home. And because China taxes the export of graphite 20 percent, American companies pay more for graphite than the companies competing with them in China making batteries and refrigerators and whatever else is needed — needs graphite.And any business owner will tell you, it’s tough to compete when you’re paying 20 percent more for the raw material than your competitor is.And it’s not just graphite. It’s key materials like tin and copper that are used everywhere from cars to electronics to semi-conductors. But with the action we’re taking today, we’re aiming to change that.Here in San Diego alone, let me tell you what it will mean. Qualcomm is going to — when we win — pay less for Chinese tin than it pays now, and no more than any Chinese company because Qualcomm makes semi-conductors. It will reduce the cost of them making those semi-conductors and make them more competitive not only in this market against Chinese companies, but worldwide. This is a worldwide market.Vice President Joe Biden arrives at the Port of San Diego to deliver remarks on trade enforcement, July 13, 2016. (Official White House photo by Lawrence Jackson)DJO Global will pay the same price for cobalt when it makes medical devices that its Chinese competitors pay, making the competition at home and worldwide fair. And when it’s fair, America wins. When it’s fair, America prevails.Ladies and gentlemen, the failure to act would cost jobs and revenue in sectors ranging from aerospace to automobiles to electronics. This all adds up. Big time.Manufacturers for brake parts that employ 20,000 people; fertilizer and animal feed companies that employ 61,000 people. This case builds on previous WTO cases we’ve won to level the playing field for American businesses and workers. Everywhere.China put a $5 Billion illegal tax on American-made cars being shipped into China, driving up the cost of those cars. We’re taking away market, meaning fewer people working on the assembly line. Fewer American cars, which are better made, more competitive than other cars moving into China. We filed a case against them. We won. We won for the 926,000 workers in American auto industry that are back selling the best cars in the world and more than they ever did.And by the way, for those who didn’t like me pushing to bail out, the automobile industry, go to hell. It doesn’t matter. It worked. There’s 926,000 autoworkers, making a decent, honorable wage.Ladies and gentlemen, the previous government in Argentina illegally shut out a wide array of American products from electronics to cars, to parts for medical devices — costing American companies tens of millions of dollars in potential exports and American jobs.We filed a case against them. We won.Today, the United States exports $9.2 billion worth of electronics, machinery, aerospace parts, chemicals, and plastics made in California, Illinois, Michigan, Florida — exports them to Argentina. They’re able to compete and export to here. That’s okay. All we want is a level playing field. Whenever, it’s level, we do just fine. We do just fine.Four years ago we filed a case against the country of India because it was refusing to allow poultry to be brought into its markets, hurting our industry and thousands of farmers from Georgia to Arkansas to my home state of Delaware. In 2015, we won.By the time India finishes complying with the WTO ruling, it will mean an additional half a billion dollars in exports of American poultry abroad. That’s a big deal. That’s a lot of jobs.That’s what standing up for 50,000 of America’s farmers looks like. We also filed and won cases against Peru, Colombia, Honduras, and South Africa on everything ranging from intellectual property to pork and beef to solar panels and timber.Folks the point is simple, we are demanding — not asking, we’re demanding that other countries abide by the letter and spirit of international obligations they sign onto. In the past, they’ve been reluctant to do that. Would that hurt relations in other areas? Would that impact on our foreign policy? Would that, in fact, affect industries who are invested here? This is about American jobs. We’re going to continue to be as aggressive as we can when any country violates agreements they’ve made hurting American business, American entrepreneurs, and American workers.Another way we’ve made sure other countries pay for violating the law is penalizing them when they don’t abide by the law. The motivations in other countries are clear. Some countries are trying keep workers in their industries, unprofitable industries that can’t compete, keeping them alive. How do they do it? What they do is they subsidize the product they’re making so it can be sold much cheaper. They’re not making any money. It’s an employment project they have. But their employment, unable to make a product that can compete, costs Americans jobs.Others want their companies to take up market share, crowd out competitors. It’s real simple. Look at the steel dumping cases. They sell steel below cost — below the cost it cost them to make it and ship it. Why do they do that? Say, what the hell? We wouldn’t do that. American company can’t stay in business. Well, they do it for a simple reason: To shut down American steel manufacturers, put them out of business, grab the share of market. Once the market is controlled, prices can be raised. It’s not a new idea. It happened with the robber barons back in the late 1800s here in America.But, ladies and gentlemen, we’ve sat by too long. Countries do this, as I said, with products like steel and rubber, aluminum all the time to gain unfair share of — not just our market, but a global market — crowding out American companies in an attempt to try to put them out of business. When countries do these things, we act.Under the World Trade Organization, we’re allowed to levy a tax, assuming we get the decision — and we have — a tax on import of those foreign goods in the amount of the subsidy or the amount of the dumping cost — to cover the difference. We’ve been vigilant doing this, and we’ve won. We have put in place 338 duties. That is taxes on their illegal behavior from nearly 40 countries that engage in these unfair trade practices. The total amount has been an extra $1.2 billion they’ve had to pay for their unfair behavior.Last year alone, we initiated another 62 investigations of countries we believe are disadvantaging U.S. companies — the most cases filed in 14 years.Folks, it’s simple: Agreements aren’t worth the paper they are written on, unless they are enforced.One of the reasons so many Americans are upset about trade is because we have not adequately enforced them — these agreements. There’s always been other considerations. We’re not afraid to make it clear to any country we deal with, as long as you play by the rules, you beat us fair and square, it’s yours. But don’t try to stack the deck against us.Well, why do we want fair trade agreements? As I said, because that’s where the customers are. Ninety-five percent of the world’s consumers live outside our borders. Let me make something clear, by all objective indicia and data that’s available, we make the best products in the world — by and large. Number one.Number two, our workers by every independent study show they are three times as productive as workers in Asia and more productive than workers in the EU. How many of you heard over the — all during the ’90s how Japan was going to own us? They were going to buy up everything. Japan Incorporated — we couldn’t compete.Then you heard about how, oh, man, tell you what, the European Union, we can’t compete with them; 385 million people, man. We can’t do it. And then China. China is going to eat our lunch, own us. I want them all to do well. I mean it sincerely. I want them all to do well economically. And they have enough money to buy our products. They have enough money to buy our products. Grow the world economy. But, ladies and gentlemen, raise your hand if you’d trade places economically with any one of those entities I named. God love China. And they’re a lot. I want to see them succeed. They not only don’t have enough energy, they don’t have enough water. Water.We want them to succeed. It’s in our interest. But, ladies and gentlemen, it’s time we take off the mask and understand just how strong we are, just how capable we are. Not we, Barack and Joe Biden, this administration, the American people. It comes down to competition. It’s fundamental to who we are.I was with — well, I shouldn’t go into that. But I was with a couple foreign leaders. They’re asking me why I was so confident, why I wanted to see them succeed. I said, so we can sell you our products.He said, what makes you think you can do that? I said, we make better products. And by the way, we do. We do.Over the last eight years because of the grit and determination of the American people — and to be very blunt about it — some of the very tough unpopular decisions the President and I have had to make, we’ve gone from crisis to recovery, on the cusp of resurgence here.The United States is better positioned in the 21st century to be the leading economy in the world for this century than it even was in the 20th century. We have everything. And we should not apologize under any circumstances for enforcing the rules of the road, for enforcing the agreements other nations have signed onto. It’s based on a simple proposition. All we have to do — and I know they always refer to me as Middle Class Joe. In Washington that’s not meant as a compliment. That’s meant when you’re middle class, you’re not sophisticated. I am middle class. I know where I come from. I know why we’re who we are. And the thing that disturbs me about so many people around the world — and some here — is they forget that ordinary people do extraordinary things. Ordinary Americans do extraordinary things. And all you got to do is give them a fair shot. Just a fair shot. They’re not asking for anything. Just give me a fair shot. I can take care of myself.Well, as long as I have this job, which the good news for some of you is, not much longer — I am going to make sure that we make no apologies for enforcing trade agreements. And any future trade agreements that are made, that are fair and equal where the American worker and American industry gets an even shot. And we do that, we’ll do just fine.Thank you all for sitting out in the sun, although I like sitting out here in the sun. Thank you for listening. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you, everybody.Thanks for what you do here at this port. Thank you.

Video, photos and transcripts of these events will follow.VIDEO of the Governor’s remarks and signing the legislation is available on YouTube here and in TV quality (h264, mp4) format here .AUDIO of the Governor’s remarks is available here .PHOTOS of the event will be available on the Governor's Flickr page shortly.A rush transcript of the Governor’s remarks is below.Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all very much. Thank you all very much. Well, it’s my pleasure to be back in Buffalo once again. Sometime I feel like I never leave but it’s a pleasure to be back. And you know, first, before we begin the subject of the day, we’ve been talking about the renaissance of Western New York and we tend to talk about big high profile projects that are making a lot of progress. And we do have big high profile projects that are making a lot of progress. But the success is a really a shared success and that’s what we often forget. It’s not just a few high profile projects and jobs at the top of the spectrum. You really feel that this renaissance is striking every community everywhere. I remember walking through this community. I don’t want to say how many years ago but Tony Masiello was mayor. And it was a totally, totally different community. And if we had said to anyone, “The Lower West Side is going to go through a resurgence and you’re not going to recognize it in just a relative handful of years,” they would have said it wasn’t going to happen. But it is happening and this is a different community than it was. Congratulations to Evergreen, congratulations to a lot of community organizations that have worked very hard but once again it is evidence that what the Mayor is doing, what the County Executive is doing, what the community of Western New York has really pulled together to accomplish, is happening. This is a different place than it was just a few years ago. And I say congratulations to Buffalo, to Erie, to Niagara Falls, because you really have done a 180 degree turn and let’s give the Mayor and the County Executive and everyone involved a round of applause.I want to thank my legislative colleagues. We finished the legislative session. The legislative session starts in January, and it goes through June. It feels like an eternity when you’re in Albany, trust me, but it’s only January through June. And it was actually a highly productive legislative session. We got things done that were national firsts and that we’re very proud of. We passed the best paid family leave program in the United States of America, which is going to change the way people live. We passed the highest minimum wage phased in over time to $15 an hour so people have a decent lifestyle at every income level. We have more funding for education than we’ve ever funded before – $25 billion for education because that’s our priority. We’re the first state that will test every school’s water to make sure it is lead free. First state in the nation. And we passed a piece of legislation that we’re going to be talking about in the next few days that will end the scourge of these so-called “zombie properties.” These are properties that caught up in the mortgage meltdown in 2007. They bounced back and forth in ownership between the original owner and the bank. Nobody really takes responsibility for the property, the property degrades, and degrades the entire community around it. It’s been going on for years. It has to end. It’s going to end now and our new housing foreclosure law is going to do that, so that’s great progress.And in the midst of it all, we actually cut taxes. Now if you want to make money – I think this is legal – I was Attorney General, I should know -- wager anyone you know and say “Did New York State raise taxes or lower taxes?” Everybody’s going to say, “Raise taxes” because it is inconceivable that a government actually lowers taxes. New York State has lowered taxes for everyone in the state and every income level in the state. And for the middle class, up to $300,000 in income— which is a very broad middle class – up to $300,000 in income, lowest tax rate in 70 years, believe it or not. So it’s a way to make money, and it’s good news for the state.And what we’re talking about today, which is the nation’s best policy, I believe, and best program, in dealing with what is a national scourge. This is not just a New York problem. It’s not just an Erie problem. It is a national problem. But once again, New York stepped up to the plate. I believe it’s New York’s legacy to lead and to take on the tough challenges and to show other states what can be done. And that’s exactly what we’re doing here with heroin. It is a national program. We’ve already gotten calls from other states seeking to replicate what we’re doing here in New York. So I want to congratulate the legislators. They’ve been recognized, but I’m going to ask them to stand once again so we can give them a round of applause. Senator Ranzenhofer, Assemblyman Sean Ryan, Senator Ortt, Assemblyman John Ceretto, Assemblyman Mickey Kearns, Assemblyman Joe Giglio – stand up. Let’s give them a round of applause and thank them for a job well done.You know the facts on heroin. It isn’t just the pain of what people are going through today. What is most frightening is the exponential increase in the numbers, which is really staggering. Ten years ago we had about six deaths in Eerie County, now we have about a hundred every year. Over the past ten years we’ve lost ten thousand people to heroin overdoses and the numbers are increasing exponentially. It is spiking. It is becoming more and more available, especially among the younger community, it’s becoming more and more accepted, and it is truly, truly a frightening and staggering increase. We’re losing as many people to heroin and opioid overdoses as we lost to the AIDS epidemic at its peak. That’s how bad this is. Think about that: The AIDS epidemic – one of the worst things that society has had to deal with, and the loss of life is just about the same with this heroin epidemic. So the numbers are staggering, and it’s frightening, and it’s getting worse.That is why this task force that we put together and put together quickly was so important. I want to thank all the members of the task force who really did great, great work and smart work in a short period of time. The Lieutenant Governor, let’s give her a round of applause, who headed it up. Now the heroin situation was really a nightmare for so many families because it was confounding. It was hard to get people help. Everywhere you turned you ran into an obstacle. Probably one of the biggest nightmares that a parent can go through is to have a child that is in trouble and a child that is struggling and you can’t get to the child, you can’t get a way to help your child and wherever you go you’re told “No,” and wherever you go you’re told, “Well you don’t understand the rules and regulations. This is what you have to do and this is what you have to fill out. As a parent, you don’t have the right to do this for your child.”I’ve been involved with too many families where this was just a heartbreaking, heartbreaking situation. I’ve been involved with too many families where the outcome was the worst imaginable outcome. I believe that probably the most unnatural pain in life is the loss of a child. Parents are painful, brothers and sisters are painful but there’s an order to life and there’s an expectation. To lose a child is unnatural. Parents don’t bury children. That’s not what happens. And for the parents who have gone through that, we have the deepest sympathy. We have parents here today who suffered that most grave loss, and some of them have been extraordinary and they’ve taken the pain and they’ve put it to a positive place. And rather than just get angry and get bitter, they’ve taken that lesson and that pain and they’ve turned it into an energy that has caused them to drive a movement so that other parents don’t feel that pain. They deserve the greatest respect and our appreciation for truly heroic action. Avi and Julie Israel are here today, and they represent all the parents across the state who have felt that pain and brought it to a higher place. So we thank them. The legislation basically does four main issues. It attacks the four largest obstacles to treating this problem.First, it takes on the insurance companies. I understand the insurance companies are businesses. Insurance companies are not charities. Insurance companies are in business to make money. They are businesses. I did a lot of battle with the insurance companies when I was Attorney General and their point is basically right. “We’re not there to give out care and give out healthcare aimlessly or easily. We want to restrict it and do what we have to do. But we’re in the business to make a profit.” The insurance regulations were part of the nightmare in getting treatment for someone with a heroin problem, because there is no time to delay. And when you have a person who is overdosing, who is sick, who needs treatment, who could possibly kill themselves at any given hour, and you run into an insurance company that says, “Well I have to give you prior approval before we’re willing to pay for a treatment program and fill out this form and fill out this form and fill out this form, and we’re not sure that you’re person actually qualifies, and we don’t know that they need treatment, and we’ll let you know in 3 days and we want to have a meeting and we want to have a consultation” – that can be a matter of life and death, those few days.You can have a person who is just out of control in life, and who the parents can’t control and the neighbors can’t control and the family can’t control, and to be told by an insurance company that “We’re not sure it’s necessary,” when you are at your wits end, can literally be the difference between life and death. What this legislation says to insurance companies is, you don’t have a right to stop a medical decision that says treatment is necessary.We are going to have a state protocol that is established, a doctor will make the determination as to that protocol, if a doctor determines that that person needs treatment, that person is going to get treatment, and that insurance company is going to pay for that treatment, period.Second, even if a parent brings a child over 18, there is no legal right to hold that child longer than 48 hours. Forty-eight hours is a relatively short period of time and 48 hours, the person who overdosed or who is under the influence might not be of a clear head yet to make decisions. But at the end of 48 hours that person would be released as a matter of law. We understand the balance with civil liberties – you don’t want to hold a person against their will – but a parent who is trying to help a child and who can’t control that child – 48 hours often isn’t enough. We’re going to take the 48 hours, we’re going to increase it to 72 hours which we think is a fair balance, respects the civil rights of that child, but also can get them the help they need. Seventy-two hours is a period where the doctors say the person will sober up to an extent that they can make rational decisions. The legislation is going to make that change from 48 to 72 hours, which can make a very big difference.Third, you have heard the stories. Assemblyman Ryan was exactly right and Lieutenant Governor was exactly right. Doctors are prescribing these painkillers with a frequency that is disturbing. My 20-year-old went in to have her tonsils removed. She comes back with a 30-day supply of opioids. If you had taken a 30 day supply of opioids you could very well have a problem at the end of 30 days just because you followed the prescription of the doctor. You don’t need 30 days of opioids when you have your tonsils removed. There’s been an increasing and increasing frequency of the number of prescriptions and the length of prescriptions. I’ve done cases in the past as Attorney General, the connections between the drug companies and doctors; I believe drug companies often incentivize doctors to prescribe certain medications, but it has gone too far. We’ve said you can’t do prescription for more than seven days, period. If you have to refill it, refill it, but no one is going home with 30 days of opioids that can get them hooked or that they can sell.And fourth, the treatment. Many, many people are going to need treatment. When a person is ready to go into treatment, that is a precious moment. When the person stops denying and the person stops fighting and the person says, “Okay, I will go for treatment.” You have a window of opportunity when the person says that because forced treatment doesn’t really work. You can’t force a person to go for drug treatment. They have to believe that they need it, but when they are at that window, when they believe they need it, you have to be able to strike fast and get them to treatment at that moment.We have had a shortage of treatment beds. So, you have people who are ready to go in and say, “Okay mom. Okay dad, I’ll go.” You call up and you can’t get them a bed and the treatment provider says, “Call back in 14 days, maybe we’ll have something.” You don’t have 14 days. We need more treatment capacity. This increases about 2,500 slots statewide to have the treatment capacity to actually help the people who need it and that’s going to be coming online immediately.So we have the right program. We learned from all across the country. The task force spoke to communities all across the state. I’m confident that it’s a smart program and it’s the right program and it’s a program that fulfills government’s obligation. You know, the greatest test for government for me, is how it responds to a crisis, right? Government is a lot of things. Nobody ever accuses it of being especially fast and collegial. So, for government to do what government did here, which is be confronted with a real crisis and a complicated crisis. For the Senate and the Assembly to come together and work together as a team, not that you don’t do that every day, and to come up with a substantive program in just a matter of weeks, get it funded and get it passed was really a great piece of government work and that’s what government is supposed to do. When there is a problem that you can’t handle yourself, it’s supposed to be fast and efficient and practical and put the politics aside. I don’t care if you’re a Democrat, I don’t care if you’re a Republican, I don’t care what you are, come together and get the job done for the people of this state and that’s exactly what this government has done and I applaud them.Now, the rest is up to us. We have the government program, we have the tools, but this is a societal crisis and this is going to take us all to address it. It’s going to take parents, it’s going to take neighbors, it’s going to take teachers, it’s going to take law enforcement, it’s going to take the District Attorneys, It’s going to take the police officers, the Sherriff, all of us coming together as a community to help young people who are in trouble and struggling. Sometimes you wonder how people survive youth. It is such a vulnerable time. You are at that point in life where you know all the answers to all the questions, or you think you know all the answers to all the questions, but you can actually get yourself in a lot of trouble. It is a test for each and every people in this all today. If we pull together and we act together, we can save lives with this program and there is no better accomplishment in life than that. Thank you and God bless you.Next SectionContact the Governor's Press OfficeContact the Governor's Press OfficeContact us by phone:

Tom Wolf will have his budget goals, as will members of the House and Senate. We can find a way to reach an understanding, but only after we recognize that a balanced, on-time budget must be grounded in fiscal reality, not unrealistic wishes. It's important to look at recent budget history.Under former Gov. Ed Rendell, the rates of spending and debt far exceeded growth in the state's economy.We were spending what we didn't have, only to run headlong into the 2008 recession that caused tax revenues to plummet. Pennsylvania's dilemma was - as often happens with rescues - only worsened under the Obama administration's ""stimulus"" spending. State government plugged billions of one-time federal dollars into general fund spending, acting as if these one-time revenues would somehow reappear from somewhere else. Rendell delayed addressing the inevitable. It came anyway. When those stimulus dollars ran out, we needed to hit reset and adjust our spending to match our revenues. Under former Gov. Tom Corbett, we made some tough decisions. But in the face of a sputtering economy, we delivered four on-time, balanced budgets without increasing broad-based taxes. Each budget finished in the black. Along comes Wolf, who promised billions in new spending, demanding billions in new taxes.Indeed, his pursuit of a slate of tax increases was the focal point of last year's budget dispute.As Speaker of the House, I stood firm against any further tax burdens on Pennsylvania families and job creators. The quality of government and the amount we spend on it long ago lost any connection, especially in the face of spiraling public pension obligations and the legacy of debt inherited from the Rendell years. Paying more taxes for less service is - and should be - a non-starter for Pennsylvanians.The bulk of this year's final budget was passed in December 2015, while the remainder was passed with bipartisan support in March 2016.That budget spent less than the original, on-time budget that the governor vetoed in June 2015. Our most current budget increased spending by 2.8 percent, while the state's economy grew by less than 1 percent.Wolf and others had advocated for an unsustainable increase in spending of nearly 6 percent.The salient question is how to make this budget season different. We are determined to avoid a repeat of last year. First and foremost, Wolf should understand that many members of the General Assembly, reflecting the views of their constituents, will not support an increase in the state's personal income tax or sales tax. Real earnings by working families have hardly increased to match government's appetite for spending. If anyone needs to tighten a belt, it's government, not working people.The General Assembly, in turn, must recognize that on some level, we need to identify our cost drivers: pensions, debt-rate increases, and the growth in entitlement spending. We need to find ways to solve these root problems, while covering the cost of the transition.All sides need to sit down and find mutually acceptable solutions. Last year's blanket veto left us no room to settle. Angry rhetoric and hardening of positions on both sides only exacerbated the situation. This year, we must tone down the language and learn to listen. All sides need to be smarter, look further ahead, and achieve the art of the possible.We saw an example of that last week when the General Assembly and the governor compromised on a cause that our caucus has long championed: an end to the state's monopoly on alcoholic beverages. My deeply held belief is that government has no place in the sale of wine and spirits. Wolf holds a different view. Still, we were able to put together a law that delivers a win for our citizens.The larger point is that we got something done, and the state's fiscal office believes it will add $150 million in new revenue every year. After last week's success, we can begin the necessary task of reforming public pensions, reducing the commonwealth's debt load, and forging a path to domestic energy independence. We can pass a budget that meets the needs of all our citizens, grows the economy, and respects the earnings of our working families.Principled compromise is not a failure of government. It is the definition of successful governing. State Rep. Mike Turzai, a Republican, is Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. He represents the Allegheny County-based 28th House District.View Comments"

Using our website's state-by-state data feature, you can navigate between interactive maps, tables, and rankings that allow you to access and use these data.View State-by-State DataThe United States is the world’s leader in incarceration.There are 2.2 million people in the nation’s prisons and jails—a 500% increase over the last 40 years. Changes in law and policy, not changes in crime rates, explain most of this increase. The results are overcrowding in prisons and fiscal burdens on states, despite increasing evidence that large-scale incarceration is not an effective means of achieving public safety.International Rates of Incarceration per 100,000Data source: International Centre for Prison Studies. Download chart U.S. State and Federal Prison Population, 1925-2015Data source: Bureau of Justice Statistics. Download chart We started sending more people to prison.A series of law enforcement and sentencing policy changes of the “tough on crime” era resulted in dramatic growth in incarceration. Since the official beginning of the War on Drugs in 1982, the number of people incarcerated for drug offenses in the U.S. skyrocketed from 40,900 in 1980 to 469,545 in 2015. Today, there are more people behind bars for a drug offense than the number of people who were in prison or jail for any crime in 1980. The number of people sentenced to prison for property and violent crimes has also increased even during periods when crime rates have declined.People in Prisons & Jails for Drug Offenses, 1980 & 2015Data source: Bureau of Justice Statistics; The Sentencing Project. Download chart We started sending people to prison for much longer terms.Number of People Serving Life Sentences, 1984-2016Data source: The Sentencing Project. Download chartHarsh sentencing laws like mandatory minimums, combined with cutbacks in parole release, keep people in prison for longer periods of time. The National Research Council reported that half of the 222% growth in the state prison population between 1980 and 2010 was due to an increase of time served in prison for all offenses. There has also been a historic rise in the use of life sentences: one in nine people in prison is now serving a life sentence, nearly a third of whom are sentenced to life without parole.Mass incarceration has not touched all communities equallyThe racial impact of mass incarcerationSentencing policies, implicit racial bias, and socioeconomic inequity contribute to racial disparities at every level of the criminal justice system. Today, people of color make up 37% of the U.S. population but 67% of the prison population. Overall, African Americans are more likely than white Americans to be arrested; once arrested, they are more likely to be convicted; and once convicted, they are more likely to face stiff sentences. Black men are six times as likely to be incarcerated as white men and Hispanic men are more than twice as likely to be incarcerated as non-Hispanic white men.Lifetime Likelihood of Imprisonment for U.S. Residents Born in 2001This estimate is based on data from 2001. Data source: Bureau of Justice Statistics. Download infographic Mass incarceration and public safetyIncarceration has some impact on crime, but the impact is one of diminishing returns.Crime rates have declined substantially since the early 1990s, but studies suggest that rising imprisonment has not played a major role in this trend. The National Research Council concluded that while prison growth was a factor in reducing crime, “the magnitude of the crime reduction remains highly uncertain and the evidence suggests it was unlikely to have been large.” Several factors explain why this impact was relatively modest.First, incarceration is particularly ineffective at reducing certain kinds of crimes: in particular, youth crimes, many of which are committed in groups, and drug crimes. When people get locked up for these offenses, they are easily replaced on the streets by others seeking an income or struggling with addiction.Second, people tend to “age out” of crime. Research shows that crime starts to peak in the mid- to late- teenage years and begins to decline when individuals are in their mid-20s. After that, crime drops sharply as adults reach their 30s and 40s. The National Research Council study concludes:“Because recidivism rates decline markedly with age, lengthy prison sentences, unless they specifically target very high-rate or extremely dangerous offenders, are an inefficient approach to preventing crime by incapacitation.”As a result, the excessive sentencing practices in the U.S. are largely counterproductive and extremely costly.State Expenditures on Corrections in Billions, 1985-2015Data source: National Association of State Budget Officers. Download chartSignificant reforms in recent yearsAfter nearly 40 years of continued growth, the U.S. prison population has stabilized in recent years.This is partially a result of declining crime rates, but has largely been achieved through pragmatic changes in policy and practice. For more than a decade, the political climate of criminal justice reform has been evolving toward evidence-based, commonsense approaches to public safety. This can be seen in a variety of legislative, judicial, and policy changes that have successfully decreased incarceration without adverse impacts on public safety.At the state level:California voters passed ballot measure Proposition 47 in 2014, which reclassified certain low-level property and drug crimes from felonies to misdemeanors, and will reinvest some of the fiscal savings into prevention programsNew York policymakers reformed the Rockefeller drug laws in 2009, which imposed harsh mandatory minimum sentences for low-level drug offensesAt the federal level:In 2014, the United States Sentencing Commission unanimously voted to reduce excessive sentences for up to 46,000 people currently serving time for federal drug offensesCongress passed the Fair Sentencing Act in 2010, which reduced the disparity in sentencing between crack and powder cocaine offensesAs promising as these changes may be, we are a long way from solving our national problem of mass incarceration—and the way forward is clear.Where do we need to go from here?Just as a bicycle works best when it uses different gears based on the terrain, we need a justice system that has different responses for different situations—shifting gears to treatment, prevention, and long-term public safety solutions as appropriate. By taking a practical approach to criminal justice reform, we can decrease crime, enhance public safety, and make more responsible use of our resources.In particular, we need to start by:Eliminating mandatory minimum sentences and cutting back on excessively lengthy sentences; for example, by imposing a 20-year maximum on prison terms.Shifting resources to community-based prevention and treatment for substance abuse.Investing in interventions to that promote strong youth development and respond to delinquency in age-appropriate and evidence-based ways.Examining and addressing the policies and practices, conscious or not, that contribute to racial inequity at every stage of the justice system.Removing barriers that make it harder for individuals with criminal records to turn their lives around.Get Our Email Updates

Pat McCrory signs a bill headed for his desk.Dash-cam footage is now considered public record, but current law doesn’t address access to body-cam videos and many agencies consider them confidential personnel records. House Bill 972 , which passed the Senate Wednesday on a 48-2 vote and the House on a 89-19 vote, would state that neither kind of footage is public record.Under the bill, heads of law enforcement agencies could make the recordings available to people shown or heard in the footage as well as personal representatives of the people recorded. Agencies would have authority in choosing times and locations for viewing or listening.Police would be able to withhold footage for privacy and safety reasons, and denied requests could be appealed to Superior Court judges.SIGN UPHelp us deliver journalism that makes a difference in our community.Our journalism takes a lot of time, effort, and hard work to produce. If you read and enjoy our journalism, please consider subscribing today.SUBSCRIBE TODAY“The judge is the middle person, and we particularly made it the Superior Court judge because they are a little more removed from the day-to-day interactions with law enforcement agencies,” said Rep. John Faircloth, a Republican from High Point and former police chief who sponsored the bill.“People (in recordings) are not allowed to duplicate it or take it with them,” Faircloth said. “They can only view it. If they want to have a copy, they will have to go through the judge.”Some Democrats have argued the bill makes it too easy for law enforcement to avoid releasing the footage. Others, including Democratic Rep. Robert Reives of Sanford, have concerns that recordings could end up tying up the courts with unnecessary workload.The American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina on Wednesday called on McCrory to veto the bill. Susanna Birdsong, the group’s policy counsel, said in a news release the bill is “an affront to transparency.”“Giving law enforcement such broad authority to keep video footage secret – even from individuals who are filmed – will damage law enforcement’s ability to build trust with the public,” Birdsong said.Eddie Caldwell, executive vice president at the N.C. Sheriff’s Association, praised the bill as easy to understand and said it protects the privacy of individuals who are recorded.“The Sheriff’s Association supports this bill as a high priority,” Caldwell said. “We’re very much in favor of it and think it’ll bring a lot of clarity and simplicity to an issue where there has been a lack of clarity.”An amendment added by the Senate at the request of Sen. Floyd McKissick, a Durham Democrat, allows the state Administrative Office of the Courts to prepare a petition, free of charge, for someone asking a court to order the release of the recording.

Doug Ducey wants to use ""taxpayer dollars to increase the salaries of private prison guards.""  "	mostly true	['Criminal Justice']	http://www.azhousedemocrats.com/	http://www.azhousedemocrats.com/2016/06/public-schools-not-private-prisons.html	2016/06/29	This year, Arizonans have shown beyond any doubt that theyprioritize education and that they want state leaders to do the same. But aDepartment of Corrections proposal approved by a legislative committee lastweek suggests that Republicans’ priorities are still all wrong. Arizona now plans to purchase the private prison in Kingmanfrom GEO Group, the company that took the facility over after inmate riotslast summer. Arizonaplans to pay $137.4 million, refinance the debt at a much lower interest rate,and then continue to contract with GEO Group to operate the prison. According to the DOC, paying off the prison will cost taxpayers $77.5 millionless if Arizona holds the debt than if GEO Group continues to. That is a bigwin for Arizona taxpayers, who are burdened by a bloated prison system. But the Kingman plan, proposed by a Republicanadministration and approved by a majority-Republican oversight committee, alsoposes a serious question: are private prisons actually more expensive thanpublic prisons? alsoposes a serious question: are private prisons actually more expensive thanpublic prisons? Until Republican legislators in 2012 outlawed costcomparisons, data consistently demonstrate that, yes, private prisons are moreexpensive than public prisons. In 2010, the Department of Corrections reportedthat the dailyper capita cost of prisoners in private prisons was almost 10 percent higherthan for those in state prisons. It seems like Republican legislators did notlike the truth, so they made up their own. And the chief justification forspending millions of dollars every year on private prisons has continued to bethat they save Arizona money. Despite appearing to acknowledge that public prisons aremore cost-effective, however, the Kingman plan is still bad for Arizona taxpayers; and for Arizona’s corrections officers. Because Gov. Ducey intends to usemore than $2 million of the yearly savings—that is, taxpayer money—to subsidizethe salaries of GEO Group’s prison guards. That bears repeating: Gov. Ducey wants to use public,taxpayer dollars to increase the salaries of private prison guards—guardsemployed by a multi-billion dollar company that made nearly$140 million in profits last year. Publiccorrections officers, meanwhile, have gone without pay raises for nine years. Democrats triedto remove the salary subsidies from the Kingman plan, but Republicanlegislators were insistent on funneling $2 million of public money to GEOGroup. The Kingman plan shows the wrong priorities for Arizona. Maybe that has something to do with the $55,000 that GEO Group gave to Gov. Ducey’s 2014 campaign. Maybe it doesn’t. But either way, taxpayer money shouldnot go to line the pockets of large, out-of-state companies. And Republican leaders in Arizona should get back tochampioning the causes Arizonans prioritize. Arizonanshave demanded education, not incarceration. House Democrats have listened,and share your priorities.

Sam Clovis, a Trump policy advisor, told Inside Higher Ed that Trump would remove the government from the student loan system and have private banks lend money to college students instead. By the way, this diverges from Trump’s original stance in 2015, when he said a “governmental program” would be the “only way” to help low-income students, reported the Washington Examiner. Furthermore, said Inside Higher Ed, Trump would make colleges share greater risk, so when deciding which students to admit or offer loans to, they favor those who are more likely to earn more post-graduation. This doesn’t seem to include those intending to major in the liberal arts. “If you are going to study 16th-century French art, more power to you. I support the arts,” said Clovis, who mentioned that the liberal arts can be worthwhile supplements to professions like engineering or business. “But you are not going to get a job.”Sheila Bair, president of Washington College, disagrees. “Yes, we also have English, Philosophy and (gasp) fine arts majors, yet they find good jobs in finance, technology or go on to graduate or professional schools,” Bair wrote in Fortune Magazine. Bair also believes Trump’s proposals — which haven’t yet been fully fleshed out — will put low-income students at a disadvantage, especially because of his strong opposition to government involvement in student loans. Several times, in his book Crippled America and in an interview with The Hill, Trump has disagreed with the idea that the government profits from student loans. He’s also said in a town hall that the Department of Education — which gives federal aid and Pell grants — could and should be “largely eliminated.”This could prove difficult for low-income students. “Without access to federal aid, low-income students will have to forgo pursuing a liberal arts degree unless they are able to access scholarship money or worse, take out expensive non-federally-backed loans,” said Bair. Trump’s plan also rejects both Hillary Clinton’s proposal for debt-free public colleges and President Obama’s free community college plan, according to Clovis, who believes that community college is already “damn near free” and that “almost anyone can afford community college.”To combat student debt then, Trump said he’ll “do something with extensions and low-interest rates,” though it’s not yet clear what that “something” is. Or he’ll “solve the problem” by creating more jobs, reports the Washington Examiner. “I often tell my supporters I’ll be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.”Grace Li is a student at Harvard College and a USA TODAY College correspondent.

As president, she will work to fix our broken immigration system and stay true to our fundamental American values: that we are a nation of immigrants, and we treat those who come to our country with dignity and respect—and that we embrace immigrants, not denigrate them.As president, Hillary will:Introduce comprehensive immigration reform. Hillary will introduce comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to full and equal citizenship within her first 100 days in office. It will treat every person with dignity, fix the family visa backlog, uphold the rule of law, protect our borders and national security, and bring millions of hardworking people into the formal economy.End the three- and 10-year bars. The three- and 10-year bars force families—especially those whose members have different citizenship or immigration statuses—into a heartbreaking dilemma: remain in the shadows, or pursue a green card by leaving the country and loved ones behind.Defend President Obama’s executive actions—known as DACA and DAPA—against partisan attacks. The Supreme Court’s deadlocked decision on DAPA was a heartbreaking reminder of how high the stakes are in this election. Hillary believes DAPA is squarely within the president’s authority and won’t stop fighting until we see it through. The estimated 5 million people eligible for DAPA—including DREAMers and parents of Americans and lawful residents—should be protected under the executive actions.Do everything possible under the law to protect families. If Congress keeps failing to act on comprehensive immigration reform, Hillary will enact a simple system for those with sympathetic cases—such as parents of DREAMers, those with a history of service and contribution to their communities, or those who experience extreme labor violations—to make their case and be eligible for deferred action.Enforce immigration laws humanely. Immigration enforcement must be humane, targeted, and effective. Hillary will focus resources on detaining and deporting those individuals who pose a violent threat to public safety, and ensure refugees who seek asylum in the U.S. have a fair chance to tell their stories.End family detention and close private immigration detention centers. Hillary will end family detention for parents and children who arrive at our border in desperate situations and close private immigrant detention centers.Expand access to affordable health care to all families. We should let families—regardless of immigration status—buy into the Affordable Care Act exchanges. Families who want to purchase health insurance should be able to do so.Promote naturalization. Hillary will work to expand fee waivers to alleviate naturalization costs, increase access to language programs to encourage English proficiency, and increase outreach and education to help more people navigate the process.Support immigrant integration. Hillary will create a national Office of Immigrant Affairs, support affordable integration services through $15 million in new grant funding for community navigators and similar organizations, and significantly increase federal resources for adult English language education and citizenship education.The Office of
