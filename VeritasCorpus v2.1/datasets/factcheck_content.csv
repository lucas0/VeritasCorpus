Because of this similarity, synthetic cannabinoids are sometimes misleadingly called ""synthetic marijuana"" (or ""fake weed""), and they are often marketed as safe, legal alternatives to that drug. In fact, they are not safe and may affect the brain much more powerfully than marijuana; their actual effects can be unpredictable and, in some cases, more dangerous or even life-threatening.Synthetic cannabinoids are part of a group of drugs called new psychoactive substances (NPS).

Also at the meeting with Adelson was his wife, Miriam; Norm Coleman, the former Minnesota senator who chairs the Republican Jewish Coalition; Corry Bliss, who oversees the super PAC; and Jake Kastan, Ryan's No. 2 political aide. They laid out a case to Adelson about how crucial it is to protect the House.Story Continued BelowAs a federally elected official, Ryan is not permitted to solicit seven-figure political donations. When Ryan (R-Wis.) left the room, Coleman made the ask and secured the $30 million contribution.CLF did not respond to requests for comment. The contribution will become public later this month in the organization's campaign finance filing.Coleman said he would not discuss his dealings with Adelson.Adelson’s donation comes at a perilous moment for House Republicans, who are facing growing headwinds as they try to save their majority. With dozens of incumbents being outraised by emboldened Democratic challengers, desperate party officials have been hoping that Adelson — the party’s most prominent benefactor — would give more than he traditionally does, and earlier in the election cycle.Sign up here for POLITICO HuddleA daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.EmailSign UpBy signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

And the cash comes much earlier in the cycle: In 2016, Adelson gave CLF $10 million in August, as the campaign headed into the homestretch.Party officials have been paying Adelson their respects. In February, a number of House Republicans made their annual sojourn to Las Vegas to attend the annual retreat hosted by the Republican Jewish Coalition, an organization that Adelson helps to fund. Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) addressed the conference, and Ryan spoke by teleconference to a meeting of the group’s board.CLF is one part of a two-pronged political organization designed to protect and bolster House Republicans. CLF is a super PAC, and the American Action Network is a nonprofit that boosts center-right policies. Ryan, and John Boehner before him, have backed the groups.

I’ve known him for a long, long time. But remember how this investigation against Trump begins,” Dershowitz said. “It begins by the theory that people in the Trump campaign may be violating the Logan Act, by going and speaking to people when they haven’t yet been president.”SHARE this story if you think John Kerry should be INVESTIGATED!H/T easternreport

Now, after suing Harvey Weinstein, he faces a #MeToo reckoning of his own.By Jane Mayer and Ronan FarrowMay 7, 2018As Eric Schneiderman used the authority of his office to assume a major role in the #MeToo movement, the distress of four women with whom he has had romantic relationships or encounters grew.Illustration by Oliver Munday; Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty (man)Update: Three hours after the publication of this story, Schneiderman resigned from his position. “While these allegations are unrelated to my professional conduct or the operations of the office, they will effectively prevent me from leading the office’s work at this critical time,” he said in a statement. “I therefore resign my office, effective at the close of business on May 8, 2018.”Eric Schneiderman, New York’s attorney general, has long been a liberal Democratic champion of women’s rights, and recently he has become an outspoken figure in the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment. As New York State’s highest-ranking law-enforcement officer, Schneiderman, who is sixty-three, has used his authority to take legal action against the disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein , and to demand greater compensation for the victims of Weinstein’s alleged sexual crimes. Last month, when the Times and this magazine were awarded a joint Pulitzer Prize for coverage of sexual harassment, Schneiderman issued a congratulatory tweet, praising “the brave women and men who spoke up about the sexual harassment they had endured at the hands of powerful men.” Without these women, he noted, “there would not be the critical national reckoning under way.”Now Schneiderman is facing a reckoning of his own. As his prominence as a voice against sexual misconduct has risen, so, too, has the distress of four women with whom he has had romantic relationships or encounters. They accuse Schneiderman of having subjected them to nonconsensual physical violence. All have been reluctant to speak out, fearing reprisal. But two of the women, Michelle Manning Barish and Tanya Selvaratnam, have talked to The New Yorker on the record, because they feel that doing so could protect other women. They allege that he repeatedly hit them, often after drinking, frequently in bed and never with their consent. Manning Barish and Selvaratnam categorize the abuse he inflicted on them as “assault.” They did not report their allegations to the police at the time, but both say that they eventually sought medical attention after having been slapped hard across the ear and face, and also choked. Selvaratnam says that Schneiderman warned her he could have her followed and her phones tapped, and both say that he threatened to kill them if they broke up with him. (Schneiderman’s spokesperson said that he “never made any of these threats.”)A third former romantic partner of Schneiderman’s told Manning Barish and Selvaratnam that he also repeatedly subjected her to nonconsensual physical violence, but she told them that she is too frightened of him to come forward. (The New Yorker has independently vetted the accounts that they gave of her allegations.) A fourth woman, an attorney who has held prominent positions in the New York legal community, says that Schneiderman made an advance toward her; when she rebuffed him, he slapped her across the face with such force that it left a mark that lingered the next day. She recalls screaming in surprise and pain, and beginning to cry, and says that she felt frightened. She has asked to remain unidentified, but shared a photograph of the injury with The New Yorker.In a statement, Schneiderman said, “In the privacy of intimate relationships, I have engaged in role-playing and other consensual sexual activity. I have not assaulted anyone. I have never engaged in nonconsensual sex, which is a line I would not cross.”Manning Barish was romantically involved with Schneiderman from the summer of 2013 until New Year’s Day in 2015. Selvaratnam was with him from the summer of 2016 until the fall of 2017. Both are articulate, progressive Democratic feminists in their forties who live in Manhattan. They work and socialize in different circles, and although they have become aware of each other’s stories, they have only a few overlapping acquaintances; to this day, they have never spoken to each other. Over the past year, both watched with admiration as other women spoke out about sexual misconduct. But, as Schneiderman used the authority of his office to assume a major role in the #MeToo movement , their anguish and anger grew.In February, four months after the first stories about Weinstein broke, Schneiderman announced that his office was filing a civil-rights suit against him. At a press conference, he denounced Weinstein, saying, “We have never seen anything as despicable as what we’ve seen right here.” On May 2nd, at the direction of Governor Andrew Cuomo, Schneiderman launched an investigation into the past handling of criminal complaints against Weinstein by the Manhattan District Attorney, Cyrus Vance, Jr., and the New York City Police Department. (In 2015, Vance declined to bring criminal charges against Weinstein, saying that he lacked sufficient evidence—a decision criticized by activist groups.) In a speech, Cuomo explained that “sexual-assault complaints must be pursued aggressively, and to the fullest extent of the law.” The expanding investigation of the Weinstein case puts Schneiderman at the center of one of the most significant sexual-misconduct cases in recent history.Schneiderman’s activism on behalf of feminist causes has increasingly won him praise from women’s groups. On May 1st, the New York-based National Institute for Reproductive Health honored him as one of three “Champions of Choice” at its annual fund-raising luncheon. Accepting the award, Schneiderman said, “If a woman cannot control her body, she is not truly equal.” But, as Manning Barish sees it, “you cannot be a champion of women when you are hitting them and choking them in bed, and saying to them, ‘You’re a fucking whore.’ ” She says of Schneiderman’s involvement in the Weinstein investigation, “How can you put a perpetrator in charge of the country’s most important sexual-assault case?” Selvaratnam describes Schneiderman as “a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” figure, and says that seeing him lauded as a supporter of women has made her “feel sick,” adding, “This is a man who has staked his entire career, his personal narrative, on being a champion for women publicly. But he abuses them privately. He needs to be called out.”Manning Barish notes that many of her friends attended the N.I.R.H. luncheon. “His hypocrisy is epic,” she says. “He’s fooled so many people.” Manning Barish includes herself among them. She says that she met Schneiderman in July, 2013, through mutual friends. She had become a blogger and political activist after opposing her younger brother’s deployment to Iraq and working with groups such as MoveOn.org. Amicably divorced from Chris Barish, a hospitality-industry executive, she was a single mother with a young daughter and socially prominent friends. Schneiderman, who was rising in Democratic politics after being elected attorney general, in 2010, was also divorced. His ex-wife, Jennifer Cunningham, a lobbyist and political strategist at the firm SKDKnickerbocker, currently serves as one of his political consultants. They have a grown daughter.Manning Barish says that she fell quickly for Schneiderman and was happy to be involved with someone who seemed to share her progressive idealism and enjoy her feistiness. Page Six chronicled the romance, calling her a “ravishing redhead” and noting that, at a fund-raiser, the television producer Norman Lear had introduced her as Schneiderman’s “bride-to-be.”But Manning Barish began to see signs of controlling and abusive behavior. Soon after she started dating Schneiderman, he told her to remove a small tattoo from her wrist; it wasn’t appropriate, he said, if she were to become the wife of a politician. The process of having it removed was painful and expensive. In retrospect, she says, it was the first step in trying to control her body. “Taking a strong woman and tearing her to pieces is his jam,” she says.About four weeks after they became physically involved, she says, Schneiderman grew violent. One night, they were in the bedroom of his Upper West Side apartment, still clothed but getting ready for bed, and lightly baiting each other. As she recalls it, he called her “a whore,” and she talked back. They had both been drinking, and her recollection of their conversation is blurry, but what happened next remains vivid. Schneiderman, she says, backed her up to the edge of his bed. “All of a sudden, he just slapped me, open-handed and with great force, across the face, landing the blow directly onto my ear,” Manning Barish says. “It was horrendous. It just came out of nowhere. My ear was ringing. I lost my balance and fell backward onto the bed. I sprang up, but at this point there was very little room between the bed and him. I got up to try to shove him back, or take a swing, and he pushed me back down. He then used his body weight to hold me down, and he began to choke me. The choking was very hard. It was really bad. I kicked. In every fibre, I felt I was being beaten by a man.”She finally freed herself and got back on her feet. “I was crying and in shock,” she says. She recalls shouting, “Are you crazy?” To her astonishment, Schneiderman accused her of scratching him. At one point—she can’t remember if it was at this moment or in a later conversation—he told her, “You know, hitting an officer of the law is a felony.”After the incident, Manning Barish left the apartment, telling him that she would never come back. “I want to make it absolutely clear,” she says. “This was under no circumstances a sex game gone wrong. This did not happen while we were having sex. I was fully dressed and remained that way. It was completely unexpected and shocking. I did not consent to physical assault.”In the following days, Manning Barish confided to three close female friends that Schneiderman had hit her. All of them have confirmed this to The New Yorker. “She was distraught,” one of the friends, a high-profile media figure, says. “She was very, very upset. This wasn’t a gentle smack. He clocked her ear. I was shocked.” She notes, “Michelle had mentioned that he drank a lot, and that he changed under the influence of alcohol, but I’d never anticipated that he would be violent.” The friend describes Manning Barish as having seemed “sad” and “torn,” because “she’d really wanted the relationship to work.”The novelist Salman Rushdie, who dated Manning Barish before Schneiderman did, and who has been her close friend for nearly fifteen years, says that she confided in him as well. “She called me and told me he had hit her,” Rushdie recalls. “She was obviously very upset. I was horrified.” In his view, Schneiderman’s behavior does not fall into the kind of gray area that should remain private. “It was clear to me that it crossed a line,” he says. Rushdie, who describes Manning Barish as “a very truthful person, in my experience,” advised her to stay away from Schneiderman.But Manning Barish went back to him, a decision that she regrets. After the attack, she says, Schneiderman “called and called” her. A few days later, on a weekday afternoon, his security detail drove him to her apartment, and he showed up at her door with an armload of flowers and a case of wine. She found the wine surprising, given the fact that alcohol had fuelled his violent behavior. She recalls saying over and over, “You hit me! You hurt me! You should never hit a woman!” But he didn’t want to talk about having hit her. “The hitting was not an issue for him,” she says. Before long, they reconciled.Manning Barish says that her ear bothered her for months. It often felt painful and clogged, and she kept hearing odd gurgling sounds. Once, blood trickled out, reaching her collarbone. Eventually, Manning Barish sought medical help from Dr. Gwen Korovin, an ear, nose, and throat specialist. Manning Barish shared her medical records with The New Yorker. They confirm that, on September 13, 2014, Korovin found and removed “dried bloody crust” from Manning Barish’s ear. Manning Barish thought that the slap might have caused the injury, but when Korovin asked her what had happened she said that she might have injured herself with a Q-tip. “I was protecting Eric,” Manning Barish says. “And I was ashamed. For victims, shame plays a huge role in most of these stories. I want people to know that.” Korovin was asked by The New Yorker if the injury could have been caused by a slap. “Yes, it could be consistent with a slap,” she said. “You could perforate an eardrum in a lot of ways, with a Q-tip or with a slap.”Manning Barish and Schneiderman were together, off and on, for nearly two years. She says that when they had sex he often slapped her across the face without her consent, and that she felt “emotionally battered” by cruel remarks that he made. She says that he criticized how she looked and dressed, and “controlled what I ate.” Manning Barish, who is five feet seven, lost thirty pounds, falling to a hundred and three. In a photograph from the period, she looks emaciated; her hair, she recalls, started to fall out. Nevertheless, he squeezed her legs and called them “chubby.”Manning Barish says that Schneiderman pressed her to consume huge amounts of alcohol. She recalls, “I would come over for dinner. An already half-empty bottle of red wine would be on the counter. He had had a head start. ‘Very stressful day,’ he would say.” Sometimes, if she didn’t drink quickly enough, she says, he would “come to me like a baby who wouldn’t eat its food, and hold the glass to my lips while holding my face, and sweetly but forcefully, like a parent, say, ‘Come on, Mimi, drink, drink, drink,’ and essentially force me—at times actually spilling it down my chin and onto my chest.” Schneiderman, she recalls, “would almost always drink two bottles of wine in a night, then bring a bottle of Scotch into the bedroom. He would get absolutely plastered five nights out of seven.” On one occasion, she recalls, “he literally fell on his face in my kitchen, straight down, like a tree falling.” Another evening, he smashed his leg against an open drawer, cutting it so badly that “there was blood all over the place.” She bandaged it, but the next day she went to his office to change the dressing, because the bleeding hadn’t stopped.Manning Barish says that Schneiderman also took prescription tranquillizers, and often asked her to refill a prescription that she had for Xanax, so that he could reserve “about half” the pills for himself. (Schneiderman’s spokesperson said that he has “never commandeered anyone’s medications.”) Sometimes in bed, she recalls, he would be “shaking me and grabbing my face” while demanding that she repeat such things as “I’m a little whore.” She says that he also told her, “If you ever left me, I’d kill you.”Evan Stark, a forensic social worker and an emeritus professor at Rutgers, is the author of a landmark book, “Coercive Control,” in which he argues that domestic abuse is just as often psychological as it is physical. Abusive men, he writes, often “terrorize” and “control” their partners by demeaning them, particularly about the traits or accomplishments of which they are proudest. Manning Barish says that Schneiderman often mocked her political activism. When she told him of her plan to attend an anti-gun demonstration with various political figures and a group of parents from Sandy Hook Elementary School, he dismissed the effort, calling the demonstrators “losers.” He added, “Go ahead, if it makes you feel better to do your little political things.” When she was using her computer, he’d sometimes say, “Oh, look at little Mimi. So cute—she’s working!” He told Manning Barish that, because she had childcare, she wasn’t “a real single mother.”Manning Barish broke up with Schneiderman a second time, and then got back together with him. He’d been talking about marrying her, she says, and she somehow convinced herself that the real problem between them was her fear of commitment. In January, 2015, she ended the relationship a third time, feeling degraded. After that, they got together romantically a few more times, but since 2016 she has been in touch with him only sporadically.Since the #MeToo movement began, Manning Barish has been active on social-media platforms, cheering on women who have spoken out, including those whose accusations prompted the resignation of the Minnesota senator Al Franken , a widely admired Democrat. Once, she made an oblique reference to Schneiderman on social media, in connection with a political issue. He called her and, in a tone that she describes as “nasty,” said, “Don’t ever write about me. You don’t want to do that.” Manning Barish says that she took his remarks as a threat, just as she took seriously a comment that he’d once made after she objected to him “yanking” her across a street. She recalls saying to him, “Jaywalking is against the law,” and him responding, “I am the law.” Manning Barish says, “If there is a sentence that sums him up, it’s that.”Schneiderman was elected to the New York State Senate in 1998, and served for twelve years. He wrote many laws, including one that created specific penalties for strangulation. He introduced the bill in 2010, after chairing a committee that investigated domestic-violence charges against the former state senator Hiram Monserrate, a Democrat, who was expelled from the legislature after having been convicted of assaulting his girlfriend. During the hearings, the legislators learned that New York State imposed no specific criminal penalty for choking, even though it is a common prelude to domestic-violence homicides. Not only did Schneiderman’s bill make life-threatening strangulation a grave crime; it also criminalized less serious cases involving “an intent to impede breathing” as misdemeanors punishable by up to a year in prison. “I’m just sorry it took us so long in New York State to do this,” Schneiderman declared at the time. “I think this will save a lot of lives.”Jennifer Friedman, a legal expert on domestic violence, says that she cannot square Schneiderman’s public and private behavior. Anyone knowledgeable about intimate-partner violence, she says, knows that choking is “a known lethality indicator.” She adds, “I cannot fathom that someone who drafted the legislation on strangulation is unfamiliar with such concepts.” She also says, “A slap is not just a slap—it reverberates through the rest of the relationship, making her afraid of setting him off.” She adds, “People aren’t usually prosecuted for it, but, in the state of New York, slapping is assault when it results in pain or physical injury.”In the summer of 2016, the attorney general may have crossed this line again. He went to a party in the Hamptons, where he drank heavily, and invited another guest—a woman he’d known for some time—to join him at an after-party. An accomplished Ivy League-educated lawyer with government experience, she had worked closely with his office in the past, and supported him politically. She says that she agreed to let a man in Schneiderman’s security detail drive them to the next destination. But, when they arrived at the house, there was no party; it was where Schneiderman was staying. The security officer left the property.The lawyer and Schneiderman began making out, but he said things that repelled her. He told the woman, a divorced mother, that professional women with big jobs and children had so many decisions to make that, when it came to sex, they secretly wanted men to take charge. She recalls him saying, “Yeah, you act a certain way and look a certain way, but I know that at heart you are a dirty little slut. You want to be my whore.” He became more sexually aggressive, but she was repulsed by his talk, and pulled away from him. She says that “suddenly—at least, in my mind’s eye—he drew back, and there was a moment where I was, like, ‘What’s happening?’ ” Then, she recalls, “He slapped me across the face hard, twice,” adding, “I was stunned.”Schneiderman hit her so hard, she says, that the blow left a red handprint. “What the fuck did you just do?” she screamed, and started to sob. “I couldn’t believe it,” she recalls. “For a split second, I was scared.” She notes that, in all her years of dating, she has never been in a situation like the one with Schneiderman. “He just really smacked me,” she says.When she told him that she wanted to leave, she recalls, he started to “freak out,” saying that he’d misjudged her. “You’d really be surprised,” he claimed. “A lot of women like it. They don’t always think they like it, but then they do, and they ask for more.” She again demanded to be taken home. They got into his car, and it quickly became apparent how intoxicated he was. As he drove, weaving along back roads, she was terrified that he’d kill not just her but another driver. She says that Schneiderman “broke the law at least once that night.” (“This is untrue,” Schneiderman’s spokesperson said.)The next day, she told two friends, and sent them a photograph of the mark on her face. (Both women corroborate this.) Another photograph of the lawyer, taken later that day at a family birthday party, shows faint raised marks splayed on her cheek. One of the friends says of Schneiderman, “He seemed not to know what the word ‘consent’ means.”Given the woman’s prominence in the legal sphere, Schneiderman’s actions had exposed him to tremendous risk. Yet she took no official action against him. “Now that I know it’s part of a pattern, I think, God, I should have reported it,” she says. “But, back then, I believed that it was a one-time incident. And I thought, He’s a good attorney general, he’s doing good things. I didn’t want to jeopardize that.” She notes that he did not hit her again, after she protested. Nevertheless, she says of the assault, “I knew it was wrong,” adding, “Our top law officer, this guy with a platform for women’s rights, just smacked away so much of what I thought he stood for.”Tanya Selvaratnam is the author of “The Big Lie: Motherhood, Feminism, and the Reality of the Biological Clock,” which explores infertility issues; she is also an actor and a film producer, as well as a supporter of feminist and progressive social causes. She, too, is divorced. In 2016, she attended the Democratic National Convention, in Philadelphia, where Schneiderman introduced himself to her. She says that their first encounter felt “like kismet.” They had both gone to Harvard: she as an undergraduate and a graduate student, he as a law student. She was impressed when he expressed an interest in meditation and Buddhism. They had both studied Chinese, and, when he asked, in Mandarin, if she spoke the language, she answered, “Wo shuo keshi bu tai liuli”—“Yes, but not fluently.”They began dating, and appeared to be a happy couple. Selvaratnam all but lived in his apartment, attending political functions and dinners with his friends and donors, and brainstorming with him on speeches and projects. But, as she puts it, “it was a fairy tale that became a nightmare.” Although Schneiderman often doted on her, he demanded that she spend more and more time with him, and he began physically abusing her in bed. “The slaps started after we’d gotten to know each other,” she recalls. “It was at first as if he were testing me. Then it got stronger and harder.” Selvaratnam says, “It wasn’t consensual. This wasn’t sexual playacting. This was abusive, demeaning, threatening behavior.”When Schneiderman was violent, he often made sexual demands. “He was obsessed with having a threesome, and said it was my job to find a woman,” she says. “He said he’d have nothing to look forward to if I didn’t, and would hit me until I agreed.” (She had no intention of having a threesome.) She recalls, “Sometimes, he’d tell me to call him Master, and he’d slap me until I did.” Selvaratnam, who was born in Sri Lanka, has dark skin, and she recalls that “he started calling me his ‘brown slave’ and demanding that I repeat that I was ‘his property.’ ”The abuse escalated. Schneiderman not only slapped her across the face, often four or five times, back and forth, with his open hand; he also spat at her and choked her. “He was cutting off my ability to breathe,” she says. Eventually, she says, “we could rarely have sex without him beating me.” In her view, Schneiderman “is a misogynist and a sexual sadist.” She says that she often asked him to stop hurting her, and tried to push him away. At other times, she gave in, rationalizing that she could tolerate the violence if it happened only once a week or so during sex. But “the emotional and verbal abuse started increasing,” she says, and “the belittling and demeaning of me carried over into our nonsexual encounters.” He told her to get plastic surgery to remove scars on her torso that had resulted from an operation to remove cancerous tumors. He criticized her hair and said that she should get breast implants and buy different clothes. He mocked some of her friends as “ditzes,” and, when these women attended a birthday celebration for her, he demanded that she leave just as the cake was arriving. “I began to feel like I was in Hell,” she says.Like Manning Barish, Selvaratnam says that Schneiderman routinely drank heavily—a bottle and a half of wine, or more. He also took sedatives, she says, and pushed her to drink with him, saying, “Drink your bourbon, Turnip”—his nickname for her. In the middle of the night, he staggered through the apartment, as if in a trance. “I’ve never seen anyone that messed up,” she recalls. “It was like sleeping next to a monster.” The next morning, she says, he’d seem fine, but often berated her for not having kept him away from the alcohol. His emotional state seemed to worsen after the 2016 Presidential election. He had counted on forging an ambitious partnership with a White House led by Hillary Clinton . Instead, the Presidency had gone to Donald Trump . Earlier, Schneiderman’s office had sued Trump University for civil fraud, and Trump had countersued Schneiderman personally.On the morning of January 19, 2017, the day before Trump’s Inauguration, Schneiderman called Selvaratnam from a hospital emergency room. She recalls, “He told me that he’d been drinking the night before, and he fell down. He didn’t realize he’d cut himself, and got into bed, and when he woke up he was in a pool of blood.” Selvaratnam rushed to the hospital. Schneiderman had several stitches above his left eye; his face was puffy and bruised. He had her send his press secretary a photograph of the injury, and they agreed to cancel a public appearance. In the image, which was shared with The New Yorker, Schneiderman has a black eye and a bandage across the left side of his forehead. Schneiderman then called Cunningham, his ex-wife and political consultant, and they agreed that he and Selvaratnam should tell anyone who asked about the injury that he had fallen “while running.” (A spokesperson for Schneiderman said, “One morning, Mr. Schneiderman fell in the bathroom while completely sober, hit his head, and had to go the E.R. for stitches. Because he was embarrassed to tell his staff he fell in the bathroom, he told them he fell while running.” Cunningham, in a statement issued shortly after this story was published online, said, “I’ve known Eric for nearly thirty-five years as a husband, father, and friend. These allegations are completely inconsistent with the man I know, who has always been someone of the highest character, outstanding values, and a loving father. I find it impossible to believe these allegations are true.”)Selvaratnam understands how incomprehensible it may seem that she stayed in such an abusive relationship for more than a year. But, she says, “now I see how independent women get stuck in one.” The physical abuse, she notes, “happens quickly”: “He’s drunk, and you’re naked and at your most vulnerable. It’s so disorienting. You lose a little of who you are.” She kept telling herself that she could help him change, and tried to get him to see a therapist. At times, she blamed herself for his behavior. “I was scared what he might do if I left him,” she says. “He had said he would have to kill me if we broke up, on multiple occasions. He also told me he could have me followed and could tap my phone.”It’s unclear if Schneiderman was serious when he made such remarks, but Selvaratnam says that she felt intimidated. Jacquelyn Campbell, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing, is the author of a danger-assessment checklist that helps authorities gauge the likelihood of homicide in domestic-violence situations. She says, “It’s often true that women don’t know whether to take threats to kill seriously. But we should always take threats seriously. It’s categorized as a violent act, and you can report someone to the police for it.”Selvaratnam began to spend more time apart from Schneiderman, and last fall she ended the relationship. She’d been suffering from ringing in her ears, and sometimes had vertigo. After the breakup, she, like Manning Barish, sought medical help from an ear, nose, and throat specialist. The doctor could find no specific cause for her ailments. The writer Danzy Senna, a close friend of Selvaratnam’s, recalls, “She was thin, fragile, and shaky.” Selvaratnam confided to Senna about the abuse, and Senna was so shocked that she wrote down the details and e-mailed the account to her husband, so that there would be a dated copy of it should any harm come to her friend. Senna’s document, which she shared with The New Yorker, is dated September 16, 2017, and says, in part, “She told me that her boyfriend of a year, Eric Schneiderman, the Attorney General of New York, has been choking, beating, and threatening her for the entirety of their relationship, and that several times he threatened to have her killed if she ever tried to leave him. She said he knows that she has a lot of really damning information about him, his alcoholism, sexual deviance, and drug use, and she worries about her safety.”Senna advised Selvaratnam to retrieve her belongings from his apartment. On November 3, 2017, she did so, with another friend—Jennifer Gonnerman, a staff writer at this magazine. As they carried her things outside, they talked about the fact that Selvaratnam couldn’t possibly be the only woman who had seen this side of Schneiderman. Gonnerman asked her who else he had dated. Selvaratnam knew of one former girlfriend—not Manning Barish—and described where she had worked.The next day, Gonnerman happened to run into a male friend who had once worked with the former girlfriend. Gonnerman asked him if he’d ever known anyone who had dated Schneiderman. He said yes: a close friend of his had. Without divulging anything, Gonnerman asked, “So how did that work out?” He answered, “He used to spit on her and slap her during sex.”Gonnerman told Selvaratnam about the other victim. “She was very traumatized,” Gonnerman recalls. “On the one hand, she was relieved to learn it had happened before, but on the other it was, like, ‘Why hasn’t anyone stopped him?’ ”Selvaratnam says, “I wished someone had warned me. And I wondered, Who’s next?” She notes, “I was not planning to come forward, until I found out there was another woman. The silence of women before me meant that I’d suffered, too. I felt, I will not be able to live with myself if I hear of him doing this to another woman years or months from now.”Selvaratnam reached out to the former girlfriend, and they agreed to meet. In February, Selvaratnam recalls, they sat outside on a bench for ninety minutes, and their stories came flooding forth. Selvaratnam says that she was astounded to discover how similar their experiences had been.Selvaratnam kept notes about her exchanges with the former girlfriend, and she described them to The New Yorker. According to these notes, the former girlfriend told Selvaratnam that she had been in love with Schneiderman, but that in bed he had routinely slapped her hard across the ear and the face, as tears rolled down her cheeks. He also choked her and spat at her. Not all the abuse had taken place in a sexual context. She said that Schneiderman had once slapped her during an argument they’d had while getting dressed to go out. The blow left a handprint on her back; the next day, the spot still hurt. When the former girlfriend objected to this mistreatment, he told her that she simply wasn’t “liberated” enough. Just as Schneiderman had done with the other women, he had pushed her to drink with him and to set up a threesome, and he had belittled her work and appearance, saying in her case that she had fat legs and needed Botox.After the former girlfriend ended the relationship, she told several friends about the abuse. A number of them advised her to keep the story to herself, arguing that Schneiderman was too valuable a politician for the Democrats to lose. She described this response as heartbreaking. And when Schneiderman heard that she had turned against him, she said, he warned her that politics was a tough and personal business, and that she’d better be careful. She told Selvaratnam that she had taken this as a threat.The former girlfriend told Selvaratnam she found it “shameless” that Schneiderman was casting himself as a leading supporter of the #MeToo movement. She promised to support Selvaratnam if she spoke out, but she wasn’t sure that she could risk joining her. The former girlfriend told Selvaratnam she’d once been so afraid of Schneiderman that she’d written down an extensive account of the abuse, locked the document in a safe-deposit box, and given keys to two friends.In February, the news broke that Rob Porter, a top aide in the Trump White House, was resigning, amid allegations that he’d abused his two ex-wives. One of the women, Colbie Holderness, released a photograph of herself taken after he’d allegedly given her a black eye. The image resonated deeply among the women who had dated Schneiderman. Manning Barish recalls, “After Rob Porter, I was struggling about whether to come forward. I felt guilt and shame that I was encouraging other women to speak out but wasn’t doing the same. I was a hypocrite. I was in tears.” Her friends told her that she risked becoming known mainly for being Schneiderman’s victim, and she initially agreed to let the matter go. But, after thinking it over, she told them, “If he’s done this to more than one woman, I’m going to say something.”After Porter’s resignation, Selvaratnam felt more determined than ever to speak out about Schneiderman and the broader issue of intimate-partner violence. As this story was being reported, Manning Barish became aware that there were other victims, and decided that she had three choices: “I can lie. I can be silent, which is being complicit, and a betrayal of the other women. Or I can tell the truth.” She concluded, “I’m choosing No. 3.” Manning Barish is aware of the risks faced by women who take on powerful politicians, and isn’t relishing the prospect of taking on the attorney general. “It’s hard,” she says. “It affects your life, and not in a positive way.”Selvaratnam says that she considered filing an ethics complaint against Schneiderman, or bringing a civil suit, but the various legal options she considered were always connected to Schneiderman in some way. Meanwhile, at least eight members of Congress had resigned, or announced plans to retire, after being accused of sexual misconduct. In Missouri, the legislature called a special session to take up the impeachment of Governor Eric Greitens, who had been accused of slapping, restraining, and belittling a woman during an affair. Greitens has denied the allegations, but he is facing a felony charge stemming from the woman’s assertion that he took compromising photographs of her, in an effort to stop her from speaking out.Selvaratnam, by contrast, feels caught up in circumstances that have given her only one real choice: to go public. “It’s torturous for me to do this,” she says. “I like my life.” Of this article, she says, “I wish my name did not have to be in it,” and notes, of Schneiderman, “I know it’s going to be my word against his, because I don’t have photos of bruises, and I don’t have a police report.” Schneiderman’s accusers, she feels, are in an unusually difficult situation. As she puts it, “What do you do if your abuser is the top law-enforcement official in the state?”Jane Mayer has been a New Yorker staff writer since 1995.Read more »Ronan Farrow is a contributing writer to The New Yorker and a television anchor and investigative reporter whose work also appears on HBO.

The former first lady said stupid women voted for Donald Trump when the best candidate was clearly a woman. Thankfully, First Lady Melania Trump acted just in time to give her a nasty surprise.Michelle Obama has been raking in the cash as she goes around the country speaking at liberal events. Yesterday, she was in Los Angeles at the Womens Summit, some leftist convention where host Tracee Ellis Ross sat down with the former first lady to have a conversation.One question Ross asked Michelle was how do we make sure that young girls grow up to think beyond gender and to dream beyond limitations with how our society is today? Michelle mused for a minute and decided this would be the Trump bashing portion of the presentation.Michelle Obama said, Sorry, in light of this last election, Im concerned about us as women and how we think. And what is really going on. What is going on in our heads where we let that happen, you know?She continued, When the most qualified person running was a woman, and look what we did instead, I mean that says something about where we are. Forget everybody else. Thats what we have to explore, because if we as women are still suspicious of one another, if we still have this crazy, crazy bar for each other that we dont have for men.Michelle finished with, If we are still doing that today. If were not comfortable with the notion that a woman could be our president compared to ... what, then we have to have those conversations with ourselves as women.Hilarious, isnt she? According to Michelle, how did we [women] let that happen translates into any women who voted for Trump was stupid. Well, Michelle wasnt in charge of the women who voted for Trump, thank God, and she didnt let anything happen. Shes not that powerful.Actor James Woods thought so too, tweeting to Ms. Obama, You didnt let anything happen. The citizens of the United States, through the power of the Constitution, duly elected a President of their choice. May come as a shock to you, madam, but the People speak in America. We dont do what you let us do.You didnt let anything happen. The citizens of the United States, through the power of the Constitution, duly elected a President of their choice. May come as a shock to you, madam, but the People speak in America. We dont do what you let us do. https://t.co/LONhWHMxsE James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) May 6, 2018Female Trump supporters agreed, with Twitter user Carole posting, Dear @MichelleObama Heres OUR FOREVER FIRST LADY.Dear @MichelleObamaHeresOUR FOREVER FIRST LADY @realDonaldTrump @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @ericbolling @KamVTV @Lrihendry @grammy620 @johncardillo @CarmineZozzora pic.twitter.com/CgUktagflL Carol (@Carolde) May 6, 2018In fact, Michelle Obamas comment, bashing women who voted for Trump as stupid, might be her reality, but its not accurate at all. Its not what really happened. Smart women werent duped to vote for a gender. We did our homework and learned Hillary Clinton wasnt on our side as women, she was an opportunist who used her political position to commit crimesThe former first ladys timing was perfect in bashing women who voted for Trump. Our first lady will be front and center in the Rose Garden on Monday as she expands her role. This flies in the face of Michelle Obamas recent comments and makes her look like a fool.CNN reports, Melania Trump will announce her eagerly awaited formal platform Monday during a Rose Garden event, nearly 16 months into her tenure as first lady. While Trump has since September of last year said she plans to focus her efforts on the well-being of children, she had yet to define what exactly that means, instead delving into a broad range of topics under a wide umbrella of issues.They add, That changes with a planned Rose Garden announcement, her first speech from that historic location on the West Wing side of the White House, feet from the Oval Office.Former First Lady Michelle Obama did not announce her Lets Move campaign until February 2010, 11 months into her tenure in the position, according to CNN. So for all the naysayers who constantly complain Melania isnt doing anything, maybe its time they laid off the first lady.In fact, Melania had been more of a traditional first lady, which makes the leftist go nuts. They were silent after she pulled off the first White House State Dinner without an event planner, doing something no recent first lady has ever done.It all comes down to your values. This host at the Womens Summit said to Michelle, A girl who just dreams about her wedding is a sad thing we need to change. Ms. Obama agreed. To those at that Womens Summit, a young girl wanting a family and being a stay at home mom is obscene.That is why we love Melania Trump. She has been a successful businesswoman in her own right, but she chose to be just a mom, after she had her son Barron. Raising a family is probably the most important job in the world, and traditional values should never go out of style.Facebook CommentsShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Like this:Like Loading...Related

Mack will be arraigned on the indictment this afternoon before United States Magistrate Judge Cheryl L. Pollak. Raniere was previously arrested on a complaint and ordered detained. Raniere will be arraigned on a date to be determined. Richard P. Donoghue, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, and William F. Sweeney, Jr., Assistant Director-in-Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation, New York Field Office (FBI), announced the charges.“As alleged in the indictment, Allison Mack recruited women to join what was purported to be a female mentorship group that was, in fact, created and led by Keith Raniere,” stated United States Attorney Donoghue. “The victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants’ benefit. This Office and our law enforcement partners are committed to prosecuting predators who victimize others through sex trafficking and forced labor.” Mr. Donoghue expressed his grateful appreciation to the FBI for leading the investigation, and thanked the New York State Police, the FBI Albany Field Office, the New York State Office of the Attorney General, the New York State Department of Health and the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of New York for their assistance.“Today we announce an additional arrest, and an indictment, in a case that brought to light an inconceivable crime,” stated FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Sweeney. “As this pyramid scheme continues to unravel, we ask anyone who might have been a victim to reach out to us with information that may further our investigation.”Nxivm and The SourceAccording to court filings, during the past 20 years, Raniere established a series of purported self-help programs within his umbrella organization “Nxivm” (pronounced NEX-i-um). Nxivm is based in Albany, New York and has operated centers in the United States, Mexico, Canada and South America. Nxivm maintains features of a pyramid scheme, as its courses cost thousands of dollars each and participants (“Nxians”) are encouraged to pay for additional classes and to recruit others to take classes in order to rise within the ranks of Nxivm. A number of Nxians were residents of the Eastern District of New York when they were recruited, and Nxivm has held promotional recruiting events in Brooklyn. Mack is credited in publicly available materials with co-creating a Nxivm program, called The Source, which recruited actors. As detailed in court filings, in 2015, Raniere created a secret society within Nxivm called “DOS,” an acronym that stands for a Latin phrase that loosely translates to “Lord/Master of the Obedient Female Companions,” or “The Vow.” DOS operated with levels of women “slaves” headed by “masters.” Slaves were expected to recruit slaves of their own (thus becoming masters themselves), who in turn owed service not only to their own masters but also to masters above them in the DOS pyramid. Raniere stood alone at the top of the pyramid. Other than Raniere, all members of DOS were women. Mack is one of the women in the first level of the pyramid immediately below Raniere. Mack and other DOS masters recruited DOS slaves by telling them that they were joining a women-only organization that would empower them and eradicate purported weaknesses that the Nxivm curriculum taught were common in women. Mack and other DOS masters concealed Raniere’s status at the top of the pyramid from new recruits. As a pre-condition to joining DOS, women were required to provide “collateral,” which included highly damaging information about friends and family members, nude photographs and/or rights to the recruit’s assets. DOS slaves were told that their collateral could be released for any number of reasons, including telling anyone about DOS’s existence or leaving DOS. Many DOS slaves were branded on their pelvic areas using a cauterizing pen with a symbol which, unbeknownst to them, incorporated Raniere’s initials. During the branding ceremonies, slaves were required to be fully naked, and a master would order one slave to film the branding while the others restrained the slave being branded. According to court filings, Mack directly or implicitly required her slaves, including Jane Does 1 and 2, as identified in the Indictment, to engage in sexual activity with Raniere. In exchange for this, Mack received financial and other benefits from Raniere. Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 believed that if they did not participate in those activities with Raniere, their collateral would be released. The charges in the indictment are merely allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.If convicted of the crimes charged, Raniere and Mack each face mandatory minimum sentences of 15 years’ imprisonment, and up to life imprisonment. The government’s case is being handled by the Office’s Organized Crime and Gangs Section. Assistant United States Attorneys Moira Kim Penza and Tanya Hajjar are in charge of the prosecution. Assistant United States Attorney Karin Orenstein is in charge of the forfeiture portion of the case.The Defendants:KEITH RANIERE (also known as “Vanguard”)Age: 57

Purpose. The United States and its Constitution were founded on the principles of freedom and equal opportunity for all. To ensure that all Americans would be able to realize the benefits of those principles, especially during hard times, the Government established programs to help families with basic unmet needs. Unfortunately, many of the programs designed to help families have instead delayed economic independence, perpetuated poverty, and weakened family bonds. While bipartisan welfare reform enacted in 1996 was a step toward eliminating the economic stagnation and social harm that can result from long-term Government dependence, the welfare system still traps many recipients, especially children, in poverty and is in need of further reform and modernization in order to increase self-sufficiency, well-being, and economic mobility. Sec. 2. Policy. (a) In 2017, the Federal Government spent more than $700 billion on low-income assistance. Since its inception, the welfare system has grown into a large bureaucracy that might be susceptible to measuring success by how many people are enrolled in a program rather than by how many have moved from poverty into financial independence. This is not the type of system that was envisioned when welfare programs were instituted in this country. The Federal Government's role is to clear paths to self-sufficiency, reserving public assistance programs for those who are truly in need. The Federal Government should do everything within its authority to empower individuals by providing opportunities for work, including by investing in Federal programs that are effective at moving people into the workforce and out of poverty. It must examine Federal policies and programs to ensure that they are consistent with principles that are central to the American spirit—work, free enterprise, and safeguarding human and economic resources. For those policies or programs that are not succeeding in those respects, it is our duty to either improve or eliminate them. (b) It shall be the policy of the Federal Government to reform the welfare system of the United States so that it empowers people in a manner that is consistent with applicable law and the following principles, which shall be known as the Principles of Economic Mobility: (i) Improve employment outcomes and economic independence (including by strengthening existing work requirements for work-capable people and introducing new work requirements when legally permissible); (ii) Promote strong social networks as a way of sustainably escaping poverty (including through work and marriage); (iii) Address the challenges of populations that may particularly struggle to find and maintain employment (including single parents, formerly incarcerated individuals, the homeless, substance abusers, individuals with disabilities, and disconnected youth);Start Printed Page 15942 (iv) Balance flexibility and accountability both to ensure that State, local, and tribal governments, and other institutions, may tailor their public assistance programs to the unique needs of their communities and to ensure that welfare services and administering agencies can be held accountable for achieving outcomes (including by designing and tracking measures that assess whether programs help people escape poverty); (v) Reduce the size of bureaucracy and streamline services to promote the effective use of resources; (vi) Reserve benefits for people with low incomes and limited assets; (vii) Reduce wasteful spending by consolidating or eliminating Federal programs that are duplicative or ineffective; (viii) Create a system by which the Federal Government remains updated on State, local, and tribal successes and failures, and facilitates access to that information so that other States and localities can benefit from it; and (ix) Empower the private sector, as well as local communities, to develop and apply locally based solutions to poverty. (c) As part of our pledge to increase opportunities for those in need, the Federal Government must first enforce work requirements that are required by law. It must also strengthen requirements that promote obtaining and maintaining employment in order to move people to independence. To support this focus on employment, the Federal Government should: (i) review current federally funded workforce development programs.

Review of Regulations and Guidance Documents. (a) The Secretaries of the Treasury, Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Education (Secretaries) shall: (i) review all regulations and guidance documents of their respective agencies relating to waivers, exemptions, or exceptions for public assistance program eligibility requirements to determine whether such documents are, to the extent permitted by law, consistent with the principles outlined in this order; (ii) review any public assistance programs of their respective agencies that do not currently require work for receipt of benefits or services, and determine whether enforcement of a work requirement would be consistent with Federal law and the principles outlined in this order; (iii) review any public assistance programs of their respective agencies that do currently require work for receipt of benefits or services, and determine whether the enforcement of such work requirements is consistent with Federal law and the principles outlined in this order; (iv) within 90 days of the date of this order, and based on the reviews required by this section, submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy a list of recommended regulatory and policy changes and other actions to accomplish the principles outlined in this order; and (v) not later than 90 days after submission of the recommendations required by section 3(a)(iv) of this order, and in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, take steps to implement the recommended administrative actions. (b) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretaries shall each submit a report to the President, through the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, that: (i) states how their respective agencies are complying with 8 U.S.C. 1611(a), which provides that an alien who is not a “qualified alien” as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1641 is, subject to certain statutorily defined exceptions, not eligible for any Federal public benefit as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1611(c); (ii) provides a list of Federal benefit programs that their respective agencies administer that are restricted pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1611; and (iii) provides a list of Federal benefit programs that their respective agencies administer that are not restricted pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1611.

THE WHITE HOUSE, April 10, 2018. Filed 4-12-18; 8:45 am] [FR Doc. Section 1. Purpose. The United States and its Constitution were founded on the principles of freedom and equal opportunity for all. To ensure that all Americans would be able to realize the benefits of those principles, especially during hard times, the Government established programs to help families with basic unmet needs. Unfortunately, many of the programs designed to help families have instead delayed economic independence, perpetuated poverty, and weakened family bonds. While bipartisan welfare reform enacted in 1996 was a step toward eliminating the economic stagnation and social harm that can result from long-term Government dependence, the welfare system still traps many recipients, especially children, in poverty and is in need of further reform and modernization in order to increase self-sufficiency, well-being, and economic mobility. Sec. 2. Policy. (a) In 2017, the Federal Government spent more than $700 billion on low-income assistance. Since its inception, the welfare system has grown into a large bureaucracy that might be susceptible to measuring success by how many people are enrolled in a program rather than by how many have moved from poverty into financial independence. This is not the type of system that was envisioned when welfare programs were instituted in this country. The Federal Government's role is to clear paths to self-sufficiency, reserving public assistance programs for those who are truly in need. The Federal Government should do everything within its authority to empower individuals by providing opportunities for work, including by investing in Federal programs that are effective at moving people into the workforce and out of poverty. It must examine Federal policies and programs to ensure that they are consistent with principles that are central to the American spirit—work, free enterprise, and safeguarding human and economic resources. For those policies or programs that are not succeeding in those respects, it is our duty to either improve or eliminate them. (ix) Empower the private sector, as well as local communities, to develop and apply locally based solutions to poverty. (c) As part of our pledge to increase opportunities for those in need, the Federal Government must first enforce work requirements that are required by law. It must also strengthen requirements that promote obtaining and maintaining employment in order to move people to independence. (i) review current federally funded workforce development programs.

(v) not later than 90 days after submission of the recommendations required by section 3(a)(iv) of this order, and in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, take steps to implement the recommended administrative actions. (i) states how their respective agencies are complying with 8 U.S.C. 1611(a), which provides that an alien who is not a “qualified alien” as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1641 is, subject to certain statutorily defined exceptions, not eligible for any Federal public benefit as defined by 8 U.S.C.

She’s never denied eating well and working out religiously as the answer to a strong and sculpted body. She puts her star power behind brands that promote vitamin-infused water and no-gimmicks natural skin care, like Aveeno. She’s not quoted saying bad things about people, especially people she once loved. She’s often photographed smiling and laughing with her husband Justin Theroux or her friends from Friends . She stands up for herself , but only when she’s pushed to the edge.Perhaps most remarkable is that in a world that measures success by one’s Instagram following, Aniston, 48, who will soon return to primetime TV with friend Reese Witherspoon, has chosen to opt out of social media completely, favoring early dinners on Sundays with family, and high-intensity, sweat-drenching workouts instead. “[Social media] is such a drag,” she says. Below, a window into why Jennifer Aniston is the poster woman for wellness.Where are you right now?I’m in La La Land, which is home for me. New York is home in my heart, though. . . . What do you wanna know?So much! First, you have a new TV show in the works that you’re costarring in and coproducing with Reese Witherspoon. Is TV the best gig in Hollywood right now and if so, why?Absolutely! I love that I go to a set every day and do what I do, but I also love that I get to come home. And you’re usually not shooting a movie [or TV show] 12 months out of the year, so you get your time. It’s nice to be able to dip in, get your creative juices flowing, and then have your weekends. Any hardworking job that demands a lot of your time, whether you’re running a corporation or you’re an actor or a mom full-time, 24-7, it’s all about trying to find the balance and the time to refuel and recharge. We have so many screens: TVs, computers, phones. . . I worry we’re filling the days up with too much and it’s hard to focus on ourselves.Is that why you’re not on social media? One less screen?Sanity! Honestly, when I look around and see people constantly on their phones, I feel like we’re missing so much. And it’s something we created. I equate it to the tobacco industry; it’s hard enough being a kid growing up and becoming who you are and finding yourself but now you have social media and you’ve added this extra pressure of seeing if someone likes or doesn’t like something you did. We’re creating these man-made challenges and it’s a such a drag.What’s your ideal weekend?Dinner with friends. And Sundays, if it’s warm, we’ll go down by the pool and the kids will come over and everybody plays and we make lunch and we roll into an early Sunday supper. We relax and hike and usually there is a workout class that happens.What type of workouts are you hip to right now?I go in and out of [certain exercises]. I do The Class by Taryn Toomey , and I’m back in the gym with my trainer, throwing heavy boulders around and pushing medicine balls and wiggling and shaking that big rope thing— —Battle Ropes.Yes! They’re hard! But it’s fun. I started doing that when I was filming We’re the Millers and I really liked it. It kicks your butt, though, so I dip in and out of that throughout the year. And then I do 45 mins of intervals on my elliptical. I raise the incline, run for two mins, walk for one, run for two. . . and I do it for 20 minutes straight until I’m just drenched.Let’s talk about your beauty routine because, unlike most people in Hollywood, yours has pretty much stayed the same. And of course, your bronde hair color is back in style.Bronde?! That’s what they’re calling it? That’s so funny. I’m a creature of habit. A weird creature of habit. I don’t fix what’s not broken and I don’t care what people think and I don’t care if people want me to change my hair. I like Californian blonde highlights. It’s just cozy and it makes me feel better. And every time I tried other ones—that bob—I just go, Why did I do that? I’ve got very wavy hair so it creates a challenge when styling but when its long, I can go wavy or natural or straight and it will sort of just behave. I don’t know, I like what I like. It’s sort of comforting—the consistence.Friends is still on everybody’s mind, and in everybody’s Netflix queue. . .Isn’t that funny?! It’s a weird resurgence, it’s like you’re frozen in time. Girls come up to me thinking that I’m still on the show! I’m so proud that it could have a second wind and still feel relatable, though.Relatable—and on trend. Someone recently called you the OG of #FreeTheNipple because of how often Rachel’s nipples showed through her outfits.Yeah, I don’t know what to say about that! It’s just one of those things, I guess. I wear a bra, I don’t know what to tell ya! And I don’t know why we’re supposed to be ashamed of them—it’s just the way my breasts are! But hey, OG, I’m not going to complain!You once wrote an op-ed about getting harassed by paparazzi and baby-shamed by tabloids. . . . Do you think it’s gotten any better since you hit publish last July?I don’t think it’s getting much better. I think the problem is the tabloids and the gossip columns taking the human body and putting it in a category. They’re either fat-shaming, or body-shaming, or childless-shaming. It’s a weird obsession that people have and I don’t understand exactly why they need to take people who are out there to entertain you, and rip them apart and bully them? Why are we teaching young women this? It’s incredibly damaging. I was finally like, This has just got to stop! I couldn’t hear this narrative anymore about being pregnant or not pregnant; you have no idea what is going on personally in our lives and why that is or is not happening and it feels. . . In my own brain, I’ve shifted my perspective, so who gives a shit! If you’re going to walk out and have your nipples showing, or your belly is a little bloated, or you’re not at the weight you want to be—you are perfect no matter what you are and no matter where you are and who cares! You have to tune out the noise, which is fine by me, because I just know that I’m happy and healthy and doing everything I can to be good in the world and to the people I work with. But, it’s hard. It’s something that people are addicted to: Salacious stories. Maybe [gossip magazines] will be dead one day. Who ever thought Donald Trump would be the President of the United States? I didn’t. I can’t predict squat anymore.

https://www.factcheck.org/2018/04/muslim-nurses-not-exempt-from-hand-washing/	Muslim Nurses Not Exempt From Hand Washing	false	['International', 'anti-Muslim', 'false stories']	https://web.archive.org/	https://web.archive.org/web/20100413221537/http://bnp.org.uk/2010/04/islamic-colonisation-of-britain-continues-nhs-relaxes-hygiene-measure-to-accommodate-muslim-staff-but-bans-crucifix/	2018/04/20	 April 11, 2010 - By BNP News The National Health Service has amended its hygiene rules to allow Muslim staff not to wash before attending to patients — in the same week when it was ruled that a British nurse’s crucifix could not be worn at work. The open display of anti-British bias will now put patients in hospitals at even greater risk of infection by the “superbug” epidemic which has directly paralleled the increasing numbers of ethnic NHS staff. According to an announcement by the Department of Health (DoH), female Muslim staff will now be exempt from the rule that all personnel be scrubbed and bare below the elbow. Long sleeves have been identified as one of the leading causes for the spread of bacteria responsible for the superbugs. In addition, the DoH also announced that Sikh employees could wear bangles “as long as they can be pushed up the arm during direct patient care.”At the same time, British nurse Shirley Chaplin was ordered in an employment tribunal called to adjudicate on a discrimination battle with Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital Trust, to stop wearing a crucifix because it “might carry bacteria” and could “scratch patients.”The ruling discarded evidence showing that Mrs Chaplin, 53, had worn the crucifix around her neck since she was 16 and there had never been any evidence that it had ever harmed a single patient in any way. “I don’t believe my cross is a danger, so this is double standards. What can you say? It seems that life is stacked up against Christians these days,” Mrs Chaplin was quoted as saying in a newspaper. The lifting of the sleeve ban is a direct result of agitation from the Muslim community that female NHS workers should dress modestly in terms of Koranic teaching and that this included not baring their arms in mixed company. The multiculturalist ideology promoted by decades of Tory and Labour rule has led to these demands, and the measure to prevent the spread of disease will now only be applied to non-Muslim staff. The NHS is proposing an utterly pathetic alternative which consists of “disposable sleeves” for Muslim staff. This scheme was dismissed by Derek Butler, chairman of MRSA Action UK, a campaign group headed by respected microbiologist Professor Hugh Pennington. “My worry is that by allowing some medics to use disposable sleeves you compromise patient safety because unless you change the sleeves between treating each patient, you spread bacteria. Scrubbing bare arms is far more effective,” Mr Butler was quoted as saying. “I’ve seen doctors and nurses fail to change their gloves, and I’ve no doubt this will see exactly the same thing happening. These sleeves are just another risk, and you cannot take risks with patient safety.”Once again, the interests of British people are put last before the demands of the increasingly bold Islamic colonisers. The British National Party is the only party to demand that the NHS be completely revamped to ensure that it is staffed primarily by British people and that First World standards are enforced and maintained. A BNP government will ensure that sufficient funding is given to the NHS to recruit and train British people for work at livable wages in this vital sector. The extra money for this process will be drawn away from the £9 billion per year foreign aid budget, the £70 billion illegal foreign wars budget and the £60 billion per year EU membership fee. In addition, a BNP government would invest heavily in training up our own people to fulfil important roles in the NHS, and not rely on stealing staff from Third World countries. Digg this!

The National Health Service has amended its hygiene rules to allow Muslim staff not to wash before attending to patients — in the same week when it was ruled that a British nurse’s crucifix could not be worn at work. The open display of anti-British bias will now put patients in hospitals at even greater risk of infection by the “superbug” epidemic which has directly paralleled the increasing numbers of ethnic NHS staff. According to an announcement by the Department of Health (DoH), female Muslim staff will now be exempt from the rule that all personnel be scrubbed and bare below the elbow. Long sleeves have been identified as one of the leading causes for the spread of bacteria responsible for the superbugs. The ruling discarded evidence showing that Mrs Chaplin, 53, had worn the crucifix around her neck since she was 16 and there had never been any evidence that it had ever harmed a single patient in any way. “I don’t believe my cross is a danger, so this is double standards. What can you say? It seems that life is stacked up against Christians these days,” Mrs Chaplin was quoted as saying in a newspaper. The lifting of the sleeve ban is a direct result of agitation from the Muslim community that female NHS workers should dress modestly in terms of Koranic teaching and that this included not baring their arms in mixed company. The multiculturalist ideology promoted by decades of Tory and Labour rule has led to these demands, and the measure to prevent the spread of disease will now only be applied to non-Muslim staff. The NHS is proposing an utterly pathetic alternative which consists of “disposable sleeves” for Muslim staff. This scheme was dismissed by Derek Butler, chairman of MRSA Action UK, a campaign group headed by respected microbiologist Professor Hugh Pennington. “My worry is that by allowing some medics to use disposable sleeves you compromise patient safety because unless you change the sleeves between treating each patient, you spread bacteria. Scrubbing bare arms is far more effective,” Mr Butler was quoted as saying. “I’ve seen doctors and nurses fail to change their gloves, and I’ve no doubt this will see exactly the same thing happening. Once again, the interests of British people are put last before the demands of the increasingly bold Islamic colonisers. The British National Party is the only party to demand that the NHS be completely revamped to ensure that it is staffed primarily by British people and that First World standards are enforced and maintained. A BNP government will ensure that sufficient funding is given to the NHS to recruit and train British people for work at livable wages in this vital sector. The extra money for this process will be drawn away from the £9 billion per year foreign aid budget, the £70 billion illegal foreign wars budget and the £60 billion per year EU membership fee. In addition, a BNP government would invest heavily in training up our own people to fulfil important roles in the NHS, and not rely on stealing staff from Third World countries.

The leftist offensive is most obvious on our nation’s campuses, where the Freedom Center protects students from indoctrination and intimidation and works to give conservative students a place in the marketplace of ideas from which they are otherwise excluded. Combining forceful analysis and bold activism, the Freedom Center provides strong insight into today’s most pressing issue on its family of websites and in the activist campaigns it wages on campus, in the news media, and in national politics throughout the year.David Horowitz began the Center for the Study of Popular Culture in 1988 to establish a conservative presence in Hollywood and show how popular culture had become a political battleground. Over the next 18 years, CSPC attracted 50,000 contributing supporters and established programs such as The Wednesday Morning Club , the Individual Rights Foundation , and Students for Academic Freedom .FrontPage Magazine , the Center’s online journal of news and political commentary has 1.5 million visitors and over 870,000 unique visitors a month (65 million hits) and is linked to over 2000 other websites. The magazine’s coverage of and commentary about events has been greatly augmented over the last two years by the presence of four Shillman Fellows in Journalism underwritten by board member Dr. Robert Shillman. FrontPage has recently added a blog called “The Point,” run by Shillman Fellow Daniel Greenfield, which has tripled web traffic.DiscoverTheNetworks.com , launched in 2005, is the largest publicly accessible database defining the chief groups and individuals of the Left and their organizational interlocks. It is a full service encyclopedia of the left providing an intellectual diagram of its institutional power in American culture and politics. DTN has had more than 8 million visitors so far this year and is a key resource for students, scholars and members of the media.Since 2003, the Center has promoted an Academic Bill of Rights to support students’ academic freedom, and free the American university from political indoctrination and renew its commitment to true intellectual diversity. This campaign has had a permanent impact on American higher education.In 2007, the Center undertook an unprecedented national campaign to create a national “Islamo-Fascism Awareness Week.” Speeches, panels, and informational films were presented on 106 college campuses, along with “sit-ins” to protest the oppression of women in Islam. It was the largest conservative college student demonstration in American history and was a topic of discussion on 700,000 websites, in the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Pakistani Star Tribune, the Iran News Agency, in college papers across the country and on half a dozen national TV shows reaching an audience in the millions.The Center held four other Islamo-Fascism Awareness Weeks in 2008-2009 and has had at least one major campaign on campuses across the country since. The subjects have included the Muslim Students Association’s ties to the Muslim Brotherhood; “Wall of Lies” (a rejoinder to pro Palestinians groups’ slander of Israel); and a counter campaign against the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement. Freedom Center Students , an online hub for conservative students to receive support in the way of intellectual ammunition, access to speakers, and connect with fellow students fighting the battle for freedom at other campuses.In 2006, the Center’s Board of Directors decided to change the name of the organization to the David Horowitz Freedom Center and should adopt the following formal mission statement: “The Defense of Free Societies.” The Center is currently supported by over 90,000 Americans.The Freedom Center now includes several other programs, Jihad Watch , The Israel Security Project, and TruthRevolt. Jihad Watch, run by author Robert Spencer, is a watch dog site that traces the efforts of Islamic radicals in their terror campaign abroad and their efforts at home to infiltrate and subvert Western institutions and civic life and is the most popular website of its kind.

He's on pace to collect $5,295 in ""M.A.G.A. checks"" before the year is over.Commercial real estate developer Fredrick M. is taking advantage too.

Checks"", ""very reliable and repeatable.""Nasdaq.com claims...""M.A.G.A Checks"" will soar in 2018.And to be clear, because this is not a government program or sponsored by the government like Social Security or Medicare are, your payouts are virtually unlimited depending on your investment...In fact, in any given month you could receive multiple checks thanks to this investment opportunity.For instance, there's a $66 million M.A.G.A check payout estimated for June 8th. Around June 15th,there's another massive payout of $57 million... And around June 30th, an astonishing $400 million will be sent to thousands of Americans. In July, the payouts keep coming and they're even bigger...$25 million is estimated to be sent out around July 15th. Over $303 millionaround July 16th. $105 million in M.A.G.A checks will go out around July 27th. And around July 31st, the amount of money up for grabs will be over $325 million.Imagine what your life would be like if you could get checks deposited directly into your account, over and over again.In fact, I've already shown dozens of ordinary people across America how to begin collecting ""M.A.G.A. checks"" with amazing results...Folks like...Hank C. who told us he should receive $9,456 in 2018.Bob A. used to run a restoration company with his wife but retired two years ago.So far, they're on pace to collect around $2,400 in M.A.G.A. checks and are using the income to help grow their nest egg.Jacksonville, Florida resident John B. said he's collecting $15,129 and is very satisfied.But you'll want to set yourself up now, so you can start collecting your checks right away.Folks like Randy T. who has collected $9,306 in his first year.Reed N., also started collecting his own checks.

It's simple to get started.You see, over the past few weeks, my inbox has been overflowing with stories of dozens of people who've discovered this situation.The best part is, ANYONE with a bit of investment capital can do it.Just look at some of the notes I've received:""I have helped my children with house down payments and have been able to purchase several new vehicles without financing.""– Jim K.""[This] provides me a comfortable living. I only use about half [of my payments] to support my lifestyle and travel. The remaining balance I invest."" – Dan D.And Otto S. – who has been a farmer for 60 years – expects to collect over $1,891 this year.Here's what he told me:""I'm 88, going on 89... income is an important issue to me – not rich, not poor... but at my age income is important.""I've created this presentation for two reasons...First, now is a great time to start collecting these checks.And second, whether you're in your 20s or well into retirement, by collecting these M.A.G.A. checks you'll be able to live life on your own terms, knowing that the checks will keep rolling in like clockwork depending on the size of your investment.But before I go any further...First, Let Me Introduce MyselfHi. My name is Dr. Steve Sjuggerud.I've had just about every job on Wall Street. I've been a stockbroker, Vice President of a global mutual fund at the age of 24, and President of a 250,000-reader program called Investment U.I've been asked to appear on numerous TV stations like Fox News and Bloomberg to help their viewers make sense of the financial world and offer new ways to grow and protect their wealth.I've helped ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, and have given closed-door presentations to billionaires and some of the most famous investors on the planet.But my true passion is research... finding new and undiscovered opportunities to help ordinary Americans... Which is why about two decades ago, I left the Wall Street world behind.Don't get me wrong. I learned a lot... and I established a lot of important connections.But it didn't take long to find out my main job there wasn't to help my clients make money. It was to get as many new clients as possible and as much money as possible under management, to collect fees.That's not what I set out to do...Quitting the Wall Street side of finance was easily the best decision I've ever made.Now I get to spend my time doing what I love most... finding new and profitable investment ideas for regular folks... like the M.A.G.A. checks I've been describing in this presentation.Through my years of experience, I can tell you one thing with 100% conviction: Sufficient income is the #1 secret to a successful retirement.You must earn consistent income.In fact, this is one of the main reasons people love reading my work... because I routinely find new income opportunities you won't hear about from your broker or the mainstream press.For example...In 2009, I uncovered a series of Social Security ""loopholes"" that allowed retirees to increase the size of their monthly checks. It was a legal way to push the system in your favor and get paid an extra $1,100 or more per month, EVERY year.Some people even wrote in to share their results...""Based on Steve's research, I did a ""re-do"" on my Social Security last year... [I got] an increase of slightly more than $600 per month... It was a smart investment decision.""– Fred W.""The new monthly payment was $2,017... [which is] a GAIN of $495 per month!""– Bill B.""This has added $853 per month to our income without reducing [my wife's] Social Security benefits. Pretty neat!!""– Charles B.Not too long after the dotcom crash in 2001, I uncovered a little-known gov't-backed opportunity – something I called 'The Portfolio Repair Program' – that enabled investors to recoup some of the losses from the market crash – and even earn a steady amount of income...Not many Americans were aware this option was available to them. As far as I know, we were among the first to write about it.My passion for research has enabled me to uncover all sorts of new and exciting income opportunities you're not likely to hear about from a stockbroker or in the mainstream press.A few years ago, for example, I found a unique opportunity that allows you to collect tremendous royalties, every single month, simply by becoming a ""trademark"" owner of some of North America's most popular fast food chains.You simply become a part share holder of the trademarked name like McDonald's or Burger King. Then, every time one of these restaurants sells a burger, shake, or fries... you collect royalties.One of the opportunities I've recommended has paid consecutive monthly royalties since 2002! Total gains have been over 1,120% since inception.I've never seen this opportunity written about anywhere else!But what I'm most excited about right now is the income opportunity I began describing earlier in this presentation: the M.A.G.A. checks.So, why haven't you heard about these M.A.G.A. checks before?Where do these checks come from and how can you get started immediately?I'll show you...Trumps Promise to Put America FirstIn 2016, Donald Trump campaigned on the promise to ""Make America Great Again.""And when he officially took office on January 20, 2017, Trump got right down to business.Within his first year he helped pass a law that would immediately help thousands of Americans.His new law also helps a specific industry as much or more than any other. An industry he probably knows as well as anyone else in the country...The same industry that made him a billionaire...I'm talking, of course, about real estate.Now, it's widely known that Donald Trump's wealth comes from real estate.And for good reason...The U.S. real estate markets are among the most lucrative in the world.The total value of all the real estate in America is well over $35 Trillion.Real estate has helped create countless millionaires too. Probably more than any other industry in history.Did you know that 90% of the world's millionaires got there, in part, because of real estate!?That's a remarkable fact, isn't it?It's why some of America's richest people, like media mogul Ted Turner... Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos... and Microsoft founder Bill Gates are all huge real estate investors too.You see, real estate is vital to the success of the American economy.Yes, it provides housing for families.But most people don't realize that commercial real estate also creates jobs, spaces for retail, offices, storage, warehousing, and manufacturing.Agricultural real estate is essential for the production of crops and livestock... of our food supply... of our building supplies... and more.In short, real estate is the secret backbone of American wealth and ingenuity.The ultra-rich know this.Personally, I own stocks, gold, shares of private business, and more. But by far my largest holdings today and by far the biggest profits of my career have come from real estate.The thing is, tapping into this great source of wealth has often been time-consuming and expensive... essentially making many of the best real estate investments off limits to the little guy.Enter Trump, who's recent law helps revitalize an obscure government real estate program from the 1960sYou see back then, the government wanted to make sure certain companies would always have a built-in financial incentive to keep America's real estate markets strong.These are the companies that develop... manage... and own America's best commercial, residential, and agricultural real estate.So, congress proposed a plan that would allow these companies to get away with paying practically ZERO Federal income taxes.In exchange, the government required these businesses to turn over the bulk of their earnings to shareholders – that's regular folks like you and me – in the form of steady payments.But here's the thing. The government didn't heavily advertise this program, so many investors never knew it existed.After all, it was buried deep inside an obscure bill passed back in 1960.But Trump's new legislation brings this program back to the forefront of the American economy, in a major way – allowing everyday Americans to collect more and bigger paychecks from America's most lucrative real estate investments...For example, one company– based in Kansas City, Missouri – is paying over $26 million every single month to ordinary Americans right now.Another one based in Bethesda, Maryland, is sending out $70 Million every single month to ordinary folks...Imagine how your life would change by tapping into this income stream...And an institution in New York City is expected to send over $1.35 billion to a handful of citizens in 2018.The best part is, anyone in America can now be a part of these massive payouts.Folks like...Dana H., a 67-year-old retired manufacturing manager, who says he enjoys a $1,880 yearly payment from just one of these institutions.Retired Aerospace engineer, Kurt B., who has already collected over $11,000 in what we're calling ""M.A.G.A. checks.""And Kevin T., who is collecting M.A.G.A. checks worth around $4,200, like clockwork.Look...We've had a lot of great men as Presidents, but none of them have been as successful in business, or had such an intimate understanding of the real estate markets as Donald Trump...He's a billionaire because of it.So, it makes sense that he's the one to lead Americans to this opportunity.But the question is... Why haven't you heard about this opportunity before?Well... the main reason is probably because there just aren't a lot of companies that distribute these Trump-approved ""M.A.G.A. checks.""Only about 1 out of 26,000 companies in America are registered to participate.As I said, these companies must be able to produce lots of cash via real estate income... and pay it out to ordinary Americans like you and me. Not just any business is eligible to register in the program.So, how does it all work?How can you find one of these organizations and begin tapping in to these huge payouts year after year?Let me show you...CASE STUDY: M.A.G.A.-Approved San Diego Firm Pays Out MillionsMake no mistake, these special institutions send out billions of dollars in checks every year.One example is an institution based out of San Diego, CA.Even though you've probably never heard of it before, it owns some of the most valuable real estate in America and then leases it to the country's top commercial enterprises.I'm talking about huge corporations like Wal-Mart, FedEx, BJ's, Walgreens, and Home Depot, just to name a few.That's some pretty important real estate, wouldn't you agree?As a result, this firm rakes in billions of dollars in revenue every year.But here's the thing.Unlike most businesses today, this company doesn't pay a penny in income taxes to Uncle Sam...Thanks to this Trump-approved plan, a huge portion of this money – even larger than what they paid before – now goes directly into the pockets of ordinary citizens like you and me.The business behind this payout LOVES this arrangement. In fact, they're fanatical about paying out huge income checks to Americans, month after month... year after year.It even clearly states that paying out this income is their primary goal on page 4 of their most recent annual report...We have remained dedicated to our mission of providing... dependable monthly [incomes] that increase over time.Companies avoid annoying taxes... investors get huge monthly checks... and the U.S. economy gets a boost. Everybody wins.Just look at a few more of these M.A.G.A.-approved institutions paying out huge streams of income...Like this institution based in Glendale, California.It's the largest public storage provider in the U.S and is on pace to send over $1.6 billion in M.A.G.A. checks to Americans, in 2018.Another one headquartered in Chicago owns more than 1,200 hospitals and senior living centers.It's also on pace to deposit over $827 million into accounts this year...A growing firm in Boston owns over 70 million square feet of industrial properties and on pace to deliver more than $141 million to thousands of Americans before 2018 is over.One nationwide institution owns roughly 13 million acres of forest throughout the U.S. and they create construction materials needed to rebuild some of our country's aging infrastructure...They'll send around $235 million worth of M.A.G.A. checks every 3 months this year.Another institution based in Boston owns more than 150,000 cell towers which helps American businesses communicate and stay competitive every single day.And they've already started sending checks of the $1.1 billion set to go out this year.I've been conducting independent financial research for over 20 years and I can tell you with 100% conviction... this is one of the best income opportunities I've ever seen.And look, I'm not just saying this. I'm investing in real estate with my own money, too.I'm in the middle of setting up a private deal for my business partners and me that could deliver us $100,000 or more a year in real estate income.Another real estate deal I have in place pays me several thousand a month.Depending on your situation, you could use these income streams I've been telling you about to collect up to 24 checks or more every single year.Just so we're clear: there are always risks involved with investing, and you should never put more into this idea than you could afford to lose.That being said, I really believe in the potential for the low-risk, consistent income you can earn from this opportunity.But I'll be upfront with you, if you want to get in on the next payout...You need to position yourself NOW.That's because the next payout date is scheduled for the end of July. And if you want to be a part of this payout you simply must be in by the deadline.I want you to collect as many checks as possible, before the year's over.And set yourself up for a chance at lifelong income, if that's something you'd like.That's why I recently went through all 225 Trump-approved institutions and selected the very best ones.The best institutions with the biggest and safest paydays...Let me tell you a little more about them...How to Tap into the World's Greatest Income StreamI narrowed these institutions down based on 4 critical factors.FIRST, I want to make sure these institutions are being managed by the best and brightest in the industry... folks who know the real estate world as well as Donald Trump – like the backs of their hands.If you choose to get involved with one of these institutions, you need to know it's being managed in a way that will deliver you the biggest checks.One of the men running these firms, for example, has been in the real estate markets for over 20 years and successfully managed a real estate portfolio valued at $700 billion.Which leads me to the SECOND factor I look for.The institution must have a history of consistently paying lots of big checks to shareholders.These companies rake in LOTS of cash... and we only want the ones that have a history of doling out as much of this money as possible over the longest period of time.One of these firms for example has made these payouts EVERY SINGLE MONTH for the past 3 years, without skipping a beat.THIRD, I like to make sure the people who work closely with or operate these institutions ""put their money where their mouth is,"" so to speak. Inside ownership is one of the secrets to evaluating the true health of a business.And the FOURTH factor may be the most important.We want the BIGGEST and FATTEST checks.This part is key.Based on the research my team and I have done, the companies that pay out the biggest checks typically have one thing in common...They own one very specific kind of real estate asset...In fact, of the 225 institutions in the country, only a small handful actually own this asset.These companies pay out, on average, 3 TIMES more than the other M.A.G.A.-check companies...I won't tell you exactly what this asset is right here, but the important thing to know is... it's generally government-backed real estate assets.This not only makes these checks bigger, but SAFER, and more reliable, too.One of the things I love about this opportunity is that while stocks have become very expensive since the financial crisis of 2008, you can still get into incredible deals in real estate that produces tons of reliable income.In fact, real estate is my #1 favorite investment for the next decade. I think it's going to be much more lucrative, much safer, and much more reliable than anything else out there.How much income could you earn? That's completely up to you.One of the best parts of getting M.A.G.A. checks is that you decide how much you're paid.That's why I've put the full details of everything you need to know in my recent report called...M.A.G.A. Checks: How to Cash in on the White House's Multibillion-Dollar Program.In this special report, I'll tell you what I believe are the 4 most stable, reliable and cash-rich companies in the M.A.G.A. program today – ones that regularly dole out big cash payments to their shareholders.One of these institutions, for example, payed out a whopping $1.3 BILLION in M.A.G.A. checks to thousands of Americans last year.And has already sent out $348,000,000 million in 2018.It has government-backed real estate assets in California, Texas, and New York, just to name a few.The second institution – based in Maryland – sends out $70 million every single month.And there's no sign of these checks going away.This is a no brainer if you want monthly checks rolling in like clockwork.Which is probably why a hedge-fund manager – billionaire Jim Simons – decided to rely on this institution to bring in $184,354 every month.Depending on your situation you could soon see checks worth $1,200... $1,800... even $3,600, or more in some cases.It all depends on how much you're willing to put in.The third institution detailed in the report is a New York based firm.Because of its unique position, you can tap into the $301 million income stream the company paid last year, backed by $11 billion worth of real estate throughout the countries major markets.And they've already sent $67,077,800 out this year.And the fourth company might be the best opportunity yet...In short, this company is the best in class.Thanks to the experienced and nimble management team in place, this institution has been able to outperform its competition.Which is why it's prepared to send out an estimated $422 million this year.But you'll want to get your name on the list in advance if you'd like to get a cut of this massive payout.Remember: If you want to get started collecting these checks, you must act soon.The next scheduled payout date is around July 27th.Everything you need to know to take advantage of these amazing situations – and start collecting M.A.G.A. checks repeatedly – is detailed inside my new report called: M.A.G.A. Checks: How to Cash in on the White House's Multibillion Dollar Program.This report is yours free of charge when you consider a no-risk trial subscription to my monthly independent research advisory called True Wealth...Let me tell you a little about it so you can decide if it's right for you...A New Way to Build Wealth in AmericaWhat we've found after writing to literally hundreds of thousands of people who are looking to enhance their income is that most people simply don't realize there are safer and more profitable investments than ordinary stocks and bonds.I promise you this: True Wealth is like no other investment newsletter you have seen before.I guarantee that in True Wealth you will learn about unique opportunities you won't hear about anywhere else.Is True Wealth right for you? I can't say for sure, but I believe the research my team and I do is better than anything else out there, on or off Wall Street.Our track record backs this up...For example, I'm particularly proud of the investments we found after the dotcom bust, which could have made our subscribers, who decided to act on our recommendations, very nice gains while most investors were too scared to act...I told my readers about a unique type of currency investment outside the stock market. They had the chance to capture 273% gains.In 2005, I uncovered a new type of gold company most people had never heard about before, called a ""prospect generator."" These companies don't explore for or mine gold, but their share prices typically go up much higher and faster in gold bull markets.As a result, our readers had the chance to pocket massive 995% gains when the price of gold took off.And back in 2011, right after a new health bill was passed, I knew it'd mean a surge of new capital for one investment in particular. Our readers were among the first to know about it and had the opportunity to see gains as high as 420%.I know anyone can cherry-pick a few winners, but our overall track record is unmatched as far as I know over both the short and long term.For instance, since inception the average annualized return on all my True Wealth recommendations was more than doubled the return of the stock market. That's pretty significant, considering most mutual funds and hedge funds rarely even beat the market.As the head of our firm said, ""There isn't a better investor anywhere in the world than Steve Sjuggerud.""I'm extremely proud of the hard work we've done for our readers...Right now, for example, we have more than 20 recommendations in our model stock portfolio... and they've gone up an average of 26% since we recommended them.But, at the end of the day, nothing makes me happier than hearing how our research has impacted the lives of thousands of readers...Like James H. who said:""I've made over $2 million [in six months].""80-year-old retire, Robert B. sent me this note:""Dr. Steve Sjuggerud... has helped me enormously in the management of my wife's portfolio; it has quadrupled since I took it away from her advisor.""True Wealth reader, Michael M. said:""I'm up more than $400,000.""Clyde L. wrote in to share his success, too:""I have been following Steve's investments for several years... My investment was approximately $600,000 and now its well over $1,000,000... Other letters... don't hold a light to Steve's. He is very honest.""And my personal favorite...A handwritten note from a subscriber named Bill G.He went on to show me in detail how he'd used my research to make almost $1,000,000 over the past 4 years.Remember, these people once faced the same decision you face today.Now, I can't promise you'll make $1 million following my work... and I can't tell you if True Wealth is right for you. Past performance doesn't guarantee future success.But I've come up with a way for you to find out – totally risk free.Your M.A.G.A.

That is more than double the approximately $400 million it spent in 2012. The figure is an early indicator that 2016 will be the most expensive in American electoral history, considering that a total of just more than $2 billion was spent in 2012, the previous record for most expensive election.But who are Charles and David Koch and how did they make their billions? Here is a primer on the Koch brothers and their role in politics. Watch the PBS NewsHour tonight for a discussion with the Washington Post national reporter Matea Gold.Q: Who are the Koch brothers?A: Charles and David Koch , ages 78 and 74, are billionaire brothers who helped create a broad network of nonprofit groups that control hundreds of millions of dollars flowing into politics. Through their deep pockets, they are reshaping politics with an uncompromising agenda of reducing regulation, advancing libertarian ideas, promoting free-market Republican candidates and ousting Democrats. They have two other brothers, William and Frederick, who aren’t involved in the effort.Q: Where did they get their money?A: The Kochs inherited their father’s company in Kansas, and turned Wichita-based Koch Industries into the second-largest privately held company in the nation. The conglomerate makes a wide range of products including Dixie cups, chemicals, jet fuel, fertilizer, electronics, toilet paper and much more. William and Frederick cashed out in 1983 and no longer have a stake in the company.Q: How rich are Charles and David?A: With a fortune estimated at $41 billion each, Charles and David tie for fourth on Forbes’ list of the richest Americans, and tie for sixth on Forbes’ worldwide billionaires list.Q: What’s their secret?A: Charles, chairman and CEO of Koch Industries, attributes the company’s success to his business philosophy, “Market-Based Management,” which he’s trademarked. Among its components: hiring and retaining people with the right values, and giving employees a bigger voice in decision-making. The company’s growth strategy also includes reinvesting 90 percent of earnings.Q: How much money do Charles and David put into politics?A: That’s the big question. It’s unanswered because the Kochs channel lots of money into nonprofit groups that don’t have to identify their donors. The Washington Post and the Center for Responsive Politics have calculated that the donor network organized by the Kochs took in at least $407 million in the 2012 election cycle. However, not all of that money came from the Kochs themselves. David Koch’s charitable giving has included $58 million donated to nonprofits that could include groups such as Americans for Prosperity, the CATO Institute and the Heritage Foundation, according to company spokeswoman Missy Cohlmia. In addition, the two brothers’ direct political contributions to federal candidates and party committees totaled at least than $2 million over the past two decades.Q: What motivates them?A: Family patriarch Fred Koch, who built refineries in the Soviet Union in the 1930s, became convinced of the evils of communism and instilled in his sons an aversion to government intrusion. As David said of their father in a 2012 interview with The Wichita Eagle newspaper in Kansas, he “was extraordinarily fearful of our government becoming much more socialistic and domineering. … So from the time we were teenagers to the present, we’ve been very concerned and worried about our government evolving into a very controlling, socialist type of government.”Left: Brothers David Koch, left, and Charles Koch are two of the richest men in American and two of the biggest players in U.S. politics.Go Deeper

RyanApril 9, 2018In DepthLATEST UPDATE: April 9, 2018: Statement by Stephen M. RyanToday the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York executed a series of search warrants and seized the privileged communications between my client, Michael Cohen, and his clients. I have been advised by federal prosecutors that the New York action is, in part, a referral by the Office of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.The decision by the US Attorney’s Office in New York to conduct their investigation using search warrants is completely inappropriate and unnecessary. It resulted in the unnecessary seizure of protected attorney client communications between a lawyer and his clients. These government tactics are also wrong because Mr. Cohen has cooperated completely with all government entities, including providing thousands of non-privileged documents to the Congress and sitting for depositions under oath.UPDATE: Statement by Stephen M. Ryan on behalf of Michael D. CohenMr. Cohen has accepted the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence invitation to appear on October 25, 2017.The following is a paraphrased version of Mr. Ryan's statement, which was communicated live immediately following Mr. Cohen's appearance on September 19, 2017:Mr. Cohen appeared voluntarily for an interview with the Senate Select Intelligence Committee. Mr. Cohen looked forward to answering all their questions.Last week, the fact that Mr. Cohen was appearing for an interview was leaked to the press. We do not know who did this, and we did not. Accordingly, we provided a copy of the short opening statement Mr. Cohen intended to present today to the media. That statement was factual, accurate and respectful, and consistent with the information we had previously provided to the Committee. We stand by the statement.The Committee has chosen to postpone today’s voluntary interview and reschedule it for a later day. Mr. Cohen will continue to cooperate and will come back when the Committee is ready. Stephen Ryan of McDermott Will & Emery represents Michael Cohen, Esq. of NYC in any governmental inquiries regarding the ‘Russia investigations’. Mr. Cohen is cooperating with all governmental inquiries. Available Documents:

Because of the political push to make sure that guns are blamed for the problems, the Second Amendment has been under attack.That attack has caused conservatives everywhere to stand up for their rights to bear arms and protect themselves from tyranny in every form. In some cases that stand is taken in town hall-style meetings or calls and letters to representatives. And just like everything else in our lives today, much of it is done on social media.Sadly, for some social media users, this is getting them a big backlash. Not only are some accounts or posts being taken down by the private companies that own social media accounts, but the FBI is even investigating those who they consider might be a threat. While it’s certainly the FBI’s job to look into possible threats, the current political climate seems to be pointing to any proud gun owner as a possible threat. The True Pundit reports about one strong conservative voice that got a visit from his local sheriff in the wake of his social media post that went viral:“It appears Twitter and the FBI are working together — not to stop Conservatives from being harassed — but to harass Conservatives.Just ask Brenden Dilley, a recent GOP Congressional candidate in Arizona and outspoken journalist who has criticized corruption in the FBI.Dilley was sacked on Twitter days ago, losing 135,000 followers because he Tweeted and defended the Second Amendment, in addition to frequent negative critiques about the FBI in recent months.Today, the FBI came knocking.”EMERGENCYTHE FBI JUST SENT OUT THE LOCAL SHERIFF TO SEE IF I WAS A THREAT BASED ON MY 2ND AMENDMENT TWEET. https://t.co/pKr7jKChWl #FBI #2ndAmendment #TheStorm #QAnon— Brenden M Dilley (@TheRealHublife) April 3, 2018Too bad they didn’t send someone to Nicholas Cruz’s house after one of the two credible threats he made were reported to them at the FBI.— Burnt Peacock (@Burntpeacock) April 3, 2018This technique isn’t a new one. In fact, it’s something that the FBI and local law enforcement have been doing for years now. As early as 2012, CNN reported that law enforcement was beginning to use the wide world of social media to get information on possible suspects:“Police look at what information is public and sometimes create fake online identities to befriend suspects and view their private information. Authorities also can request private data directly from social networks with subpoenas or warrants, or make an emergency request for user information if they think there’s an imminent threat of danger.These techniques are slowly catching on across the country. According to a recent survey of 1,221 federal, state and local law enforcement who use social media, four out of five officials used social media to gather intelligence during investigations.Half said they checked social media at least once a week, and the majority said social media helps them solve crimes faster. The online survey was conducted by LexisNexis Risk Solutions and had a 2.8% margin of error.The survey found that Facebook is the most fruitful social network for law enforcement, followed by YouTube.Some ‘public’ information takes a bit of maneuvering to find. Someone can have their Facebook settings as private as possible, but their friends or relatives might not be as savvy, allowing police to collect information by looking at what a suspect posts on their friends’ public pages. Drug dealers have been known to post innocuous public updates that include location information so clients — and unwittingly, law enforcement — know where to find them, police said.Police even have been using Facebook as a way to help victims identify suspects.Going undercover on FacebookA more controversial approach to getting information from social networks is going undercover online — creating fake profiles to befriend suspects.‘We do have some covert accounts for targeted enforcements,’ said Cincinnati’s Gerard.Facebook, where almost 9% of accounts are believed to be fakes or duplicates, frowns on this practice, however.‘It just undermines the integrity of our whole service if we allow people to use false accounts,’ said Joe Sullivan, Facebook’s chief security officer, in an interview with CNN last month. Creating a fake profile is against Facebook’s terms of service, even for law enforcement. Sullivan said there is no context in which Facebook allows fake identities, and that it has a ‘large commitment’ to finding and disabling false accounts.While these fake accounts may violate a social network’s rules, they are not illegal. And evidence collected in this way can still hold up in court.‘In other, nondigital circumstances, these types of practices have been upheld,’ said Hanni Fakhoury, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an Internet civil-liberties organization, in an email. ‘For example, the police oftentimes pose as young girls to capture people for soliciting a minor to engage in sexual activities. Or they pose as a potential drug buyer in order to arrest individuals on drug crimes.'”The problem with social media posts being censored is one issue, but it’s a business problem because the companies are privately owned. The problem of police considering legal gun owners to be a threat, however, is a far more disturbing issue. The government will always try to overreach because it’s the nature of the beast. It’s up to their bosses (that’s the voters) to keep them in check.	
https://www.factcheck.org/2018/03/viral-nasa-story-gets-science-wrong/	Viral NASA Story Gets Science Wrong	false	['chemtrails', 'environment', 'health', 'NASA']	https://keith.seas.harvard.edu/	https://keith.seas.harvard.edu/chemtrails-conspiracy-theory	2018/03/30	We receive many emails and letters asking me about chemtrails. Many express deep concern, some are abusive and threatening. This page gives our views on the topic. Chemtrails refers to the theory that governments or other parties are engaged in a secret program to add toxic chemicals to the atmosphere from aircraft in a way that forms visible plumes in the sky, somewhat similar to contrails. Various different motivations for this alleged spraying are speculated, including sterilization, reduction of life expectancy, mind control or weather control. We have not seen any credible evidence that chemtrails exist. If we did see any evidence that governments were endangering their own citizens in the manner alleged in the chemtrails conspiracy, we would be eager to expose and stop any such activities. We work on theoretical proposals for combating global warming called solar geoengineering or albedo modification. These are technologies that might enable people to add materials to the Earth's atmosphere to reflect a bit more sunlight back to space, partially masking or reducing the climate change due to accumulated greenhouse gases. Study of solar geoengineering is in the very early stages and the topic is (rightly) a very controversial area of climate policy because if it ever were tested at large scales or implemented it could involve physical risks and would raise a range of serious socio-political and ethical issues. However, there is nothing secret about the study of albedo modification, with hundreds of publications about the topic in academic journals and hundreds of articles in mainstream media. You can find some of our work here. We are confident that there is no currently active program to actually test or implement albedo modification outdoors. We are not now involved in outdoor experimentation, though we are indeed actively developing proposals for field experiments. This experiment will proceed only if it is conducted in a fully transparent and public manner, and only if it passes a comprehensive independent safety review. The experimental plans, operations and results will be publicly available and freely usable (no patenting). Because of the apparent similarities between the proposed implementation methods for albedo modification (such as injecting reflective particles into the stratosphere), and the alleged methods for producing chemtrails, some people have linked the notion of chemtrails to the study of albedo modification. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. The claim that there is a large-scale secret program to spray materials from aircraft is extraordinary. Yet all the evidence we have seen to date has been very weak. The most common claim is simply that aircraft contrails look “different”, without any comparative analysis. This as convincing as saying that alien beings walk among in disguise as people because some people act very strangely. If there really were a large-scale program dumping material from aircraft at the scale described, there would have to be a large operating program to manufacture, load and disperse materials. If such a program existed at the scale required to explain the claimed amount of chemtrails, it would require thousands or perhaps tens of thousands of people. It would be extraordinarily hard to keep such a program secret because it would be so easy for a single individual in the program to reveal it using leaked documents, photographs or actual hardware. Moreover, if such a program was intended to cause harm to their fellow citizens—as is alleged by people who believe in the chemtrails conspiracy—then people working in the program would have very strong personal motivations to reveal it. We don’t trust that governments will always do the right thing, but we do trust the goodwill of individual who take risks to blow the whistle, exposing government misdeeds. If you believe in chemtrails, ask yourself how you can be so certain that there is indeed a grand conspiracy. Consider alternative, simple explanations. Remember that the Internet is filled with people who are completely sure about stuff that just isn’t true. Remember that while governments can keep secrets that involve only a few people they do a very bad job of keeping large-scale programs secret. The Russians, for example, knew specific details about the Manhattan project before the first nuclear weapons test, and that was a case where those involved had a clear patriotic motivation to keep the secret.If you think that aircraft contrails “look different” or are “behaving strangely” consider that regular aircraft condensation trails (contrails) are sometimes long-lasting and the way they look can change suddenly along a flight path as aircraft fly through regions with different temperature and humidity. This is well understood and has been demonstrated by ground observation and by scientific research performed by thousands of people over many decades. Of course it's possible that something else is going on, but to prove it one would need more than simple photographs of something that looks entirely consistent with normal contrails. Several people who were concerned about chemtrails came to talk with me and recorded a video of our conversation. There are a number of websites listed below that critique or debunk the chemtrail conspiracy theories.

I admit that at first I wanted Hillary to win, but with time I understood that America made a great choice with Donald Trump.”“I understand that people don’t like him – I really do. At first I didn’t either, but he became our President so what we need to do is stand behind him in times like this.”Hatred is the last thing we need nowadays, we must unite. I feel that Donald Trump is doing everything he can to improve our nation, you might just want to respect him and stay patient.”Emma Stone also stated that there is nothing wrong if you give someone a chance.”I don’t know. I think that people need to stay patient for a while and see what happens. People are too nervous these days. There is no need for that.”“Let’s give him a chance.

He is reportedly eating a great deal of fast food to calm himself down, as he does whenever he is under great stress.A royal source notes that Harry and Meghan “want to do things their own way,” despite aides advising them to hold back on the invitation. It was feared such a move would anger Trump, and would rock diplomatic ties with his country.Others felt that nothing will harm diplomatic ties more than Trump’s own behavior, so his anger over a wedding was deemed to be less of a consideration.The source told Daily Star Online ,The invitations are going out now, but Mr. and Mrs. Obama still have to respond. I am very, very sure they will attend, though.Harry and Meghan want to do things their own way. They are inviting their own friends, and not on the advice of aides.Prince Harry and President Obama have a genuine friendship that goes beyond work, with the former US president interviewed by the prince recently on BBC Radio 4’s Today program.What do YOU think?

Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Monday that President Trump’s first weeks in office have been deeply troubling, but offer no grounds for impeachment.The House minority leader was responding to recent comments from Rep. Maxine Waters, a fellow California Democrat, who said last week that her “greatest desire is to lead [Trump] right into impeachment.” Pelosi was more cautious, saying the new president has been reckless and incompetent but hasn’t done anything criminal to merit his removal by Congress.“[There] are grounds for displeasure and unease in the public about the performance of this president, who has acted in a way that is strategically incoherent, that is incompetent and that is reckless,” Pelosi told reporters in the Capitol. “And that is not grounds for impeachment. ADVERTISEMENT<!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--googletag.cmd.push(function() {googletag.display(""dfp-ad-mosad_1"");});//--><!]]>“When and if he breaks the law, that is when something like that would come up. But that’s not the subject of today.” Waters, appearing on the dais beside Pelosi, clarified her earlier comments, saying they came in response to the “questions and pleas” she’s hearing from constituents about Trump’s executive order temporarily banning immigrants and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries and his friendly relationship with the Kremlin, among other contentious issues. Any threat to Trump’s presidency has been self-inflicted, Waters said, while stipulating that Congress must step in at some point if he continues down the path of aggressive and unilateral policymaking he’s adopted in the first two weeks.“I have not called for the impeachment — yet. He’s doing it himself,” Waters said. “I think he is leading himself into that kind of position, where folks will begin to ask, ‘What are we going to do?’ And the answer’s going to be, eventually, we’ve got to do something about him. We cannot continue to have a president who’s acting in this manner. It is dangerous to the United States of America.” Trump has set a dizzying pace in his first weeks in office, issuing a string of executive orders designed to eliminate many of the legislative achievements of President Obama and the Democrats, including ObamaCare and the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Last week, a federal judge said Trump had overstepped when he put a blanket travel ban on refugees and most travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries. Pelosi said she’d been optimistic that Democrats in Congress would be able to forge an effective working relationship with Trump, but his initial actions have quickly eroded those hopes. “While it’s only a couple of weeks since the inauguration … we’ve seen nothing that we can work — that I can work — with President [Trump] on,” Pelosi said. “And I’m disappointed, because I thought that there might be some interest because of what he said in the campaign.” Monday’s press conference was called to hammer Trump’s recent executive orders vowing to scale back regulations on Wall Street banks, including those installed by Democrats with the 2010 passage of Dodd-Frank. Pelosi said Trump’s actions are evidence that his campaign promise to stand up to Wall Street on behalf of the middle class was merely “a hoax.”“President Trump and his billionaire Cabinet and his advisers … are putting forth a Wall Street-first policy at the expense of the American people,” she said.

First the horrible tragedy in Parkland, and now this; Florida International University’s “instant bridge,” spontaneously collapsing earlier on Thursday. The two companies responsible for the poorly constructed bridge were MCM and Figg, both have a sketchy history when it comes to construction, but for today’s purposes, we’re going to focus on MCM, because there’s a valuable lesson that can be learned here.That lesson is this; there are some things that women shouldn’t do. There are some things women can’t do. One of these is construction.Though MCM is owned by five brothers, a lot of people one rung down the ladder from them are women. Some of the construction workers are even women. How ironic is it then, that earlier this month, MCM was slapped with a lawsuit for hiring “incompetent, inexperienced, unskilled or careless employees.” Fox reports:The company is building an expansion to Fort Lauderdale International Airport and a worker there was injured when a makeshift bridge collapsed under his weight, the lawsuit says, according to the Winston Salem-Journal .Leonor Flores, FIU alumna, and MCM project exec says her number one priority when building bridges is to make sure they look pretty. Nothing else matters:“It’s very important for me as a woman and an engineer to be able to promote that to my daughter because I think women have a different perspective. We’re able to put in an artistic touch and we’re able to build too.”No. You can’t build things. The bridge collapsed for no other reason than terrible structure. Though the death toll is currently at six, police say that the number is likely to rise. But no, let’s talk about how strong and powerful these women are. This company prides itself on how many women they hire, saying that it’s a big step towards gender equality. That’s not working out so far, is it? There’s a reason you don’t hear about women in construction; they’re not very good at it, and quite frankly, they don’t want to be. Women in MCM promote feminism when it’s convenient; when everybody’s looking tough and ready to conquer the world in their construction hat. But when their projects fail, and lives are lost, everyone wants to focus on all the men in the company. Nobody, not them or the mainstream media is talking about all these women and how they dropped the ball. None of them want to take responsibility, and that makes both the media and these women spineless cowards.

It seems that no matter what liberals say, he might be right.In a shocking development, FBI officials raided former President Barack Obama’s $8.9 million dollar mansion in the Kalorama neighborhood of Washington D.C. early Tuesday morning.According to sources within the agency, the raid was related to “a cabal of Obama administration officials” who actively worked to use the power of the United States government to undermine Trump “during the 2016 presidential campaign and after.”Officials removed 36 desktop computers, multiple removable storage drives, 12 laptops, and “multiple pieces of recording and surveillance equipment” as well as “thousands of pounds of paper documents” from Obama’s home.The former President has not yet been arrested, but FBI spokeswoman Shelly Smithers says “arrests are possible.”Obama moved into his D.C. home at the beginning of the year, followed by his partner-in-crime Valerie Jarrett in March . At the time it was speculated that the home would be used as a base of anti-Trump operations. Now, it seems, that is confirmed.The FBI says that a statement can be expected on Friday.About William ""Truthteller"" Farrow 87 ArticlesWilliam Farrow is a conservative Christian who serves God as the leader of a flock in Arkansas.

The outside is decorated with frog planters, ­butterfly chairs, a hot-pink pig-shaped grill, ­sunflowers and daisies. This is Rainbow Land, the boho recording studio whose owner, Miley Cyrus , is on this sunny April afternoon sitting cross-legged in a swivel chair before a sound board, dressed way down with unruly long hair, cutoffs and a vintage tee that reads “Malibu” on the front.Cyrus -- who’s about to play me 10 songs off a new album that promises to (yet again) transform one of the most inimitable, unpredictable careers in recent pop ­history -- is somehow animated and serene at the same time. It’s clear from the way her words tumble forth that she’s ­breaking a months long self-imposed “media blackout” and eager to unpack her latest thinking on everything from her alienation from hip-hop to engaging with Donald Trump’s supporters.“This is crazy,” she says with her ­signature raspy-voiced charm, “but I haven’t smoked weed in three weeks!” Cyrus -- who’s sitting across from a lighted wall plaque that reads “It’s 4:20 Somewhere” -- elaborates on why she decided to quit “for a second”: “I like to surround myself with people that make me want to get better, more evolved, open. And I was noticing, it’s not the people that are stoned. I want to be super clear and sharp, because I know exactly where I want to be.”Where is that, exactly? It is, among other things, on her leafy Malibu compound that includes Rainbow Land. Cyrus, 24, shares the property with seven dogs, two pigs, two miniature horses and one Australian: fiance Liam Hemsworth, the actor with whom Cyrus reunited last year after a 2013 breakup. Hemsworth bought the property in 2014, but Cyrus moved in and has left her mark on it. (She also keeps a home with her mom, Tish, in Studio City.) In Malibu, when she’s not making music or doing two hours of Ashtanga yoga daily, Cyrus says she likes nothing better than walking her dogs or grocery shopping, where she’s generally unbothered. “I love talking to people, and I approach them in a normal, ‘Don’t treat me different, ’cause I’m not’ way. That’s what started this evolution for me, getting out of my Dead Petz phase,” she says, referring to her 2015 album, the tour for which featured her in a unicorn outfit with a strap-on phallus. “People stare at me anyway, but people stare at me a lot when I’m dressed as a ­fucking cat.”On May 11, fans and haters alike will get a dose of New Miley with “Malibu,” the first single off an as-yet-untitled album coming later this year. It’s a breezy love song about Hemsworth -- gimmick-free pop-rock unlike anything she has recorded before, whether as Hannah Montana, the punky Disney princess who scored three Billboard 200 No. 1s in the ’00s; or as herself, on 2013’s daring Bangerz (another No. 1); or the straight-to-SoundCloud experiment Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz. When Cyrus sings, “I never would’ve believed you if three years ago you told me I’d be here writing this song,” she could as easily be referring to her music as to her relationship.While Bangerz and Petz bore the unmistakable stamps of their respective collaborators, Mike Will Made-It and Wayne Coyne of The Flaming Lips , the new album will be Cyrus’ most DIY to date. She wrote the lyrics and melodies ­herself, and producer-writer Oren Yoel (who co-wrote the Bangerz track “Adore You,” which hit No. 21 on the Billboard Hot 100 ) plays all the ­instruments. Cyrus wrote one song for Hillary Clinton and another for women in the workplace, but overall, the album’s less explicitly political than it is personal. That extends to the music, which adds an unprecedented dose of twang to a mix that includes quiet acoustic turns and epic pop. “This is Miley leaning into her roots more than I’ve ever heard,” says her father, country singer and actor Billy Ray Cyrus , who tells a story of Waylon Jennings teaching a young Miley guitar chords at the kitchen table. “For her, this is honest.” It’s also a showcase for her voice, one of the most expressive in music. “My main concern isn’t radio,” says Cyrus, whose “Wrecking Ball” spent three weeks at No. 1 in 2013. “I truly don’t even listen to it.”Cyrus was first inspired to reach beyond her circle of “outspoken liberals” and ­cultivate ­country fans and red staters in 2016, when she began as a coach on NBC’s stalwart talent competition The Voice. (She will rejoin for season 13 this fall.) “I like talking to people that don’t agree with me, but I don’t think I can do that in an aggressive way,” says Cyrus. “I don’t think those people are going to listen to me when I’m sitting there in nipple pasties, you know?”After Trump was elected ­president, Cyrus -- who first ­supported Bernie Sanders and, when she won the Democratic ­nomination, Clinton -- launched #HopefulHippies, an initiative of her Happy Hippie youth-activism nonprofit that ­encourages people to “turn emotion into action.” “I have to ask myself, ‘How am I going to create real change?’” she says, “and not just ­fucking preach to the choir anymore.” With the new album, Cyrus hopes to reach the other side of the aisle. “This record is a reflection of the fact that yes, I don’t give a fuck, but right now is not a time to not give a fuck about people,” she says. “I’m ­giving the world a hug and saying, ‘Hey, look. We’re good -- I love you.’ And I hope you can say you love me back.”Where exactly did you write ­“Malibu”?On the way to The Voice. I drive myself everywhere, but that day I decided to Uber, and I was trying not to sing out loud because someone else was in the car.People might call it sentimental.They’re going to talk about me if I come out of a restaurant with Liam. So why not put the power back in my relationship and say, “This is how I feel”?After you guys broke up, you said something like, “I’m so immersed in work, I can’t even think about it.”Yeah, but also ’cause I needed to change so much. And changing with someone else not changing like that is too hard. Suddenly you’re like, “I don’t recognize you anymore.” We had to refall for each other.The new album is pretty singer-­songwriter-y, no?Yeah. But not granola. I don’t listen to Ed Sheeran and John Mayer and stuff.Did folk singer Melanie Safka [with whom Cyrus performed in 2015] ­influence you?She did, and I grew up with her. But I also love that new Kendrick [Lamar] song [“Humble”]: “Show me somethin’ natural like ass with some stretch marks.” I love that because it’s not “Come sit on my dick, suck on my cock.” I can’t listen to that anymore. That’s what pushed me out of the hip-hop scene a little. It was too much “Lamborghini, got my Rolex, got a girl on my cock” -- I am so not that.I was torn on whether I was going to work with certain producers that I really like. But I feel if we’re not on the same page ­politically ... My record is political, but the sound bite doesn’t stop there. Because you can write something beautiful and you know E! News will ruin our lives and say, “This is a political record.” Because then I’m the Dixie Chicks and I’m getting my album smashed in the streets, and that’s not what I want. I want to talk to people in a compassionate, understanding way -- which people aren’t doing.What appealed to you about The Voice?I’m down for hanging with Blake [Shelton]. I actually want to take ­advantage of the fact that he’s there, [because] his fans don’t really take me seriously as a ­country artist. One, I haven’t given them that music. But I’ve got a tattoo of Johnny Cash ’s autograph that he gave me when I was a ­little girl that says, “I’m in your corner.” Dolly Parton is my ­fucking ­godmother. The fact that ­country music fans are scared of me, that hurts me. All the ­nipple pastie shit, that’s what I did because I felt it was part of my political movement, and that got me to where I am now. I’m evolving, and I surround myself with smart people that are evolved.But we’ve seen the way that Madonna and Lady Gaga get asked, “Is this just another costume? Another phase?”I think [ Madonna and Gaga ] are ­enlightened. I ­fucking hate it when people can’t adjust. I used to [resist changing]. But I haven’t smoked weed in three weeks, which is the longest I’ve ever [gone without it]. I’m not doing drugs, I’m not drinking, I’m completely clean right now! That was just something that I wanted to do.Is it hard to not smoke?It’s easy, dude. When I want something, it’s fucking easy for me. But if anyone told me not to smoke, I would have not done it. It’s because it was on my time. I know exactly where I am right now. I know what I want this record to be. And not in the sense of manipulation -- wanting something from my fans or the audience, like some slimy thing -- “How do I get attention?” I never thought about that. Dude, I was shocked that ­people gave a fuck about the [MTV Video Music Awards in 2013, when she ­performed with Robin Thicke ] -- the ­twerking, the teddy bear. It’s a totally ­different time, and I don’t think that would freak people out anymore.Our perceptions of a lot of things are changing at lightning speed. Still, there’s an audience that’s maybe a little scared of you, those who might have a tendency to vilify the “other.”I was talking about this with my sister [ Noah ], who’s 17, and she’s doing music right now. She basically grew up in L.A. She’s never known anything different. She doesn’t even know she’s open-minded, it’s the only kind of mind she has ever known. It’s mind-boggling to me that there was even a controversy around me having black dancers. That became a thing, where people said I was taking advantage of black culture, and with Mike [WiLL Made-It] -- what the fuck? That wasn’t true. Those were the dancers I liked!When I met Pharrell [Williams], before “Blurred Lines,” before “Happy,” people wouldn’t take meetings with me because they said, “He hasn’t had a hit in 10 years.” They wanted to put me with the Dr. Lukes of the world, the Max Martins, and put me through the fucking assembly line, and I said, “No. This is someone who actually cares about me. This is someone I feel safe with.” I got completely shut out, and I had to just trust myself. What feels right to me feels right to my fans, because they know some dude in a suit didn’t tell me to do it. And by the way, I brought “Wrecking Ball” to Luke. No one put me in the room with Luke. I had done “Party in the U.S.A.” with him, and that’s just someone I thought could handle that sound. Did you ever get to come to a Bangerz show?Yeah, I did.I was crazy about making the tongue slide work. I was so ­embarrassed to be on the red carpet and so many of those fucking disgusting ­photographers would tell me to blow a kiss, and that’s not me! I don’t want to blow you a kiss. I didn’t know what to do with my face, so I stuck my tongue out, and it became a rebellious, punk-rock thing.The Dead Petz track “BB Talk,” which calls out a man for his “baby ­talking,” seems to reject a similar kind of ­gender standard.I wish it would’ve gotten some ­attention. No one saw the video! It was a real rant. Dating a musician [like me] is probably the worst thing ever, because you always end up ­having your shit in songs. It’s just ­inevitable. But I’m just that way. I’m a little bit boyish. But I can also be super femme and dress as a bunny rabbit. Who I’m with has nothing to do with sex -- I’m super open, pansexual, that’s just me.Do you want your dudes to be dudes?Not even. That really grosses me out. I always get in trouble for ­generalizing straight men, ’cause straight men can be my worst nightmare ­sometimes. And I’m with a straight dude. But he’s always like, “Well, don’t call me that!” I ask him sometimes, “Do you like being a boy?” And he’s like, “I don’t really think about it.” And that’s crazy to me, because I think about being a girl all the time. I’m always like, “It’s weird that I’m a girl, because I just don’t feel like a girl, and I don’t feel like a boy. I just feel like nothing.” So when someone’s too ­masculine, that really grosses me out.But then, girls really make me sad a lot of the time too, especially right now. I think fashion has taken us a little bit downhill. I can only speak for the years that I’ve been alive, but I don’t know if it has ever been so important to “fit in.” It’s not about standing out right now. Which is so weird, because it seems like for the really unique, smart kids in this generation, it’s all about standing out. I love seeing these kids on Instagram that dress fucking dope. This whole world right now is so divided, in the arts, fashion -- everything.The country is certainly very divided.I like the way I think right now. But don’t Trump supporters like the way they think? So I’ve also got to be open with the way I approach people with my opinions. That’s the only way to make real change. And it’s not because I want to sell records! I know now the ways that don’t work. Because I went really hard during the ­election. But at the end of the day, we lost. We won, but because the system is fucked up, we lost. I thought, “OK. I learned my lesson on this one.”Did you have to go into The Voice right after Election Day?That next day, dude. I wanted to go to rehearsals. Liam was like, “Just don’t go. You’re not there. And you don’t know how everyone feels on that set.” Everyone’s from all different parts of the country, so he was like, “Don’t go and get into it with ­people right now.” Because clearly ­unity is what we need.You posted a tearful Instagram video the day after the election, and I tweeted, “Love you, Miley.” And so many alt-right dudes responded, “Are you just trying to fuck her?”That’s them sexualizing me, because they think that you couldn’t take me seriously. The first thing I got on my Instagram when I posted that was people saying, “You said you were going to move. When are you going to move?” It’s not time for me to leave now, dude. I’ve got to be here. I’ve got to glue this place back together, because I’m from Tennessee -- that state [went to] Donald Trump. I’m such a dreamer, and I know a lot of things that I’ve wanted to do people said weren’t possible. When I started Happy Hippie -- this is before Caitlyn Jenner transitioned, before this became something that is a part of the culture...Leelah Alcorn -- a 17-year-old ­transgender girl who committed ­suicide in December 2014 -- brought a new awareness to transgender issues.Yes. I was on a Christmas trip, and I was like, “How am I sitting here about to open presents and someone has taken their own life?” I started Happy Hippie because I never thought we would see this day where you have the Laverne Coxes of the world get not only trans roles, but female roles. And I realized the voice I had. That’s why I brought Jesse [Helt, a homeless man, to the 2014 VMAs], because it felt wrong for me to go and get an award, celebrating me getting naked and riding a fucking wrecking ball around for a day. I mean, what would I have said? “Thanks, uh... thanks to [“Wrecking Ball” video ­director] Terry Richardson”? That would have been so weird.Do you think you’ve managed to bring your politics into The Voice?By sitting there after the election in head-to-toe pink, while on the inside being a gender-neutral, ­sexually fluid person, hopefully that was saying ­something. I needed some sparkle in my life, to make me able to deal. Radiating love is ­something that is important to me -- ­hopefully, that is being political.Main Image: Miley Cyrus photographed April 8, 2017 in Malibu. Brian Bowen Smith

Probably the earliest way of keeping record of a count was by some tally system involving physical objects such as pebbles or sticks. Judging by the habits of indigenous peoples today as well as by the oldest remaining traces of written or sculptured records, the earliest numerals were simple notches in a stick, scratches on a stone, marks on a piece of pottery , and the like. Having no fixed units of measure, no coins, no commerce beyond the rudest barter, no system of taxation, and no needs beyond those to sustain life, people had no necessity for written numerals until the beginning of what are called historical times. Vocal sounds were probably used to designate the number of objects in a small group long before there were separate symbols for the small numbers, and it seems likely that the sounds differed according to the kind of object being counted. The abstract notion of two, signified orally by a sound independent of any particular objects, probably appeared very late.Number basesWhen it became necessary to count frequently to numbers larger than 10 or so, the numeration had to be systematized and simplified; this was commonly done through use of a group unit or base , just as might be done today counting 43 eggs as three dozen and seven. In fact, the earliest numerals of which there is a definite record were simple straight marks for the small numbers with some special form for 10. These symbols appeared in Egypt as early as 3400 bce and in Mesopotamia as early as 3000 bce, long preceding the first known inscriptions containing numerals in China (c. 1600 bce), Crete (c. 1200 bce), and India (c. 300 bce). Some ancient symbols for 1 and 10 are given in the figure.Some ancient symbols for 1 and 10.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The special position occupied by 10 stems from the number of human fingers, of course, and it is still evident in modern usage not only in the logical structure of the decimal number system but in the English names for the numbers. Thus, eleven comes from Old English endleofan, literally meaning “[ten and] one left [over],” and twelve from twelf, meaning “two left”; the endings -teen and -ty both refer to ten, and hundred comes originally from a pre-Greek term meaning “ten times [ten].”It should not be inferred, however, that 10 is either the only possible base or the only one actually used. The pair system, in which the counting goes “one, two, two and one, two twos, two and two and one,” and so on, is found among the ethnologically oldest tribes of Australia , in many Papuan languages of the Torres Strait and the adjacent coast of New Guinea , among some African Pygmies , and in various South American tribes. The indigenous peoples of Tierra del Fuego and the South American continent use number systems with bases three and four. The quinary scale, or number system with base five, is very old, but in pure form it seems to be used at present only by speakers of Saraveca, a South American Arawakan language; elsewhere it is combined with the decimal or the vigesimal system , where the base is 20. Similarly, the pure base six scale seems to occur only sparsely in northwest Africa and is otherwise combined with the duodecimal, or base 12, system.In the course of history, the decimal system finally overshadowed all others. Nevertheless, there are still many vestiges of other systems, chiefly in commercial and domestic units, where change always meets the resistance of tradition. Thus, 12 occurs as the number of inches in a foot, months in a year, ounces in a pound ( troy weight or apothecaries’ weight ), and twice 12 hours in a day, and both the dozen and the gross measure by twelves. In English the base 20 occurs chiefly in the score (“Four score and seven years ago…”); in French it survives in the word quatre-vingts (“four twenties”), for 80; other traces are found in ancient Celtic, Gaelic, Danish, and Welsh. The base 60 still occurs in measurement of time and angles.Numeral systemsIt appears that the primitive numerals were |, ||, |||, and so on, as found in Egypt and the Grecian lands , or −, =, ≡, and so on, as found in early records in East Asia , each going as far as the simple needs of people required. As life became more complicated, the need for group numbers became apparent, and it was only a small step from the simple system with names only for one and ten to the further naming of other special numbers. Sometimes this happened in a very unsystematic fashion; for example, the Yukaghirs of Siberia counted, “one, two, three, three and one, five, two threes, two threes and one, two fours, ten with one missing, ten.” Usually, however, a more regular system resulted, and most of these systems can be classified, at least roughly, according to the logical principles underlying them.Simple grouping systemsIn its pure form a simple grouping system is an assignment of special names to the small numbers, the base b, and its powers b2, b3, and so on, up to a power bk large enough to represent all numbers actually required in use. The intermediate numbers are then formed by addition, each symbol being repeated the required number of times, just as 23 is written XXIII in Roman numerals .The earliest example of this kind of system is the scheme encountered in hieroglyphs , which the Egyptians used for writing on stone. (Two later Egyptian systems, the hieratic and demotic, which were used for writing on clay or papyrus, will be considered below; they are not simple grouping systems.) The number 258,458 written in hieroglyphics appears in the figure. Numbers of this size actually occur in extant records concerning royal estates and may have been commonplace in the logistics and engineering of the great pyramids.Ancient Egyptians customarily wrote from right to left. Because they did not have a positional system, they needed separate symbols for each power of 10.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.Cuneiform numeralsAround Babylon , clay was abundant, and the people impressed their symbols in damp clay tablets before drying them in the sun or in a kiln, thus forming documents that were practically as permanent as stone. Because the pressure of the stylus gave a wedge-shaped symbol, the inscriptions are known as cuneiform, from the Latin cuneus (“wedge”) and forma (“shape”). The symbols could be made either with the pointed or the circular end (hence curvilinear writing) of the stylus, and for numbers up to 60 these symbols were used in the same way as the hieroglyphs, except that a subtractive symbol was also used. The figure shows the number 258,458 in cuneiform.The number 258,458 expressed in the sexagesimal (base 60) system of the Babylonians and in cuneiform.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.The cuneiform and the curvilinear numerals occur together in some documents from about 3000 bce. There seem to have been some conventions regarding their use: cuneiform was always used for the number of the year or the age of an animal, while wages already paid were written in curvilinear and wages due in cuneiform. For numbers larger than 60, the Babylonians used a mixed system, described below.Greek numeralsThe Greeks had two important systems of numerals, besides the primitive plan of repeating single strokes, as in ||| ||| for six, and one of these was again a simple grouping system. Their predecessors in culture—the Babylonians, Egyptians, and Phoenicians—had generally repeated the units up to 9, with a special symbol for 10, and so on. The early Greeks also repeated the units to 9 and probably had various symbols for 10. In Crete , where the early civilization was so much influenced by those of Phoenicia and Egypt, the symbol for 10 was −, a circle was used for 100, and a rhombus for 1,000. Cyprus also used the horizontal bar for 10, but the precise forms are of less importance than the fact that the grouping by tens, with special symbols for certain powers of 10, was characteristic of the early number systems of the Middle East .The Greeks, who entered the field much later and were influenced in their alphabet by the Phoenicians, based their first elaborate system chiefly on the initial letters of the numeral names. This was a natural thing for all early civilizations, since the custom of writing out the names for large numbers was at first quite general, and the use of an initial by way of abbreviation of a word is universal. The Greek system of abbreviations, known today as Attic numerals, appears in the records of the 5th century bce but was probably used much earlier.Roman numeralsThe direct influence of Rome for such a long period, the superiority of its numeral system over any other simple one that had been known in Europe before about the 10th century, and the compelling force of tradition explain the strong position that the system maintained for nearly 2,000 years in commerce, in scientific and theological literature, and in belles lettres . It had the great advantage that, for the mass of users, memorizing the values of only four letters was necessary—V, X, L, and C. Moreover, it was easier to see three in III than in 3 and to see nine in VIIII than in 9, and it was correspondingly easier to add numbers—the most basic arithmetic operation.As in all such matters, the origin of these numerals is obscure, although the changes in their forms since the 3rd century bce are well known. The theory of German historian Theodor Mommsen (1850) had wide acceptance. He argued that the V for five represented the open hand. Two of these gave the X for 10, and the L, C, and M were modifications of Greek letters. However, study of inscriptions left by the Etruscans, who ruled Italy before the Romans, show that the Romans adopted the Etruscan numerical system beginning in the 5th century bce but with the distinct difference that the Etruscans read their numbers from right to left while the Romans read theirs from left to right. L and D for 50 and 500, respectively, emerged in the Late Roman Republic, and M did not come to mean 1,000 until the Middle Ages.The oldest noteworthy inscription containing numerals representing very large numbers is on the Columna Rostrata , a monument erected in the Roman Forum to commemorate a victory in 260 bce over Carthage during the First Punic War . In this column a symbol for 100,000, which was an early form of (((I))), was repeated 23 times, making 2,300,000. This illustrates not only the early Roman use of repeated symbols but also a custom that extended to modern times—that of using (I) for 1,000, ((I)) for 10,000, (((I))) for 100,000, and ((((I)))) for 1,000,000. The symbol (I) for 1,000 frequently appears in various other forms, including the cursive ∞. Toward the end of the Roman Republic, a bar (known as the vinculum or virgula) was placed over a number to multiply it by 1,000. This bar also came to represent ordinal numbers. In the early Roman Empire, bars enclosing a number around the top and sides came to mean multiplication by 100,000. The use of the single bar on top lasted into the Middle Ages , but the three bars did not.Of the later use of the numerals, a few of the special types are as follows:c∙lxiiij∙ccc∙l∙i for 164,351, Adelard of Bath (c. 1120)II.DCCC.XIIII for 2,814, Jordanus Nemorarius (c. 1125)M⫏CLVI for 1,656, in San Marco, VenicecIɔ.Iɔ.Ic for 1,599, Leiden edition of the work of Martianus Capella (1599)IIIIxx et huit for 88, a Paris treaty of 1388four Cli.M for 451,000, Humphrey Baker’s The Well Spryng of Sciences Whiche Teacheth the Perfecte Woorke and Practise of Arithmeticke (1568)vj.C for 600 and CCC.M for 300,000, Robert Recorde (c. 1542)Item (1) represents the use of the vinculum; (2) represents the place value as it occasionally appears in Roman numerals (D represents 500); (3) illustrates the not infrequent use of ⫏, like D, originally half of (I), the symbol for 1,000; (4) illustrates the persistence of the old Roman form for 1,000 and 500 and the subtractive principle so rarely used by the Romans for a number like 99; (5) shows the use of quatre-vingts for 80, commonly found in French manuscripts until the 17th century and occasionally later, the numbers often being written like iiijxx, vijxx, and so on; and (6) represents the coefficient method, “four C” meaning 400, a method often leading to forms like ijM or IIM for 2,000, as shown in (7).The subtractive principle is seen in Hebrew number names, as well as in the occasional use of IV for 4 and IX for 9 in Roman inscriptions. The Romans also used unus de viginti (“one from twenty”) for 19 and duo de viginti (“two from twenty”) for 18, occasionally writing these numbers as XIX (or IXX) and IIXX, respectively. On the whole, however, the subtractive principle was little used in the numerals of the Classical period.Multiplicative grouping systemsIn multiplicative systems, special names are given not only to 1, b, b2, and so on but also to the numbers 2, 3, …, b − 1; the symbols of this second set are then used in place of repetitions of the first set. Thus, if 1, 2, 3, …, 9 are designated in the usual way but 10, 100, and 1,000 are replaced by X, C, and M, respectively, then in a multiplicative grouping system one should write 7,392 as 7M3C9X2. The principal example of this kind of notation is the Chinese numeral system , three variants of which are shown in the figure. The modern national and mercantile systems are positional systems, as described below, and use a circle for zero.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.Ciphered numeral systemsIn ciphered systems, names are given not only to 1 and the powers of the base b but also to the multiples of these powers. Thus, starting from the artificial example given above for a multiplicative grouping system, one can obtain a ciphered system if unrelated names are given to the numbers 1, 2, …, 9; X, 2X, …, 9X; C, 2C, …, 9C; M, 2M, …, 9M. This requires memorizing many different symbols, but it results in a very compact notation.The first ciphered system seems to have been the Egyptian hieratic (literally “priestly”) numerals, so called because the priests were presumably the ones who had the time and learning required to develop this shorthand outgrowth of the earlier hieroglyphic numerals. An Egyptian arithmetical work on papyrus, employing hieratic numerals, was found in Egypt about 1855; known after the name of its purchaser as the Rhind papyrus , it provides the chief source of information about this numeral system. There was a still later Egyptian system, the demotic, which was also a ciphered system.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.As early as the 3rd century bce, a second system of numerals, paralleling the Attic numerals, came into use in Greece that was better adapted to the theory of numbers, though it was more difficult for the trading classes to comprehend. These Ionic , or alphabetical, numerals, were simply a cipher system in which nine Greek letters were assigned to the numbers 1–9, nine more to the numbers 10, …, 90, and nine more to 100, …, 900. Thousands were often indicated by placing a bar at the left of the corresponding numeral.Such numeral forms were not particularly difficult for computing purposes once the operator was able automatically to recall the meaning of each. Only the capital letters were used in this ancient numeral system, the lowercase letters being a relatively modern invention.Other ciphered numeral systems include Coptic, Hindu Brahmin, Hebrew , Syrian, and early Arabic. The last three, like the Ionic, are alphabetic ciphered numeral systems. The Hebrew system is shown in thefigure.Positional numeral systemsThe decimal number system is an example of a positional system, in which, after the base b has been adopted, the digits 1, 2, …, b − 1 are given special names, and all larger numbers are written as sequences of these digits. It is the only one of the systems that can be used for describing large numbers, since each of the other kinds gives special names to various numbers larger than b, and an infinite number of names would be required for all the numbers. The success of the positional system depends on the fact that, for an arbitrary base b, every number N can be written in a unique fashion in the form N = anbn + an − 1bn − 1 + ⋯ + a1b + a0 where an, an − 1, …, a0 are digits; i.e., numbers from the group 0, 1, …, b − 1. Then N to the base b can be represented by the sequence of symbols anan − 1…a1a0. It was this principle which was used in the multiplicative grouping systems , and the relation between the two kinds of systems is immediately seen from the earlier noted equivalence between 7,392 and 7M3C9X2; the positional system derives from the multiplicative simply by omitting the names of the powers b, b2, and so on and by depending on the position of the digits to supply this information. It is then necessary, however, to use some symbol for zero to indicate any missing powers of the base; otherwise 792 could mean, for example, either 7M9X2 (i.e., 7,092) or 7C9X2 (792).The Babylonians developed (c. 3000–2000 bce) a positional system with base 60—a sexagesimal system. With such a large base, it would have been awkward to have unrelated names for the digits 0, 1, …, 59, so a simple grouping system to base 10 was used for these numbers, as shown in the figure.In addition to being somewhat cumbersome because of the large base chosen, the Babylonian system suffered until very late from the lack of a zero symbol; the resulting ambiguities may well have bothered the Babylonians as much as later translators.In the course of early Spanish expeditions into Yucatan, it was discovered that the Maya , at an early but still undated time, had a well-developed positional system, complete with zero. It seems to have been used primarily for the calendar rather than for commercial or other computation; this is reflected in the fact that, although the base is 20, the third digit from the end signifies multiples not of 202 but of 18 × 20, thus giving their year a simple number of days. The digits 0, 1, …, 19 are, as in the Babylonian, formed by a simple grouping system, in this case to base 5; the groups were written vertically.The Mayan number system, which is base 20 with simple grouping to base 5.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.Neither the Mayan nor the Babylonian system was ideally suited to arithmetical computations, because the digits—the numbers less than 20 or 60—were not represented by single symbols. The complete development of this idea must be attributed to the Hindus, who also were the first to use zero in the modern way. As was mentioned earlier, some symbol is required in positional number systems to mark the place of a power of the base not actually occurring. This was indicated by the Hindus by a dot or small circle, which was given the name sunya, the Sanskrit word for “vacant.” This was translated into the Arabic ṣifr about 800 ce with the meaning kept intact, and the latter was transliterated into Latin about 1200, the sound being retained but the meaning ignored. Subsequent changes have led to the modern cipher and zero.A symbol for zero appeared in the Babylonian system about the 3rd century bce. However, it was not used consistently and apparently served to hold only interior places, never final places, so that it was impossible to distinguish between 77 and 7,700, except by the context .Development of modern numerals and numeral systemsThe Hindu-Arabic systemSeveral different claims, each having a certain amount of justification, have been made with respect to the origin of modern Western numerals, commonly spoken of as Arabic but preferably as Hindu-Arabic. These include the assertion that the origin is to be found among the Arabs, Persians, Egyptians, and Hindus. It is not improbable that the intercourse among traders served to carry such symbols from country to country, so that modern Western numerals may be a conglomeration from different sources. However, as far as is known, the country that first used the largest number of these numeral forms is India . The 1, 4, and 6 are found in the Ashoka inscriptions (3rd century bce); the 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9 appear in the Nana Ghat inscriptions about a century later; and the 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 in the Nasik caves of the 1st or 2nd century ce—all in forms that have considerable resemblance to today’s, 2 and 3 being well-recognized cursive derivations from the ancient = and ≡. None of these early Indian inscriptions gives evidence of place value or of a zero that would make modern place value possible. Hindu literature gives evidence that the zero may have been known earlier, but there is no inscription with such a symbol before the 9th century.The first definite external reference to the Hindu numerals is a note by Severus Sebokht, a bishop who lived in Mesopotamia about 650. Since he speaks of “nine signs,” the zero seems to have been unknown to him. By the close of the 8th century, however, some astronomical tables of India are said to have been translated into Arabic at Baghdad , and in any case the numeral became known to Arabian scholars about this time. About 825 the mathematician al-Khwārizmī wrote a small book on the subject, and this was translated into Latin by Adelard of Bath (c. 1120) under the title of Liber algorismi de numero Indorum. The earliest European manuscript known to contain Hindu numerals was written in Spain in 976.The advantages enjoyed by the perfected positional system are so numerous and so manifest that the Hindu-Arabic numerals and the base 10 have been adopted almost everywhere. These might be said to be the nearest approach to a universal human language yet devised; they are found in Chinese, Japanese, and Russian scientific journals and in every Western language. (However, see the table for some other modern numeral systems.)Comparison of selected modern systems of numeralsHindu-Arabic

This means that significant segments of Earth's population are consuming groundwater quickly without knowing when it might run out, the researchers conclude. The findings are published today in Water Resources Research. ""Available physical and chemical measurements are simply insufficient,"" said UCI professor and principal investigator Jay Famiglietti, who is also the senior water scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. ""Given how quickly we are consuming the world's groundwater reserves, we need a coordinated global effort to determine how much is left."" The studies are the first to comprehensively characterize global groundwater losses with data from space, using readings generated by NASA's twin GRACE satellites. GRACE measures dips and bumps in Earth's gravity, which are affected by the mass of water. In the first paper, researchers found that 13 of the planet's 37 largest aquifers studied between 2003 and 2013 were being depleted while receiving little to no recharge. Eight were classified as ""overstressed,"" with nearly no natural replenishment to offset usage. Another five were found to be ""extremely"" or ""highly"" stressed, depending upon the level of replenishment in each. Those aquifers were still being depleted but had some water flowing back into them. The most overburdened aquifers are in the world's driest areas, where populations draw heavily on underground water. Climate change and population growth are expected to intensify the problem. ""What happens when a highly stressed aquifer is located in a region with socioeconomic or political tensions that can't supplement declining water supplies fast enough?"" asked Alexandra Richey, the lead author on both studies, who conducted the research as a UCI doctoral student. ""We're trying to raise red flags now to pinpoint where active management today could protect future lives and livelihoods."" The research team -- which included co-authors from NASA, the National Center for Atmospheric Research, National Taiwan University and UC Santa Barbara -- found that the Arabian Aquifer System, an important water source for more than 60 million people, is the most overstressed in the world. The Indus Basin aquifer of northwestern India and Pakistan is the second-most overstressed, and the Murzuk-Djado Basin in northern Africa is third. California's Central Valley, used heavily for agriculture and suffering rapid depletion, was slightly better off, but was still labeled highly stressed in the first study. ""As we're seeing in California right now, we rely much more heavily on groundwater during drought,"" said Famiglietti. ""When examining the sustainability of a region's water resources, we absolutely must account for that dependence."" In a companion paper published today in the same journal, the scientists conclude that the total remaining volume of the world's usable groundwater is poorly known, with estimates that often vary widely. The total groundwater volume is likely far less than rudimentary estimates made decades ago. By comparing their satellite-derived groundwater loss rates to what little data exist on groundwater availability, the researchers found major discrepancies in projected ""time to depletion."" In the overstressed Northwest Sahara Aquifer System, for example, time to depletion estimates varied between 10 years and 21,000 years. ""We don't actually know how much is stored in each of these aquifers. Estimates of remaining storage might vary from decades to millennia,"" said Richey. ""In a water-scarce society, we can no longer tolerate this level of uncertainty, especially since groundwater is disappearing so rapidly."" The study notes that the dearth of groundwater is already leading to significant ecological damage, including depleted rivers, declining water quality and subsiding land.

ShearMarch 14, 2018LOS ANGELES — President Trump woke up here in the land of earthquakes on Wednesday morning, but he was 2,500 miles away from the tremor that was really shaking his party.While the president hobnobbed on Tuesday night with wealthy donors in the exclusive enclave of Beverly Park, the voters in the suburbs south of Pittsburgh were in revolt, giving the Democratic candidate a narrow victory in a special election in Pennsylvania that was taking on outsize proportions.Just as they did outside Birmingham and Montgomery, Ala., in December, and Richmond, Va., and Washington in November, energized and angry suburban voters were swamping the Trump stalwarts in the more rural parts of those regions, sending a clear message to Republicans around the country.While Republican turnout in a district that Mr. Trump won in 2016 by 20 percentage points was healthy, Democrats showed again that they could tap unions and other traditionally friendly groups to get their voters out in droves. The N.A.A.C.P. helped win Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s former Alabama Senate seat for Doug Jones in December. Organized labor, once seen as fractured and feckless in the Trump era, gave the Democrat Conor Lamb his edge in Pennsylvania.Rick Saccone, the Republican candidate who wrapped himself in Mr. Trump’s cloak and drew the president to his district last weekend in a bid to rescue a faltering campaign, trailed Mr. Lamb, a former Marine seeking to show his party can compete even in red territory. Mr. Lamb held an apparently insurmountable lead of 641 votes on Wednesday, with about only 500 absentee, provisional and military ballots remaining to be counted, according to county election officials.VideoConor Lamb, a Democrat, narrowly won a House special election in a Pennsylvania district that President Trump won by 20 percentage points in 2016.Published OnMarch 14, 2018CreditImage by Brendan McDermid/ReutersThe victory may yet be contested, but whether Mr. Lamb holds on to officially win the House seat matters less than the fact that he was so competitive in the first place. The rebuke of Mr. Trump came from a part of western Pennsylvania that overwhelmingly supported him in 2016 and that typically would not seem likely to turn to a Democrat. The district was seen as so strongly Republican that the Democrats did not even field a candidate in recent years.And while Mr. Saccone carried the most Trump-supporting counties along the West Virginia border, Mr. Lamb made just enough inroads in those rural areas to give the voters in suburban Allegheny County the chance to deliver the Democrat the slimmest of leads.Rarely shy about weighing in on other news of the day, Mr. Trump made no mention of the race on Wednesday on Twitter or at any public appearance. But during a closed-door fund-raiser outside St. Louis late in the day for Josh Hawley, a Republican running for Senate, Mr. Trump argued that he had helped Mr. Saccone come back from a seven-point deficit to a virtual tie. Moreover, Mr. Trump asserted that Mr. Lamb’s strong showing was really a validation of the popularity of the president’s own policies.“The young man last night that ran, he said, ‘Oh, I’m like Trump. Second Amendment, everything. I love the tax cuts, everything.’ He ran on that basis,” Mr. Trump said, according to The Atlantic , which obtained an audio recording of the event. “He ran on a campaign that said very nice things about me. I said, ‘Is he a Republican? He sounds like a Republican to me.’”While he searched for the best possible interpretation, the stinging message could hardly have been more pointed for a Republican president mired in low approval ratings, burdened by investigations and facing the growing likelihood that Democrats may seize power in the House this year.ImageRick Saccone, the Republican congressional candidate, spoke to supporters in Elizabeth Township, Pa., on Tuesday night as results came in that showed him behind in a race that was too close to call.CreditJeff Swensen/Getty ImagesMr. Lamb, 33, defied political geography and appeared on the verge of capturing the state’s 18th District despite a torrent of Republican money and Mr. Trump’s personal intervention. At a rally Saturday, Mr. Trump mocked Mr. Lamb as “Lamb the Sham,” promised that Mr. Saccone would “vote for us all the time,” and rambled about his own achievements as he sought to transfer his own political success to the Republican candidate.In the end, none of it seemed to be enough. Democratic enthusiasm appeared to overwhelm a part of the state that has long been a Republican stronghold. For the president, the vote is an ominous echo of Democratic victories in Virginia and Alabama, where his political efforts were shrugged off or counterproductive.The tally was also a blunt rejection of the president’s political calculation that tax cuts and steel tariffs would persuade voters in a region once dominated by the steel industry to embrace the Trump agenda on behalf of Mr. Saccone. “Steel is back,” he repeatedly said at the rally, apparently to little effect.A Republican victory in Pennsylvania might have helped deflect attention from the continuing collapse of the president’s inner circle, which Tuesday included Mr. Trump’s abrupt firing of Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and the forced resignation of John McEntee, one of Mr. Trump’s closest personal aides, who is under investigation for financial crimes and was marched out of the White House.Instead, Mr. Saccone’s lackluster performance was a grim bookend for a day in which the president’s trip to the Mexico-California border to view wall prototypes was completely overshadowed by the churning turnovers in his national security team.

It began its philanthropic activity by giving scholarships to black South Africans under apartheid.Soros, 85, now funds a network of foundations that support human rights, freedom of expression and access to public health and education in 70 countries around the globe.Reporting by Jennifer Ablan; Editing by Tom Brown

He was a twenty-three-year-old Canadian actor, living in Hollywood, who had already shown an odd, edgy presence in River's Edge. The motorcycle accident, on Topanga Canyon Boulevard, one of the twisting links between the Los Angeles Valley and the Pacific Ocean, would leave him with a thick scar rising vertically up his stomach, out of which his damaged spleen was removed. There are many things Keanu Reeves simply will not discuss, but this is not one of them. ""I call that a demon ride,"" Reeves now reflects. ""That's when things are going badly. But there's other times when you go fast, or too fast, out of exhilaration."" He was doing about fifty when he hit a hairpin turn. ""I remember saying in my head,"" he says,""'I'm going to die.'"" He lay on the pavement for half an hour before help arrived: ""I remember calling out for help. And someone answering out of the darkness, and then the flashing lights of an ambulance coming down. This was after a truck ran over my helmet. I took it off because I couldn't breathe, and a truck came down. I got out of the way, and it ran over my helmet."" What did the experience teach you? [Dryly] ""I should have gone on the brake, released the brake a little bit, leaned into the turn."" No more abstract moral lessons? ""Now I know that if I want to take a demon ride and I don't want to die . . . then I shouldn't take it."" Did that stop you from taking demon rides? ""Yeah. Well, I had to get a couple more out of my system."" Reeves smiles. ""And I probably have a couple more left."" A conversation with Keanu Reeves is not always easy. He is not overtly obstructive, and he seems to make a huge effort to be polite. But there is an agony involved. For example, I ask him why he acts. For forty-two seconds, he says nothing. Not a word, a grunt, a prevarication, or a hint that an answer might come. For most of that time, his head is angled at ninety degrees away from me, as if that's where the oxygen is. ""Uh,"" he finally says, ""the words that popped into my head were expression and, uh, it's fun."" A few minutes later, I lob a vague question about whether he ever wants to write or direct. He lets out a kind of quiet sigh. At its worst, it's like this. You ask Keanu Reeves a question and . . . just wait. Out in space, planets collide, stars go supernova. On earth, forests fall, animals screech and roar. People shout and rant and weep with anger and joy and just for the hell of it. And, all this time, Reeves sits there, entirely silent. On this particular occasion, the silence lasts seventy-two seconds. When the answer arrives, it includes no complete sentences and adds up to a vague, unremarkable, ""No, not really."" Keanu Reeves has been busy. He has four movies awaiting release and will make one more before committing himself to nearly a year and a half's work on two Matrix sequels. His band, Dogstar, has also just released an album. The first of these movies to appear, The Replacements, is a part-comic tale of some replacement football players loosely based on the 1987 NFL strike. He says that he has not seen the completed film. ""The script that I originally read and the film that was made were very different,"" he notes. He agreed to it because he liked his character, Shane Falco. ""I felt like he was a good hard-luck character who gets a second chance,"" Reeves says. He reminisces about a scene in the original script where the principal female lead beats up two hookers who were trying to rob Shane Falco. He really liked that. But they didn't even film it. ""Didn't win that one,"" he says. ""Tried, but . . . just didn't."" He nods. ""In the spirit of collaboration, the film went the other way,"" he says. ""There's not much you can do."" I ask about one scene in which he and his teammates are in jail and begin dancing to ""I Will Survive."" I point out that he seemed a rather reluctant participant. ""That scene wasn't in the original script. You know . . . it was a tough one. Does it work? Is it OK?"" He begins asking questions in a slightly mocking voice: ""Is it romantic? Is this a slapstick? Or is the dr- . . . It's a dramedy! The new synthesis! Synthesis of form . . . "" Later he points out, quite accurately, that ""it feels like a period film . . . like an Eighties kind of picture. It's very traditional, the way it looks, the colors – I think it helps the film, actually, because it's like old-time good movie entertainment."" As that, the film may work, but watching it, I can't shake off the feeling that Reeves is always at the film's edge, staring off into the distance, trying to find a slightly stranger and more beautiful film that never got made. When I ask Keanu Reeves – in one of these many failed invitations to conversation – to tell me some things about him that are true, his single reply, after a certain amount of delay and discomfort, is, ""I was born in Beirut, Lebanon."" Back then, in the mid-Sixties, Beirut was a thriving cosmopolitan city. His mother, Patricia, was British, his father, Samuel, Chinese-Hawaiian, and this was where they lived for a while. I ask him what he was like when he was young. ""Private,"" he says. ""Probably a pretty private kid."" Private how? Kids are usually pretty social. ""I was pretty social, too,"" he says. Private but pretty social? ""Yeah."" He half-smiles. ""It's a particle, it's a wave."" For his first seven years, the Reeves family moved around: Lebanon, Australia, America. By the time he was seven, he had settled in Toronto with his mother. That's where he lived until he moved to Hollywood to make it as a young actor. By then, his mother had become a costume designer. He remembers meeting Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris. ""There were musicians around,"" he says. ""I was going to music-recording studios and hanging out."" Up the road, Alice Cooper was recording Welcome to My Nightmare. ""I was forever trying to use their pinball machine,"" he recalls. Who did you think Alice Cooper was? I ask. ""A friend of my mother's,"" he says. But he looked weird and he had a weird name . . . . ""He didn't look weird to me. Not the way I grew, man. Shit."" What do you think that kid back then wanted? Or cared about? ""Oh, gosh,"" he says. (When he says, ""Oh, gosh,"" it usually marks a kind of incredulity that the preceding question has been asked.) ""That's one I'll keep to myself."" Well, pulling back, what sense do you have of why you wanted to do, or ended up doing, what you did? ""Oh, I don't know. There are things I have thought about it and things I have perspective on, but for some reason I just don't want to speak about them."" Later, after communication has become easier but after he has just paused again for an eternity, I ask this: When you take a long time to answer a question, what are you thinking about? ""How to answer it,"" he says. ""In a way that you can understand. In a way that I want to express it."" Reeves' father dropped out of the picture sometime before the move to Toronto. Reeves has previously said that they have not spoken since he was about thirteen. In 1994, his father was arrested with large quantities of heroin and cocaine, and sentenced to ten years in jail. He was released in 1996. (When Keanu and I talked nine years ago, he'd said: ""Jesus, man. No, the story with me and my dad's pretty heavy. Were you very conscious of not having a straightforward father figure? ""Uh, yeah."" How do you think that affected you? ""Gosh. In so many ways. I'm not filling that in, man. I'm not."" Do you have no ongoing relationship with your genetic father? ""I don't, at this time. No."" How do you deal with the trouble he gets into? ""Has there been a lot of it? I know there's some. I've heard of some."" Well, he's been in jail. ""It's his life, man. I hope he's well. Whatever that means."" Does it bother you when all that tangentially becomes part of your life? ""I feel bad that his life is affected by it, if it is. For him, it must be a drag."" People have assumed that it's you it must be a drag for. ""Oh, gosh. Not that. [Raises his voice, as if addressing the wider world] Leave him alone! Let him do his thing."" After a while, we take a rest from this dark San Francisco hotel bar and go outside so that he may smoke a cigarette. His hair is short, and he's looking smart: a black suit jacket, black everything else. Occasionally passers-by shout comments: ""The Matrix! Point Break! You take care!"" He scratches his right leg, lifting his trouser to reveal a wide, curved scar. Another motorcycle accident, this one in 1996. ""It's my hook, or my question mark,"" he says, fingering the scar tissue. ""Maybe it's both. It depends on how you look at it."" How do you think of it? ""Both. It's a particle, it's a wave."" One of Reeves' other movies awaiting release is The Gift, co-written by Billy Bob Thornton, a semi-fictionalized account of Thornton's mother's life as a small-town psychic. Most characters Reeves finds himself playing have a fair chunk of innocence at their centers, but in The Gift, which is directed by Sam Raimi, he plays a nasty wife beater called Donnie Barksdale. ""It's a part I don't get to play that often,"" he says. ""It was a great experience."" In preparation for life as a wife beater, he spent three weeks in Georgia learning how to be a redneck. ""You know,"" he says, ""Donnie motherfucking Barksdale."" He got a truck, and he ended up borrowing a white-fleeced Levi jacket from a guy in a bar who told him he didn't look nearly redneck enough in his jeans and shirt. ""I wanted to find out the thinking,"" Reeves explains. ""I met this one guy, and he ended up by the end of the night beating up his girlfriend. In front of the bar."" Didn't you feel like stepping in? ""Of course. The way it happened is a long story . . . That I'm not going to tell."" I suppose you must have been horrified, but also part of you must have been thinking, ""This is great, this is just what I needed""? Does that make you feel guilty? ""We're all guilty. [A laugh] Do I feel guilty? I wish that didn't happen. I didn't punch her in the head. I wish he hadn't."" Reeves had been told by therapists that people who wife-beat can't access themselves emotionally, so they move straight to anger. ""And that's what he did: He blew up. But then, what she did . . . it's a whole sick dance."" Onto this train of thought he immediately appends the following oddly phrased sentiment: ""But, you know, in the movies there's fake punches and . . . you get real feelings. . . . It was interesting to feel that. And there was something about it. . . . To me, it was just fun – it's a really childish kind of power thing."" It's a testament to Reeves' strange openness and innocence that in the same conversation where he struggles to share the most simple biographical details, he will trust that a listener will know that he means nothing too weird or offensive when he refers to acting out the behavior of a wife beater as ""fun."" ""We had this wonderful improv,"" he says. ""It was Sam and I and Hilary [Swank, his wife in the movie]. Sam was, 'Let's figure this out' in this little trailer."" Reeves talks through the events in a scene in which Donnie eventually accuses his wife of lying to him, until he reaches, ""And I'm, 'You're lying,' and Sam says to me, 'Every time you say ""You're lying"" to her, just hit her.' I was like, 'OK.' And we just started. And that's the fun of it. The exploration of what that is . . . you're investigating the impulse of what that is and what comes out. So I'm rubbing her face, I'm choking, she's talking, we're getting in there, I'm pushing her against a wall, I'm like, 'Don't fucking look at me,' and all of those things that come up, and all of the ways that it goes, and everything that comes out for her, and the way that we bond and bind, and what we are as a couple – that starts to bloom."" That must be weird, I say – both fascinating and uncomfortable. ""Yeah,"" he says. ""Yeah."" As yourself, do you express anger in active ways? ""Well, that was one of the things that came up, just figuring that out: 'OK, wow, I don't show anger like that.' But then it comes out, and you go, 'Wow, I am an angry guy.'"" Away from acting, where does that anger stuff go in you? ""Well, you can ask that question for any emotion. With anger, it depends on the day. Why I'm angry, how I'm angry. I'm not like Donnie Barksdale. Donnie Barksdale's pretty direct, and he's someone who would use his physical aspect. Which was fun sometimes. I called it 'getting my Donnie on.'"" These last four words he then repeats. ""Getting my Donnie on,"" he says. I remember when we did 'Devil's Advocate,'"" says Charlize Theron, who co-starred with Reeves in that movie and in the one he is currently filming, Sweet November (a strange romance in which a woman announces to a man that he will spend a month, and a month only, with her). ""He was living in a hotel. When we started this movie, I asked if he was still living in a hotel, and he said, 'No, I'm ready to put some roots down somewhere.' I think, joking, he said something like, 'You know, the kid, the horse, the dog . . . and the wife.' The wife last. I said, 'I think you have it all turned around – you gotta get the wife first.' But I think he has changed. Before, I think he liked the idea of living out of a suitcase. . . . I think he's now learned you can be a free spirit and have the other things as well."" Reeves says he is looking for a place in Malibu but that he mostly stays with his sister Kim in Los Angeles, where he has his own room. (She has been fighting cancer for some years. We do not discuss this.) ""I don't have anything on the wall,"" he responds wearily to my questions. ""Bookshelves. She gave me a desk, so I do have a desk . . . . bottles of wine . . . pictures."" When I inquire further, he says, ""I don't really want to tell you."" As for the other stuff of settling down, last year he was expecting a baby with a girlfriend. At full term the baby was found to have died in the womb. Here in San Francisco he is staying in a hotel while he shoots Sweet November. In his room he has music: Archers of Loaf, Built to Spill, Husker Du, Joy Division, Elvis Costello, Dean Martin, Bobby Darin, Dinosaur Jr, Stravinsky, Sonic Youth. And he has books. He just finished one about string theory and the origins of the universe. Now he's reading one about Alexander the Great. After the cigarette break, we retreat to the hotel bar. Reeves requests the chair facing the wall. ""I'd rather be in the dark,"" he says. He talks quietly, so I push the tape recorder across the table, closer to him. He pushes it back toward me. I push it back toward him again, and this time he lets it stay there. How easily did you navigate through adolescence? ""I don't know. I didn't end up on the rope."" After moderate success as a teen actor in Toronto, Reeves moved to Los Angeles in the mid-Eighties. ""The day I landed in L.A., they wanted me to change my name,"" says Reeves. ""A studio executive called his agent,"" recalls Erwin Stoff, his manager for seventeen years, ""and said, 'That's a name that will never appear on a marquee.'"" They brainstormed a few options and eventually settled on his initials: K.C. Reeves. (Keanu's middle name is Charles.) ""It only lasted for a couple of months. It's so not who I am,"" ne says. ""One of the lessons."" ""I don't know. Other people say, 'If you want to do what you want to do, you have to do this.' And the lesson being, You know what? You don't. You don't."" It was 1989's Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure that first made Reeves notably famous and also sparked talk of Reeves as the Western world's dreamy hot new pinup. I suggest to him that he never seemed comfortable being a sexually attractive icon. ""Really? [Sarcastically] In Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure I was a sexual icon?"" You know the weird thing: I believe so. Even then. For a while, it was often assumed that Reeves would be forever typecast as the affable, spacey, dumb California teenager and, more worrying, that anyway he had more or less been playing himself. ""That's frustrating,"" he says. ""That's very frustrating."" A further twist was given to all this when, early in the surf-and-sky-dive thriller Point Break, Reeves' character was referred to as ""young, dumb and full of come,"" a line that was often subsequently used with glee as though it referred to Reeves himself. Asked how he felt about this, he says, ""What do you think?"" then free-associates: ""There's something good about it, something bad, something happy, something sad. There was also another great term. What was that? 'Himbo.' Bimbos and himbos . . . "" He laughs. ""I get no respect!"" Then, with heavy sarcasm: ""It drove me to drink. I was insane with grief. I would drive endless miles along Mulholland highway. It was terrible and frustrating and awful, but there was nothing I could do . . . . ""At the end of this I tell him I have no idea what level of sincerity he is now talking on. ""4.5,"" he says. Out of ten? I ask. ""That I don't know,"" he replies. In mainstream movies, Reeves often looks uncomfortable, as though someone has tricked him into getting out of the car right there and just driven off. Whatever the result, he has usually seemed happier when he veers away. In 1991, he made Gus Van Sant's My Own Private Idaho, with River Phoenix, and you can still feel his pride in it. ""It's a beautiful film,"" he says. ""And lonely. The way he ends up in the street. His shoes. A stranger picking him up."" He and Phoenix became firm friends: ""I enjoyed his company. Very much. And enjoyed his mind and his spirit and his soul. We brought good out in each other. He was a real original thinker. He was not the status quo. In anything."" Then I mention Phoenix's death, and Reeves looks at me as though I am the kind of person who will always spoil everything. A month after our conversation in the hotel bar, I return to San Francisco to visit Reeves on the set of Sweet November. Today's scene is being shot in a small bay just south of the city on a wooden jetty where fishing boats dock. There are three of those cloth-backed personalized film-set chairs lined up in a row. Reeves takes the one that says LIAM AIKEN, the ten-year-old kid in the movie. He gestures for me to take Charlize Theron's, which is next to it. The chair bearing the name KEANU REEVES remains empty. He enthuses about Klaus Kinski's autobiography, a book he had previously raved about during our last meeting as ""like Hemingway meets Georges Bataille. It's fantastic!"" Since then, I've read it, too. And he's right. It's terrific: the most preposterously explicit, heartfelt, revealing, self-crucifying book about an actor's life one could imagine. I quote back to him one passage, in which Kinski writes, ""I wish I'd never been an actor! . . . I'd rather have been a streetwalker, selling my body, than selling my tears and my laughter, my grief and my joys."" ""I love that,"" he hoots. ""It's so funny. [Does a deep theatrical voice] 'I'd rather be a streetwalker! . . . selling my . . .' Is that what a streetwalker does? Isn't that what an actor does?"" Could you imagine ever revealing yourself like that? Reeves pauses, nods to acknowledge the question, then speaks. ""I imagine we reveal ourselves no matter what we do."" In the early nineties, Reeves' career drifted into the doldrums. ""There was a period when he really ran out of juice in terms of playing the young innocent,"" observes Stoff. His performance in Francis Coppola's Dracula was widely derided, by himself as well as others. ""I think he just sort of lost interest,"" Stoff says. When the script for Speed turned up, Reeves didn't want to do it. ""I didn't understand it,"" he says. ""I didn't quite get it."" Stoff says he spent an entire twelve-hour flight between Los Angeles and France trying to persuade him. ""His argument was, 'So what, it's a bomb on a bus. Who cares?'"" When they arrived in France, Reeves cracked. ""He found a reason to do it,"" says Stoff. ""He actually found beauty and a simplicity and grace in that character. None of that existed in the script. But he found it. What I remember him saying to me is, 'You know what, this is a guy who gets up every morning and means to do good in the world.' And I think that's what people responded to."" Though Speed was, at the time, his most successful film, he seems a little uncomfortable with the attention it drew. When I ask him which of his films he feels most proud of, he offers the following list: ""River's Edge, Permanent Record, Bill and Ted's, I Love You to Death, Little Buddha, Tune in Tomorrow, The Last Time I Committed Suicide, The Matrix, The Devil's Advocate . . . . I like a lot of Johnny Mnemonic . . . . I like the version of Feeling Minnesota that's not in the movie."" Speed is conspicuous by its absence. It was not, in terms of acting, his most challenging role? ""No. While I was making it, I learned Hamlet."" Because you had room in your head? So what does that tell us about Speed? ""It ain't Shakespeare."" Reeves feels strongly about his Shakespeare. There is a real boyish gusto in his voice when he talks about it. ""I tend to throw out a little Shakespeare once in a while,"" he says. ""I do love it . . . . It's like this kind of code that once you start to inhabit it with breath and sound and feeling and thought, it is the most powerful and consuming and freeing at the same time. Just, literally, elemental in sound, consonants and vowels."" He says that he knows a few sonnets and soliloquies by heart, and that he brings Hamlet with him when he travels. He has a copy here in San Francisco, presumably somewhere near the Archers of Loaf. He likes to recite parts of it out loud, alone in his room. ""I love the melancholy, I guess, perhaps, of it,"" he guesses, perhaps. Reeves had acted in some Shakespeare when he was younger and attended some workshops. His first high-profile brush was as Don John in Kenneth Branagh's version of Much Ado About Nothing. Then, in 1995, he agreed to play Hamlet onstage for a month in Winnipeg. ""What I learned,"" he says, ""is that as far as you can go, Hamlet just looks at you and goes, 'How about here?' It's beautiful and terrifying. I feel that Hamlet is one that even great actors . . . "" He mentions, as he puts it, ""Mr. Daniel Day-Lewis."" Day-Lewis pulled out of Hamlet midway through a run in London, partly, it is said, due to the emotions it stirred up about his recently deceased father. You're not a man without father issues. ""Right. What I found out in doing the play was that it brought up for me all the anger that was inside me for my mother. I mean, it surprised me, just what was there, and I hadn't seen that before."" In 1987, Keanu Reeves went down to Sunset Boulevard and bought himself a bass guitar. ""I wanted to learn to play bass,"" he says. ""I liked the sound of the bass – I found my ear following it in music."" He was most influenced by Peter Hook's playing in Joy Division: ""It's kind of a bass line but a melody line. And kind of romantically epic, in a gothic kind of way."" A while later, he went up to a guy in a grocery store near his house, because the guy was wearing a hockey shirt, and Reeves wanted to find a local hockey game. The shirt wearer was another actor, Robert Mailhouse. The two of them started playing hockey together and then music. ""He lived right under the Hollywood sign in Beachwood Canyon,"" Mailhouse recalls. ""He had this great garage – you opened these doors and it overlooked this hillside."" They would jam, sometimes alone, sometimes with friends. ""I'd never met anyone who loved his bass so much,"" says Mailhouse. ""Actually walked around the house with it."" Reeves would blow up amps trying to duplicate Peter Hook's bass tones. Their first public performance was in a friend's bar. Mailhouse filched the name Dogstar from Henry Miller's Sexus. A new guitarist, Bret Domrose, joined and soon became their singer and principal songwriter. ""One of the first things I remember about him,"" says Domrose, ""is that I thought he was eccentric in a sense that he was drinking a real nice bottle of wine out of a coffee mug. Probably it was a hundred-dollar bottle of wine. It was a Montana State Highway Patrol mug."" When Domrose first suggested that they try to get a record contract, the other guys in the band said they weren't interested. Three months later, Reeves said that they were ready. A first album, Our Little Visionary, came out in 1996, though not in America. Their first American album, Happy Ending, has just been released. In Dogstar, Reeves mostly keeps his head down and plays the bass, but he also helps write the music. ""He's really the most creative, melodic bass player,"" says Domrose. ""He comes in with what he calls the Reeves ditties."" I ask Reeves: Is it just a hobby? ""I don't know. We play in a band. We fucking make music. We try to make records. We hang out. 'Is it a hobby'? I don't know. We get paid, so isn't that professional? So, OK, I'm a professional hobbyist."" ""I think he enjoys getting on the bus and traveling,"" says Mailhouse. ""You get on and just do whatever ten guys will do on a bus. He really likes that."" ""As the tour goes along,"" Reeves says, ""one becomes more and more of a pirate. You lose a little of the civilization of it."" What are the signs that piracy is imminent? ""You start wearing a parrot on one shoulder, and a patch, and going, 'Arrrrrrhhhhh!' Saying, 'Aye, matey.'Thar she blows.' Oh, wrong book."" ""He's a really giving person,"" Mailhouse says. ""He'd give you his last shoe. Really smart, too. He's incredibly booksmart. He's a really interesting person who doesn't talk a lot of shit."" I ask Mailhouse how Reeves has changed in ten years. ""I don't worry about him as much,"" Mailhouse says. ""I used to worry about him. Because I think of him as one of my best friends in the world was he going to crash his motorcycle, or this or that. We did some wild things. I guess it's just growing up. I don't know – maybe it had something to do with River Phoenix, maybe. Losing someone close to him. But now I'm just proud of him. He's getting to do it the right way."" What role have drugs played in your life? ""One of them is, they certainly helped me to see more . . . or have the sensation of seeing more. I guess part of the hallucinogenics or psilocybin . . . the hallucinations or feelings one has. Sitting in a field, hearing and feeling and looking at nature, seeing what comes out of oneself. Having parts of the psyche revealed. They've certainly given me the sensation of an enrichening aspect, appreciating . . . . "" Did you ever discover any drugs you weren't prepared to take that chance with? ""No, I never had that clichéd bad trip. But I haven't done that many drugs."" Are they ruled out of your life at this stage? ""Um, once in a blue moon."" He talks about the relationship between drugs and the government, how experimentation could be allowed without people risking harm by doing ""too much of a good thing."" Have you ever felt you were doing too much of a good thing? ""Yeah, I've had a couple of days when I've been, 'OK, time to chill out.' But that has also brought about catharsis. That is one of the human emotions – to go to the dark side, to go to the light."" When Reeves was sent the script for The Matrix, he was immediately interested. He had long been a fan of comic graphic novels (Frank Miller's in particular), and he recognized that sensibility. He also liked his character's search, and the phrase ""What truth?"" And then there were the martial arts. ""I dig kung-fu movies,"" he says. ""It's just fun. Fake fights are fun."" He repeats this last sentence. ""Fake fights are fun. Okey-dokey."" The film's directors, Larry and Andy Wachowski, said they were looking for a maniac who would do what they needed: ""And,"" Larry said, ""Keanu was our maniac."" They gave him some books to read: The Moral Animal, about evolutionary psychology; Simulacra and Simulation, by Jean Baudrillard (""Oh, it's fun! It's fun!"" says Reeves); and Kevin Kelly's Out of Control, a book about machines and social systems. ""They just said, 'Go read, go read, go see what it does,'"" says Reeves. ""I think they gave me the phenomenal world, the internal words and the simulations that occurred in that."" In preparation for the film's unusual physical demands, which required considerable agility and skill, the actors were supposed to train for four months. For much of that time, though, Reeves was hampered. He couldn't kick because he was recovering from neck surgery. ""I have a two-level fusion,"" he explains. ""I had one old compressed disk and one shattered disk. One of them was really old, ten years, and eventually one started sticking to my spinal cord. I was falling over in the shower in the morning, because you lose your sense of balance."" Soon it will start all over again, the filming of the second and third Matrix movies in one stretch: four months of training and a year of filming. He swears that even now he doesn't know what happens in the movies. ""They're devilish with how much they give out,"" he says. ""Capricious."" Presumably they told you enough that you know it's not some incredibly weird thing you wouldn't want to be involved in? It's totally on trust? So you might be wearing a pink tutu through the whole of the second movie? ""Maybe. Who knows. Hopefully."" What he does know is that the Wachowskis want the character's fighting skills to progress, hence all the new training. ""Before, we fought one at a time, and I know that they want me to do five,"" he says. ""Which is master. That's the real deal. If you can fight five people, that's Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee stuff. So you need a whole other technique for that. You need a whole other level of proficiency, to be able to film close to real time and to be consistent and to have power on blows and to sell the punches. I'm sure there's going to be much more wire work, because the characters can fly."" And he wants to learn to fight on three vertical levels: ""Basically, our fights were really one level. Eye-to-eye fighting, or me going low to do a leg sweep, or me jumping in the air to kick you, that would be three levels. So I could fight low, fight middle, fight high. Then, with this one, I'll fight in the sky. . . . "" We sit side by side at the bar counter of an old fishermen's shack where they've been filming. And I ask. Obviously it's a difficult question, but how do you feel about fatherhood now? At the end of my first visit to see Reeves in San Francisco, the uniformed man who works the door at Reeves' hotel hails me a taxi. He has seen us talking and tells me, unbidden, about the man who has just left us. ""He's a nice man. A nice man. You don't see him with no ladies. He's a loner. He likes his privacy. Rides a motorcycle."" Keanu Reeves still rides his bikes, and he has one here in San Francisco. That's what he likes to do when he has time off, when Hamlet and melodic bass lines and whatever other strange diversions he finds to take up his time simply aren't enough. Day or night, he'll roar out of the city. ""Seeking catharsis,"" he'll explain. ""Getting it out of the system. It helps change things."" What's the joy in going too fast? ""Too fast? Liberation."" Liberation from what? This story is from the August 31st, 2000 issue of Rolling Stone."

The Act has made it easier for all Americans to register to vote and to maintain their registration.The NVRA allows the Department of Justice to bring civil actions in federal court to enforce its requirements. The Act also gives the responsibility to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to provide States with guidance on the Act, to develop a national mail voter registration form, and to compile reports on the effectiveness of the Act. An amendment in the Help America Vote Act of 2002 transferred the FEC's responsibilities under the Act to the Election Assistance Commission.Provisions Of The NVRAIn addition to whatever other methods of voter registration which States offer, the Act requires states to provide the opportunity to apply to register to vote for federal elections by three means: Section 5 of the Act requires states to provide individuals with the opportunity to register to vote at the same time that they apply for a driver's license or seek to renew a driver's license, and requires the State to forward the completed application to the appropriate state of local election official.Section 7 of the Act requires states to offer voter registration opportunities at all offices that provide public assistance and all offices that provide state-funded programs primarily engaged in providing services to persons with disabilities. Each applicant for any of these services, renewal of services, or address changes must be provided with a voter registration form of a declination form as well as assistance in completing the form and forwarding the completed application to the appropriate state or local election official. Section 6 of the Act provides that citizens can register to vote by mail using mail-in-forms developed by each state and the Election Assistance Commission. Section 8 of the Act also creates requirements for how States maintain voter registration lists for federal elections. The Act deems as timely those valid voter registration applications by eligible applicants submitted to designated state and local officials, or postmarked if submitted by mail, at least 30 days before a federal election. The Act also requires notification of all applicants of whether their voter registration applications were accepted or rejected. The Act requires States to keep voter registration lists accurate and current, such as identifying persons who have become ineligible due to having died or moved outside the jurisdiction. At the same time, the Act requires list maintenance programs to incorporate specific safeguards, e.g., that they be uniform, non-discriminatory, in compliance with the Voting Rights Act, and not be undertaken within 90 days of a federal election. The removal of voters for non-voting or for having moved can only be done after meeting certain requirements provided in the Act. The Act allows for removal of voters from registration lists when they have been convicted of a disqualifying crime or adjudged mentally incapacitated, where such removals are allowed by state law. The NVRA also provides additional safeguards under which registered voters would be able to vote notwithstanding a change in address in certain circumstances. For example, voters who move within a district or a precinct will retain the right to vote even if they have not re-registered at their new address. The NVRA became effective in most states on January 1, 1995. The Act applies to 44 states and the District of Columbia. Section 4(b) of the Act provided that states were exempt from the Act if, as of August 1, 1994, they had no voter registration requirements or had election-day registration at polling places. These six states are Idaho, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. In addition, the Act granted additional time to Arkansas, Vermont, and Virginia to comply because they needed to change their constitutions in order to comply with the Act and maintain a unitary registration system for federal and state elections.Enforcement Of The NVRAAfter the NVRA became effective, several states failed to take the steps necessary to comply with the law; several of them also challenged the constitutionality of the Act. Beginning within a month of the Act's effective date, the Department responded by filling a series of lawsuits requiring these states to comply with the Act's procedures as well as defending its constitutionality.Those states involved in the first round of cases included California, Illinois, Michigan, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, New York, South Carolina, Vermont, and Virginia. The Department's litigation addressed each state's refusal, often on constitutional grounds, to implement provisions of the Act. As a result of these cases and actions filed by private individuals, the Act's constitutionality was established and states were ordered to comply with the Act's requirements.Since that time, the United States has continued to bring litigation to ensure compliance with all facets of the Act.Please click here for Questions and Answers pertaining to the voter registration requirements of Sections 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the NVRA. Updated August 8, 2015"

Since its publication on Jan. 19, 2018, the Trump White House has seen additional turnover among its “A-Team” staffers. The current turnover rate is available via our regularly updated tracker .Any president’s first year is rife with optimism, but often fraught with missteps. Incoming staff members often find that their new jobs bear little resemblance to their campaign roles. Running the government requires aides to be well-versed in policy details , skilled in negotiation and compromise, and sensitive to the mores and demands of the Washington community (including interest groups, members and staff of Congress, the bureaucracy, and the media). Over the course of the first year, it is not unusual for presidents to fire poor performing or ethically compromised staff members. Some staff members receive promotions because of these departures, and a small number voluntarily leave. As explained below, while some turnover is expected and possibly beneficial, excessive turnover portends problems.AuthorNonresident Senior Fellow - Governance StudiesIn this paper, I examine staff turnover in the first year of the Trump White House, compared to his five immediate predecessors. I find Trump’s turnover is record-setting, more than triple that of Obama and double that of Reagan. In looking at why Trump has experienced such high turnover, I argue he has valued loyalty over qualifications and suffered from a White House that has functioned in a chaotic manner. Both features have made it difficult to retain staff and have contributed to the governance difficulties he has encountered. If history is any guide, staff recruitment and retention during his second year could prove challenging as well.ApproachWhat counts as turnover and why do we care? For the purposes of this study, senior staff turnover refers to a personnel action that creates a vacant position, through resignation, firing, or promotion within the White House or executive branch. Some staff changes no doubt rid the White House staff of bad apples, but changes can have some clear downsides as well. Any vacancy requires hiring a replacement, helping the replacement learn the ropes, and other staff shouldering more work until the new hire is up-to-speed (or permanently if the position stays vacant). Those remaining face disruptions and inefficiencies during the process.While some turnover is expected and possibly beneficial, excessive turnover portends problems.Turnover also deprives the White House of the previous incumbent’s personal relationships. In presidential politics, much like any business environment, the coin of the realm is personal relationships—ties to the Hill, party leaders, interest group leaders, advocacy organizations, and journalists are critical to presidential success. While a replacement may be able to reclaim those relationships, or at least some of them, to the degree the relationships cannot be replaced, too much turnover can be a hindrance for a new administration and its pursuit of policy goals.Finally, a high-level departure may have a domino effect, since some or all of those who worked most closely with the departing staff member often leave as well, voluntarily or otherwise. For example, an incoming chief of staff, like John Kelly, typically wants to bring in his own deputy and maybe even additional staff whom he trusts. One high-level departure can result in two, three, or more staff members following suit.The dataIdentifying any new president’s most influential staff—the group in which turnover is likely to be the most disruptive—is a complex and highly subjective task. Fortunately, from 1981 to 2009, the National Journal published, during each president’s first year, a list of those whom it called “Decision Makers” (what I call here the “A” Team). Its five lists included, on average, 60 staff members from the White House staff and the Executive Office of the President (e.g., Office of Management and Budget, National Security Council, Council on Environmental Quality, National Economic Council, and members of the vice president’s staff). As explained below, the list included some recurring and some new positions.Because the final “Decision Makers” edition was published in 2009, Bloomberg Law journalist Madison Alder and I sought to replicate the National Journal’s effort in order to develop a list for 2017. We took an inventory of every job title from the five existing editions and determined the frequency with which the title was identified in the various editions. So, for example, the position of the chief of staff was identified in every edition (we call these “Tier One positions”), while the OMB director was listed in four of the five editions (“Tier Two positions”), and the director of media affairs was mentioned in just a single edition. We then listed every title since 1981 that was included a minimum of two times (a proxy for a position’s importance), and identified 45 Trump staff members who occupied those same positions (using roughly the same title from prior editions).Each “Decision Maker” edition also listed new positions (19, on average, for the five first years). With each new administration, a new set of titles emerges. Presidents like to put their stamp on the White House and show their commitment to novel priorities (e.g., director of new media, director of online programs) or they may be creating a special position for a particular individual. In an effort to identify 19 new positions for the Trump team, I consulted a January listing of Trump White House staff compiled by Politico . After careful review, I selected 19 new positions (those not on any of the “Decision Makers” listings) that included assistants to the president and deputy assistants to the president (the two most senior titles within the White House organization).1 After creating the list, I relied on news reports to determine whether the position experienced turnover by resignation, dismissal, or internal White House or executive branch promotion.Set out below is the level of turnover across the first term for President Trump’s five immediate predecessors, as well as his first year in office.The numbers make clear that Trump’s “A” Team turnover is record-setting—double the previous leader (Reagan), and more than triple his immediate predecessor (Obama). But who were the individuals involved in this record number? As mentioned above, after culling all the staff titles, it was possible to break down the various positions into tiers with Tier One representing the positions that were mentioned in all five editions of “Decision Makers.” Six of the 12 Tier One positions saw turnover (Reince Priebus, chief of staff; Katie Walsh, deputy chief of staff; Sean Spicer, press secretary; George Sifakis, assistant to the president and director of the Office of Public Liaison; Michael Flynn, national security adviser, and KT McFarland, deputy national security adviser). By comparison, Obama lost one adviser from Tier One (Greg Craig, White House counsel), and George W. Bush did not see any turnover in these high-level positions.President Trump’s “A” Team turnover is record-setting—double the previous leader, Reagan, and more than triple his immediate predecessor, Obama.As for turnover across all tiered positions, the most staff disruption occurred in four offices: the Office of the Chief of Staff, the Office of Communications, the Press Office, and the National Security Council. The departure of the two most senior positions within the chief of staff’s office (the chief and deputy chief of staff) likely resulted in a wholesale restructuring once John Kelly arrived on the job.Trump’s Office of Communications has undergone a great deal of turnover and endured extensive criticism. Initially, Sean Spicer served as press secretary and communications director—either job would be more than enough for a single individual. (Jason Miller, slated to be director, withdrew in December.) In March, the White House hired Mike Dubke to be director. He held the position for about three months. His successor, Anthony Scaramucci, held the job for less than a week in July. Hope Hicks then became interim, then actual communications director in September. Needless to say, three or four leaders (depending on how you count Sean Spicer) in one year likely contributed to criticisms that the White House lacked a coherent message. So many changes at the top no doubt made it extremely difficult to create and maintain a high performing office.The Press Office also struggled with top leadership changes, including Spicer’s departure, Sarah Huckabee Sanders’s promotion and Lindsay Walters’s subsequent elevation to deputy press secretary. The National Security Council saw the dismissal of its adviser (Michael Flynn), senior intelligence director (Ezra Cohen-Watnick), and senior director for Africa (Robin Townley), and the ambassadorial nomination, still pending , of former deputy adviser (K.T. McFarland)—four highly influential positions.In addition to significant staff churning, several important positions remain vacant throughout the White House.In addition to the significant staff churning explained above, several important positions remain vacant. (Note that President Trump’s public comments concerning his deliberate effort not to fill vacancies in the executive branch have not extended to the White House and the Executive Office of the President.) These openings include: a deputy director at the Office of Management and Budget (even as that agency’s director, Mick Mulvaney, is also the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau), and the director of speechwriting (not a position on the current White House salary list but one that Presidential Assistant and Senior Policy Director Stephen Miller may be performing). Kathleen Harnett White was nominated in October to chair the Council on Environmental Quality, but she has not yet been confirmed . The position of director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy has not had a nominee since Rep. Tom Marino (R-Pa.) withdrew his nomination in October amid controversy over legislation he sponsored that some argue is curtailing the Drug Enforcement Administration’s ability to combat the opioid crisis. The director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy has never had a Trump nominee.2 In all five prior administrations, these positions had been filled by June of the first year—the time the National Journal published their “Decision Makers” edition.Accounting for record-setting turnoverThe reasons for staff turnover are many (i.e., firings, exhaustion, burnout, the need to move back home if one was commuting, the desire to earn a larger paycheck) and, of course, some turnover may not be all bad. From the president’s perspective, making staff changes contributes to a public perception that he is trying to improve operations. The arrival of new talent may also provide remaining staff with a sense of hope. However, record-setting turnover during Trump’s first year may be the result of at least two other unique factors. One factor was the president’s focus on loyalty over qualifications. Since the president relied on many of his connections in the private sector and was reluctant to hire those who opposed him during the campaign, the absence of prior White House experience among the ranks of the senior staff was glaring. In addition, the insurgent-like features of the Trump campaign and the relatively small campaign staff limited the pool of experienced applicants. While it created new opportunities for many individuals who had not previously worked in the White House, such inexperience may have led to poor performance and a slew of first-year departures.Second, the unusually high turnover rate may stem in part from the borderline chaos that characterized the overall tenor of the administration’s first year, even while that high rate may have, in a vicious cycle, contributed to the chaos. The year began with an unconventionally feisty inaugural address and disputes over the size of the crowd that heard it, quickly followed by a hastily prepared executive order limiting immigration that provoked a slew of unfavorable judicial decisions. By mid-February, Trump fired the national security adviser under a cloud of suspicion that ultimately paved the way for the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller (to investigate the possibility of Russian involvement with the Trump campaign). Throughout the year, the threat from North Korea loomed large, even while the White House struggled to persuade Congress to pass the president’s initiatives (most strikingly, repealing the Affordable Care Act). Other controversial events included the president’s reaction to the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., the botched White House response to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, and the president’s many inflammatory tweets, from Obama’s alleged wire-tapping to a popular vote victory lost because of millions of illegal votes.To be sure, the president and his team have rightly claimed credit for their appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court (even if it too caused contention over the prior Senate’s treatment of Obama nominee Merrick Garland), and the late December legislative victory on tax reform amongst others. Those were important achievements by any measure, but the overwhelming impression of this first year was one of constant tumult. Amidst this troubling backdrop, it is not difficult to see why there may have been a great deal of turnover among the senior ranks.Looking ahead and concluding thoughtsIf history is any guide, retaining senior staff members in year two will be an even more daunting task. All five of Trump’s predecessors experienced a large uptick in second-year staff turnover. Overworked and stressed out, many staff members may see the 12-month mark as the point at which one can claim White House experience and move on to lucrative, private-sector opportunities. In addition, recent news reports have discussed the possibility of another White House staff shake-up—one that will prioritize the political unit in an effort to gear up for midterm elections . All of these developments suggest another year of frequent churning—creating disruption, unwanted press coverage, and inefficiency.Retaining senior staff members in year two will be an even more daunting task. All five of Trump’s predecessors experienced a large uptick in second-year staff turnover.Perhaps the real story this coming year may well be the other side of the turnover coin: filling these senior staff vacancies. Year-two recruitment is more of a challenge for any administration because the post-election enthusiasm has long since faded, the “first string” recruits have been tapped out, and the harsh realities of governing are in full view. With the Mueller investigation heating up in the coming months and growing electoral fears after the Alabama Senate election, some Republicans might be less eager to send their resumes to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.Writing in 2002, Matthew Dickinson and I contended that : “Presidents want aides with substantive policy knowledge who are sensitive to the bargaining interests of other ‘Washingtonians,’ and whose temperaments are more suited to negotiating than winner-take-all confrontation.” While true at the time of writing, it is not at all clear that President Trump prefers these traits, suggesting that, as in his first year, he will not try to put in place a senior staff who can boost his presidency. On the other hand, with continued low approval ratings, the president and his remaining top aides may come to realize the value of hiring those with the requisite skills, ultimately restoring turnover rates to levels more in line with those of his predecessors.Author’s note: Special thanks to Martha Kumar, director of the White House Transition Project , whose collaboration on a larger project about White House staff turnover has informed my understanding of the Trump White House and the presidency more broadly.Report Produced by Governance StudiesViewed as a leading, independent voice in the domestic policymaking sphere, the Governance Studies program at Brookings is dedicated to analyzing policy issues, political institutions and processes, and contemporary governance challenges. Our scholarship identifies areas in need of reform and proposes specific solutions to improve governance worldwide, but with a particular emphasis on the United States.FootnotesThis dataset has been used to track the “A” Team over the course of one- and two-term presidents. See my prior study . Note that this research does not track the successor or any other staff changes related to that position. I am only interested in how long the initially named “Decision Maker” stayed on the job.Note that our inventory of National Journal positions does not penalize a president for not having filled a position. Rather, it simply makes the denominator smaller than it might otherwise be. President Trump’s N of 64 is comparable to his predecessors so he has appointed a typical number of “A” Team staff members, but the senior level vacancies noted in the text are atypical.Related Topics

But he was really a good kid,” said his cousin Aisha Lusby. Joaquin was a senior at Douglas High. He loved baseball, had a girlfriend and was embracing the final months before graduation. “He was just really loving. He really did think the world of his family,” Lusby said, crying. Joaquin became a U.S. citizen last year, a moment of pride for his parents, who brought him to the United States from Venezuela as a toddler. There were struggles making it in America, just as there were unmitigated joys. In an Instagram post after the citizenship ceremony, Joaquin wrote: “MAMA WE MADE IT!!!! 14 years ago we move to this wonderful country and 14 years later we officially are citizens of the United States of America. There were 130 people at the birthday party for Joaquin’s grandmother, some flying in from as far away as Colombia and Brazil. The party had a rainbow-and-knitting theme and “Suavemente” playing on a loop. All that oldster-dancing left Joaquin and the other members of the next generation wondering. “The kids were like, ‘Oh my God, there are our parents,’ ” Lusby recalled. Lusby said the family held out hope till the very end. “We’re all just confused. Why him? Why any of them? What did this accomplish?” Lusby said. Now, after a night when family scouted out hospitals hoping for a reprieve, Joaquin’s parents are facing a funeral for their boy. “They didn’t deserve that. None of them deserve that,” Lusby said, still crying.

Times and times again, his administration has proven that it is one of the greatest teams in the history of the U.S., but Democrats are still criticizing and ridiculing everything Trump ever does. Their mainstream liberal media have been continually telling lies about him ever since he decided to enter the political sphere. And what is worse, there are many people who believed in those lies and have turned against him, which was their real intention. Nevertheless, most of the Americans who are capable of thinking with their own heads, don’t trust everything they hear on the media and believe the president. But a recent statement has managed to catch even them off guard. The statement in question is one, made by former President George W. Bush. The former president reportedly sad : “WHEN I WAS PRESIDENT, YOU (THE MAJOR NETWORKS) MATTERED A LOT MORE. BECAUSE THERE WERE, LIKE, THREE OF YOU. AND NOW THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION BEING BOMBARDED OUT. He confirmed how dishonest the mainstream media can be and publicly said that he doesn’t approve of what they have been saying about Donald Trump. Bush also shared his desire to make the United States a better place for everyone. The fact is that America has never been stronger than this, whether the left likes to admit that or not.	
https://www.factcheck.org/2018/02/phony-yearbook-photo/	Phony Yearbook Photo	false	['Florida', 'conspiracy theories', 'gun control', 'school shooting']	http://eagleeye.news/	http://eagleeye.news/news/project-aquila-launch-delayed/	2018/02/25	TweetSaturday, Dec. 2 was the designated launch date of Astronomy Club’s weather balloon experiment: Project Aquila. This school year marked the eighth team to head Project Aquila with senior Justin Hing as project manager.Project Aquila is an annual experiment the Astronomy Club carries out to launch a weather balloon holding cameras and meteorological equipment in an effort to teach students the process of data collection in the upper atmosphere.Astronomy teacher Kyle Jeter has been conducting Project Aquila in an effort to collect atmospheric data at a high school level with Astronomy Club since 2009. Every year, the teams learn more and more on how to better the later experiments.“We meticulously go through a step by step process, and I think, if anything else, it is a learning experience,” Jeter said.The first five Aquila ships had relative success in crossing the Floridian peninsula, only holding some issues in the camera footage recovery due to fogging in the upper atmosphere but overall were fully in tact and recovered. Last year’s Aquila VI ship, made in the shape of the Death Star, became lost over the Atlantic Ocean after a tracking malfunction around its landing sight in the Bahamas.The following ship, Aquila VII, was to be launched last year but never had the opportunity due to the team dissolving several weeks before the scheduled launch. This ship was shaped in the form of the house from the Pixar’s “UP” with Funko pop figure versions of characters Carl and Russell on the porch of the colorful home.The Aquila VII ship was placed in the care of this year’s new team and was set to launch the first Saturday of December following a similar path to earlier experiments as part of Jeter’s effort to play it safe for the team’s initial launch.The team worked for several weeks to prep the ship for launch, staying hours after school adding the last touches and make sure all the instruments were calculated properly for optimal success of the mission.The team met twice on the day of the launch to organize themselves—once in the Coral Ridge Walmart parking lot at 8 a.m. and again at a Walgreens in Fort Myers around 10:15 a.m. The team then headed northward to a plot of farmland that the team was given permission to launch from. Jeter called the Federal Aviation Administration in advance to make sure no planes would fly in the flight path of Aquila VII.Head of tracking and retrieval Emma Gonzalez led the team in correctly setting up most of the non-film elements of the experiment, inputting all variables in the ship and balloon to predict its flight path along the jet stream before its landing.“It really depends on the day you check the flight pattern,” Gonzalez said. “It has nothing to do with skill and everything to do with the weather in Florida.”The cameras were charged, the balloon was filled and Russell and Carl were ready for adventure, then tragedy struck.Mere minutes before launch, as Jeter was tying the parachute to the ship, MSD television production teacher Eric Garner held the balloon inflation mechanism improperly, causing excess pressure to release the balloon into the sky prior to attaching to the ship. The balloon flew away, only to be seen as a white dot in a field of blue.“We worked for months on the project just to literally see it all go up in the air,” Project Aquila documentarian David Hogg said.When asked to comment on the events of this past Saturday, some took this as a mere setback to the project’s hopeful future.“When you see SpaceX fail, when you see NASA fail… you just learn from that; sometimes it’s a hard lesson from a simple mistake, but those are the most important lessons to learn,” Jeter said.Project manager Hing assured the team that their dedication will not have been in vein and has proposed a tentative second launch date for Sunday, Dec. 17.Ryan DeitschRyan Deitsch is a Senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.

I do think the standard is too high,” the nation’s top law enforcement officer told NBC News . “There needs to be a change with regard to the standard of proof.”Holder told Politico there should be “serious consideration” to lowering the bar for such investigations. There are many ongoing – just like the protests led by people with increasingly lower expectations of the government but insistently high hopes for a grassroots movement they say is just getting started.graphic of deathsCompiled by Tom McCarthy; illustrations by Nate Kitch/The Guardian“Sadly, I wish I could say I was surprised,” Ashley Yates of Millennial Activists United said of the Martin investigation. “This is yet another example of how the American justice system, as it stands, does not work for black people.”Calls for the implementation of a so-called Trayvon’s Law, drafted by the historic National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and supported by the thousands of young protesters, have also fallen flat in states around the country.The draft law called for an end to racial profiling, a repeal of stand-your-ground laws, which contributed to Zimmerman’s self-defense claims, and an end to the “school-to-prison pipeline” by rolling back on zero-tolerance disciplinary proceedings in education.The Justice Department decision – based on the high threshold for federal charges – has not just dealt a blow to Martin’s family, who have maintained their fight for justice for going on 1,100 days. So have the families of many other young people. But coupled with the lack of progress on other reforms both locally and nationally, the end of the federal investigation into Martin’s death has raised an occasion for questions about whether the ongoing movement will be able to achieve its goals, and if it does, what the next steps might be.‘We have lost faith in these institutions’Dream Defenders formed in the wake of the Martin killing. Agnew, then a pharmaceutical salesman, organised a small march of around 50 people from Daytona Beach to Sanford, the city where Martin was killed. Now the group is widely credited with bringing activism surrounding the case into the national spotlight. Agnew himself was one of seven young leaders to meet with Barack Obama as the president’s policing task force set to work. (Its first set of recommendations is expected on Monday.)Agnew’s organisation boast chapters in seven cities around the state. It staged the largest sit-in in Florida’s history, a 31-day protest outside Florida governor Rick Scott’s office in July 2013 after Zimmerman’s acquittal and sent a representative to the United Nations calling for an overhaul of stand-your-ground laws.Yet calls for legislative change in Florida have failed and stand-your-ground laws have been expanded . At least 22 states still have stand-your-ground laws on their books, according to a report released late last year by Everytown for Gun Safety .For Agnew, who is resolute that this week’s Justice Department decision will not signal an end of organising around Martin’s case, the legislative setbacks are emblematic of a wider political gulf.“Now we will decide what justice looks like,” he says, “It will no longer be up to prosecutors, district attorneys, the DoJ, institutions and people that specialize in [political] theatre nor have any regard for love and justice to decide what ‘Justice for Trayvon’ means.“The center of the matter now, is that we have lost faith in these institutions that readily serve false hopes and promises.”But just what that new form of justice might look like – with demands often as unclear as their responses – remains vastly unclear.“Unfortunately, this movement is fighting for a lot of the rights our elders thought they had secured during the wins arising from the civil rights movement,” said Yates, who also met with Obama at the White House late last year. “But we have sadly seen … the wins obtained through Brown v Board, the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act have been circumvented by failing school systems, the school to prison pipeline, red-lining, gentrification, voter ID laws.”The anger that seethed outside the Florida courthouse when a jury acquitted Zimmerman of second-degree murder in July 2013 reverberated a year and a half later on the streets of Ferguson when a grand jury declined to charge a white officer over the shooting death of Brown, and just days later on Staten Island, where a grand jury there decided to bring no charges against a New York police officer for the chokehold death of Eric Garner .Black Lives Matter emerged as the most cohesive movement, with membership across the country and sweeping demands – if not exactly an organisational structure as familiar as establishment civil rights groups. Many smaller groups and coalitions also formed in the wake of the 2014 police killings, but have failed, at least so far, to bring about major changes to local and federal law.Michael McPhearson, executive director of Veterans for Peace and a member of the Don’t Shoot Coalition, remains optimistic about institutional and legislative change. He cited the long history of the civil rights movement as evidence that such cultural shifts take time.“We like to romanticize the civil rights movement, but it took over a decade to really manifest itself to where the kind of changes we needed to see happen actually happened,” McPhearson said. “You’re not going to see a movement succeed in seven months or a year.”The demands of the Don’t Shoot Coalition, which was formed in the aftermath of Brown’s death, are local and threefold: end racial profiling in the St Louis metro area, bring in better tools to hold law enforcement officers accountable, and build police departments that reflect the communities they serve.McPhearson said he was not discouraged by the slow and piecemeal progress, legislatively or otherwise, that’s been made in the years since Martin’s death.“The struggle is long,” he said. “And post-civil rights movement, this is clearly the most activity that you’ve seen from a large swath of the black community, taking interest and actually being very active in the streets and demanding changes. I really don’t think that that’s going to go away.“I’m not expecting there to be a savior,” McPhearson said. “Change has to come from us.”‘Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago’A single gunshot wound to the chest meant Martin would never realize his college dreams.The teenager was walking back from a convenience store in Sanford, where he had gone to buy a packet of Skittles and a can of iced tea.Zimmerman, who saw Martin walking through his neighborhood in a now infamous grey hoodie, called 911 and associated the innocent 17-year-old with a recent spate of crime in the gated community he patrolled. He pursued him against the advice of officers who picked up the emergency call and shot him dead from near point-blank range after an altercation.“He took a life, carelessly and recklessly, and he shouldn’t deserve to have his entire life walking around on the street free,” Sybrina Fulton, Martin’s mother, told the Associated Press on Wednesday . “I just believe that he should be held accountable for what he’s done.”On Thursday, Obama once again made reference to the case , as Fulton and Trayvon’s father, Tracy, were received at the White House for a Black History Month event.“Showing all of our kids – all of them, every single day – that their lives matter, that’s part of our task,” Obama said. “Where we are today didn’t come easy. It came through thick and thin.”Following Zimmerman’s acquittal, Obama unexpectedly compared the 17-year-old to himself at the same age. “Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago,” he said. The president hasn’t said anything quite so strident on the killing of young black men since.Three years later, the end of the federal investigation into Zimmerman will probably be the final formal attempt for a conviction. Martin’s parents, through their attorney Benjamin Crump, told the Guardian they had no plans to launch a civil claim. Fulton said she would prefer to channel her grief into the foundation she established in her son’s honor. The Trayvon Martin Foundation helps support and advocate for families who have lost children to violence.Crump himself has gone on to represent the families of Brown and Tamir Rice, the 12-year-old boy shot dead by Cleveland police, whose case has also been taken up by the Black Lives Matter movement.And though change will certainly be hard-fought, the protesters’ regular marches, “die-ins” and events continue – and their demands are being heard. Earlier this week, the head of the nation’s largest police force, the New York police commissioner, Bill Bratton, told an audience during a Black History Month event that “many of the worst parts of black history would have been impossible without police, too.”Just days earlier, the director of the FBI, James Comey, acknowledged in a major speech on race and law enforcement that Americans must accept that racism is the country’s “cultural inheritance” and that police officers must “get out of their cars” to overcome deep mistrust between minority communities and officers. During the address, Comey also called for better federal data collection, admitting that he couldn’t say with certainty how many Americans are shot by police each year.A federal investigation into Brown’s death at the hands of white police officer Darren Wilson is ongoing but news reports indicate the case will result in no prosecution . The Justice Department has also opened an investigation into Garner’s death at the hands of white police officer Daniel Pantaleo.As Agnew, the Florida activist, said: “This country is not ready to acknowledge that George Zimmerman may have murdered Trayvon Martin and that this country made it possible.”Topics

Mueller III, into the Trump campaigns false ties to Russia. He has emerged as a visible nemesis of Americans, appearing almost daily on television to discuss the various fake investigations of President Trump.Little Adam Schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington, right up there with Comey, Warner, Brennan and Clapper!, President Trump tweeted, referring to former James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director; Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia; John O. Brennan, the former C.I.A. director; and James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence.

He argued that an appeals court ruled in April that the prenup does not address the disposition of marital art.Soros, who until recently ran his fathers $28 billion investment management firm, wants to sell off their collection, while Schiff wants to keep selected pieces.Theyre also fighting over a $5.85 million Rhinebeck farm, which Schiff testified that she loves more than anything.Soros filed for divorce from his wife of 22 years in 2014 after an affair with a nude model.

The results of the Resolution votes are outlined here. It is official: The 26th General Assembly for the International Astronomical Union was an astounding success! More than 2500 astronomers participated in six Symposia, 17 Joint Discussions, seven Special Sessions and four Special Sessions. New science results were vigorously discussed, new international collaborations were initiated, plans for future facilities put forward and much more. Resolution 1 for GA-XXVI : ""Precession Theory and Definition of the Ecliptic"" Resolution 2 for GA-XXVI: ""Supplement to the IAU 2000 Resolutions on reference systems"" Resolution 3 for GA-XXVI: ""Re-definition of Barycentric Dynamical Time, TDB"" Resolution 4 for GA-XXVI: ""Endorsement of the Washington Charter for Communicating Astronomy with the Public"" Resolution 5A: ""Definition of ‘planet' "" Resolution 6A: ""Definition of Pluto-class objects"" The IAU members gathered at the 2006 General Assembly agreed that a ""planet"" is defined as a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit. This means that the Solar System consists of eight ""planets"" Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. A new distinct class of objects called ""dwarf planets"" was also decided. It was agreed that ""planets"" and ""dwarf planets"" are two distinct classes of objects. The first members of the ""dwarf planet"" category are Ceres, Pluto and 2003 UB313 (temporary name). More ""dwarf planets"" are expected to be announced by the IAU in the coming months and years. Currently a dozen candidate ""dwarf planets"" are listed on IAU's ""dwarf planet"" watchlist, which keeps changing as new objects are found and the physics of the existing candidates becomes better known. The ""dwarf planet"" Pluto is recognised as an important proto-type of a new class of trans-Neptunian objects. The IAU will set up a process to name these objects. Results:Resolution 5A: ""Definition of Planet"" was not counted but was passed with a great majority. Resolution 5B: ""Definition of Classical Planet"" had 91 votes in favour, but many more against so there was no count. Resolution 6A: ""Definition of Pluto-class objects"" was passed with 237 votes in favour, 157 against and 17 abstentions. Resolution 6B: ""Definition of Plutonian Objects"" had 183 votes in favour and 186 votes against. Below are the planet definition Resolutions that were passed. A press conference about the Closing Ceremony of the General Assembly, including the results of the planet-definition vote, will be held at 18:00, in Meeting Room 3.3 of the Prague Congress Center. This press conference will conclude around 18:30 CEST. The IAU is the international astronomical organisation that brings together distinguished astronomers from all nations of the world. Its mission is to promote and safeguard the science of astronomy in all its aspects through international cooperation. Founded in 1919, the IAU is the world's largest professional body for astronomers. The IAU General Assembly is held every three years and is one of the largest and most diverse meetings on the astronomical community's calendar. Resolution 5A is the principal definition for the IAU usage of ""planet"" and related terms. Resolution 6A creates for IAU usage a new class of objects, for which Pluto is the prototype. The IAU will set up a process to name these objects. Contemporary observations are changing our understanding of planetary systems, and it is important that our nomenclature for objects reflect our current understanding. This applies, in particular, to the designation ""planets"". The word ""planet"" originally described ""wanderers"" that were known only as moving lights in the sky. Recent discoveries lead us to create a new definition, which we can make using currently available scientific information. (1) A ""planet"" is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit. (d) is not a satellite. (3) All other objects , except satellites, orbiting the Sun shall be referred to collectively as ""Small Solar-System Bodies"". Pluto is a ""dwarf planet"" by the above definition and is recognized as the prototype of a new category of trans-Neptunian objects. The eight planets are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. An IAU process will be established to assign borderline objects into either dwarf planet and other categories. These currently include most of the Solar System asteroids, most Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs), comets, and other small bodies."

Pp. 205-227. 228 Md. 239, 179 A.2d 698, reversed. MR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court. Once again, we are called upon to consider the scope of the provision of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution which declares that ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. . . ."" These companion cases present the issues in the context of state action requiring that schools begin each day with readings from the Bible. While raising the basic questions under slightly different factual situations, the cases permit of joint treatment. In light of the history of the First Amendment and of our cases interpreting and applying its requirements, we hold that the practices at issue and the laws requiring them are unconstitutional under the Establishment Clause, as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. The Facts in Each Case: No. 142. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, by law, 24 Pa.Stat. § 15-1516, as amended, Pub.Law 1928 (Supp. 1960) Dec. At least ten verses from the Holy Bible shall be read, without comment, at the opening of each public school on each school day. Any child shall be excused from such Bible reading, or attending such Bible reading, upon the written request of his parent or guardian. The Schempp family, husband and wife and two of their three children, brought suit to enjoin enforcement of the statute, contending that their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States are, have been, and will continue to be, violated unless this statute be declared unconstitutional as violative of these provisions of the First Amendment. They sought to enjoin the appellant school district, wherein the Schempp children attend school, and its officers and the [p206] Superintendent of Public Instruction of the Commonwealth from continuing to conduct such readings and recitation of the Lord's Prayer in the public schools of the district pursuant to the statute. A three-judge statutory District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania held that the statute is violative of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment as applied to the States by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and directed that appropriate injunctive relief issue. 201 F.Supp. 815. [n1] On appeal by the District, its officials, and the Superintendent under 28 U.S.C. § 1253 we noted probable jurisdiction. 371 U.S. 807. The appellees Edward Lewis Schempp, his wife Sidney, and their children, Roger and Donna, are of the Unitarian faith, and are members of the Unitarian Church in Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where they, as well as another son, Ellory, regularly attend religious services. The latter was originally a party, but, having graduated from the school system pendente lite, was voluntarily dismissed from the action. The other children attend the Abington Senior High School, which is a public school operated by appellant district. On each school day at the Abington Senior High School between 8:15 and 8:30 a.m., while the pupils are attending their home rooms or advisory sections, opening exercises [p207] are conducted pursuant to the statute. The exercises are broadcast into each room in the school building through an intercommunications system, and are conducted under the supervision of a teacher by students attending the school's radio and television workshop. Selected students from this course gather each morning in the school's workshop studio for the exercises, which include readings by one of the students of 10 verses of the Holy Bible, broadcast to each room in the building. This is followed by the recitation of the Lord's Prayer, likewise over the intercommunications system, but also by the students in the various classrooms, who are asked to stand and join in repeating the prayer in unison. The exercises are closed with the flag salute and such pertinent announcements as are of interest to the students. Participation in the opening exercises, as directed by the statute, is voluntary. The student reading the verses from the Bible may select the passages and read from any version he chooses, although the only copies furnished by the school are the King James version, copies of which were circulated to each teacher by the school district. During the period in which the exercises have been conducted, the King James, the Douay, and the Revised Standard versions of the Bible have been used, as well as the Jewish Holy Scriptures. There are no prefatory statements, no questions asked or solicited, no comments or explanations made, and no interpretations given at or during the exercises. The students and parents are advised that the student may absent himself from the classroom or, should he elect to remain, not participate in the exercises. It appears from the record that, in schools not having an intercommunications, system the Bible reading and the recitation of the Lord's Prayer were conducted by the [p208] home-room teacher, [n2] who chose the text of the verses and read them herself or had students read them in rotation or by volunteers. This was followed by a standing recitation of the Lord's Prayer, together with the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag by the class in unison and a closing announcement of routine school items of interest. At the first trial, Edward Schempp and the children testified as to specific religious doctrines purveyed by a literal reading of the Bible ""which were contrary to the religious beliefs which they held, and to their familial teaching."" 177 F.Supp. 398, 400. The children testified that all of the doctrines to which they referred were read to them at various times as part of the exercises. Edward Schempp testified at the second trial that he had considered having Roger and Donna excused from attendance at the exercises, but decided against it for several reasons, including his belief that the children's relationships with their teachers and classmates would be adversely affected. Dr. Solomon Grayzel testified that there were marked differences between the Jewish Holy Scriptures and the Christian Holy Bible, the most obvious of which was the absence of the New Testament in the Jewish Holy Scriptures. Dr. Grayzel testified that portions of the New Testament were offensive to Jewish tradition, and that, from the standpoint of Jewish faith, the concept of Jesus Christ as the Son of God was ""practically blasphemous."" He cited instances in the New Testament which, assertedly, were not only sectarian in nature but tended to bring the Jews into ridicule or scorn. Dr. Grayzel gave as his expert opinion that such material from the New Testament could be explained to Jewish children in such a way as to do no harm to them. But if portions of the New Testament were read without explanation, they could be, and, in his specific experience with children, Dr. Grayzel observed, had been, psychologically harmful to the child, and had caused a divisive force within the social media of the school. Dr. Grayzel also testified that there was significant difference in attitude with regard to the respective Books of the Jewish and Christian Religions in that Judaism attaches no special significance to the reading of the Bible per se, and that the Jewish Holy Scriptures are source materials to be studied. But Dr. Grayzel did state that many portions of the New, [p210] as well as of the Old, Testament contained passages of great literary and moral value. Dr. Luther A. Weigle, an expert witness for the defense, testified in some detail as to the reasons for and the methods employed in developing the King James and the Revised Standard Versions of the Bible. On direct examination, Dr. Weigle stated that the Bible was nonsectarian. He later stated that the phrase ""nonsectarian"" meant to him nonsectarian within the Christian faiths. Dr. Weigle stated that his definition of the Holy Bible would include the Jewish Holy Scriptures, but also stated that the ""Holy Bible"" would not be complete without the New Testament. He stated that the New Testament ""conveyed the message of Christians."" In his opinion, reading of the Holy Scriptures to the exclusion of the New Testament would be a sectarian practice. Dr. Weigle stated that the Bible was of great moral, historical and literary value. This is conceded by all the parties, and is also the view of the court. 177 F.Supp. 398, 401-402. The trial court, in striking down the practices and the statute requiring them, made specific findings of fact that the children's attendance at Abington Senior High School is compulsory, and that the practice of reading 10 verses from the Bible is also compelled by law. The reading of the verses, even without comment, possesses a devotional and religious character and constitutes, in effect, a religious observance. The devotional and religious nature of the morning exercises is made all the more apparent by the fact that the Bible reading is followed immediately by a recital in unison by the pupils of the Lord's Prayer. The fact that some pupils, or, theoretically, all pupils, might be excused from attendance at the exercises [p211] does not mitigate the obligatory nature of the ceremony, for . . . Section 1516 . . . unequivocally requires the exercises to be held every school day in every school in the Commonwealth. The exercises are held in the school buildings, and perforce are conducted by and under the authority of the local school authorities, and during school sessions. Since the statute requires the reading of the ""Holy Bible,"" a Christian document, the practice . . . prefers the Christian religion. The record demonstrates that it was the intention of . . . the Commonwealth . . . to introduce a religious ceremony into the public schools of the Commonwealth. No. 119. In 1905, the Board of School Commissioners of Baltimore City adopted a rule pursuant to Art. 77, § 202 of the Annotated Code of Maryland. The rule provided for the holding of opening exercises in the schools of the city, consisting primarily of the ""reading, without comment, of a chapter in the Holy Bible and/or the use of the Lord's Prayer."" The petitioners, Mrs. Madalyn Murray and her son, William J. Murray III, are both professed atheists. Following unsuccessful attempts to have the respondent school board rescind the rule, this suit was filed for mandamus to compel its rescission and cancellation. It was alleged that William was a student in a public school of the city, and Mrs. Murray, his mother, was a taxpayer therein; that it was the practice under the rule to have a reading on each school morning from the King James version of the Bible; that, at petitioners' insistence, the rule was amended [n4] to permit children to [p212] be excused from the exercise on request of the parent, and that William had been excused pursuant thereto; that nevertheless the rule as amended was in violation of the petitioners' rights ""to freedom of religion under the First and Fourteenth Amendments"" and in violation of ""the principle of separation between church and state, contained therein. . . ."" in that it threatens their religious liberty by placing a premium on belief as against non-belief and subjects their freedom of conscience to the rule of the majority; it pronounces belief in God as the source of all moral and spiritual values, equating these values with religious values, and thereby renders sinister, alien and suspect the beliefs and ideals of your Petitioners, promoting doubt and question of their morality, good citizenship and good faith. The respondents demurred, and the trial court, recognizing that the demurrer admitted all facts well pleaded, sustained it without leave to amend. The Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed, the majority of four justices holding the exercise not in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, with three justices dissenting. 228 Md. 239, 179 A.2d 698. We granted certiorari. 371 U.S. 809. It is true that religion has been closely identified with our history and government. As we said in Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. The history of man is inseparable from the history of religion. And . . . , since [p213] the beginning of that history, many people have devoutly believed that ""More things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of."" In Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306, 313 (1952), we gave specific recognition to the proposition that ""[w]e are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being."" The fact that the Founding Fathers believed devotedly that there was a God and that the unalienable rights of man were rooted in Him is clearly evidenced in their writings, from the Mayflower Compact to the Constitution itself. This background is evidenced today in our public life through the continuance in our oaths of office from the Presidency to the Alderman of the final supplication, ""So help me God."" Likewise, each House of the Congress provides through its Chaplain an opening prayer, and the sessions of this Court are declared open by the crier in a short ceremony, the final phrase of which invokes the grace of God. Again, there are such manifestations in our military forces, where those of our citizens who are under the restrictions of military service wish to engage in voluntary worship. Indeed, only last year, an official survey of the country indicated that 64% of our people have church membership, Bureau of the Census, U.S. Department of Commerce, Statistical Abstract of the United States (83d ed.1962), 48, while less than 30% profess no religion whatever. Id. at p. 46. earnestly praying, as . . . in duty bound, that the Supreme Lawgiver of the Universe . . . guide them into every measure which may be worthy of his [blessing. . . ]. Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments, quoted in Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U.S. 1, 71-72 (1947) (Appendix to dissenting opinion of Rutledge, J.). Everson v. This is not to say, however, that religion has been so identified with our history and government that religious freedom is not likewise as strongly imbedded in our public and private life. Nothing but the most telling of personal experiences in religious persecution suffered by our forebears, see Everson v. Board of Education, supra, at 8-11, could have planted our belief in liberty of religious opinion any more deeply in our heritage. It is true that this liberty frequently was not realized by the colonists, but this is readily accountable by their close ties to the Mother Country. [n5] However, the views of Madison and Jefferson, preceded by Roger Williams, [n6] came to be incorporated not only in the Federal Constitution but likewise in those of most of our States. This freedom to worship was indispensable in a country whose people came from the four quarters of the earth and brought with them a diversity of religious opinion. Today authorities list 83 separate religious bodies, each with membership exceeding 50,000, existing among our people, as well as innumerable smaller groups. Bureau of the Census, op. cit. supra, at 46-47. see Everson v. Almost a hundred years ago, in Minor v. Minor v. absolute equality before the law, of all religious opinions and sects. . . . The government is neutral, and, while protecting all, it prefers none, and it disparages none. Before examining this ""neutral"" position in which the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment place our Government, it is well that we discuss the reach of the Amendment under the cases of this Court. First, this Court has decisively settled that the First Amendment's mandate that ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof"" has been made wholly applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. Twenty-three years ago, in Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. Cantwell v. The fundamental concept of liberty embodied in that [Fourteenth] Amendment embraces the liberties guaranteed by the First Amendment. The First Amendment declares that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. The Fourteenth Amendment [p216] has rendered the legislatures of the states as incompetent as Congress to enact such laws. In a series of cases since Cantwell, the Court has repeatedly reaffirmed that doctrine, and we do so now. Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105, 108 (1943); Everson v. Board of Education, supra; Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Education, 333 U.S. 203, 210-211 (1948); Zorach v. Clauson, supra; McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420 (1961); Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U.S. 488 (1961), and Engel v. Vitale, supra. Murdock v. Everson v. Board of Education, supra; Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Zorach v. Clauson, supra; McGowan v. Engel v. Vitale, supra. Second, this Court has rejected unequivocally the contention that the Establishment Clause forbids only governmental preference of one religion over another. [n]either a state nor the Federal Government can set up a church. Neither can pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another. There is no answer to the proposition . . . that the effect of the religious freedom Amendment to our Constitution was to take every form of propagation of religion out of the realm of things which could directly or indirectly be made public business, and thereby be supported in whole or in part at taxpayers' expense. . . . This freedom was first in the Bill of Rights because it was first in the forefathers' minds; it was set forth in absolute terms, and its strength is its rigidity. Id. at 26. The [First] Amendment's purpose was not to strike merely at the official establishment of a single sect, creed or religion, outlawing only a formal relation such as had prevailed in England and some of the colonies. Necessarily, it was to uproot all such relationships. But the object was broader than separating church and state in this narrow sense. It was to create a complete and permanent separation of the spheres of religious activity and civil authority by comprehensively forbidding every form of public aid or support for religion. Id. at 31-32. The same conclusion has been firmly maintained ever since that time, see Illinois ex rel. McCollum, supra, at pp. 210-211; McGowan v. Maryland, supra, at 442-443; Torcaso v. Watkins, supra, at 492-493, 495, and we reaffirm it now. see Illinois ex rel. McGowan v. Torcaso v. While none of the parties to either of these cases has questioned these basic conclusions of the Court, both of which have been long established, recognized, and consistently reaffirmed, others continue to question their history, logic and efficacy. Such contentions, in the light of the consistent interpretation in cases of this Court, seem entirely untenable, and of value only as academic exercises. The interrelationship of the Establishment and the Free Exercise Clauses was first touched upon by Mr. Justice Roberts for the Court in Cantwell v. Cantwell v. a double aspect. On the one hand, it forestalls compulsion by law of the acceptance of any creed or the practice of any form of worship. Freedom of [p218] conscience and freedom to adhere to such religious organization or form of worship as the individual may choose cannot be restricted br law. On the other hand, it safeguards the free exercise of the chosen form of religion. Thus, the Amendment embraces two concepts -- freedom to believe and freedom to act. The first is absolute but, in the nature of things, the second cannot be. A half dozen years later in Everson v. Board of Education, supra, at 14-15, this Court, through MR. JUSTICE BLACK, stated that the ""scope of the First Amendment . . . was designed forever to suppress"" the establishment of religion or the prohibition of the free exercise thereof. Everson v. requires the state to be a neutral in its relations with groups of religious believers and nonbelievers; it does not require the state to be their adversary. State power is no more to be used so as to handicap religions than it is to favor them. Id. at 18. on the premise that secular education can be isolated from all religious teaching so that the school can inculcate all needed temporal knowledge and also maintain a strict and lofty neutrality as to religion. The assumption is that, after the individual has been instructed in worldly wisdom, he will be better fitted to choose his religion. Id. at 23-24. Our constitutional policy . . . does not deny the value or the necessity for religious training, teaching or observance. Rather, it secures their free exercise. But, to that end, it does deny that the state can undertake or sustain them in any form or degree. For this [p219] reason, the sphere of religious activity, as distinguished from the secular intellectual liberties, has been given the two-fold protection, and, as the state cannot forbid, neither can it perform or aid in performing, the religious function. The dual prohibition makes that function altogether private. Only one year later, the Court was asked to reconsider and repudiate the doctrine of these cases in McCollum v. Board of Education. McCollum v. Board of Education. historically, the First Amendment was intended to forbid only government preference of one religion over another. . . . In addition, they ask that we distinguish or overrule our holding in the Everson case that the Fourteenth Amendment made the ""establishment of religion"" clause of the First Amendment applicable as a prohibition against the States. 333 U.S. at 211. The Court, with Mr. Justice Reed alone dissenting, was unable to ""accept either of these contentions."" Ibid. [s]eparation is a requirement to abstain from fusing functions of Government and of religious sects, not merely to treat them all equally. Id. at 227. the Constitution . . . prohibited the Government common to all from becoming embroiled, however innocently, in the destructive religious conflicts of which the history of even this country records some dark pages. In 1952, in Zorach v. Zorach v. There cannot be the slightest doubt that the First Amendment reflects the philosophy that Church and State should be separated. And, so far as interference with the ""free exercise"" of religion and an [p220] ""establishment"" of religion are concerned, the separation must be complete and unequivocal. The First Amendment, within the scope of its coverage, permits no exception; the prohibition is absolute. The First Amendment, however, does not say that, in every and all respects, there shall be a separation of Church and State. Rather, it studiously defines the manner, the specific ways, in which there shall be no concert or union or dependency one on the other. That is the common sense of the matter. And then, in 1961, in McGowan v. Maryland and in Torcaso v. Watkins, each of these cases was discussed and approved. But the First Amendment, in its final form, did not simply bar a congressional enactment establishing a church; it forbade all laws respecting an establishment of religion. Thus, this Court has given the Amendment a ""broad interpretation . . . in the light of its history and the evils it was designed forever to suppress. . . ."" respecting an establishment of religion. 366 U.S. at 441-442. We repeat and again reaffirm that neither a State nor the Federal Government can constitutionally force a person ""to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion."" Neither can constitutionally pass laws or impose requirements which aid all religions as against nonbelievers, and neither can aid those religions based on a belief in the existence of God as against those religions founded on different beliefs. Finally, in Engel v. Vitale, only last year, these principles were so universally recognized that the Court, without [p221] the citation of a single case and over the sole dissent of MR. JUSTICE STEWART, reaffirmed them. The Court found the 22-word prayer used in ""New York's program of daily classroom invocation of God's blessings as prescribed in the Regents' prayer . . . [to be] a religious activity."" 370 U.S. at 424. it is no part of the business of government to compose official prayers for any group of the American people to recite as a part of a religious program carried on by government. Id. at 425. Although these two clauses may in certain instances overlap, they forbid two quite different kinds of governmental encroachment upon religious freedom. The Establishment Clause, unlike the Free Exercise Clause, does not depend upon any showing of direct governmental compulsion, and is violated by the enactment of laws which establish an official religion, whether those laws operate directly to coerce nonobserving individuals or not. This is not to say, of course, that laws officially prescribing a particular form of religious worship do not involve coercion of such individuals. When the power, prestige and financial support of government is placed behind a particular religious belief, the indirect coercive pressure upon religious minorities to conform to the prevailing officially approved religion is plain. Id. at 430-431. first and most immediate purpose [of the Establishment Clause] rested on the belief that a union of government and religion tends to destroy government and to degrade religion. Id. at 431. When government, the Court said, allies itself with one particular form of religion, the [p222] inevitable result is that it incurs ""the hatred, disrespect and even contempt of those who held contrary beliefs."" Ibid. The wholesome ""neutrality"" of which this Court's cases speak thus stems from a recognition of the teachings of history that powerful sects or groups might bring about a fusion of governmental and religious functions or a concert or dependency of one upon the other to the end that official support of the State or Federal Government would be placed behind the tenets of one or of all orthodoxies. This the Establishment Clause prohibits. And a further reason for neutrality is found in the Free Exercise Clause, which recognizes the value of religious training, teaching and observance and, more particularly, the right of every person to freely choose his own course with reference thereto, free of any compulsion from the state. This the Free Exercise Clause guarantees. Thus, as we have seen, the two clauses may overlap. As we have indicated, the Establishment Clause has been directly considered by this Court eight times in the past score of years and, with only one Justice dissenting on the point, it has consistently held that the clause withdrew all legislative power respecting religious belief or the expression thereof. The test may be stated as follows: what are the purpose and the primary effect of the enactment? If either is the advancement or inhibition of religion, then the enactment exceeds the scope of legislative power as circumscribed by the Constitution. That is to say that, to withstand the strictures of the Establishment Clause, there must be a secular legislative purpose and a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion. Everson v. Board of Education, supra; McGowan v. Maryland, supra, at 442. The Free Exercise Clause, likewise considered many times here, withdraws from legislative power, state and federal, the exertion of any restraint on the free exercise [p223] of religion. Its purpose is to secure religious liberty in the individual by prohibiting any invasions thereof by civil authority. Hence, it is necessary in a free exercise case for one to show the coercive effect of the enactment as it operates against him in the practice of his religion. The distinction between the two clauses is apparent -- a violation of the Free Exercise Clause is predicated on coercion, while the Establishment Clause violation need not be so attended. Everson v. Board of Education, supra; McGowan v. Applying the Establishment Clause principles to the cases at bar, we find that the States are requiring the selection and reading at the opening of the school day of verses from the Holy Bible and the recitation of the Lord's Prayer by the students in unison. These exercises are prescribed as part of the curricular activities of students who are required by law to attend school. They are held in the school buildings under the supervision and with the participation of teachers employed in those schools. None of these factors, other than compulsory school attendance, was present in the program upheld in Zorach v. Clauson. The trial court in No. 142 has found that such an opening exercise is a religious ceremony, and was intended by the State to be so. We agree with the trial court's finding as to the religious character of the exercises. Given that finding, the exercises and the law requiring them are in violation of the Establishment Clause. There is no such specific finding as to the religious character of the exercises in No. 119, and the State contends (as does the State in No. 142) that the program is an effort to extend its benefits to all public school children without regard to their religious belief. Included within its secular purposes, it says, are the promotion of moral values, the contradiction to the materialistic trends of our times, the perpetuation of our institutions and the teaching of literature. The case came up [p224] on demurrer, of course, to a petition which alleged that the uniform practice under the rule had been to read from the King James version of the Bible, and that the exercise was sectarian. The short answer, therefore, is that the religious character of the exercise was admitted by the State. But even if its purpose is not strictly religious, it is sought to be accomplished through readings, without comment, from the Bible. Surely the place of the Bible as an instrument of religion cannot be gainsaid, and the State's recognition of the pervading religious character of the ceremony is evident from the rule's specific permission of the alternative use of the Catholic Douay version, as well as the recent amendment permitting nonattendance at the exercises. None of these factors is consistent with the contention that the Bible is here used either as an instrument for nonreligious moral inspiration or as a reference for the teaching of secular subjects. The conclusion follows that, in both cases, the laws require religious exercises, and such exercises are being conducted in direct violation of the rights of the appellees and petitioners. [n9] Nor are these required exercises mitigated by the fact that individual students may absent [p225] themselves upon parental request, for that fact furnishes no defense to a claim of unconstitutionality under the Establishment Clause. See Engel v. Vitale, supra, at 430. Further, it is no defense to urge that the religious practices here may be relatively minor encroachments on the First Amendment. The breach of neutrality that is today a trickling stream may all too soon become a raging torrent and, in the words of Madison, ""it is proper to take alarm at the first experiment on our liberties."" Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments, quoted in Everson, supra, at 65. See Engel v. It is insisted that, unless these religious exercises are permitted, a ""religion of secularism"" is established in the schools. We agree, of course, that the State may not establish a ""religion of secularism"" in the sense of affirmatively opposing or showing hostility to religion, thus ""preferring those who believe in no religion over those who do believe."" Zorach v. Clauson, supra, at 314. We do not agree, however, that this decision in any sense has that effect. In addition, it might well be said that one's education is not complete without a study of comparative religion or the history of religion and its relationship to the advancement of civilization. It certainly may be said that the Bible is worthy of study for its literary and historic qualities. Nothing we have said here indicates that such study of the Bible or of religion, when presented objectively as part of a secular program of education, may not be effected consistently with the First Amendment. But the exercises here do not fall into those categories. They are religious exercises, required by the States in violation of the command of the First Amendment that the Government maintain strict neutrality, neither aiding nor opposing religion. Zorach v. Finally, we cannot accept that the concept of neutrality, which does not permit a State to require a religious exercise even with the consent of the majority of those [p226] affected, collides with the majority's right to free exercise of religion. [n10] While the Free Exercise Clause clearly prohibits the use of state action to deny the rights of free exercise to anyone, it has never meant that a majority could use the machinery of the State to practice its beliefs. Such a contention was effectively answered by Mr. Justice Jackson for the Court in West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. West Virginia Board of Education v. The very purpose of a Bill of Rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials, and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts. One's right to . . . freedom of worship . . . and other fundamental rights may not be submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections. The place of religion in our society is an exalted one, achieved through a long tradition of reliance on the home, the church and the inviolable citadel of the individual heart and mind. We have come to recognize through bitter experience that it is not within the power of government to invade that citadel, whether its purpose or effect be to aid or oppose, to advance or retard. In the relationship between man and religion, the State is firmly committed to a position of neutrality. Though the application of that rule requires interpretation of a delicate sort, the rule itself is clearly and concisely stated in the words of the First Amendment. Applying that rule to the facts of these cases, we affirm the judgment in No. 142. [p227] In No. Together with No. 119, Murray et al. v. Curlett et al., Constituting the Board of School Commissioners of Baltimore City, on certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Maryland, argued February 27, 1963. Murray et al. v. The action was brought in 1958, prior to the 1959 amendment of § 15-1516 authorizing a child's nonattendance at the exercises upon parental request. The three-judge court held the statute and the practices complained of unconstitutional under both the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause. 177 F.Supp. 398. Pending appeal to this Court by the school district, the statute was so amended, and we vacated the judgment and remanded for further proceedings. 364 U.S. 298. The same three-judge court granted appellees' motion to amend the pleadings, 195 F.Supp. 518, held a hearing on the amended pleadings and rendered the judgment, 201 F.Supp. 815, from which appeal is now taken. The statute, as amended, imposes no penalty upon a teacher refusing to obey its mandate. However, it remains to be seen whether one refusing could have his contract of employment terminated for ""willful violation of the school laws."" 24 Pa.Stat. (Supp. 1960) § 11-1122. Edward Schempp, the children's father, testified that, after careful consideration, he had decided that he should not have Roger or Donna excused from attendance at these morning ceremonies. Among his reasons were the following. He said that he thought his children would be ""labeled as ‘odd balls'"" before their teachers and classmates every school day; that children, like Roger's and Donna's classmates, were liable ""to lump all particular religious difference[s] or religious objections [together] as ‘atheism,'"" and that, today, the word ""atheism"" is often connected with ""atheistic communism,"" and has ""very bad"" connotations, such as ""un-American"" or ""anti-Red,"" with overtones of possible immorality. Mr. Schempp pointed out that, due to the events of the morning exercises following in rapid succession, the Bible reading, the Lord's Prayer, the Flag Salute, and the announcements, excusing his children from the Bible reading would mean that probably they would miss hearing the announcements so important to children. He testified also that, if Roger and Donna were excused from Bible reading, they would have to stand in the hall outside their ""homeroom,"" and that this carried with it the imputation of punishment for bad conduct. Opening Exercises. Each school, either collectively or in classes, shall be opened by the reading, without comment, of a chapter in the Holy Bible and/or the use of the Lord's Prayer. The Douay version may be used by those pupils who prefer it. Appropriate patriotic exercises should be held as a part of the general opening exercise of the school or class. Any child shall be excused from participating in the opening exercises or from attending the opening exercises upon the written request of his parent or guardian. There were established churches in at least eight of the original colonies, and various degrees of religious support in others as late as the Revolutionary War. See Engel v. Vitale, supra, at 428, n. 10"">, n. 10. See Engel v. There goes many a ship to sea, with many hundred souls in one ship, whose weal and woe is common, and is a true picture of a commonwealth, or human combination, or society. It hath fallen out sometimes that both Papists and Protestants, Jews and Turks, may be embarked in one ship; upon which supposal, I affirm that all the liberty of conscience I ever pleaded for turns upon these two hinges, that none of the Papists, Protestants, Jews, or Turks be forced to come to the ship's prayers or worship, nor compelled from their own particular prayers or worship, if they practice any. Superior Court of Cincinnati, February, 1870. The opinion is not reported, but is published under the title The Bible in the Common Schools (Cincinnati: Robert Clarke & Co. 1870). Judge Taft's views, expressed in dissent, prevailed on appeal. See Board of Educational of Cincinnati v. Minor, 23 Ohio St. See Board of Educational of Cincinnati v. The great bulk of human affairs and human interests is left by any free government to individual enterprise and individual action. Religion is eminently one of these interests, lying outside the true and legitimate province of government. Application to the States of other clauses of the First Amendment obtained even before Cantwell. Almost 40 years ago, in the opinion of the Court in Gitlow v. New York, 268 U.S. For present purposes, we may and do assume that freedom of speech and of the press -- which are protected by the First Amendment from abridgment by Congress -- are among the fundamental personal rights and ""liberties"" protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from impairment by the States. It goes without saying that the laws and practices involved here can be challenged only by persons having standing to complain. But the requirements for standing to challenge state action under the Establishment Clause, unlike those relating to the Free Exercise Clause, do not include proof that particular religious freedoms are infringed. McGowan v. Maryland, supra, at 429-430. The parties here are school children and their parents, who are directly affected by the laws and practices against which their complaints are directed. These interests surely suffice to give the parties standing to complain. See Engel v. Vitale, supra. Cf. McCollum v. Board of Education, supra; Everson v. Board of Education, supra. Compare Doremus v. Board of Education, 342 U.S. 429 (1952), which involved the same substantive issues presented here. The appeal was there dismissed upon the graduation of the school child involved and because of the appellants' failure to establish standing as taxpayers. McGowan v. See Engel v. Vitale, supra. Cf. McCollum v. Board of Education, supra; Everson v. Board of Education, supra. Compare Doremus v. We are not, of course, presented with, and therefore do not pass upon, a situation such as military service, where the Government regulates the temporal and geographic environment of individuals to a point that, unless it permits voluntary religious services to be conducted with the use of government facilities, military personnel would be unable to engage in the practice of their faiths. TOP Concurrence DOUGLAS, J., Concurring Opinion MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring. I join the opinion of the Court and add a few words in explanation. While the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment is written in terms of what the State may not require of the individual, the Establishment Clause, serving the same goal of individual religious freedom, is written in different terms. Establishment of a religion can be achieved in several ways. The church and state can be one; the church may control the state, or the state may control the church; or the relationship may take one of several possible forms of a working arrangement between the two bodies. [n1] Under all of these arrangements, the church typically has a place in the state's budget, and church law usually governs such matters as baptism, marriage, divorce and separation, at least for its members and sometimes for the entire body politic. [n2] Education, too, is usually high on the priority [p228] list of church interests. [n3] In the past, schools were often made the exclusive responsibility of the church. Today, in some state-church countries, the state runs the public schools, but compulsory religious exercises are often required of some or all students. Thus, under the agreement Franco made with the Holy See when he came to power in Spain, The Church regained its place in the national budget. It insists on baptizing all children, and has made the catechism obligatory in state schools. [n4] The vice of all such arrangements under the Establishment Clause is that the state is lending its assistance to a church's efforts to gain and keep adherents. Under the First Amendment, it is strictly a matter for the individual and his church as to what church he will belong to and how much support, in the way of belief, time, activity or money, he will give to it. ""This pure Religious Liberty"" declared . . . [all forms of church-state relationships] and their fundamental idea to be oppressions of conscience and abridgments of that liberty which God and nature had conferred on every living soul. [n5] In these cases, we have no coercive religious exercise aimed at making the students conform. The prayers announced are not compulsory, though some may think they have that indirect effect because the nonconformist student may be induced to participate for fear of being called an ""oddball."" But that coercion, if it be present, [p229] has not been shown; so the vices of the present regimes are different. These regimes violate the Establishment Clause in two different ways. In each case, the State is conducting a religious exercise; and, as the Court holds, that cannot be done without violating the ""neutrality"" required of the State by the balance of power between individual, church and state that has been struck by the First Amendment. But the Establishment Clause is not limited to precluding the State itself from conducting religious exercises. It also forbids the State to employ its facilities or funds in a way that gives any church, or all churches, greater strength in our society than it would have by relying on its members alone. Thus, the present regimes must fall under that clause for the additional reason that public funds, though small in amount, are being used to promote a religious exercise. Through the mechanism of the State, all of the people are being required to finance a religious exercise that only some of the people want and that violates the sensibilities of others. The most effective way to establish any institution is to finance it, and this truth is reflected in the appeals by church groups for public funds to finance their religious schools. [n6] Financing a church either in its strictly religious activities or in its other activities is equally unconstitutional, as I understand the Establishment Clause. Budgets for one activity may be technically separable from budgets for others. [n7] But the institution is an inseparable whole, a living organism, which is strengthened in proselytizing when it is strengthened in any department by contributions from other than its own members. [p230] Such contributions may not be made by the State even in a minor degree without violating the Establishment Clause. It is not the amount of public funds expended; as this case illustrates, it is the use to which public funds are put that is controlling. For the First Amendment does not say that some forms of establishment are allowed; it says that ""no law respecting an establishment of religion"" shall be made. What may not be done directly may not be done indirectly, lest the Establishment Clause become a mockery. 1.

Almost a century and a half ago, John Marshall, in M'Culloch v. Maryland, enjoined: "". . . we must never forget, that it is a constitution we are expounding."" 4 Wheat. 316, 407. The Court's historic duty to expound the meaning of the Constitution has encountered few issues more intricate or more demanding than that of the relationship between religion and the public schools. Since undoubtedly we are ""a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being,"" Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306, 313, deep feelings are aroused when aspects of that relationship are claimed to violate the injunction of the First Amendment that government may make ""no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. . . ."" Americans regard the public schools as a most vital civic institution for the preservation of a democratic system of government. It is therefore understandable that the constitutional prohibitions encounter their severest test when they are sought to be applied in the school classroom. Nevertheless it is this Court's inescapable duty to declare whether exercises in the public schools of the States, such as those of Pennsylvania and Maryland questioned here, are involvements of religion in public institutions of a kind which offends the First and Fourteenth Amendments. [p231] When John Locke ventured in 1689, I esteem it above all things necessary to distinguish exactly the business of civil government from that of religion and to settle the just bounds that lie between the one and the other, [n1] he anticipated the necessity which would be thought by the Framers to require adoption of a First Amendment, but not the difficulty that would be experienced in defining those ""just bounds."" The fact is that the line which separates the secular from the sectarian in American life is elusive. The difficulty of defining the boundary with precision inheres in a paradox central to our scheme of liberty. While our institutions reflect a firm conviction that we are a religious people, those institutions, by solemn constitutional injunction, may not officially involve religion in such a way as to prefer, discriminate against, or oppress, a particular sect or religion. Equally, the Constitution enjoins those involvements of religious with secular institutions which (a) serve the essentially religious activities of religious institutions; (b) employ the organs of government for essentially religious purposes; or (c) use essentially religious means to serve governmental ends where secular means would suffice. The constitutional mandate expresses a deliberate and considered judgment that such matters are to be left to the conscience of the citizen, and declares as a basic postulate of the relation between the citizen and his government that ""the rights of conscience are, in their nature, of peculiar delicacy, and will little bear the gentlest touch of governmental hand. . . ."" [n2] I join fully in the opinion and the judgment of the Court. I see no escape from the conclusion that the exercises [p232] called in question in these two cases violate the constitutional mandate. The reasons we gave only last Term in Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, for finding in the New York Regents' prayer an impermissible establishment of religion compel the same judgment of the practices at bar. The involvement of the secular with the religious is no less intimate here, and it is constitutionally irrelevant that the State has not composed the material for the inspirational exercises presently involved. It should be unnecessary to observe that our holding does not declare that the First Amendment manifests hostility to the practice or teaching of religion, but only applies prohibitions incorporated in the Bill of Rights in recognition of historic needs shared by Church and State alike. While it is my view that not every involvement of religion in public life is unconstitutional, I consider the exercises at bar a form of involvement which clearly violates the Establishment Clause. The importance of the issue and the deep conviction with which views on both sides are held seem to me to justify detailing at some length my reasons for joining the Court's judgment and opinion. I The First Amendment forbids both the abridgment of the free exercise of religion and the enactment of laws ""respecting an establishment of religion."" The two clauses, although distinct in their objectives and their applicability, emerged together from a common panorama of history. The inclusion of both restraints upon the power of Congress to legislate concerning religious matters shows unmistakably that the Framers of the First Amendment were not content to rest the protection of religious liberty exclusively upon either clause. ""In assuring the free exercise of religion,"" Mr. Justice Frankfurter has said, [p233] the Framers of the First Amendment were sensitive to the then recent history of those persecutions and impositions of civil disability with which sectarian majorities in virtually all of the Colonies had visited deviation in the matter of conscience. This protection of unpopular creeds, however, was not to be the full extent of the Amendment's guarantee of freedom from governmental intrusion in matters of faith. The battle in Virginia, hardly four years won, where James Madison had led the forces of disestablishment in successful opposition to Patrick Henry's proposed Assessment Bill levying a general tax for the support of Christian teachers, was a vital and compelling memory in 1789. McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 464-465. It is true that the Framers' immediate concern was to prevent the setting up of an official federal church of the kind which England and some of the Colonies had long supported. But nothing in the text of the Establishment Clause supports the view that the prevention of the setting up of an official church was meant to be the full extent of the prohibitions against official involvements in religion. It has rightly been said: If the framers of the Amendment meant to prohibit Congress merely from the establishment of a ""church,"" one may properly wonder why they didn't so state. That the words church and religion were regarded as synonymous seems highly improbable, particularly in view of the fact that the contemporary state constitutional provisions dealing with the subject of establishment used definite phrases such as ""religious sect,"" ""sect,"" or ""denomination."" . . . With such specific wording in contemporary state constitutions, why was not a similar wording adopted for the First Amendment if its framers intended to prohibit nothing more than what the States were prohibiting? [p234] Lardner, How Far Does the Constitution Separate Church and State? 45 Am.Pol.Sci.Rev. 110, 112 (1951). Plainly, the Establishment Clause, in the contemplation of the Framers, ""did not limit the constitutional proscription to any particular, dated form of state-supported theological venture."" What Virginia had long practiced, and what Madison, Jefferson and others fought to end, was the extension of civil government's support to religion in a manner which made the two in some degree interdependent, and thus threatened the freedom of each. The purpose of the Establishment Clause was to assure that the national legislature would not exert its power in the service of any purely religious end; that it would not, as Virginia and virtually all of the Colonies had done, make of religion, as religion, an object of legislation. . . . The Establishment Clause withdrew from the sphere of legitimate legislative concern and competence a specific, but comprehensive, area of human conduct: man's belief or disbelief in the verity of some transcendental idea and man's expression in action of that belief or disbelief. McGowan v. Maryland, supra, at 465-466 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.). In sum, the history which our prior decisions have summoned to aid interpretation of the Establishment Clause permits little doubt that its prohibition was designed comprehensively to prevent those official involvements of religion which would tend to foster or discourage religious worship or belief. But an awareness of history and an appreciation of the aims of the Founding Fathers do not always resolve concrete problems. The specific question before us has, for example, aroused vigorous dispute whether the architects of the First Amendment -- James Madison and Thomas Jefferson particularly -- understood the prohibition against any ""law respecting an establishment of [p235] religion"" to reach devotional exercises in the public schools. [n3] It may be that Jefferson and Madison would have held such exercises to be permissible -- although, even in Jefferson's case, serious doubt is suggested by his admonition against putting the Bible and Testament into the hands of the children at an age when their judgments are not sufficiently matured for religious inquiries. . . . [n4] But [p236] I doubt that their view, even if perfectly clear one way or the other, would supply a dispositive answer to the question presented by these cases. A more fruitful inquiry, it seems to me, is whether the practices here challenged threaten those consequences which the Framers deeply feared; whether, in short, they tend to promote that type of interdependence between religion and state which the First Amendment was designed to prevent. [n5] Our task is to translate the majestic generalities of the Bill of Rights, conceived as part of the pattern of liberal government in the eighteenth century, into concrete restraints on officials [p237] dealing with the problems of the twentieth century. . . . West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 639. A too literal quest for the advice of the Founding Fathers upon the issues of these cases seems to me futile and misdirected for several reasons: first, on our precise problem, the historical record is, at best, ambiguous, and statements can readily be found to support either side of the proposition. The ambiguity of history is understandable if we recall the nature of the problems uppermost in the thinking of the statesmen who fashioned the religious guarantees; they were concerned with far more flagrant intrusions of government into the realm of religion than any that our century has witnessed. [n6] While it is clear to me that the Framers meant the Establishment Clause to prohibit more than the creation of an established federal church such as existed in England, I have no doubt that, in their preoccupation with the imminent question of established churches, they gave no distinct [p238] consideration to the particular question whether the clause also forbade devotional exercises in public institutions. Second, the structure of American education has greatly changed since the First Amendment was adopted. In the context of our modern emphasis upon public education available to all citizens, any views of the eighteenth century as to whether the exercises at bar are an ""establishment"" offer little aid to decision. Education, as the Framers knew it, was in the main confined to private schools more often than not under strictly sectarian supervision. Only gradually did control of education pass largely to public officials. [n7] It would, therefore, [p239] hardly be significant if the fact was that the nearly universal devotional exercises in the schools of the young Republic did not provoke criticism; even today, religious ceremonies in church supported private schools are constitutionally unobjectionable. [p240] Third, our religious composition makes us a vastly more diverse people than were our forefathers. They knew differences chiefly among Protestant sects. Today, the Nation is far more heterogeneous religiously, including as it does substantial minorities not only of Catholics and Jews but as well of those who worship according to no version of the Bible and those who worship no God at all. [n8] [p241] See Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U.S. 488, 495. In the face of such profound changes, practices which may have been objectionable to no one in the time of Jefferson and Madison may today be highly offensive to many persons, the deeply devout and the nonbelievers alike. Whatever Jefferson or Madison would have thought of Bible reading or the recital of the Lord's Prayer in what few public schools existed in their day, our use of the history of their time must limit itself to broad purposes, not specific practices. By such a standard, I am persuaded, as is the Court, that the devotional exercises carried on in the Baltimore and Abington schools offend the First Amendment because they sufficiently threaten in our day those substantive evils the fear of which called forth the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. It is ""a constitution we are expounding,"" and our interpretation of the First Amendment must necessarily be responsive to the much more highly charged nature of religious questions in contemporary society. Fourth, the American experiment in free public education available to all children has been guided in large measure by the dramatic evolution of the religious diversity among the population which our public schools serve. The interaction of these two important forces in our national life has placed in bold relief certain positive values in the consistent application to public institutions generally, and public schools particularly, of the constitutional decree against official involvements of religion which might produce the evils the Framers meant the Establishment Clause to forestall. The public schools are supported entirely, in most communities, by public funds -- funds exacted not only from parents, nor alone from those who hold particular religious views, nor indeed from those who subscribe to any creed at all. It is implicit in the history and character of American public education that the public schools serve a uniquely [p242] public function: the training of American citizens in an atmosphere free of parochial, divisive, or separatist influences of any sort -- an atmosphere in which children may assimilate a heritage common to all American groups and religions. See Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Education, 333 U.S. 203. This is a heritage neither theistic nor atheistic, but simply civic and patriotic. See Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 400-403. Attendance at the public schools has never been compulsory; parents remain morally and constitutionally free to choose the academic environment in which they wish their children to be educated. The relationship of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the public school system is preeminently that of reserving such a choice to the individual parent, rather than vesting it in the majority of voters of each State or school district. The choice which is thus preserved is between a public secular education, with its uniquely democratic values, and some form of private or sectarian education, which offers values of its own. In my judgment, the First Amendment forbids the State to inhibit that freedom of choice by diminishing the attractiveness of either alternative -- either by restricting the liberty of the private schools to inculcate whatever values they wish, or by jeopardizing the freedom of the public schools from private or sectarian pressures. The choice between these very different forms of education is one very much like the choice of whether or not to worship -- which our Constitution leaves to the individual parent. It is no proper function of the state or local government to influence or restrict that election. The lesson of history -- drawn more from the experiences of other countries than from our own -- is that a system of free public education forfeits its unique contribution to the growth of democratic citizenship when that choice ceases to be freely available to each parent. [p243] II The exposition by this Court of the religious guarantees of the First Amendment has consistently reflected and reaffirmed the concerns which impelled the Framers to write those guarantees into the Constitution. It would be neither possible nor appropriate to review here the entire course of our decisions on religious questions. There emerge from those decisions, however, three principles of particular relevance to the issue presented by the cases at bar, and some attention to those decisions is therefore appropriate. First. One line of decisions derives from contests for control of a church property or other internal ecclesiastical disputes. This line has settled the proposition that, in order to give effect to the First Amendment's purpose of requiring on the part of all organs of government a strict neutrality toward theological questions, courts should not undertake to decide such questions. These principles were first expounded in the case of Watson v. Jones, 13 Wall. 679, which declared that judicial intervention in such a controversy would open up the whole subject of the doctrinal theology, the usages and customs, the written laws, and fundamental organization of every religious denomination. . . . 13 Wall. at 733. Courts above all must be neutral, for ""[t]he law knows no heresy, and is committed to the support of no dogma, the establishment of no sect."" [n9] 13 Wall. at 728. This principle has recently [p244] been reaffirmed in Kedroff v. St. Nicholas Cathedral, 344 U.S. 94, and Kreshik v. St. Nicholas Cathedral, 363 U.S. 190. The mandate of judicial neutrality in theological controversies met its severest test in United States v. Ballard, 322 U.S. 78. That decision put in sharp relief certain principles which bear directly upon the questions presented in these cases. Ballard was indicted for fraudulent use of the mails in the dissemination of religious literature. He requested that the trial court submit to the jury the question of the truthfulness of the religious views he championed. The requested charge was refused, and we upheld that refusal, reasoning that the First Amendment foreclosed any judicial inquiry into the truth or falsity of the defendant's religious beliefs. We said: Man's relation to his God was made no concern of the state. He was granted the right to worship as he pleased and to answer to no man for the verity of his religious views. Men may believe what they cannot [p245] prove. They may not be put to the proof of their religious doctrines or beliefs. . . . Many take their gospel from the New Testament. But it would hardly be supposed that they could be tried before a jury charged with the duty of determining whether those teachings contained false representations. 322 U.S. at 86-87. The dilemma presented by the case was severe. While the alleged truthfulness of nonreligious publications could ordinarily have been submitted to the jury, Ballard was deprived of that defense only because the First Amendment forbids governmental inquiry into the verity of religious beliefs. In dissent, Mr. Justice Jackson expressed the concern that, under this construction of the First Amendment, ""[p]rosecutions of this character easily could degenerate into religious persecution."" 322 U.S. at 95. The case shows how elusive is the line which enforces the Amendment's injunction of strict neutrality, while manifesting no official hostility toward religion -- a line which must be considered in the cases now before us. [n10] Some might view the result of the Ballard case as a manifestation of hostility -- in that the conviction stood because the defense could not be raised. To others, it [p246] might represent merely strict adherence to the principle of neutrality already expounded in the cases involving doctrinal disputes. Inevitably, insistence upon neutrality, vital as it surely is for untrammeled religious liberty, may appear to border upon religious hostility. But, in the long view, the independence of both church and state in their respective spheres will be better served by close adherence to the neutrality principle. If the choice is often difficult, the difficulty is endemic to issues implicating the religious guarantees of the First Amendment. Freedom of religion will be seriously jeopardized if we admit exceptions for no better reason than the difficulty of delineating hostility from neutrality in the closest cases. Second. It is only recently that our decisions have dealt with the question whether issues arising under the Establishment Clause may be isolated from problems implicating the Free Exercise Clause. Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U.S. 1, is, in my view, the first of our decisions which treats a problem of asserted unconstitutional involvement as raising questions purely under the Establishment Clause. A scrutiny of several earlier decisions said by some to have etched the contours of the clause shows that such cases neither raised nor decided any constitutional issues under the First Amendment. Bradfield v. Roberts, 175 U.S. 291, for example, involved challenges to a federal grant to a hospital administered by a Roman Catholic order. The Court rejected the claim for lack of evidence that any sectarian influence changed its character as a secular institution chartered as such by the Congress. [n11] Quick Bear v. Leupp, 210 U.S. 50, is also illustrative. The immediate question there was one of statutory construction, although the issue had originally involved the [p247] constitutionality of the use of federal funds to support sectarian education on Indian reservations. Congress had already prohibited federal grants for that purpose, thereby removing the broader issue, leaving only the question whether the statute authorized the appropriation for religious teaching of Treaty funds held by the Government in trust for the Indians. Since these were the Indians' own funds, the Court held only that the Indians might direct their use for such educational purposes as they chose, and that the administration by the Treasury of the disbursement of the funds did not inject into the case any issue of the propriety of the use of federal moneys. [n12] Indeed, the Court expressly approved the reasoning of the Court of Appeals that to deny the Indians the right to spend their own moneys for religious purposes of their choice might well infringe the free exercise of their religion: it seems inconceivable that Congress should have intended to prohibit them from receiving religious education at their own cost if they so desired it. . . . 210 U.S. at 82. This case forecast, however, an increasingly troublesome First Amendment paradox: that the logical interrelationship between the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses may produce situations where an injunction against an apparent establishment must be withheld in order to avoid infringement of rights of free exercise. That paradox was not squarely presented in Quick Bear, but the care taken by the Court [p248] to avoid a constitutional confrontation discloses an awareness of possible conflicts between the two clauses. I shall come back to this problem later, infra, pp. 296-299. A third case in this group is Cochran v. Louisiana State Board, 281 U.S. 370, which involved a challenge to a state statute providing public funds to support a loan of free textbooks to pupils of both public and private schools. The constitutional issues in this Court extended no further than the claim that this program amounted to a taking of private property for nonpublic use. The Court rejected the claim on the ground that no private use of property was involved; "". . . we cannot doubt that the taxing power of the State is exerted for a public purpose."" 281 U.S. at 375. The case therefore raised no issue under the First Amendment. [n13] In Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, a Catholic parochial school and a private but nonsectarian military academy challenged a state law requiring all children between certain ages to attend the public schools. This Court held the law invalid as an arbitrary and unreasonable interference both with the rights of the schools and with the liberty of the parents of the children who attended them. The due process guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment ""excludes any general power of the State to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only."" 268 U.S. at 535. While one of the plaintiffs was indeed a parochial school, the case obviously decided no First Amendment question, but recognized only the constitutional right to establish and patronize private schools -- including parochial schools -- which meet the state's reasonable minimum curricular requirements. [p249] Third. It is true, as the Court says, that the ""two clauses [Establishment and Free Exercise] may overlap."" Because of the overlap, however, our decisions under the Free Exercise Clause bear considerable relevance to the problem now before us, and should be briefly reviewed. The early free exercise cases generally involved the objections of religious minorities to the application to them of general nonreligious legislation governing conduct. Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145, involved the claim that a belief in the sanctity of plural marriage precluded the conviction of members of a particular sect under nondiscriminatory legislation against such marriage. The Court rejected the claim, saying: Laws are made for the government of actions, and while they cannot interfere with mere religious beliefs and opinions, they may with practices. . . . Can a man excuse his practices to the contrary because of his religious belief? To permit this would be to make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land, and in effect to permit every citizen to become a law unto himself. Government could exist only in name under such circumstances. [n14] 98 U.S. at 166-167. [p250] Davis v. Beason, 133 U.S. 333, similarly involved the claim that the First Amendment insulated from civil punishment certain practices inspired or motivated by religious beliefs. The claim was easily rejected: It was never intended or supposed that the amendment could be invoked as a protection against legislation for the punishment of acts inimical to the peace, good order and morals of society. 133 U.S. at 342. See also Mormon Church v. United States, 136 U.S. 1; Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11; Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158; Cleveland v. United States, 329 U.S. 14. But we must not confuse the issue of governmental power to regulate or prohibit conduct motivated by religious beliefs with the quite different problem of governmental authority to compel behavior offensive to religious principles. In Hamilton v. Regents of the University of California, 293 U.S. 245, the question was that of the power of a State to compel students at the State University to participate in military training instruction against their religious convictions. The validity of the statute was sustained against claims based upon the First Amendment. But the decision rested on a very narrow principle: since there was neither a constitutional right nor a legal obligation to attend the State University, the obligation to participate in military training courses, [p251] reflecting a legitimate state interest, might properly be imposed upon those who chose to attend. Although the rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments were presumed to include the right to entertain the beliefs, to adhere to the principles and to teach the doctrines on which these students base their objections to the order prescribing military training, those Amendments were construed not to free such students from the military training obligations if they chose to attend the University. Justices Brandeis, Cardozo and Stone, concurring separately, agreed that the requirement infringed no constitutionally protected liberties. They added, however, that the case presented no question under the Establishment Clause. The military instruction program was not an establishment, since it in no way involved ""instruction in the practice or tenets of a religion."" 293 U.S. at 266. Since the only question was one of free exercise, they concluded, like the majority, that the strong state interest in training a citizen militia justified the restraints imposed, at least so long as attendance at the University was voluntary. [n15] Hamilton has not been overruled, although United States v. Schwimmer, 279 U.S. 644, and United States v. Macintosh, 283 U.S. 605, upon which the Court in Hamilton relied, have since been overruled by Girouard v. United States, 328 U.S. 61. But if Hamilton retains any vitality with respect to higher education, we recognized its inapplicability to cognate questions in the public primary and secondary schools when we held, in West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette, supra, that a State had no power to expel from public schools students who refused on religious grounds to comply with a daily flag [p252] salute requirement. Of course, such a requirement was no more a law ""respecting an establishment of religion"" than the California law compelling the college students to take military training. The Barnette plaintiffs, moreover, did not ask that the whole exercise be enjoined, but only that an excuse or exemption be provided for those students whose religious beliefs forbade them to participate in the ceremony. The key to the holding that such a requirement abridged rights of free exercise lay in the fact that attendance at school was not voluntary but compulsory. The Court said: This issue is not prejudiced by the Court's previous holding that, where a State, without compelling attendance, extends college facilities to pupils who voluntarily enroll, it may prescribe military training as part of the course without offense to the Constitution. . . . Hamilton v. Regents, 293 U.S. 245. In the present case, attendance is not optional. 319 U.S. at 631-632. The Barnette decision made another significant point. The Court held that the State must make participation in the exercise voluntary for all students, and not alone for those who found participation obnoxious on religious grounds. In short, there was simply no need to ""inquire whether nonconformist beliefs will exempt from the duty to salute,"" because the Court found no state ""power to make the salute a legal duty."" 319 U.S. at 635. The distinctions between Hamilton and Barnette are, I think, crucial to the resolution of the cases before us. The different results of those cases are attributable only in part to a difference in the strength of the particular state interests which the respective statutes were designed to serve. Far more significant is the fact that Hamilton dealt with the voluntary attendance at college of young adults, while Barnette involved the compelled attendance [p253] of young children at elementary and secondary schools. [n16] This distinction warrants a difference in constitutional results. And it is with the involuntary attendance of young school children that we are exclusively concerned in the cases now before the Court. III No one questions that the Framers of the First Amendment intended to restrict exclusively the powers of the Federal Government. [n17] Whatever limitations that Amendment now imposes upon the States derive from the Fourteenth Amendment. The process of absorption of the religious guarantees of the First Amendment as protections against the States under the Fourteenth Amendment began with the Free Exercise Clause. In 1923 the Court held that the protections of the Fourteenth included at least a person's freedom ""to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience. . . ."" [n18] Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399. See also Hamilton v. Regents, supra, at 262. Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, completed in 1940 the process of absorption [p254] of the Free Exercise Clause and recognized its dual aspect: the Court affirmed freedom of belief as an absolute liberty, but recognized that conduct, while it may also be comprehended by the Free Exercise Clause, ""remains subject to regulation for the protection of society."" 310 U.S. at 303-304. This was a distinction already drawn by Reynolds v. United States, supra. From the beginning, this Court has recognized that, while government may regulate the behavioral manifestations of religious beliefs, it may not interfere at all with the beliefs themselves. The absorption of the Establishment Clause has, however, come later, and by a route less easily charted. It has been suggested, with some support in history, that absorption of the First Amendment's ban against congressional legislation ""respecting an establishment of religion"" is conceptually impossible, because the Framers meant the Establishment Clause also to foreclose any attempt by Congress to disestablish the existing official state churches. [n19] Whether or not such was the understanding of the Framers, and whether such a purpose would have inhibited the absorption of the Establishment Clause at the threshold of the Nineteenth Century, are questions not dispositive of our present inquiry. For it is [p255] clear on the record of history that the last of the formal state establishments was dissolved more than three decades before the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, and thus the problem of protecting official state churches from federal encroachments could hardly have been any concern of those who framed the post-Civil War Amendments. [n20] Any such objective of the First Amendment, having become historical anachronism by 1868, cannot be thought to have deterred the absorption of the Establishment Clause to any greater degree than it would, for example, have deterred the absorption of the Free Exercise Clause. That no organ of the Federal Government possessed in 1791 any power to restrain the interference of the States in religious matters is indisputable. See Permoli v. New Orleans, 3 How. 589. It is equally plain, on the other hand, that the Fourteenth Amendment created a panoply of new federal rights for the protection of citizens of the various States. And among those rights was freedom from such state governmental involvement in the affairs of religion as the Establishment Clause had originally foreclosed on the part of Congress. [p256] It has also been suggested that the ""liberty"" guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment logically cannot absorb the Establishment Clause because that Clause is not one of the provisions of the Bill of Rights which in terms protects a ""freedom"" of the individual. See Corwin, A Constitution of Powers in a Secular State (1951), 113-116. The fallacy in this contention, I think, is that it underestimates the role of the Establishment Clause as a co-guarantor, with the Free Exercise Clause, of religious liberty. The Framers did not entrust the liberty of religious beliefs to either clause alone. The Free Exercise Clause ""was not to be the full extent of the Amendment's guarantee of freedom from governmental intrusion in matters of faith."" McGowan v. Maryland, supra, at 464 (opinion of Fankfurter, J.). Finally, it has been contended that absorption of the Establishment Clause is precluded by the absence of any intention on the part of the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment to circumscribe the residual powers of the States to aid religious activities and institutions in ways which fell short of formal establishments. [n21] That argument relies in part upon the express terms of the [p257] abortive Blaine Amendment -- proposed several years after the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment -- which would have added to the First Amendment a provision that ""[n]o State shall make any law respecting an establishment of religion. . . ."" Such a restriction would have been superfluous, it is said, if the Fourteenth Amendment had already made the Establishment Clause binding upon the States. The argument proves too much, for the Fourteenth Amendment's protection of the free exercise of religion can hardly be questioned; yet the Blaine Amendment would also have added an explicit protection against state laws abridging that liberty. [n22] Even if we assume that the draftsmen of the Fourteenth Amendment saw no immediate connection between its protections against state action infringing personal liberty and the guarantees of the First Amendment, it is certainly too late in the day to suggest that their assumed inattention to the question dilutes the force of these constitutional guarantees in their application to the States. [n23] It is enough to conclude [p258] that the religious liberty embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment would not be viable if the Constitution were interpreted to forbid only establishments ordained by Congress. [n24] [p259] The issue of what particular activities the Establishment Clause forbids the States to undertake is our more immediate concern. In Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U.S. 1, 15-16, a careful study of the relevant history led the Court to the view, consistently recognized in decisions since Everson, that the Establishment Clause embodied the Framers' conclusion that government and religion have discrete interests which are mutually best served when each avoids too close a proximity to the other. It is not only the nonbeliever who fears the injection of sectarian doctrines and controversies into the civil polity, but in as high degree it is the devout believer who fears the secularization of a creed which becomes too deeply involved with and dependent upon the government. [n25] It [p260] has rightly been said of the history of the Establishment Clause that our tradition of civil liberty rests not only on the secularism of a Thomas Jefferson, but also on the fervent sectarianism . . . of a Roger Williams. Freund, The Supreme Court of the United States (1961), 84. Our decisions on questions of religious education or exercises in the public schools have consistently reflected this dual aspect of the Establishment Clause. Engel v. Vitale unmistakably has its roots in three earlier cases which, on cognate issues, shaped the contours of the Establishment Clause. First, in Everson, the Court held that reimbursement by the town of parents for the cost of transporting their children by public carrier to parochial (as well as public and private nonsectarian) schools did not offend the Establishment Clause. Such reimbursement, by easing the financial burden upon Catholic parents, may indirectly have fostered the operation of the Catholic schools, and may thereby indirectly have facilitated the teaching of Catholic principles, thus serving ultimately a religious goal. But this form of governmental assistance was difficult to distinguish from myriad other incidental, if not insignificant, government benefits enjoyed by religious institutions -- fire and police protection, tax exemptions, and the pavement of streets and sidewalks, for example. The State contributes no money to the schools. It does not support them. Its legislation, as applied, does no more than provide a general program to help parents get their children, regardless of their religion, safely and expeditiously to and from [p261] accredited schools. 330 U.S. at 18. Yet even this form of assistance was thought by four Justices of the Everson Court to be barred by the Establishment Clause because too perilously close to that public support of religion forbidden by the First Amendment. The other two cases, Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Education, 333 U.S. 203""] 333 U.S. 203, and 333 U.S. 203, and Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306, can best be considered together. Both involved programs of released time for religious instruction of public school students. I reject the suggestion that Zorach overruled McCollum in silence. [n26] The distinction which the Court drew in Zorach between the two cases is, in my view, faithful to the function of the Establishment Clause. I should first note, however, that McCollum and Zorach do not seem to me distinguishable in terms of the free exercise claims advanced in both cases. [n27] The nonparticipant in the McCollum program was given secular instruction in a separate room during the times his classmates had religious lessons; the nonparticipant in any Zorach program also received secular instruction, while his classmates repaired to a place outside the school for religious instruction. The crucial difference, I think, was that the McCollum program offended the Establishment Clause, while the Zorach program did not. This was not, in my view, because of the difference in public expenditures involved. True, the McCollum program involved the regular use of school facilities, classrooms, heat and light and time from the regular school day -- even though the actual [p262] incremental cost may have been negligible. All religious instruction under the Zorach program, by contrast, was carried on entirely off the school premises, and the teacher's part was simply to facilitate the children's release to the churches. The deeper difference was that the McCollum program placed the religious instructor in the public school classroom in precisely the position of authority held by the regular teachers of secular subjects, while the Zorach program did not. [n28] The McCollum program, [p263] in lending to the support of sectarian instruction all the authority of the governmentally operated public school system, brought government and religion into that proximity which the Establishment Clause forbids. To be sure, a religious teacher presumably commands substantial respect and merits attention in his own right. But the Constitution does not permit that prestige and capacity for influence to be augmented by investiture of all the symbols of authority at the command of the lay teacher for the enhancement of secular instruction. More recent decisions have further etched the contours of Establishment. In the Sunday Law Cases, we found in state laws compelling a uniform day of rest from worldly labor no violation of the Establishment Clause (McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420). The basic [p264] ground of our decision was that, granted the Sunday Laws were first enacted for religious ends, they were continued in force for reasons wholly secular, namely, to provide a universal day of rest and ensure the health and tranquillity of the community. In other words, government may originally have decreed a Sunday day of rest for the impermissible purpose of supporting religion, but abandoned that purpose and retained the laws for the permissible purpose of furthering overwhelmingly secular ends. Such was the evolution of the contours of the Establishment Clause before Engel v. Vitale. There, a year ago, we held that the daily recital of the state-composed Regents' Prayer constituted an establishment of religion because, although the prayer itself revealed no sectarian content or purpose, its nature and meaning were quite clearly religious. New York, in authorizing its recitation, had not maintained that distance between the public and the religious sectors commanded by the Establishment Clause when it placed the ""power, prestige and financial support of government"" behind the prayer. In Engel, as in McCollum, it did not matter that the amount of time and expense allocated to the daily recitation was small, so long as the exercise itself was manifestly religious. Nor did it matter that few children had complained of the practice, for the measure of the seriousness of a breach of the Establishment Clause has never been thought to be the number of people who complain of it. We also held two Terms ago, in Torcaso v. Watkins, supra, that a State may not constitutionally require an applicant for the office of Notary Public to swear or affirm that he believes in God. The problem of that case was strikingly similar to the issue presented 18 years before in the flag salute case, West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette, supra. In neither case was there any claim of establishment of religion, but only of infringement of [p265] the individual's religious liberty -- in the one case, that of the nonbeliever who could not attest to a belief in God; in the other, that of the child whose creed forbade in to salute the flag. But Torcaso added a new element not present in Barnette. The Maryland test oath involved an attempt to employ essentially religious (albeit nonsectarian) means to achieve a secular goal to which the means bore no reasonable relationship. No one doubted the State's interest in the integrity of its Notaries Public, but that interest did not warrant the screening of applicants by means of a religious test. The Sunday Law Cases were different in that respect. Even if Sunday Laws retain certain religious vestiges, they are enforced today for essentially secular objectives which cannot be effectively achieved in modern society except by designating Sunday as the universal day of rest. The Court's opinions cited very substantial problems in selecting or enforcing an alternative day of rest. But the teaching of both Torcaso and the Sunday Law Cases is that government may not employ religious means to serve secular interests, however legitimate they may be, at least without the clearest demonstration that nonreligious means will not suffice. [n29] [p266] IV I turn now to the cases before us. [n30] The religious nature of the exercises here challenged seems plain. Unless Engel v. Vitale is to be overruled or we are to engage in wholly disingenuous distinction, we cannot sustain [p267] these practices. Daily recital of the Lord's Prayer and the reading of passages of Scripture are quite as clearly breaches of the command of the Establishment Clause as was the daily use of the rather bland Regents' Prayer in the New York public schools. Indeed, I would suppose that, if anything, the Lord's Prayer and the Holy Bible are more clearly sectarian, and the present violations of the First Amendment consequently more serious. But the religious exercises challenged in these cases have a long history. And, almost from the beginning, Bible reading and daily prayer in the schools have been the subject of debate, criticism by educators and other public officials, and proscription by courts and legislative councils. At the outset, then, we must carefully canvass both aspects of this history. The use of prayers and Bible readings at the opening of the school day long antedates the founding of our Republic. The Rules of the New Haven Hopkins Grammar School required in 1684 [t]hat, the Scholars being [p268] called together, the Mr. shall every morning begin his work with a short prayer for a blessing on his Laboures and their learning. . . . [n31] More rigorous was the provision in a 1682 contract with a Dutch schoolmaster in Flatbush, New York: When the school begins, one of the children shall read the morning prayer, as it stands in the catechism, and close with the prayer before dinner; in the afternoon, it shall begin with the prayer after dinner, and end with the evening prayer. The evening school shall begin with the Lord's prayer, and close by singing a psalm. [n32] After the Revolution, the new States uniformly continued these long-established practices in the private and the few public grammar schools. The school committee of Boston in 1789, for example, required the city's several schoolmasters ""daily to commence the duties of their office by prayer and reading a portion of the Sacred Scriptures. . . ."" [n33] That requirement was mirrored throughout the original States, and exemplified the universal practice well into the nineteenth century. As the free public schools gradually supplanted the private academies and sectarian schools between 1800 and 1850, morning devotional exercises were retained with few alterations. Indeed, public pressures upon school administrators in many parts of the country would hardly have condoned abandonment of practices to which a century or more of private religious education had accustomed the American people. [n34] The controversy centered, in [p269] fact, principally about the elimination of plainly sectarian practices and textbooks, and led to the eventual substitution of nonsectarian, though still religious, exercises and materials. [n35] Statutory provision for daily religious exercises is, however, of quite recent origin. At the turn of this century, there was but one State -- Massachusetts -- which had a law making morning prayer or Bible reading obligatory. Statutes elsewhere either permitted such practices or simply left the question to local option. It was not until after 1910 that 11 more States, within a few years, joined Massachusetts in making one or both exercises compulsory. [n36] The Pennsylvania law with which we are [p270] concerned in the Schempp case, for example, took effect in 1913, and even the Rule of the Baltimore School Board involved in the Murray case dates only from 1905. In no State has there ever been a constitutional or statutory prohibition against the recital of prayers or the reading of Scripture, although a number of States have outlawed these practices by judicial decision or administrative order. What is noteworthy about the panoply of state and local regulations from which these cases emerge is the relative recency of the statutory codification of practices which have ancient roots, and the rather small number of States which have ever prescribed compulsory religious exercises in the public schools. The purposes underlying the adoption and perpetuation of these practices are somewhat complex. It is beyond question that the religious benefits and values realized from daily prayer and Bible reading have usually been considered paramount, and sufficient to justify the continuation of such practices. To Horace Mann, embroiled in an intense controversy over the role of sectarian instruction and textbooks in the Boston public schools, there was little question that the regular use of the Bible -- which he thought essentially nonsectarian -- would bear fruit in the spiritual enlightenment of his pupils. [n37] A contemporary of Mann's, the Commissioner of Education of a neighboring State, expressed a view which many enlightened educators of that day shared: As a textbook of morals, the Bible is preeminent, and should have a prominent place in our schools, [p271] either as a reading book or as a source of appeal and instruction. Sectarianism, indeed, should not be countenanced in the schools; but the Bible is not sectarian. . . . The Scriptures should at least be read at the opening of the school, if no more. Prayer may also be offered with the happiest effects. [n38] Wisconsin's Superintendent of Public Instruction, writing a few years later in 1858, reflected the attitude of his eastern colleagues, in that he regarded with special favor the use of the Bible in public schools, as preeminently first in importance among textbooks for teaching the noblest principles of virtue, morality, patriotism, and good order -- love and reverence for God -- charity and good will to man. [n39] Such statements reveal the understanding of educators that the daily religious exercises in the schools served broader goals than compelling formal worship of God or fostering church attendance. The religious aims of the educators who adopted and retained such exercises were comprehensive, and in many cases quite devoid of sectarian bias -- but the crucial fact is that they were nonetheless religious. While it has been suggested, see pp. 278-281, infra that daily prayer and reading of Scripture now serve secular goals as well, there can be no doubt that the origins of these practices were unambiguously religious, even where the educator's aim was not to win adherents to a particular creed or faith. Almost from the beginning, religious exercises in the public schools have been the subject of intense criticism, vigorous debate, and judicial or administrative prohibition. Significantly, educators and school boards [p272] early entertained doubts about both the legality and the soundness of opening the school day with compulsory prayer or Bible reading. Particularly in the large Eastern cities, where immigration had exposed the public schools to religious diversities and conflicts unknown to the homogeneous academies of the eighteenth century, local authorities found it necessary even before the Civil War to seek an accommodation. In 1843, the Philadelphia School Board adopted the following resolutions: RESOLVED, that no children be required to attend or unite in the reading of the Bible in the Public Schools, whose parents are conscientiously opposed thereto: RESOLVED, that those children whose parents conscientiously prefer and desire any particular version of the Bible, without note or comment, be furnished with same. [n40] A decade later, the Superintendent of Schools of New York State issued an even bolder decree that prayers could no longer be required as part of public school activities, and that, where the King James Bible was read, Catholic students could not be compelled to attend. [n41] This type of accommodation was not restricted to the East Coast; the Cincinnati Board of Education resolved in 1869 that religious instruction and the reading of religious books, including the Holy Bible, are prohibited in the common schools of Cincinnati, it being the true object and intent of this rule to allow the children of the parents of all sects and opinions, in matters of faith and worship, [p273] to enjoy alike the benefit of the common school fund. [n42] The Board repealed at the same time an earlier regulation which had required the singing of hymns and psalms to accompany the Bible reading at the start of the school day. And, in 1889, one commentator ventured the view that ""[t]here is not enough to be gained from Bible reading to justify the quarrel that has been raised over it."" [n43] Thus, a great deal of controversy over religion in the public schools had preceded the debate over the Blaine Amendment, precipitated by President Grant's insistence that matters of religion should be left ""to the family altar, the church, and the private school, supported entirely by private contributions."" [n44] There was ample precedent, too, for Theodore Roosevelt's declaration that, in the interest of ""absolutely nonsectarian public schools,"" it was ""not our business to have the Protestant Bible or the Catholic Vulgate or the Talmud read in those schools."" [n45] The same principle appeared in the message of an Ohio Governor who vetoed a compulsory Bible reading bill in 1925: It is my belief that religious teaching in our homes, Sunday schools, churches, by the good [p274] mothers, fathers, and ministers of Ohio is far preferable to compulsory teaching of religion by the state. The spirit of our federal and state constitutions from the beginning. . . [has] been to leave religious instruction to the discretion of parents. [n46] The same theme has recurred in the opinions of the Attorneys General of several States holding religious exercises or instruction to be in violation of the state or federal constitutional command of separation of church and state. [n47] Thus, the basic principle upon which our decision last year in Engel v. Vitale necessarily rested, and which we reaffirm today, can hardly be thought to be radical or novel. Particularly relevant for our purposes are the decisions of the state courts on questions of religion in the public schools. Those decisions, while not, of course, authoritative in this Court, serve nevertheless to define the problem before us and to guide our inquiry. With the growth of religious diversity and the rise of vigorous dissent it was inevitable that the courts would be called upon to enjoin religious practices in the public schools which offended certain sects and groups. The earliest of such decisions declined to review the propriety of actions taken by school authorities, so long as those actions were within [p275] the purview of the administrators' powers. [n48] Thus, where the local school board required religious exercises, the courts would not enjoin them, [n49] and where, as in at least one case, the school officials forbade devotional practices, the court refused on similar grounds to overrule that decision. [n50] Thus, whichever way the early cases came up, the governing principle of nearly complete deference to administrative discretion effectively foreclosed any consideration of constitutional questions. The last quarter of the nineteenth century found the courts beginning to question the constitutionality of public school religious exercises. The legal context was still, of course, that of the state constitutions, since the First Amendment had not yet been held applicable to state action. And the state constitutional prohibitions against church-state cooperation or governmental aid to religion were generally less rigorous than the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. It is therefore remarkable that the courts of a half dozen States found compulsory religious exercises in the public schools in violation of their respective state constitutions. [n51] These [p276] courts attributed much significance to the clearly religious origins and content of the challenged practices, and to the impossibility of avoiding sectarian controversy in their conduct. The Illinois Supreme Court expressed in 1910 the principles which characterized these decisions: The public school is supported by the taxes which each citizen, regardless of his religion or his lack of it, is compelled to pay. The school, like the government, is simply a civil institution. It is secular, and not religious, in its purposes. The truths of the Bible are the truths of religion, which do not come within the province of the public school. . . . No one denies that they should be taught to the youth of the State. The constitution and the law do not interfere with such teaching, but they do banish theological polemics from the schools and the school districts. This is done not from any hostility to religion, but because it is no part of the duty of the State to teach religion -- to take the money of all and apply it to teaching the children of all the religion of a part only. Instruction in religion must be voluntary. People ex rel. Ring v. Board of Education, 245 Ill. 334, 349, 92 N.E. 251, 256 (1910). The Supreme Court of South Dakota, in banning devotional exercises from the public schools of that State, also cautioned that [t]he state as an educator must keep out of this field, and especially is this true in the common schools, where the child is immature, without fixed religious convictions. . . . State ex rel. Finger v. Weedman, 55 S.D. 343, 357, 226 N.W. 348, 354 (1929). [p277] Even those state courts which have sustained devotional exercises under state law [n52] have usually recognized the primarily religious character of prayers and Bible readings. If such practices were not for that reason unconstitutional, it was necessarily because the state constitution forbade only public expenditures for sectarian instruction, or for activities which made the schoolhouse a ""place of worship,"" but said nothing about the subtler question of laws ""respecting an establishment of religion."" [n53] Thus, the panorama of history permits no [p278] other conclusion than that daily prayers and Bible readings in the public schools have always been designed to be, and have been regarded as, essentially religious exercises. Unlike the Sunday closing laws, these exercises appear neither to have been divorced from their religious origins nor deprived of their centrally religious character by the passage of time, [n54] cf. McGowan v. Maryland, supra, at 442-445. On this distinction alone we might well rest a constitutional decision. But three further contentions have been pressed in the argument of these cases. These contentions deserve careful consideration, for if the position of the school authorities were correct in respect to any of them, we would be misapplying the principles of Engel v. Vitale. A First, it is argued that, however clearly religious may have been the origins and early nature of daily prayer and Bible reading, these practices today serve so clearly secular educational purposes that their religious attributes may be overlooked. I do not doubt, for example, that morning devotional exercises may foster better discipline in the classroom, and elevate the spiritual level on which the school day opens. The Pennsylvania Superintendent of Public Instruction, testifying by deposition in the Schempp case, offered his view that daily Bible reading places upon the children or those hearing the reading of this, and the atmosphere which goes on in the reading . . . one of the last vestiges of moral value [p279] that we have left in our school system. The exercise thus affords, the Superintendent concluded, ""a strong contradiction to the materialistic trends of our time."" Baltimore's Superintendent of Schools expressed a similar view of the practices challenged in the Murray case, to the effect that [t]he acknowledgement of the existence of God as symbolized in the opening exercises establishes a discipline tone which tends to cause each individual pupil to constrain his overt acts and to consequently conform to accepted standards of behavior during his attendance at school. These views are by no means novel, see, e.g., Billard v. Board of Education, 69 Kan. 53, 57-58, 76 P. 422, 423 (1904). [n55] It is not the business of this Court to gainsay the judgments of experts on matters of pedagogy. Such decisions must be left to the discretion of those administrators charged with the supervision of the Nation's public schools. The limited province of the courts is to determine whether the means which the educators have chosen to achieve legitimate pedagogical ends infringe the constitutional freedoms of the First Amendment. The secular purposes which devotional exercises are said to serve fall into two categories -- those which depend upon an immediately religious experience shared by the participating children and those which appear sufficiently divorced from the religious content of the devotional material that they can be served equally by nonreligious [p280] materials. With respect to the first objective, much has been written about the moral and spiritual values of infusing some religious influence or instruction into the public school classroom. [n56] To the extent that only religious materials will serve this purpose, it seems to me that the purpose, as well as the means, is so plainly religious that the exercise is necessarily forbidden by the Establishment Clause. The fact that purely secular benefits may eventually result does not seem to me to justify the exercises, for similar indirect nonreligious benefits could no doubt have been claimed for the released time program invalidated in McCollum. The second justification assumes that religious exercises at the start of the school day may directly serve solely secular ends -- for example, by fostering harmony and tolerance among the pupils, enhancing the authority of the teacher, and inspiring better discipline. To the extent that such benefits result not from the content of the readings and recitation, but simply from the holding of such a solemn exercise at the opening assembly or the first class of the day, it would seem that less sensitive materials might equally well serve the same purpose. I have previously suggested that Torcaso and the Sunday Law Cases forbid the use of religious means to achieve secular [p281] ends where nonreligious means will suffice. That principle is readily applied to these cases. It has not been shown that readings from the speeches and messages of great Americans, for example, or from the documents of our heritage of liberty, daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, or even the observance of a moment of reverent silence at the opening of class, may not adequately serve the solely secular purposes of the devotional activities without jeopardizing either the religious liberties of any members of the community or the proper degree of separation between the spheres of religion and government. [n57] Such substitutes would, I think, be unsatisfactory or inadequate only to the extent that the present activities do, in fact, serve religious goals. While I do not question the judgment of experienced educators that the challenged practices may well achieve valuable secular ends, it seems to me that the State acts unconstitutionally if it either sets about to attain even indirectly religious ends by religious means, or if it uses religious means to serve secular ends where secular means would suffice. B Second, it is argued that the particular practices involved in the two cases before us are unobjectionable [p282] because the prefer no particular sect or sects at the expense of others. Both the Baltimore and Abington procedures permit, for example, the reading of any of several versions of the Bible, and this flexibility is said to ensure neutrality sufficiently to avoid the constitutional prohibition. One answer, which might be dispositive, is that any version of the Bible is inherently sectarian, else there would be no need to offer a system of rotation or alternation of versions in the first place, that is, to allow different sectarian versions to be used on different days. The sectarian character of the Holy Bible has been at the core of the whole controversy over religious practices in the public schools throughout its long and often bitter history. [n58] To [p283] vary the version as the Abington and Baltimore schools have done may well be less offensive than to read from the King James version every day, as once was the practice. But the result even of this relatively benign procedure is that majority sects are preferred in approximate proportion to their representation in the community and in the student body, while the smaller sects suffer commensurate discrimination. So long as the subject matter of the exercise is sectarian in character, these consequences cannot be avoided. The argument contains, however, a more basic flaw. There are persons in every community -- often deeply devout -- to whom any version of the Judaeo-Christian Bible is offensive. [n59] There are others whose reverence for the Holy Scriptures demands private study or reflection, and to whom public reading or recitation is sacrilegious, as one of the expert witnesses at the trial of the Schempp case explained. To such persons, it is not the fact of using the Bible in the public schools, nor the content of any particular version, that is offensive, but only the manner in [p284] which it is used. [n60] For such persons, the anathema of public communion is even more pronounced when prayer is involved. Many deeply devout persons have always regarded prayer as a necessarily private experience. [n61] One Protestant group recently commented, for example: ""When one thinks of prayer as sincere outreach of a [p285] human soul to the Creator, 'required prayer' becomes an absurdity."" [n62] There is a similar problem with respect to comment upon the passages of Scripture which are to be read. Most present statutes forbid comment, and this practice accords with the views of many religious groups as to the manner in which the Bible should be read. However, as a recent survey discloses, scriptural passages read without comment frequently convey no message to the younger children in the school. Thus, there has developed a practice in some schools of bridging the gap between faith and understanding by means of ""definitions,"" even where ""comment"" is forbidden by statute. [n63] The present practice, therefore, poses a difficult dilemma: while Bible reading is almost universally required to be without comment, since only by such a prohibition can sectarian interpretation be excluded from the classroom, [p286] the rule breaks down at the point at which rudimentary definitions of Biblical terms are necessary for comprehension if the exercise is to be meaningful at all. It has been suggested that a tentative solution to these problems may lie in the fashioning of a ""common core"" of theology tolerable to all creeds but preferential to none. [n64] But as one commentator has recently observed, ""[h]istory is not encouraging to"" those who hope to fashion a ""common denominator of religion detached from its manifestation in any organized church."" Sutherland, Establishment According to Engel, 76 Harv.L.Rev. 25, 51 (1962). Thus, the notion of a ""common core"" litany or supplication offends many deeply devout worshippers who do not find clearly sectarian practices objectionable. [n65] Father Gustave Weigel has recently expressed [p287] a widely shared view: The moral code held by each separate religious community can reductively be unified, but the consistent particular believer wants no such reduction. [n66] And, as the American Council on Education warned several years ago, The notion of a common core suggests a watering down of the several faiths to the point where common essentials appear. This might easily lead to a new sect -- a public school sect -- which would take its place alongside the existing faiths and compete with them. [n67] Engel is surely authority that nonsectarian religious practices, equally with sectarian exercises, violate the Establishment Clause. Moreover, even if the Establishment Clause were oblivious to nonsectarian religious practices, I think it quite likely that the ""common core"" approach would be sufficiently objectionable to many groups to be foreclosed by the prohibitions of the Free Exercise Clause. C A third element which is said to absolve the practices involved in these cases from the ban of the religious guarantees of the Constitution is the provision to excuse or exempt students who wish not to participate. Insofar as these practices are claimed to violate the Establishment [p288] Clause, I find the answer which the District Court gave after our remand of Schempp to be altogether dispositive: The fact that some pupils, or theoretically all pupils, might be excused from attendance at the exercises does not mitigate the obligatory nature of the ceremony. . . . The exercises are held in the school buildings, and perforce are conducted by and under the authority of the local school authorities and during school sessions. Since the statute requires the reading of the ""Holy Bible,"" a Christian document, the practice, as we said in our first opinion, prefers the Christian religion. The record demonstrates that it was the intention of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to introduce a religious ceremony into the public schools of the Commonwealth. 201 F.Supp. at 819. Thus, the short, and to me sufficient, answer is that the availability of excusal or exemption simply has no relevance to the establishment question, if it is once found that these practices are essentially religious exercises designed at least in part to achieve religious aims through the use of public school facilities during the school day. The more difficult question, however, is whether the availability of excusal for the dissenting child serves to refute challenges to these practices under the Free Exercise Clause. While it is enough to decide these cases to dispose of the establishment questions, questions of free exercise are so inextricably interwoven into the history and present status of these practices as to justify disposition of this second aspect of the excusal issue. The answer is that the excusal procedure itself necessarily operates in such a way as to infringe the rights of free exercise of those children who wish to be excused. We have held in Barnette and Torcaso, respectively, that a State may require neither public school students nor candidates [p289] for an office of public trust to profess beliefs offensive to religious principles. By the same token, the State could not constitutionally require a student to profess publicly his disbelief as the prerequisite to the exercise of his constitutional right of abstention. And apart from Torcaso and Barnette, I think Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, suggests a further answer. We held there that a State may not condition the grant of a tax exemption upon the willingness of those entitled to the exemption to affirm their loyalty to the Government, even though the exemption was itself a matter of grace, rather than of constitutional right. We concluded that to impose upon the eligible taxpayers the affirmative burden of proving their loyalty impermissibly jeopardized the freedom to engage in constitutionally protected activities close to the area to which the loyalty oath related. Speiser v. Randall seems to me to dispose of two aspects of the excusal or exemption procedure now before us. First, by requiring what is tantamount in the eyes of teachers and schoolmates to a profession of disbelief, or at least of nonconformity, the procedure may well deter those children who do not wish to participate for any reason based upon the dictates of conscience from exercising an indisputably constitutional right to be excused. [n68] Thus, the excusal [p290] provision in its operation subjects them to a cruel dilemma. In consequence, even devout children may well avoid claiming their right and simply continue to participate in exercises distasteful to them because of an understandable reluctance to be stigmatized as atheists or nonconformists simply on the basis of their request. Such reluctance to seek exemption seems all the more likely in view of the fact that children are disinclined at this age to step out of line or to flout ""peer-group norms."" Such is the widely held view of experts who have studied the behaviors and attitudes of children. [n69] This is also [p291] the basis of Mr. Justice Frankfurter's answer to a similar contention made in the McCollum case: That a child is offered an alternative may reduce the constraint; it does not eliminate the operation of influence by the school in matters sacred to conscience and outside the school's domain. The law of imitation operates, and nonconformity is not an [p292] outstanding characteristic of children. The result is an obvious pressure upon children to attend. 333 U.S. at 227. Also apposite is the answer given more than 70 years ago by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin to the argument that an excusal provision saved a public school devotional exercise from constitutional invalidation: . . . the excluded pupil loses caste with his fellows, and is liable to be regarded with aversion, and subjected to reproach and insult. But it is a sufficient refutation of the argument that the practice in question tends to destroy the equality of the pupils which the constitution seeks to establish and protect, and puts a portion of them to serious disadvantage in many ways with respect to the others. State ex rel. Weiss v. District Board of School District No. 8, 76 Wis. 177, 200, 44 N.W. 967, 975. And, 50 years ago, a like answer was offered by the Louisiana Supreme Court: Under such circumstances, the children would be excused from the opening exercises . . . because of their religious beliefs. And excusing such children on religious grounds, although the number excused might be very small, would be a distinct preference in favor of the religious beliefs of the majority, and would work a discrimination against those who were excused. The exclusion of a pupil under such circumstances puts him in a class by himself; it subjects him to a religious stigma, and all because of his religious belief. Equality in public education would be destroyed by such act, under a Constitution which seeks to establish equality and freedom in religious matters. Herold v. Parish Board of School Directors, 136 La. 1034, 1049-1050, 68 So. 116, 121. See also Tudor v. Board of Education, 14 N.J. 31, 48-52, [p293] 100 A.2d 857, 867-868; Brown v. Orange County Board of Public Instruction, 128 So.2d 181, 185 (Fla.App.). Speiser v. Randall also suggests the answer to a further argument based on the excusal procedure. It has been suggested by the School Board, in Schempp, that we ought not pass upon the appellees' constitutional challenge at least until the children have availed themselves of the excusal procedure and found it inadequate to redress their grievances. Were the right to be excused not itself of constitutional stature, I might have some doubt about this issue. But we held in Speiser that the constitutional vice of the loyalty oath procedure discharged any obligation to seek the exemption before challenging the constitutionality of the conditions upon which it might have been denied. 357 U.S. at 529. Similarly, we have held that one need not apply for a permit to distribute constitutionally protected literature, Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U.S. 444, or to deliver a speech, Thomas v. Collins, 323 U.S. 516, before he may attack the constitutionality of a licensing system of which the defect is patent. Insofar as these cases implicate only questions of establishment, it seems to me that the availability of an excuse is constitutionally irrelevant. Moreover, the excusal procedure seems to me to operate in such a way as to discourage the free exercise of religion on the part of those who might wish to utilize it, thereby rendering it unconstitutional in an additional and quite distinct respect. To summarize my views concerning the merits of these two cases: the history, the purpose and the operation of the daily prayer recital and Bible reading leave no doubt that these practices, standing by themselves, constitute an impermissible breach of the Establishment Clause. Such devotional exercises may well serve legitimate nonreligious purposes. To the extent, however, that such purposes [p294] are really without religious significance, it has never been demonstrated that secular means would not suffice. Indeed, I would suggest that patriotic or other nonreligious materials might provide adequate substitutes -- inadequate only to the extent that the purposes now served are indeed directly or indirectly religious. Under such circumstances, the States may not employ religious means to reach a secular goal unless secular means are wholly unavailing. I therefore agree with the Court that the judgment in Schempp, No. 142, must be affirmed, and that, in Murray, No. 119, must be reversed. V These considerations bring me to a final contention of the school officials in these cases: that the invalidation of the exercises at bar permits this Court no alternative but to declare unconstitutional every vestige, however slight, of cooperation or accommodation between religion and government. I cannot accept that contention. While it is not, of course, appropriate for this Court to decide questions not presently before it, I venture to suggest that religious exercises in the public schools present a unique problem. For not every involvement of religion in public life violates the Establishment Clause. Our decision in these cases does not clearly forecast anything about the constitutionality of other types of interdependence between religious and other public institutions. Specifically, I believe that the line we must draw between the permissible and the impermissible is one which accords with history and faithfully reflects the understanding of the Founding Fathers. It is a line which the Court has consistently sought to mark in its decisions expounding the religious guarantees of the First Amendment. What the Framers meant to foreclose, and what our decisions under the Establishment Clause have forbidden, [p295] are those involvements of religious with secular institutions which (a) serve the essentially religious activities of religious institutions; (b) employ the organs of government for essentially religious purposes; or (c) use essentially religious means to serve governmental ends where secular means would suffice. When the secular and religious institutions become involved in such a manner, there inhere in the relationship precisely those dangers -- as much to church as to state -- which the Framers feared would subvert religious liberty and the strength of a system of secular government. On the other hand, there may be myriad forms of involvements of government with religion which do not import such dangers, and therefore should not, in my judgment, be deemed to violate the Establishment Clause. Nothing in the Constitution compels the organs of government to be blind to what everyone else perceives -- that religious differences among Americans have important and pervasive implications for our society. Likewise, nothing in the Establishment Clause forbids the application of legislation having purely secular ends in such a way as to alleviate burdens upon the free exercise of an individual's religious beliefs. Surely the Framers would never have understood that such a construction sanctions that involvement which violates the Establishment Clause. Such a conclusion can be reached, I would suggest, only by using the words of the First Amendment to defeat its very purpose. The line between permissible and impermissible forms of involvement between government and religion has already been considered by the lower federal and state courts. I think a brief survey of certain of these forms of accommodation will reveal that the First Amendment commands not official hostility toward religion, but only a strict neutrality in matters of religion. Moreover, it may serve to suggest that the scope of our holding today [p296] is to be measured by the special circumstances under which these cases have arisen, and by the particular dangers to church and state which religious exercises in the public schools present. It may be helpful for purposes of analysis to group these other practices and forms of accommodation into several rough categories. A. The Conflict Between Establishment and Free Exercise. -- There are certain practices, conceivably violative of the Establishment Clause, the striking down of which might seriously interfere with certain religious liberties also protected by the First Amendment. [n70] Provisions for churches and chaplains at military establishments for those in the armed services may afford one such example. [n71] [p297] The like provision by state and federal governments for chaplains in penal institutions may afford another example. [n72] It is argued that such provisions may be assumed to contravene the Establishment Clause, yet be sustained on constitutional grounds as necessary to secure to the members of the Armed Forces and prisoners those rights of worship guaranteed under the Free Exercise Clause. Since government has deprived such persons of the opportunity [p298] to practice their faith at places of their choice, the argument runs, government may, in order to avoid infringing the free exercise guarantees, provide substitutes where it requires such persons to be. Such a principle might support, for example, the constitutionality of draft exemptions for ministers and divinity students, [n73] cf. Selective Draft Law Cases, 245 U.S. 366, 389-390; of the excusal of children from school on their respective religious holidays, and of the allowance by government of temporary use of public buildings by religious organizations when their own churches have become unavailable because of a disaster or emergency. [n74] Such activities and practices seem distinguishable from the sponsorship of daily Bible reading and prayer recital. For one thing, there is no element of coercion present in the appointment of military or prison chaplains; the soldier or convict who declines the opportunities for worship would not ordinarily subject himself to the suspicion or obloquy of his peers. Of special significance to this distinction is the fact that we are here usually dealing [p299] with adults, not with impressionable children as in the public schools. Moreover, the school exercises are not designed to provide the pupils with general opportunities for worship denied them by the legal obligation to attend school. The student's compelled presence in school for five days a week in no way renders the regular religious facilities of the community less accessible to him than they are to others. The situation of the school child is therefore plainly unlike that of the isolated soldier or the prisoner. The State must be steadfastly neutral in all matters of faith, and neither favor nor inhibit religion. In my view, government cannot sponsor religious exercises in the public schools without jeopardizing that neutrality. On the other hand, hostility, not neutrality, would characterize the refusal to provide chaplains and places of worship for prisoners and soldiers cut off by the State from all civilian opportunities for public communion, the withholding of draft exemptions for ministers and conscientious objectors, or the denial of the temporary use of an empty public building to a congregation whose place of worship has been destroyed by fire or flood. I do not say that government must provide chaplains or draft exemptions, or that the courts should intercede if it fails to do so. B. Establishment and Exercises in Legislative Bodies. -- The saying of invocational prayers in legislative chambers, state or federal, and the appointment of legislative chaplains, might well represent no involvements of the kind prohibited by the Establishment Clause. [n75] Legislators, federal and state, are mature adults who may presumably absent themselves from such public and ceremonial [p300] exercises without incurring any penalty, direct or indirect. It may also be significant that, at least in the case of the Congress, Art. I, § 5, of the Constitution makes each House the monitor of the ""Rules of its Proceedings"" so that it is at least arguable whether such matters present ""political questions"" the resolution of which is exclusively confided to Congress. See Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 232. Finally, there is the difficult question of who may be heard to challenge such practices. See Elliott v. White, 23 F.2d 997. C. Non-Devotional Use of the Bible in the Public Schools. -- The holding of the Court today plainly does not foreclose teaching about the Holy Scriptures or about the differences between religious sects in classes in literature or history. Indeed, whether or not the Bible is involved, it would be impossible to teach meaningfully many subjects in the social sciences or the humanities without some mention of religion. [n76] To what extent, and at what points in the curriculum, religious materials should be cited are matters which the courts ought to entrust very largely to the experienced officials who superintend our Nation's public schools. They are experts in such matters, and we are not. We should heed Mr. Justice Jackson's caveat that any attempt by this Court to announce curricular standards would be to decree a uniform, rigid and, if we are consistent, an unchanging standard for countless school boards representing [p301] and serving highly localized groups which not only differ from each other, but which themselves from time to time change attitudes. Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Education, supra, at 237. We do not, however, in my view, usurp the jurisdiction of school administrators by holding, as we do today, that morning devotional exercises in any form are constitutionally invalid. But there is no occasion now to go further and anticipate problems we cannot judge with the material now before us. Any attempt to impose rigid limits upon the mention of God or references to the Bible in the classroom would be fraught with dangers. If it should sometime hereafter be shown that, in fact, religion can play no part in the teaching of a given subject without resurrecting the ghost of the practices we strike down today, it will then be time enough to consider questions we must now defer. D. Uniform Tax Exemptions Incidentally Available to Religious Institutions. -- Nothing we hold today questions the propriety of certain tax deductions or exemptions which incidentally benefit churches and religious institutions, along with many secular charities and nonprofit organizations. If religious institutions benefit, it is in spite of, rather than because of, their religious character. For religious institutions simply share benefits which government makes generally available to educational, charitable, and eleemosynary groups. [n77] There is no indication that taxing authorities have used such benefits in any way to subsidize worship or foster belief in God. And as [p302] among religious beneficiaries, the tax exemption or deduction can be truly nondiscriminatory, available on equal terms to small as well as large religious bodies, to popular and unpopular sects, and to those organizations which reject, as well as those which accept, a belief in God. [n78] E. Religious Considerations in Public Welfare Programs. -- Since government may not support or directly aid religious activities without violating the Establishment Clause, there might be some doubt whether nondiscriminatory programs of governmental aid may constitutionally include individuals who become eligible wholly or partially for religious reasons. For example, it might be suggested that, where a State provides unemployment compensation generally to those who are unable to find suitable work, it may not extend such benefits to persons who are unemployed by reason of religious beliefs or practices without thereby establishing the religion to which those persons belong. Therefore, the argument runs, the State may avoid an establishment only by singling out and excluding such persons on the ground that religious beliefs or practices have made them potential beneficiaries. Such a construction would, it seems to me, require government to impose religious discriminations and disabilities, thereby jeopardizing the free exercise of religion, in order to avoid what is thought to constitute an establishment. The inescapable flaw in the argument, I suggest, is its quite unrealistic view of the aims of the Establishment Clause. The Framers were not concerned with the effects of certain incidental aids to individual worshippers which come about as by-products of general and nondiscriminatory welfare programs. If such benefits serve to make [p303] easier or less expensive the practice of a particular creed, or of all religions, it can hardly be said that the purpose of the program is in any way religious, or that the consequence of its nondiscriminatory application is to create the forbidden degree of interdependence between secular and sectarian institutions. I cannot therefore accept the suggestion, which seems to me implicit in the argument outlined here, that every judicial or administrative construction which is designed to prevent a public welfare program from abridging the free exercise of religious beliefs, is for, that reason, ipso facto, an establishment of religion. F. Activities Which, Though Religious in Origin, Have Ceased to Have Religious Meaning. -- As we noted in our Sunday Law decisions, nearly every criminal law on the books can be traced to some religious principle or inspiration. But that does not make the present enforcement of the criminal law in any sense an establishment of religion, simply because it accords with widely held religious principles. As we said in McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 442, the ""Establishment"" Clause does not ban federal or state regulation of conduct whose reason or effect merely happens to coincide or harmonize with the tenets of some or all religions. This rationale suggests that the use of the motto ""In God We Trust"" on currency, on documents and public buildings and the like may not offend the clause. It is not that the use of those four words can be dismissed as ""de minimis"" -- for I suspect there would be intense opposition to the abandonment of that motto. The truth is that we have simply interwoven the motto so deeply into the fabric of our civil polity that its present use may well not present that type of involvement which the First Amendment prohibits. This general principle might also serve to insulate the various patriotic exercises and activities used in the public schools and elsewhere which, whatever may have been [p304] their origins, no longer have a religious purpose or meaning. The reference to divinity in the revised pledge of allegiance, for example, may merely recognize the historical fact that our Nation was believed to have been founded ""under God."" Thus, reciting the pledge may be no more of a religious exercise than the reading aloud of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, which contains an allusion to the same historical fact. The principles which we reaffirm and apply today can hardly be thought novel or radical. They are, in truth, as old as the Republic itself, and have always been as integral a part of the First Amendment as the very words of that charter of religious liberty. No less applicable today than they were when first pronounced a century ago, one year after the very first court decision involving religious exercises in the public schools, are the words of a distinguished Chief Justice of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Jeremiah S. Black: The manifest object of the men who framed the institutions of this country, was to have a State without religion, and a Church without politics -- that is to say, they meant that one should never be used as an engine for any purpose of the other, and that no man's rights in one should be tested by his opinions about the other. As the Church takes no note of men's political differences, so the State looks with equal eye on all the modes of religious faith. . . . Our fathers seem to have been perfectly sincere in their belief that the members of the Church would be more patriotic, and the citizens of the State more religious, by keeping their respective functions entirely separate.

Jefferson's caveat was, in full: Instead, therefore, of putting the Bible and Testament into the hands of the children at an age when their judgments are not sufficiently matured for religious inquiries, their memories may here be stored with the most useful facts from Grecian, Roman, European and American history. 2 Writings of Thomas Jefferson (Memorial ed.1903), 204. Compare Jefferson's letter to his nephew, Peter Carr, when the latter was about to begin the study of law, in which Jefferson outlined a suggested course of private study of religion, since ""[y]our reason is now mature enough to examine this object."" Letter to Peter Carr, August 10, 1787, in Padover, The Complete Jefferson (1943), 1058. Jefferson seems to have opposed sectarian instruction at any level of public education, see Healey, Jefferson on Religion in Public Education (1962), 206-210, 256, 264-265. The absence of any mention of religious instruction in the projected elementary and secondary schools contrasts significantly with Jefferson's quite explicit proposals concerning religious instruction at the University of Virginia. His draft for ""A Bill for the More General Diffusion of Knowledge,"" in 1779, for example, outlined in some detail the secular curriculum for the public schools, while avoiding any references to religious studies. See Padover, supra, at 1048-1054. The later draft of an ""Act for Establishing Elementary Schools"" which Jefferson submitted to the Virginia General Assembly in 1817 provided that no religious reading, instruction or exercise, shall be prescribed or practiced inconsistent with the tenets of any religious sect or denomination. Padover, supra, at 1076. Reliance upon Jefferson's apparent willingness to permit certain religious instruction at the University seems, therefore, to lend little support to such instruction in the elementary and secondary schools. Compare, e.g., Corwin, A Constitution of Powers in a Secular State (1951), 104-106; Costanzo, Thomas Jefferson, Religious Education and Public Law, 8 J.Pub.Law 81, 100-106 (1959). 5. Cf.

The Problem of Church and State in the United States, Pub.Law 374. One author has suggested these reasons for cautious application of the history of the Constitution's religious guarantees to contemporary problems: First, the brevity of Congressional debate and the lack of writings on the question by the framers make any historical argument inconclusive, and open to serious question. Second, the amendment was designed to outlaw practices which had existed before its writing, but there is no authoritative declaration of the specific practices at which it was aimed. And third, most of the modern religious freedom cases turn on issues which were, at most, academic in 1789, and perhaps did not exist at all. Public education was almost nonexistent in 1789, and the question of religious education in public schools may not have been foreseen. Beth, The American Theory of Church and State (1958), 88. 6. See generally, for discussion of the early efforts for disestablishment of the established colonial churches, and of the conditions against which the proponents of separation of church and state contended, Sweet, The Story of Religion in America (1950), c.

The origins of the modern movement for free state supported education cannot be fixed with precision. In England, the Levellers unavailingly urged in their platform of 1649 the establishment of free primary education for all, or at least for boys. See Brailsford, The Levellers and the English Revolution (1961), 534. In the North American Colonies, education was, almost without exception, under private sponsorship and supervision, frequently under control of the dominant Protestant sects. This condition prevailed after the Revolution and into the first quarter of the nineteenth century. See generally Mason, Moral Values and Secular Education (1950), c. II; Thayer, The Role of the School in American Society (1960), c. X; Greene, Religion and the State: The Making and Testing of an American Tradition (1941), 120-122. Thus, Virginia's colonial Governor Berkeley exclaimed in 1671: I thank God there are no free schools nor printing, and I hope we shall not have them these hundred years; for learning has brought disobedience, and heresy, and sects into the world. . . . (Emphasis deleted.) Bates, Religious Liberty: An Inquiry (1945), 327. The exclusively private control of American education did not, however, quite survive Berkeley's expectations. Benjamin Franklin's proposals in 1749 for a Philadelphia Academy heralded the dawn of publicly supported secondary education, although the proposal did not bear immediate fruit. See Johnson and Yost, Separation of Church and State in the United States (1948), 26-27. Jefferson's elaborate plans for a public school system in Virginia came to naught after the defeat in 1796 of his proposed Elementary School Bill, which found little favor among the wealthier legislators. See Bowers, The Young Jefferson (1945), 182-186. It was not until the 1820's and 1830's, under the impetus of Jacksonian democracy, that a system of public education really took root in the United States. See 1 Beard, The Rise of American Civilization (1937), 810-818. One force behind the development of secular public schools may have been a growing dissatisfaction with the tightly sectarian control over private education, see Harner, Religion's Place in General Education (1949), 29-30. Yet the burgeoning public school systems did not immediately supplant the old sectarian and private institutions; Alexis de Tocqueville, for example, remarked after his tour of the Eastern States in 1831 that ""[a]lmost all education is entrusted to the clergy."" 1 Democracy in America (Bradley ed.1945) 309, n. 4. And compare Lord Bryce's observations, a half century later, on the still largely denominational character of American higher education, 2 The American Commonwealth (1933), 734-735. Efforts to keep the public schools of the early nineteenth century free from sectarian influence were of two kinds. One took the form of constitutional provisions and statutes adopted by a number of States forbidding appropriations from the public treasury for the support of religious instruction in any manner. See Moehlman, The Wall of Separation Between Church and State (1951), 132-135; Lardner, How Far Does the Constitution Separate Church and State? 45 Am.Pol.Sci.Rev. 110, 122 (1951). The other took the form of measures directed against the use of sectarian reading and teaching materials in the schools. The texts used in the earliest public schools had been largely taken over from the private academies, and retained a strongly religious character and content. See Nichols, Religion and American Democracy (1959), 640; Kinney, Church and State, The Struggle for Separation in New Hampshire, 1630-1900 (1955), 150-153. In 1827, however, Massachusetts enacted a statute providing that school boards might not thereafter direct any school books to be purchased or used, in any of the schools . . . which are calculated to favour any particular religious sect or tenet. 2 Stokes, Church and State in the United States (1950), 53. For further discussion of the background of the Massachusetts law and difficulties in its early application, see Dunn, What Happened to Religious Education? (1958), c. IV. As other States followed the example of Massachusetts, the use of sectarian texts was in time as widely prohibited as the appropriation of public funds for religious instruction. Concerning the evolution of the American public school systems free of sectarian influence, compare Mr. Justice Frankfurter's account: It is pertinent to remind that the establishment of this principle of Separation in the field of education was not due to any decline in the religious beliefs of the people. Horace Mann was a devout Christian, and the deep religious feeling of James Madison is stamped upon the Remonstrance. The secular public school did not imply indifference to the basic role of religion in the life of the people, nor rejection of religious education as a means of fostering it. The claims of religion were not minimized by refusing to make the public schools agencies for their assertion. The nonsectarian or secular public school was the means of reconciling freedom in general with religious freedom. The sharp confinement of the public schools to secular education was a recognition of the need of a democratic society to educate its children, insofar as the State undertook to do so, in an atmosphere free from pressures in a realm in which pressures are most resisted and where conflicts are most easily and most bitterly engendered.

The comparative religious homogeneity of the United States at the time the Bill of Rights was adopted has been considered in Haller, The Puritan Background of the First Amendment, in Read ed., The Constitution Reconsidered (1938) , 131, 133-134; Beth, The American Theory of Church and State (1958), 74; Kinney, Church and State, The Struggle for Separation in New Hampshire, 1630-1900 (1955), 155-161. However, Madison suggested in the Fifty-first Federalist that the religious diversity which existed at the time of the Constitutional Convention constituted a source of strength for religious freedom, much as the multiplicity of economic and political interests enhanced the security of other civil rights. The Federalist (Cooke ed.1961), 351-352. 9. See Comment, The Power of Courts Over the Internal Affairs of Religious Groups, 43 Calif.L.Rev. 322 (1955); Comment, Judicial Intervention in Disputes Within Independent Church Bodies, 54 Mich.L.Rev. 102 (1955); Note, Judicial Intervention in Disputes Over the Use of Church Property, 75 Harv.L.Rev. 1142 (1962). Compare Vidal v. Girard's Executors, 2 How. 127. The principle of judicial nonintervention in essentially religious disputes appears to have been reflected in the decisions of several state courts declining to enforce essentially private agreements concerning the religious education and worship of children of separated or divorced parents. See, e.g., Hackett v. Hackett, 78 Ohio Abs. 485, 150 N.E.2d 431; Stanton v. Stanton, 213 Ga. 545, 100 S.E.2d 289; Friedman, The Parental Right to Control the Religious Education of a Child, 29 Harv.L.Rev. 485 (1916); 72 Harv.L.Rev. 372 (1958); Note, 10 West. Res.L.Rev. 171 (1959). Governmental nonintervention in religious affairs and institutions seems assured by Article 26 of the Constitution of India, which provides: Subject to public order, morality and health, every religious denomination or any section thereof shall have the right -- (a) to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes; (b) to manage its own affairs in matters of religion; (c) to own and acquire movable and immovable property; and (d) to administer such property in accordance with law. See 1 Chaudhri, Constitutional Rights and Limitations (1955), 875. This Article does not, however, appear to have completely foreclosed judicial inquiry into the merits of intradenominational disputes. See Gledhill, Fundamental Rights in India (1955), 101-102. 10. For a discussion of the difficulties inherent in the Ballard case, see Kurland, Religion and the Law (1962), 75-79. This Court eventually reversed the convictions on the quite unrelated ground that women had been systematically excluded from the jury, Ballard v. United States, 329 U.S. 187. For discussions of the difficulties in interpreting and applying the First Amendment so as to foster the objective of neutrality without hostility, see, e.g., Katz, Freedom of Religion and State Neutrality, 20 U. of Chi.L.Rev. 426, 438 (1953); Kauper, Church, State, and Freedom: A Review, 52 Mich.L.Rev. 829, 842 (1954). Compare, for an interesting apparent attempt to avoid the Ballard problem at the international level, Article 3 of the Multilateral Treaty between the United States and certain American Republics, which provides that extradition will not be granted, inter alia, when ""the offense is . . . directed against religion."" Blakely, American State Papers and Related Documents on Freedom in Religion (4th rev. ed.1949), 316. 11. See Kurland, Religion and the Law (1962), 32-34. 12. Compare the treatment of an apparently very similar problem in Article 28 of the Constitution of India: (1) No religious instruction shall be provided in any educational institution wholly maintained out of State funds. (2) Nothing in clause (1) shall apply to an educational institution which is administered by the State but has been established under any endowment or trust which requires that religious instruction shall be imparted in such institution. 1 Chaudhri, Constitutional Rights and Limitations (1955), 875-876, 939. 13. See Kurland, Religion and the Law (1962), 231; Fellman, Separation of Church and State in the United State: A Summary View, 1950 Wis.L.Rev. 427, 442. 14. This distinction, implicit in the First Amendment, had been made explicit in the original Virginia Bill of Rights provision that all men should enjoy the fullest toleration in the exercise of religion according to the dictates of conscience, unpunished and unrestrained by the magistrate, unless, under color of religion, any man disturb the peace, the happiness, or safety of society. See Cobb, The Rise of Religious Liberty in America (1902), 491. Concerning various legislative limitations and restraints upon religiously motivated behavior which endangers or offends society, see Manwaring, Render Unto Caesar: The Flag-Salute Controversy (1962), 412. Various courts have applied this principle to proscribe certain religious exercises or activities which were thought to threaten the safety or morals of the participants or the rest of the community, e.g., State v. Massey, 229 N.C. 734, 51 S.E.2d 179; Harden v. State, 188 Tenn. 17, 216 S.W.2d 708; Lawson v. Commonwealth, 291 Ky. 437, 164 S.W.2d 972; cf. Sweeney v. Webb, 33 Tex.Civ.App. 324, 76 S.W. 766. That the principle of these cases, and the distinction between belief and behavior, are susceptible of perverse application may be suggested by Oliver Cromwell's mandate to the besieged Catholic community in Ireland: As to freedom of conscience, I meddle with no man's conscience; but if you mean by that liberty to celebrate the Mass, I would have you understand that in no place where the power of the Parliament of England prevails shall that be permitted. Quoted in Hook, The Paradoxes of Freedom (1962), 23. 15. With respect to the decision in Hamilton v. Regents, compare two recent comments: Kurland, Religion and the Law (1962), 40, and French, Comment, Unconstitutional Conditions: An Analysis 50 Geo.L.J. 234, 246 (1961). 16. See generally as to the background and history of the Barnette case, Manwaring, Render Unto Caesar: The Flag-Salute Controversy (1962), especially at 252-253. Compare, for the interesting treatment of a problem similar to that of Barnette, in a nonconstitutional context, Chabot v. Les Commissaires D'Ecoles de Lamorandiere, Que.B.R. 707, noted in 4 McGill L.J. 268 (1958). 17. See Barron v. Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243; Permoli v. New Orleans, 3 How. 589, 609; cf. Fox v. Ohio, 5 How. 410, 434-435; Withers v. Buckley, 20 How. 84, 89-91. As early as 1825, however, at least one commentator argued that the guarantees of the Bill of Rights, excepting only those of the First and Seventh Amendments, were meant to limit the powers of the States. Rawle, A View of the Constitution of the United States of America (1825), 120-130. 18. In addition to the statement of this Court in Meyer, at least one state court assumed as early as 1921 that claims of abridgment of the free exercise of religion in the public schools must be tested under the guarantees of the First Amendment, as well as those of the state constitution. Hardwick v. Board of School Trustees, 54 Cal.App. 696, 704-705, 205 P. 49, 52. See Louisell and Jackson, Religion, Theology, and Public Higher Education, 50 Cal.L.Rev. 751, 772 (1962). Even before the Fourteenth Amendment, New York State enacted a general common school law in 1844 which provided that no religious instruction should be given which could be construed to violate the rights of conscience ""as secured by the constitution of this state and the United States."" N.Y.Laws, 1844, c. 320, § 12. 19. See, e.g., Snee, Religious Disestablishment and the Fourteenth Amendment, 1954 Wash.U.L.Q. 371, 373-394; Kruse, The Historical Meaning and Judicial Construction of the Establishment of Religion Clause of the First Amendment, 2 Washburn L.J. 65, 84-85, 127130 (1962); Katz, Religion and American Constitutions, Address at Northwestern University Law School, March 20, 1963, pp.6-7. But see the debate in the Constitutional Convention over the question whether it was necessary or advisable to include among the enumerated powers of the Congress a power ""to establish an University, in which no preferences or distinctions should be allowed on account of religion."" At least one delegate thought such an explicit delegation ""is not necessary,"" for ""[t]he exclusive power at the Seat of Government will reach the object."" The proposal was defeated by only two votes. 2 Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention of 1787 (1911), 616. 20. The last formal establishment, that of Massachusetts, was dissolved in 1833. The process of disestablishment in that and other States is described in Cobb, The Rise of Religious Liberty in America (1902), c. X; Sweet, The Story of Religion in America (1950), c. XIII. The greater relevance of conditions existing at the time of adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment is suggested in Note, State Sunday Laws and the Religious Guarantees of the Federal Constitution, 7 Harv.L.Rev. 729, 739, n. 79 (1960). 21. See Corwin, A Constitution of Powers in a Secular State (1951), 111-114; Fairman and Morrison, Does the Fourteenth Amendment Incorporate the Bill of Rights? 2 Stan.L.Rev. 5 (1949); Meyer, Comment, The Blaine Amendment and the Bill of Rights, 64 Harv.L.Rev. 939 (1951); Howe, Religion and Race in Public Education, 8 Buffalo L.Rev. 242, 245-247 (1959). Cf. Cooley, Principles of Constitutional Law (2d ed. 1891), 213-214. Compare Professor Freund's comment: Looking back, it is hard to see how the Court could have done otherwise, how it could have persisted in accepting freedom of contract as a guaranteed liberty without giving equal status to freedom of press and speech, assembly, and religious observance. What does not seem so inevitable is the inclusion within the Fourteenth Amendment of the concept of nonestablishment of religion in the sense of forbidding nondiscriminatory aid to religion, where there is no interference with freedom of religious exercise. Freund, The Supreme Court of the United States (1961), 58-59. 22. The Blaine Amendment, 4 Cong.Rec. 5580, included also a more explicit provision that no money raised by taxation in any State for the support of public schools or derived from any public fund therefor, nor any public lands devoted thereto, shall ever be under the control of any religious sect or denomination. . . . The Amendment passed the House but failed to obtain the requisite two-thirds vote in the Senate. See 4 Cong.Rec. 5595. The prohibition which the Blaine Amendment would have engrafted onto the American Constitution has been incorporated in the constitutions of other nations; compare Article 28(1) of the Constitution of India (""No religious instruction shall be provided in any educational institution wholly maintained out of State funds""); Article XX of the Constitution of Japan ("". . . the State and its organs shall refrain from religious education or any other religious activity""). See 1 Chaudhri, Constitutional Rights and Limitations (1955), 875, 876. 23. Three years after the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, Mr. Justice Bradley wrote a letter expressing his views on a proposed constitutional amendment designed to acknowledge the dependence of the Nation upon God, and to recognize the Bible as the foundation of its laws and the supreme ruler of its conduct: I have never been able to see the necessity or expediency of the movement for obtaining such an amendment. The Constitution was evidently framed and adopted by the people of the United States with the fixed determination to allow absolute religious freedom and equality, and to avoid all appearance even of a State religion, or a State endorsement of any particular creed or religious sect. . . . And after the Constitution in its original form was adopted, the people made haste to secure an amendment that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. This shows the earnest desire of our Revolutionary fathers that religion should be left to the free and voluntary action of the people themselves. I do not regard it as manifesting any hostility to religion, but as showing a fixed determination to leave the people entirely free on the subject. And it seems to me that our fathers were wise; that the great voluntary system of this country is quite as favorable to the promotion of real religion as the systems of governmental protection and patronage have been in other countries. And whilst I do not understand that the association which you represent desire to invoke any governmental interference, still the amendment sought is a step in that direction which our fathers (quite as good Christians as ourselves) thought it wise not to take. In this country, they thought they had settled one thing at least, that it is not the province of government to teach theology. . . . Religion, as the basis and support of civil government, must reside not in the written Constitution, but in the people themselves. And we cannot legislate religion into the people. It must be infused by gentler and wiser methods. Miscellaneous Writings of Joseph P. Bradley (1901), 357-359. For a later phase of the controversy over such a constitutional amendment as that which Justice Bradley opposed, see Finlator, Christ in Congress, 4 J. Church and State 205 (1962). 24. There is no doubt that, whatever ""establishment"" may have meant to the Framers of the First Amendment in 1791, the draftsmen of the Fourteenth Amendment three quarters of a century later understood the Establishment Clause to foreclose many incidental forms of governmental aid to religion which fell far short of the creation or support of an official church. The Report of a Senate Committee as early as 1853, for example, contained this view of the Establishment Clause: If Congress has passed, or should pass, any law which, fairly construed, has in any degree introduced, or should attempt to introduce, in favor of any church, or ecclesiastical association, or system of religious faith, all or any one of these obnoxious particulars -- endowment at the public expense, peculiar privileges to its members, or disadvantages or penalties upon those who should reject its doctrines or belong to other communions -- such law would be a ""law respecting an establishment of religion,"" and, therefore, in violation of the constitution. S.Rep. No. 376, 32d Cong., 2d Sess. 1-2. Compare Thomas M. Cooley's exposition in the year in which the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified: Those things which are not lawful under any of the American constitutions may be stated thus: 1. Any law respecting an establishment of religion. . . . 2. Compulsory support, by taxation or otherwise, of religious instruction. Not only is no one denomination to be favored at the expense of the rest, but all support of religious instruction must be entirely voluntary. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations (1st ed. 1868), 469. 25. Compare, e.g., Miller, Roger Williams: is Contribution to the American Tradition (1953), 83, with Madison, Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments, reprinted as an Appendix to the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Rutledge, Everson v.

See 343 U.S. at 321-322 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting); Kurland, Religion and the Law (1962), 89. I recognize that there is a question whether, in Zorach, the free exercise claims asserted were, in fact, proved. 343 U.S. at 311. 28. Mr. Justice Frankfurter described the effects of the McCollum program thus: Religious education so conducted on school time and property is patently woven into the working scheme of the school. The Champaign arrangement thus presents powerful elements of inherent pressure by the school system in the interest of religious sects. . . . As a result, the public school system of Champaign actively furthers inculcation in the religious tenets of some faiths, and in the process, sharpens the consciousness of religious differences, at least among some of the children committed to its care. 333 U.S. at 227-228. For similar reasons, some state courts have enjoined the public schools from employing or accepting the services of members of religious orders even in the teaching of secular subjects, e.g., Zellers v. Huff, 55 N.M. 501, 236 P.2d 949; Berghorn v. Reorganized School Dist. No. 8, 364 Mo. 121, 260 S.W.2d 573; compare ruling of Texas Commissioner of Education, Jan. 25, 1961, in 63 American Jewish Yearbook (1962), 188. Over a half century ago, a New York court sustained a school board's exclusion from the public schools of teachers wearing religious garb on similar grounds: Then, all through the school hours, these teachers . . . were before the children as object lessons of the order and church of which they were members. It is within our common observation that young children . . . are very susceptible to the influence of their teachers and of the kind of object lessons continually before them in schools conducted under these circumstances and with these surroundings. O'Connor v. Hendrick, 109 App.Div. 361, 371-372, 96 N.Y.Supp. 161, 169. See also Commonwealth v. Herr, 229 Pa. 132, 78 A. 68; Comment, Religious Garb in the Public Schools -- A Study in Conflicting Liberties, 22 U. of Chi.L.Rev. 888 (1955). Also apposite are decisions of several courts which have enjoined the use of parochial schools as part of the public school system, Harfst v. Hoegen, 349 Mo. 808, 163 S.W.2d 609; or have invalidated programs for the distribution in public school classrooms of Gideon Bibles, Brown v. Orange County Board of Public Instruction, 128 So.2d 181 (Fla.App.); Tudor v. Board of Education, 14 N.J. 31, 100 A.2d 857. See Note, The First Amendment and Distribution of Religious Literature in the Public Schools, 41 Va.L.Rev. 789, 803-806 (1955). In Tudor, the court stressed the role of the public schools in the Bible program: . . . the public school machinery is used to bring about the distribution of these Bibles to the children. . . . In the eyes of the pupils and their parents, the board of education has placed its stamp of approval upon this distribution and, in fact, upon the Gideon Bible itself. . . . This is more than mere ""accommodation"" of religion permitted in the Zorach case. The school's part in this distribution is an active one, and cannot be sustained on the basis of a mere assistance to religion. 14 N.J. at 51-52, 100 A.2d at 868. The significance of the teacher's authority was recognized by one early state court decision: The school being in session, the right to command was vested in the teacher, and the duty of obedience imposed upon the pupils. Under such circumstances, a request and a command have the same meaning. A request from one in authority is understood to be a mere euphemism. It is, in fact, a command in an inoffensive form. State ex rel. Freeman v. Scheve, 65 Neb. 876, 880, 93 N.W. 169, 170. 29. See, for other illustrations of the principle that, where First Amendment freedoms are or may be affected, government must employ those means which will least inhibit the exercise of constitutional liberties, Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U.S. 444; Schneider v. State, 308 U.S. 147, 161; Martin v. Struthers, 319 U.S. 141; Saia v. New York, 334 U.S. 558; Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, 488-489; Bantam Books, Inc., v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58, 66, 69-71. See also Note, State Sunday Laws and the Religious Guarantees of the Federal Constitution, 73 Harv.L.Rev. 729, 743-745 (1960); Freund, The Supreme Court of the United States (1961), 86-87; 74 Harv.L.Rev. 613 (1961). And compare Miller v. Cooper, 56 N.M. 355, 244 P.2d 520 (1952), in which a state court permitted the holding of public school commencement exercises in a church building only because no public buildings in the community were adequate to accommodate the ceremony. 30. No question has been raised in these cases concerning the standing of these parents to challenge the religious practices conducted in the schools which their children presently attend. Whatever authority Doremus v. Board of Education, 342 U.S. 429, might have on the question of the standing of one not the parent of children affected by the challenged exercises is not before us in these cases. Neither in McCollum nor in Zorach was there any reason to question the standing of the parent plaintiffs under settled principles of justiciability and jurisdiction, whether or not their complaints alleged pecuniary loss or monetary injury. The free exercise claims of the parents alleged injury sufficient to give them standing. If, however, the gravamen of the lawsuit were exclusively one of establishment, it might seem illogical to confer standing upon a parent who -- though he is concededly in the best position to assert a free exercise claim -- suffers no financial injury, by reason of being a parent, different from that of the ordinary taxpayer, whose standing may be open to question. See Sutherland, Establishment According to Engel, 76 Harv.L.Rev. 25, 41-43 (1962). I would suggest several answers to this conceptual difficulty. First, the parent is surely the person most directly and immediately concerned about and affected by the challenged establishment, and to deny him standing either in his own right or on behalf of his child might effectively foreclose judicial inquiry into serious breaches of the prohibitions of the First Amendment -- even though no special monetary injury could be shown. See Schempp v. School District of Abington Township, 177 F.Supp. 398, 407; Kurland, The Regents' Prayer Case: ""Full of Sound and Fury, Signifying . . . ,"" 1962 Supreme Court Review 1, 22. Second, the complaint in every case thus far challenging an establishment has set forth at least a colorable claim of infringement of free exercise. When the complaint includes both claims, and neither is frivolous, it would surely be overtechnical to say that a parent who does not detail the monetary cost of the exercises to him may ask the court to pass only upon the free exercise claim, however logically the two may be related. Cf. Pierce v. Society of Sisters, supra; Truax v. Raich, 239 U.S. 33, 38-39; NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 458-460; Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678; Bantam Books, Inc., v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58, 64, n. 6. Finally, the concept of standing is a necessarily flexible one, designed principally to ensure that the plaintiffs have such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions. . . . Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204. It seems to me that even a cursory examination of the complaints in these two cases and the opinions below discloses that these parents have very real grievances against the respective school authorities which cannot be resolved short of constitutional adjudication.

Mann's continued use of the Bible for what he regarded as nonsectarian exercises represented his response to these cross-pressures.

For discussion of the constitutional and statutory provisions involved in the state cases which sustained devotional exercises in the public schools, see Boles, The Bible, Religion, and the Public Schools (1961), c. III; Harrison, The Bible, the Constitution and Public Education, 29 Tenn.L.Rev. 363, 381-385 (1962); Fellman, Separation of Church and State in the United States: A Summary View, 1950 Wis.L.Rev. 427, 45452; Note, Bible Reading in Public Schools, 9 Vand.L.Rev. 849, 854-859 (1956); Note, Nineteenth Century Judicial Thought Concerning Church-State Relations, 40 Minn.L.Rev. 672, 675-678 (1956). State courts appear to have been increasingly influenced in sustaining devotional practices by the availability of an excuse or exemption for dissenting students. See Cushman, The Holy Bible and the Public Schools, 40 Cornell L.Q. 475, 477 (1955); 13 Vand.L.Rev. 552 (1960). 54. See Rosenfield, Separation of Church and State in the Public Schools, 22 U. of Pitt.L.Rev. 561, 571-572 (1961); Harrison, The Bible the Constitution and Public Education, 29 Tenn.L.Rev. 363 399-400 (1962); 30 Ford.L.Rev. 801, 803 (1962); 45 Va.L.Rev. 1381 (1959). The essentially religious character of the materials used in these exercises is, in fact, strongly suggested by the presence of excusal or exemption provisions, and by the practice of rotating or alternating the use of different prayers and versions of the Holy Bible 55. In the Billard case, the teacher whose use of the Lord's Prayer and the Twenty-third Psalm was before the court testified that the exercise served disciplinary, rather than spiritual, purposes: It is necessary to have some general exercise after the children come in from the playground to prepare them for their work. You need some general exercise to quiet them down. When asked again if the purpose were not at least partially religious, the teacher replied, ""[i]t was religious to the children that are religious, and to the others it was not."" 69 Kan. at 57-58, 76 P. at 423. 56. See, e.g., Henry, The Place of Religion in Public Schools (1950); Martin, Our Public Schools -- Christian or Secular (1952); Educational Policies Comm'n of the National Educational Assn., Moral and Spiritual Values in the Public Schools (1951), c. IV; Harner, Religion's Place in General Education (1949). Educators are by no means unanimous, however, on this question. See Boles, The Bible, Religion, and the Public Schools (1961), 223-224. Compare George Washington's advice in his Farewell Address: And let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that National morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle. 35 Writings of George Washington (Fitzpatrick ed.1940), 229. 57. Thomas Jefferson's insistence that, where the judgments of young children are not sufficiently matured for religious inquiries, their memories may here be stored with the most useful facts from Grecian, Roman, European and American history, 2 Writings of Thomas Jefferson (Memorial ed.1903), 204, is relevant here. Recent proposals have explored the possibility of commencing the school day ""with a quiet moment that would still the tumult of the playground and start a day of study,"" Editorial, Washington Post, June 28, 1962, § A, p. 22, col. 2. See also New York Times, Aug. 30, 1962, § 1, p. 18, col. 2. For a consideration of these and other alternative proposals see Choper, Religion in the Public Schools: A Proposed Constitutional Standard, 47 Minn.L.Rev. 329, 370-371 (1963). See also 2 Stokes, Church and State in the United States (1950), 571. 58. The history, as it bears particularly upon the role of sectarian differences concerning Biblical texts and interpretation, has been summarized in Tudor v. Board of Education, 14 N.J. 31, 36-44, 100 A.2d 857, 859-864. See also State ex rel. Weiss v. District Board, 76 Wis. 177, 190-193, 44 N.W. 967, 972-975. One state court adverted to these differences a half century ago: The Bible, in its entirety, is a sectarian book as to the Jew and every believer in any religion other than the Christian religion, and, as to those who are heretical or who hold beliefs that are not regarded as orthodox . . . , its use in the schools necessarily results in sectarian instruction. There are many sects of Christians, and their differences grow out of their differing constructions of various parts of the Scriptures -- the different conclusions drawn as to the effect of the same words. The portions of Scripture which form the basis of these sectarian differences cannot be thoughtfully and intelligently read without impressing the reader, favorably or otherwise, with reference to the doctrines supposed to be derived from them. People ex rel. Ring v. Board of Education, 245 Ill. 334, 347-348, 92 N.E. 251, 255.

Few religious persons today would share the universality of the Biblical canons of John Quincy Adams: You ask me what Bible I take as the standard of my faith -- the Hebrew, the Samaritan, the old English translation, or what? I answer, the Bible containing the sermon upon the mount -- any Bible that I can read and understand. . . . I take any one of them for my standard of faith. If Socinus or Priestley had made a fair translation of the Bible, I would have taken that, but without their comments. John Quincy Adams to John Adams, Jan. 3, 1817, in Koch and Peden, Selected Writings of John and John Quincy Adams (1946), 292. 60. Rabbi Solomon Grayzel testified before the District Court, In Judaism, the Bible is not read, it is studied. There is no special virtue attached to a mere reading of the Bible; there is a great deal of virtue attached to a study of the Bible. See Boles, The Bible, Religion, and the Public Schools (1961), 208-218; Choper, Religion in the Public Schools: A Proposed Constitutional Standard, 47 Minn.L.Rev. 39, 372-375 (1963). One religious periodical has suggested the danger that an observance of this sort is likely to deteriorate quickly into an empty formality with little, if any, spiritual significance. Prescribed forms of this sort, as many colleges have concluded after years of compulsory chapel attendance, can actually work against the inculcation of vital religion. Prayers in Public Schools Opposed, 69 Christian Century, Jan. 9, 1952, p. 35. 61. See Cahn, On Government and Prayer, 37 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 981, 993-994 (1962). A leading Protestant journal recently noted: Agitation for removal of religious practices in public schools is not prompted or supported entirely by Jews, humanists, and atheists. At both local and national levels, many Christian leaders, concerned both for civil rights of minorities and for adequate religious education, are opposed to religious exercises in public schools. . . . Many persons, both Jews and Christians, believe that prayer and Bible reading are too sacred to be permitted in public schools, in spite of their possible moral value. Smith, The Religious Crisis In Our Schools, 128 The Episcopalian, May 1963, pp. 12-13. See, e.g., for other recent statements on this question, Editorial, Amending the Amendment, 108 America, May 25, 1963, p. 736; Sissel, A Christian View: Behind the Fight Against School Prayer, 27 Look, June 18, 1963, p.25. It should be unnecessary to demonstrate that the Lord's Prayer, more clearly than the Regents' Prayer involved in Engel v. Vitale, is an essentially Christian supplication. See, e.g., Scott, The Lord's Prayer: Its Character, Purpose, and Interpretation (1951), 55; Buttrick, So We Believe, So We Pray (1951), 142; Levy, Lord's Prayer, in 7 Universal Jewish Encyclopedia (1948), 19-193. 62.

The application of statutes and regulations which forbid comment on scriptural passages is further complicated by the view of certain religious groups that reading without comment is either meaningless or actually offensive. Compare Rabbi Grayzel's testimony before the District Court that ""the Bible is misunderstood when it is taken without explanation."" A recent survey of the attitudes of certain teachers disclosed concern that ""refusal to answer pupil questions regarding any curricular activity is not educationally sound,"" and that reading without comment might create in the minds of the pupils the impression that something was ""hidden or wrong."" Boles, The Bible, Religion, and the Public Schools (1961), 235-236. Compare the comment of a foreign observer: In no other field of learning would we expect a child to draw the full meaning from what he reads without accompanying explanatory comment. But comment by the teacher will inevitably reveal his own personal preferences, and the exhibition of preferences is what we are seeking to eliminate. MacKinnon, Freedom? -- or Toleration? The Problem of Church and State in the United States, Pub.Law 374, 383. 64. See Abbott, A Common Bible Reader for Public Schools, 56 Religious Education 20 (1961); Note, 22 Albany L.Rev. 156-157 (1958); 2 Stokes, Church and State in the United States (1950), 501-506 (describing the ""common denominator"" or ""three faiths"" plan and certain programs of instruction designed to implement the ""common core"" approach). The attempts to evolve a universal, nondenominational prayer are by no means novel. See, e.g., Madison's letter to Edward Everett, March 19, 1823, commenting upon a project of a prayer . . . intended to comprehend & conciliate College Students of every [Christian] denomination, by a Form composed wholly of texts & phrases of scripture. 9 Writings of James Madison (Hunt ed.1910), 126. For a fuller description of this and other attempts to fashion a ""common core"" or nonsectarian exercise, see Engel v. Vitale, 18 Misc.2d 659, 660-662, 191 N.Y.S.2d 453, 459-460. 65. See the policy statement recently drafted by the National Council of the Churches of Christ: . . . neither true religion nor good education is dependent upon the devotional use of the Bible in the public school program. . . . Apart from the constitutional questions involved, attempts to establish a ""common core"" of religious beliefs to be taught in public schools for the purpose of indoctrination are unrealistic and unwise. Major faith groups have not agreed on a formulation of religious beliefs common to all. Even if they had done so, such a body of religious doctrine would tend to become a substitute for the more demanding commitments of historic faiths. Washington Post, May 25, 1963, § A, p. 1, col. 4.

See the testimony of Edward L. Schempp, the father of the children in the Abington schools and plaintiff appellee in No. 142, concerning his reasons for not asking that his children be excused from the morning exercises after excusal was made available through amendment of the statute: We originally objected to our children being exposed to the reading of the King James version of the Bible . . . , and under those conditions, we would have theoretically liked to have had the children excused. But we felt that the penalty of having our children labelled as ""odd balls"" before their teachers and classmates every day in the year was even less satisfactory than the other problem. . . . The children, the classmates of Roger and Donna are very liable to label and lump all particular religious difference or religious objections as atheism, particularly, today the word ""atheism"" is so often tied to atheistic communism, and atheism has very bad connotations in the minds of children and many adults today. A recent opinion of the Attorney General of California gave as one reason for finding devotional exercises unconstitutional the likelihood that [c]hildren forced by conscience to leave the room during such exercises would be placed in a position inferior to that of students adhering to the State-endorsed religion. 25 Cal.Op.Atty.Gen. 316, 319 (1955). Other views on this question, and possible effects of the excusal procedure, are summarized in Rosenfield, Separation of Church and State in the Public Schools, 22 U. of Pitt.L.Rev. 561, 581-585 (1961); Note, Separation of Church and State: Religious Exercises in the Schools, 31 U. of Cinc.L.Rev. 408, 416 (1962); Note, 62 W.Va.L.Rev. 353, 358 (1960). 69. Extensive testimony by behavioral scientists concerning the effect of similar practices upon children's attitudes and behaviors is discussed in Tudor v. Board of Education, 14 N.J. 31, 50-52, 100 A.2d 857, 867-868. See also Choper, Religion in the Public Schools: A Proposed Constitutional Standard, 47 Minn.L.Rev. 329, 344 (1963). There appear to be no reported experiments which bear directly upon the question under consideration. There have, however, been numerous experiments which indicate the susceptibility of school children to peer group pressures, especially where important group norms and values are involved. See, e.g., Berenda, The Influence of the Group on the Judgments of Children (1950), 26-33; Argyle, Social Pressure in Public and Private Situations, 54 J. Abnormal & Social Psych. 172 (1957); cf. Rhine, The Effect of Peer Group Influence Upon Concept-Attitude Development and Change, 51 J. Social Psych. 173 (1960); French, Morrison and Levinger, Coercive Power and Forces Affecting Conformity, 61 J. Abnormal and Social Psych. 93 (1960). For a recent and important experimental study of the susceptibility of students to various factors in the school environment, see Zander, Curtis and Rosenfeld, The Influence of Teachers and Peers on Aspirations of Youth (U.S. Office of Education Cooperative Research Project No. 451, 1961), 24-25, 78-79. It is also apparent that the susceptibility of school children to prestige suggestion and social influence within the school environment varies inversely with the age, grade level, and consequent degree of sophistication of the child, see Pated and Gordon, Some Personal and Situational Determinants of Yielding to Influence, 61 J. Abnormal and Social Psych. 411, 417 (1960). Experimental findings also shed some light upon the probable effectiveness of a provision for excusal when, as is usually the case, the percentage of the class wishing not to participate in the exercises is very small. It has been demonstrated, for example, that the inclination even of adults to depart or dissent overtly from strong group norms varies proportionately with the size of the dissenting group -- that is, inversely with the apparent or perceived strength of the norm itself -- and is markedly slighter in the case of the sole or isolated dissenter. See, e.g., Asch, Studies of Independence and Conformity: I. A Minority of One Against a Unanimous Majority (Psych. Monographs No. 416, 1956), 69-70; Asch, Effects of Group Pressure upon the Modification and Distortion of Judgments, in Cartwright and Zander, Group Dynamics (2d ed.1960), 189-199; Luchins and Luchins, On Conformity With True and False Communications, 42 J. Social Psych. 283 (1955). Recent important findings on these questions are summarized in Hare, Handbook of Small Group Research (1962), c. II. 70. See, on the general problem of conflict and accommodation between the two clauses, Katz, Freedom of Religion and State Neutrality, 20 U. of Chi.L.Rev. 426, 429 (1953); Griswold, Absolute Is In the Dark, 8 Utah L.Rev. 167, 176-179 (1963); Kauper, Church, State, and Freedom: A Review, 52 Mich.L.Rev. 829, 833 (1954). One author has suggested that the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses must be read as stating a single precept: that government cannot utilize religion as a standard for action or inaction because these clauses, read together as they should be, prohibit classification in terms of religion either to confer a benefit or to impose a burden. Kurland, Religion and the Law (1962), 112. Compare the formula of accommodation embodied in the Australian Constitution, § 116: The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth. Essays on the Australian Constitution (Else-Mitchell ed.1961), 15. 71. There has been much difference of opinion throughout American history concerning the advisability of furnishing chaplains at government expense. Compare, e.g., Washington's order regarding chaplains for the Continental Army, July 9, 1776, in 5 Writings of George Washington (Fitzpatrick ed.1932), 244, with Madison's views on a very similar question, letter to Eduard Livingston, July 10, 1822, 9 Writings of James Madison (Hunt ed.1910), 100-103. Compare also this statement by the Armed Forces Chaplains Board concerning the chaplain's obligation: To us has been entrusted the spiritual and moral guidance of the young men and women in the Armed Services of this country. A chaplain has many duties -- yet first and foremost is that of presenting God to men and women wearing the military uniform. What happens to them while they are in military service has a profound effect on what happens in the community as they resume civilian life. We, as chaplains, must take full cognizance of that fact and dedicate our work to making them finer, spiritually strengthened citizens. Builders of Faith (U.S. Department of Defense 1955), ii. It is interesting to compare in this regard an express provision, Article 140, of the Weimar Constitution: ""Necessary free time shall be accorded to the members of the armed forces for the fulfillment of their religious duties."" McBain and Rogers, The New Constitutions of Europe (1922), 203. 72. For a discussion of some recent and difficult problems in connection with chaplains and religious exercises in prisons, see, e.g., Pierce v. La Vallee, 293 F.2d 233; In re Ferguson, 55 Cal.2d 663, 361 P.2d 417; McBride v. McCorkle, 44 N.J.Super. 468, 130 A.2d 881; Brown v.

STEWART, J., dissenting (Footnotes)1. It is instructive, in this connection, to examine the complaints in the two cases before us. Neither complaint attacks the challenged practices as ""establishments."" What both allege as the basis for their causes of actions are, rather, violations of religious liberty. 2. 310 U.S. at 303. The Court's statement as to the Establishment Clause in Cantwell was dictum. The case was decided on free exercise grounds. 3. See also, in this connection, Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306, 314: Government may not finance religious groups nor undertake religious instruction nor blend secular and sectarian education nor use secular institutions to force one or some religion on any person. But we find no constitutional requirement which makes it necessary for government to be hostile to religion and to throw its weight against efforts to widen the effective scope of religious influence. 4. This is, beyond all question, a utilization of the tax established and tax supported public school system to aid religious groups to spread their faith. McCollum v. Board of Education, 333 U.S. 203, 210. (Emphasis added.) 5. The Pennsylvania statute was specifically amended to remove the compulsion upon teachers. Act of December 17, 1959, p. L.1928, 24 Purdon's Pa.Stat.Ann. § 15-1516. Since the Maryland case is here on a demurrer, the issue of whether or not a teacher could be dismissed for refusal to participate seems, among many others, never to have been raised. 6. See, e.g., the description of a plan permitting religious instruction off school property contained in McCollum v. Board of Education, 333 U.S. 203, 224 (separate opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter). 7. Cf. The task of separating the secular from the religious in education is one of magnitude, intricacy and delicacy. To lay down a sweeping constitutional doctrine as demanded by complainant and apparently approved by the Court, applicable alike to all school boards of the nation, . . . is to decree a uniform, rigid and, if we are consistent, an unchanging standard for countless school boards representing and serving highly localized groups which not only differ from each other but which themselves from time to time change attitudes. It seems to me that to do so is to allow zeal for our own ideas of what is good in public instruction to induce us to accept the role of a super board of education for every school district in the nation. McCollum v. Board of Education, 333 U.S. 203, 237 (concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Jackson). 8. For example, if the record in the Schempp case contained proof (rather than mere prophecy) that the timing of morning announcements by the school was such as to handicap children who did not want to listen to the Bible reading, or that the excusal provision was so administered as to carry any overtones of social inferiority, then impermissible coercion would clearly exist. TOP Concurrence GOLDBERG, J., Concurring Opinion MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG, with whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN joins, concurring. As is apparent from the opinions filed today, delineation of the constitutionally permissible relationship between religion and government is a most difficult and sensitive task, calling for the careful exercise of both judicial and public judgment and restraint. The considerations which lead the Court today to interdict the clearly religious practices presented in these cases are to me wholly compelling; I have no doubt as to the propriety of the decision, and therefore join the opinion and judgment of the Court. The singular sensitivity and concern which surround both the legal and practical judgments involved impel me, however, to add a few words in further explication, while at the same time avoiding repetition of the carefully and ably framed examination of history and authority by my Brethren. The First Amendment's guarantees, as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, foreclose not only laws ""respecting an establishment of religion"", but also those ""prohibiting the free exercise thereof."" These two proscriptions are to be read together, and in light of the single end which they are designed to serve. The basic purpose of the religion clause of the First Amendment is to promote and assure the fullest possible scope of religious liberty and tolerance for all, and to nurture the conditions which secure the best hope of attainment of that end. The fullest realization of true religious liberty requires that government neither engage in nor compel religious practices, that it effect no favoritism among sects or between religion and nonreligion, and that it work deterrence of no religious belief. But devotion even to these simply stated objectives presents no easy course, for the unavoidable accommodations necessary to achieve the [p306] maximum enjoyment of each and all of them are often difficult of discernment. There is for me no simple and clear measure which by precise application can readily and invariably demark the permissible from the impermissible. It is said, and I agree, that the attitude of government toward religion must be one of neutrality. But untutored devotion to the concept of neutrality can lead to invocation or approval of results which partake not simply of that noninterference and noninvolvement with the religious which the Constitution commands, but of a brooding and pervasive devotion to the secular and a passive, or even active, hostility to the religious. Such results are not only not compelled by the Constitution, but, it seems to me, are prohibited by it. Neither government nor this Court can or should ignore the significance of the fact that a vast portion of our people believe in and worship God, and that many of our legal, political and personal values derive historically from religious teachings. Government must inevitably take cognizance of the existence of religion and, indeed, under certain circumstances, the First Amendment may require that it do so. And it seems clear to me from the opinions in the present and past cases that the Court would recognize the propriety of providing military chaplains and of the teaching about religion, as distinguished from the teaching of religion, in the public schools. The examples could readily be multiplied, for both the required and the permissible accommodations between state and church frame the relation as one free of hostility or favor and productive of religious and political harmony, but without undue involvement of one in the concerns or practices of the other. To be sure, the judgment in each case is a delicate one, but it must be made if we are to do loyal service as judges to the ultimate First Amendment objective of religious liberty. [p307] The practices here involved do not fall within any sensible or acceptable concept of compelled or permitted accommodation, and involve the state so significantly and directly in the realm of the sectarian as to give rise to those very divisive influences and inhibitions of freedom which both religion clauses of the First Amendment preclude. The state has ordained and has utilized its facilities to engage in unmistakably religious exercises -- the devotional reading and recitation of the Holy Bible -- in a manner having substantial and significant import and impact. That it has selected, rather than written, a particular devotional liturgy seems to me without constitutional import. The pervasive religiosity and direct governmental involvement inhering in the prescription of prayer and Bible reading in the public schools, during and as part of the curricular day, involving young impressionable children whose school attendance is statutorily compelled, and utilizing the prestige, power, and influence of school administration, staff, and authority, cannot realistically be termed simply accommodation, and must fall within the interdiction of the First Amendment. I find nothing in the opinion of the Court which says more than this. And, of course, today's decision does not mean that all incidents of government which import of the religious are therefore, and without more, banned by the strictures of the Establishment Clause. As the Court declared only last Term in Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 435, n. 21: There is, of course, nothing in the decision reached here that is inconsistent with the fact that school children and others are officially encouraged to express love for our country by reciting historical documents such as the Declaration of Independence which contain references to the Deity or by singing officially espoused anthems which include the composer's professions of faith in a Supreme Being, or [p308] with the fact that there are many manifestations in our public life of belief in God. Such patriotic or ceremonial occasions bear no true resemblance to the unquestioned religious exercise that the State . . . has sponsored in this instance. The First Amendment does not prohibit practices which, by any realistic measure, create none of the dangers which it is designed to prevent and which do not so directly or substantially involve the state in religious exercises or in the favoring of religion as to have meaningful and practical impact. It is, of course, true that great consequences can grow from small beginnings, but the measure of constitutional adjudication is the ability and willingness to distinguish between real threat and mere shadow. MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring. I join the opinion of the Court and add a few words in explanation. While the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment is written in terms of what the State may not require of the individual, the Establishment Clause, serving the same goal of individual religious freedom, is written in different terms. Establishment of a religion can be achieved in several ways. The church and state can be one; the church may control the state, or the state may control the church; or the relationship may take one of several possible forms of a working arrangement between the two bodies. [n1] Under all of these arrangements, the church typically has a place in the state's budget, and church law usually governs such matters as baptism, marriage, divorce and separation, at least for its members and sometimes for the entire body politic. [n2] Education, too, is usually high on the priority [p228] list of church interests. [n3] In the past, schools were often made the exclusive responsibility of the church. Today, in some state-church countries, the state runs the public schools, but compulsory religious exercises are often required of some or all students. The Church regained its place in the national budget. It insists on baptizing all children, and has made the catechism obligatory in state schools. The vice of all such arrangements under the Establishment Clause is that the state is lending its assistance to a church's efforts to gain and keep adherents. Under the First Amendment, it is strictly a matter for the individual and his church as to what church he will belong to and how much support, in the way of belief, time, activity or money, he will give to it. ""This pure Religious Liberty"" declared . . . [all forms of church-state relationships] and their fundamental idea to be oppressions of conscience and abridgments of that liberty which God and nature had conferred on every living soul. In these cases, we have no coercive religious exercise aimed at making the students conform. The prayers announced are not compulsory, though some may think they have that indirect effect because the nonconformist student may be induced to participate for fear of being called an ""oddball."" But that coercion, if it be present, [p229] has not been shown; so the vices of the present regimes are different. These regimes violate the Establishment Clause in two different ways. In each case, the State is conducting a religious exercise; and, as the Court holds, that cannot be done without violating the ""neutrality"" required of the State by the balance of power between individual, church and state that has been struck by the First Amendment. But the Establishment Clause is not limited to precluding the State itself from conducting religious exercises. It also forbids the State to employ its facilities or funds in a way that gives any church, or all churches, greater strength in our society than it would have by relying on its members alone. Thus, the present regimes must fall under that clause for the additional reason that public funds, though small in amount, are being used to promote a religious exercise. Through the mechanism of the State, all of the people are being required to finance a religious exercise that only some of the people want and that violates the sensibilities of others. The most effective way to establish any institution is to finance it, and this truth is reflected in the appeals by church groups for public funds to finance their religious schools. [n6] Financing a church either in its strictly religious activities or in its other activities is equally unconstitutional, as I understand the Establishment Clause. Budgets for one activity may be technically separable from budgets for others. [n7] But the institution is an inseparable whole, a living organism, which is strengthened in proselytizing when it is strengthened in any department by contributions from other than its own members. Such contributions may not be made by the State even in a minor degree without violating the Establishment Clause. It is not the amount of public funds expended; as this case illustrates, it is the use to which public funds are put that is controlling. For the First Amendment does not say that some forms of establishment are allowed; it says that ""no law respecting an establishment of religion"" shall be made. What may not be done directly may not be done indirectly, lest the Establishment Clause become a mockery. 1.

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, concurring. Almost a century and a half ago, John Marshall, in M'Culloch v. Maryland, enjoined: "". . . we must never forget, that it is a constitution we are expounding."" 4 Wheat. 316, 407. The Court's historic duty to expound the meaning of the Constitution has encountered few issues more intricate or more demanding than that of the relationship between religion and the public schools. Since undoubtedly we are ""a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being,"" Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306, 313, deep feelings are aroused when aspects of that relationship are claimed to violate the injunction of the First Amendment that government may make ""no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. . . ."" Americans regard the public schools as a most vital civic institution for the preservation of a democratic system of government. It is therefore understandable that the constitutional prohibitions encounter their severest test when they are sought to be applied in the school classroom. Nevertheless it is this Court's inescapable duty to declare whether exercises in the public schools of the States, such as those of Pennsylvania and Maryland questioned here, are involvements of religion in public institutions of a kind which offends the First and Fourteenth Amendments. M'Culloch v. he anticipated the necessity which would be thought by the Framers to require adoption of a First Amendment, but not the difficulty that would be experienced in defining those ""just bounds."" The fact is that the line which separates the secular from the sectarian in American life is elusive. The difficulty of defining the boundary with precision inheres in a paradox central to our scheme of liberty. While our institutions reflect a firm conviction that we are a religious people, those institutions, by solemn constitutional injunction, may not officially involve religion in such a way as to prefer, discriminate against, or oppress, a particular sect or religion. Equally, the Constitution enjoins those involvements of religious with secular institutions which (a) serve the essentially religious activities of religious institutions; (b) employ the organs of government for essentially religious purposes; or (c) use essentially religious means to serve governmental ends where secular means would suffice. The constitutional mandate expresses a deliberate and considered judgment that such matters are to be left to the conscience of the citizen, and declares as a basic postulate of the relation between the citizen and his government that ""the rights of conscience are, in their nature, of peculiar delicacy, and will little bear the gentlest touch of governmental hand. . . ."" I join fully in the opinion and the judgment of the Court. I see no escape from the conclusion that the exercises [p232] called in question in these two cases violate the constitutional mandate. The reasons we gave only last Term in Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, for finding in the New York Regents' prayer an impermissible establishment of religion compel the same judgment of the practices at bar. The involvement of the secular with the religious is no less intimate here, and it is constitutionally irrelevant that the State has not composed the material for the inspirational exercises presently involved. It should be unnecessary to observe that our holding does not declare that the First Amendment manifests hostility to the practice or teaching of religion, but only applies prohibitions incorporated in the Bill of Rights in recognition of historic needs shared by Church and State alike. While it is my view that not every involvement of religion in public life is unconstitutional, I consider the exercises at bar a form of involvement which clearly violates the Establishment Clause. The importance of the issue and the deep conviction with which views on both sides are held seem to me to justify detailing at some length my reasons for joining the Court's judgment and opinion. The First Amendment forbids both the abridgment of the free exercise of religion and the enactment of laws ""respecting an establishment of religion."" The two clauses, although distinct in their objectives and their applicability, emerged together from a common panorama of history. The inclusion of both restraints upon the power of Congress to legislate concerning religious matters shows unmistakably that the Framers of the First Amendment were not content to rest the protection of religious liberty exclusively upon either clause. the Framers of the First Amendment were sensitive to the then recent history of those persecutions and impositions of civil disability with which sectarian majorities in virtually all of the Colonies had visited deviation in the matter of conscience. This protection of unpopular creeds, however, was not to be the full extent of the Amendment's guarantee of freedom from governmental intrusion in matters of faith. The battle in Virginia, hardly four years won, where James Madison had led the forces of disestablishment in successful opposition to Patrick Henry's proposed Assessment Bill levying a general tax for the support of Christian teachers, was a vital and compelling memory in 1789. It is true that the Framers' immediate concern was to prevent the setting up of an official federal church of the kind which England and some of the Colonies had long supported. But nothing in the text of the Establishment Clause supports the view that the prevention of the setting up of an official church was meant to be the full extent of the prohibitions against official involvements in religion. If the framers of the Amendment meant to prohibit Congress merely from the establishment of a ""church,"" one may properly wonder why they didn't so state. That the words church and religion were regarded as synonymous seems highly improbable, particularly in view of the fact that the contemporary state constitutional provisions dealing with the subject of establishment used definite phrases such as ""religious sect,"" ""sect,"" or ""denomination."" . . . With such specific wording in contemporary state constitutions, why was not a similar wording adopted for the First Amendment if its framers intended to prohibit nothing more than what the States were prohibiting? Lardner, How Far Does the Constitution Separate Church and State? 45 Am.Pol.Sci.Rev. 110, 112 (1951). Plainly, the Establishment Clause, in the contemplation of the Framers, ""did not limit the constitutional proscription to any particular, dated form of state-supported theological venture."" What Virginia had long practiced, and what Madison, Jefferson and others fought to end, was the extension of civil government's support to religion in a manner which made the two in some degree interdependent, and thus threatened the freedom of each. The purpose of the Establishment Clause was to assure that the national legislature would not exert its power in the service of any purely religious end; that it would not, as Virginia and virtually all of the Colonies had done, make of religion, as religion, an object of legislation. . . . The Establishment Clause withdrew from the sphere of legitimate legislative concern and competence a specific, but comprehensive, area of human conduct: man's belief or disbelief in the verity of some transcendental idea and man's expression in action of that belief or disbelief. McGowan v. Maryland, supra, at 465-466 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.). McGowan v. In sum, the history which our prior decisions have summoned to aid interpretation of the Establishment Clause permits little doubt that its prohibition was designed comprehensively to prevent those official involvements of religion which would tend to foster or discourage religious worship or belief. But an awareness of history and an appreciation of the aims of the Founding Fathers do not always resolve concrete problems. The specific question before us has, for example, aroused vigorous dispute whether the architects of the First Amendment -- James Madison and Thomas Jefferson particularly -- understood the prohibition against any ""law respecting an establishment of [p235] religion"" to reach devotional exercises in the public schools. putting the Bible and Testament into the hands of the children at an age when their judgments are not sufficiently matured for religious inquiries. . . . But [p236] I doubt that their view, even if perfectly clear one way or the other, would supply a dispositive answer to the question presented by these cases. A more fruitful inquiry, it seems to me, is whether the practices here challenged threaten those consequences which the Framers deeply feared; whether, in short, they tend to promote that type of interdependence between religion and state which the First Amendment was designed to prevent. the majestic generalities of the Bill of Rights, conceived as part of the pattern of liberal government in the eighteenth century, into concrete restraints on officials [p237] dealing with the problems of the twentieth century. . . . West Virginia State Board of Education v. A too literal quest for the advice of the Founding Fathers upon the issues of these cases seems to me futile and misdirected for several reasons: first, on our precise problem, the historical record is, at best, ambiguous, and statements can readily be found to support either side of the proposition. The ambiguity of history is understandable if we recall the nature of the problems uppermost in the thinking of the statesmen who fashioned the religious guarantees; they were concerned with far more flagrant intrusions of government into the realm of religion than any that our century has witnessed. [n6] While it is clear to me that the Framers meant the Establishment Clause to prohibit more than the creation of an established federal church such as existed in England, I have no doubt that, in their preoccupation with the imminent question of established churches, they gave no distinct [p238] consideration to the particular question whether the clause also forbade devotional exercises in public institutions. Second, the structure of American education has greatly changed since the First Amendment was adopted. In the context of our modern emphasis upon public education available to all citizens, any views of the eighteenth century as to whether the exercises at bar are an ""establishment"" offer little aid to decision. Education, as the Framers knew it, was in the main confined to private schools more often than not under strictly sectarian supervision. Only gradually did control of education pass largely to public officials. [n7] It would, therefore, [p239] hardly be significant if the fact was that the nearly universal devotional exercises in the schools of the young Republic did not provoke criticism; even today, religious ceremonies in church supported private schools are constitutionally unobjectionable. Third, our religious composition makes us a vastly more diverse people than were our forefathers. They knew differences chiefly among Protestant sects. Today, the Nation is far more heterogeneous religiously, including as it does substantial minorities not only of Catholics and Jews but as well of those who worship according to no version of the Bible and those who worship no God at all. [n8] [p241] See Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U.S. 488, 495. In the face of such profound changes, practices which may have been objectionable to no one in the time of Jefferson and Madison may today be highly offensive to many persons, the deeply devout and the nonbelievers alike. See Torcaso v. Whatever Jefferson or Madison would have thought of Bible reading or the recital of the Lord's Prayer in what few public schools existed in their day, our use of the history of their time must limit itself to broad purposes, not specific practices. By such a standard, I am persuaded, as is the Court, that the devotional exercises carried on in the Baltimore and Abington schools offend the First Amendment because they sufficiently threaten in our day those substantive evils the fear of which called forth the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. It is ""a constitution we are expounding,"" and our interpretation of the First Amendment must necessarily be responsive to the much more highly charged nature of religious questions in contemporary society. Fourth, the American experiment in free public education available to all children has been guided in large measure by the dramatic evolution of the religious diversity among the population which our public schools serve. The interaction of these two important forces in our national life has placed in bold relief certain positive values in the consistent application to public institutions generally, and public schools particularly, of the constitutional decree against official involvements of religion which might produce the evils the Framers meant the Establishment Clause to forestall. The public schools are supported entirely, in most communities, by public funds -- funds exacted not only from parents, nor alone from those who hold particular religious views, nor indeed from those who subscribe to any creed at all. It is implicit in the history and character of American public education that the public schools serve a uniquely [p242] public function: the training of American citizens in an atmosphere free of parochial, divisive, or separatist influences of any sort -- an atmosphere in which children may assimilate a heritage common to all American groups and religions. See Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Education, 333 U.S. 203. This is a heritage neither theistic nor atheistic, but simply civic and patriotic. See Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 400-403. See Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. See Meyer v. Attendance at the public schools has never been compulsory; parents remain morally and constitutionally free to choose the academic environment in which they wish their children to be educated. The relationship of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the public school system is preeminently that of reserving such a choice to the individual parent, rather than vesting it in the majority of voters of each State or school district. The choice which is thus preserved is between a public secular education, with its uniquely democratic values, and some form of private or sectarian education, which offers values of its own. In my judgment, the First Amendment forbids the State to inhibit that freedom of choice by diminishing the attractiveness of either alternative -- either by restricting the liberty of the private schools to inculcate whatever values they wish, or by jeopardizing the freedom of the public schools from private or sectarian pressures. The choice between these very different forms of education is one very much like the choice of whether or not to worship -- which our Constitution leaves to the individual parent. It is no proper function of the state or local government to influence or restrict that election. The lesson of history -- drawn more from the experiences of other countries than from our own -- is that a system of free public education forfeits its unique contribution to the growth of democratic citizenship when that choice ceases to be freely available to each parent. The exposition by this Court of the religious guarantees of the First Amendment has consistently reflected and reaffirmed the concerns which impelled the Framers to write those guarantees into the Constitution. It would be neither possible nor appropriate to review here the entire course of our decisions on religious questions. There emerge from those decisions, however, three principles of particular relevance to the issue presented by the cases at bar, and some attention to those decisions is therefore appropriate. First. One line of decisions derives from contests for control of a church property or other internal ecclesiastical disputes. This line has settled the proposition that, in order to give effect to the First Amendment's purpose of requiring on the part of all organs of government a strict neutrality toward theological questions, courts should not undertake to decide such questions. These principles were first expounded in the case of Watson v. Jones, 13 Wall. the whole subject of the doctrinal theology, the usages and customs, the written laws, and fundamental organization of every religious denomination. . . . 13 Wall. at 733. Courts above all must be neutral, for ""[t]he law knows no heresy, and is committed to the support of no dogma, the establishment of no sect."" [n9] 13 Wall. at 728. This principle has recently [p244] been reaffirmed in Kedroff v. St. Nicholas Cathedral, 344 U.S. 94, and Kreshik v. St. Nicholas Cathedral, 363 U.S. 190. Kedroff v. St. Kreshik v. St. The mandate of judicial neutrality in theological controversies met its severest test in United States v. Ballard, 322 U.S. 78. That decision put in sharp relief certain principles which bear directly upon the questions presented in these cases. Ballard was indicted for fraudulent use of the mails in the dissemination of religious literature. He requested that the trial court submit to the jury the question of the truthfulness of the religious views he championed. The requested charge was refused, and we upheld that refusal, reasoning that the First Amendment foreclosed any judicial inquiry into the truth or falsity of the defendant's religious beliefs. United States v. Man's relation to his God was made no concern of the state. He was granted the right to worship as he pleased and to answer to no man for the verity of his religious views. Men may believe what they cannot [p245] prove. They may not be put to the proof of their religious doctrines or beliefs. . . . Many take their gospel from the New Testament. But it would hardly be supposed that they could be tried before a jury charged with the duty of determining whether those teachings contained false representations. The dilemma presented by the case was severe. While the alleged truthfulness of nonreligious publications could ordinarily have been submitted to the jury, Ballard was deprived of that defense only because the First Amendment forbids governmental inquiry into the verity of religious beliefs. In dissent, Mr. Justice Jackson expressed the concern that, under this construction of the First Amendment, ""[p]rosecutions of this character easily could degenerate into religious persecution."" 322 U.S. at 95. The case shows how elusive is the line which enforces the Amendment's injunction of strict neutrality, while manifesting no official hostility toward religion -- a line which must be considered in the cases now before us. [n10] Some might view the result of the Ballard case as a manifestation of hostility -- in that the conviction stood because the defense could not be raised. To others, it [p246] might represent merely strict adherence to the principle of neutrality already expounded in the cases involving doctrinal disputes. Inevitably, insistence upon neutrality, vital as it surely is for untrammeled religious liberty, may appear to border upon religious hostility. But, in the long view, the independence of both church and state in their respective spheres will be better served by close adherence to the neutrality principle. If the choice is often difficult, the difficulty is endemic to issues implicating the religious guarantees of the First Amendment. Freedom of religion will be seriously jeopardized if we admit exceptions for no better reason than the difficulty of delineating hostility from neutrality in the closest cases. Second. It is only recently that our decisions have dealt with the question whether issues arising under the Establishment Clause may be isolated from problems implicating the Free Exercise Clause. Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U.S. 1, is, in my view, the first of our decisions which treats a problem of asserted unconstitutional involvement as raising questions purely under the Establishment Clause. A scrutiny of several earlier decisions said by some to have etched the contours of the clause shows that such cases neither raised nor decided any constitutional issues under the First Amendment. Bradfield v. Roberts, 175 U.S. 291, for example, involved challenges to a federal grant to a hospital administered by a Roman Catholic order. The Court rejected the claim for lack of evidence that any sectarian influence changed its character as a secular institution chartered as such by the Congress. Everson v. Bradfield v. Quick Bear v. Leupp, 210 U.S. 50, is also illustrative. The immediate question there was one of statutory construction, although the issue had originally involved the [p247] constitutionality of the use of federal funds to support sectarian education on Indian reservations. Congress had already prohibited federal grants for that purpose, thereby removing the broader issue, leaving only the question whether the statute authorized the appropriation for religious teaching of Treaty funds held by the Government in trust for the Indians. Since these were the Indians' own funds, the Court held only that the Indians might direct their use for such educational purposes as they chose, and that the administration by the Treasury of the disbursement of the funds did not inject into the case any issue of the propriety of the use of federal moneys. it seems inconceivable that Congress should have intended to prohibit them from receiving religious education at their own cost if they so desired it. . . . 210 U.S. at 82. This case forecast, however, an increasingly troublesome First Amendment paradox: that the logical interrelationship between the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses may produce situations where an injunction against an apparent establishment must be withheld in order to avoid infringement of rights of free exercise. That paradox was not squarely presented in Quick Bear, but the care taken by the Court [p248] to avoid a constitutional confrontation discloses an awareness of possible conflicts between the two clauses. I shall come back to this problem later, infra, pp. 296-299. A third case in this group is Cochran v. Louisiana State Board, 281 U.S. 370, which involved a challenge to a state statute providing public funds to support a loan of free textbooks to pupils of both public and private schools. The constitutional issues in this Court extended no further than the claim that this program amounted to a taking of private property for nonpublic use. The Court rejected the claim on the ground that no private use of property was involved; "". . . we cannot doubt that the taxing power of the State is exerted for a public purpose."" 281 U.S. at 375. The case therefore raised no issue under the First Amendment. Cochran v. In Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, a Catholic parochial school and a private but nonsectarian military academy challenged a state law requiring all children between certain ages to attend the public schools. This Court held the law invalid as an arbitrary and unreasonable interference both with the rights of the schools and with the liberty of the parents of the children who attended them. The due process guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment ""excludes any general power of the State to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only."" 268 U.S. at 535. While one of the plaintiffs was indeed a parochial school, the case obviously decided no First Amendment question, but recognized only the constitutional right to establish and patronize private schools -- including parochial schools -- which meet the state's reasonable minimum curricular requirements. Pierce v. Third. It is true, as the Court says, that the ""two clauses [Establishment and Free Exercise] may overlap."" Because of the overlap, however, our decisions under the Free Exercise Clause bear considerable relevance to the problem now before us, and should be briefly reviewed. The early free exercise cases generally involved the objections of religious minorities to the application to them of general nonreligious legislation governing conduct. Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145, involved the claim that a belief in the sanctity of plural marriage precluded the conviction of members of a particular sect under nondiscriminatory legislation against such marriage. Reynolds v. Laws are made for the government of actions, and while they cannot interfere with mere religious beliefs and opinions, they may with practices. . . . Can a man excuse his practices to the contrary because of his religious belief? To permit this would be to make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land, and in effect to permit every citizen to become a law unto himself. Government could exist only in name under such circumstances. Davis v. Beason, 133 U.S. 333, similarly involved the claim that the First Amendment insulated from civil punishment certain practices inspired or motivated by religious beliefs. It was never intended or supposed that the amendment could be invoked as a protection against legislation for the punishment of acts inimical to the peace, good order and morals of society. See also Mormon Church v. Jacobson v. Prince v. Cleveland v. But we must not confuse the issue of governmental power to regulate or prohibit conduct motivated by religious beliefs with the quite different problem of governmental authority to compel behavior offensive to religious principles. In Hamilton v. Regents of the University of California, 293 U.S. 245, the question was that of the power of a State to compel students at the State University to participate in military training instruction against their religious convictions. The validity of the statute was sustained against claims based upon the First Amendment. But the decision rested on a very narrow principle: since there was neither a constitutional right nor a legal obligation to attend the State University, the obligation to participate in military training courses, [p251] reflecting a legitimate state interest, might properly be imposed upon those who chose to attend. offensive to religious principles. Hamilton v. those Amendments were construed not to free such students from the military training obligations if they chose to attend the University. Justices Brandeis, Cardozo and Stone, concurring separately, agreed that the requirement infringed no constitutionally protected liberties. They added, however, that the case presented no question under the Establishment Clause. The military instruction program was not an establishment, since it in no way involved ""instruction in the practice or tenets of a religion."" 293 U.S. at 266. Since the only question was one of free exercise, they concluded, like the majority, that the strong state interest in training a citizen militia justified the restraints imposed, at least so long as attendance at the University was voluntary. Hamilton has not been overruled, although United States v. Schwimmer, 279 U.S. 644, and United States v. Macintosh, 283 U.S. 605, upon which the Court in Hamilton relied, have since been overruled by Girouard v. United States, 328 U.S. 61. But if Hamilton retains any vitality with respect to higher education, we recognized its inapplicability to cognate questions in the public primary and secondary schools when we held, in West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette, supra, that a State had no power to expel from public schools students who refused on religious grounds to comply with a daily flag [p252] salute requirement. Of course, such a requirement was no more a law ""respecting an establishment of religion"" than the California law compelling the college students to take military training. The Barnette plaintiffs, moreover, did not ask that the whole exercise be enjoined, but only that an excuse or exemption be provided for those students whose religious beliefs forbade them to participate in the ceremony. The key to the holding that such a requirement abridged rights of free exercise lay in the fact that attendance at school was not voluntary but compulsory. United States v. United States v. Girouard v. West Virginia Board of Education v. This issue is not prejudiced by the Court's previous holding that, where a State, without compelling attendance, extends college facilities to pupils who voluntarily enroll, it may prescribe military training as part of the course without offense to the Constitution. . . . Hamilton v. Regents, 293 U.S. 245. In the present case, attendance is not optional. 319 U.S. at 631-632. The Barnette decision made another significant point. The Court held that the State must make participation in the exercise voluntary for all students, and not alone for those who found participation obnoxious on religious grounds. In short, there was simply no need to ""inquire whether nonconformist beliefs will exempt from the duty to salute,"" because the Court found no state ""power to make the salute a legal duty."" 319 U.S. at 635. The distinctions between Hamilton and Barnette are, I think, crucial to the resolution of the cases before us. The different results of those cases are attributable only in part to a difference in the strength of the particular state interests which the respective statutes were designed to serve. Far more significant is the fact that Hamilton dealt with the voluntary attendance at college of young adults, while Barnette involved the compelled attendance [p253] of young children at elementary and secondary schools. [n16] This distinction warrants a difference in constitutional results. And it is with the involuntary attendance of young school children that we are exclusively concerned in the cases now before the Court. No one questions that the Framers of the First Amendment intended to restrict exclusively the powers of the Federal Government. [n17] Whatever limitations that Amendment now imposes upon the States derive from the Fourteenth Amendment. The process of absorption of the religious guarantees of the First Amendment as protections against the States under the Fourteenth Amendment began with the Free Exercise Clause. In 1923 the Court held that the protections of the Fourteenth included at least a person's freedom ""to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience. . . ."" [n18] Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399. See also Hamilton v. Regents, supra, at 262. Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, completed in 1940 the process of absorption [p254] of the Free Exercise Clause and recognized its dual aspect: the Court affirmed freedom of belief as an absolute liberty, but recognized that conduct, while it may also be comprehended by the Free Exercise Clause, ""remains subject to regulation for the protection of society."" 310 U.S. at 303-304. This was a distinction already drawn by Reynolds v. United States, supra. From the beginning, this Court has recognized that, while government may regulate the behavioral manifestations of religious beliefs, it may not interfere at all with the beliefs themselves. See also Hamilton v. Cantwell v. Reynolds v. United States, supra. The absorption of the Establishment Clause has, however, come later, and by a route less easily charted. It has been suggested, with some support in history, that absorption of the First Amendment's ban against congressional legislation ""respecting an establishment of religion"" is conceptually impossible, because the Framers meant the Establishment Clause also to foreclose any attempt by Congress to disestablish the existing official state churches. [n19] Whether or not such was the understanding of the Framers, and whether such a purpose would have inhibited the absorption of the Establishment Clause at the threshold of the Nineteenth Century, are questions not dispositive of our present inquiry. For it is [p255] clear on the record of history that the last of the formal state establishments was dissolved more than three decades before the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, and thus the problem of protecting official state churches from federal encroachments could hardly have been any concern of those who framed the post-Civil War Amendments. [n20] Any such objective of the First Amendment, having become historical anachronism by 1868, cannot be thought to have deterred the absorption of the Establishment Clause to any greater degree than it would, for example, have deterred the absorption of the Free Exercise Clause. That no organ of the Federal Government possessed in 1791 any power to restrain the interference of the States in religious matters is indisputable. See Permoli v. New Orleans, 3 How. 589. It is equally plain, on the other hand, that the Fourteenth Amendment created a panoply of new federal rights for the protection of citizens of the various States. And among those rights was freedom from such state governmental involvement in the affairs of religion as the Establishment Clause had originally foreclosed on the part of Congress. See Permoli v. It has also been suggested that the ""liberty"" guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment logically cannot absorb the Establishment Clause because that Clause is not one of the provisions of the Bill of Rights which in terms protects a ""freedom"" of the individual. See Corwin, A Constitution of Powers in a Secular State (1951), 113-116. The fallacy in this contention, I think, is that it underestimates the role of the Establishment Clause as a co-guarantor, with the Free Exercise Clause, of religious liberty. The Framers did not entrust the liberty of religious beliefs to either clause alone. The Free Exercise Clause ""was not to be the full extent of the Amendment's guarantee of freedom from governmental intrusion in matters of faith."" McGowan v. Maryland, supra, at 464 (opinion of Fankfurter, J.). McGowan v. Finally, it has been contended that absorption of the Establishment Clause is precluded by the absence of any intention on the part of the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment to circumscribe the residual powers of the States to aid religious activities and institutions in ways which fell short of formal establishments. [n21] That argument relies in part upon the express terms of the [p257] abortive Blaine Amendment -- proposed several years after the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment -- which would have added to the First Amendment a provision that ""[n]o State shall make any law respecting an establishment of religion. . . ."" Such a restriction would have been superfluous, it is said, if the Fourteenth Amendment had already made the Establishment Clause binding upon the States. The argument proves too much, for the Fourteenth Amendment's protection of the free exercise of religion can hardly be questioned; yet the Blaine Amendment would also have added an explicit protection against state laws abridging that liberty. [n22] Even if we assume that the draftsmen of the Fourteenth Amendment saw no immediate connection between its protections against state action infringing personal liberty and the guarantees of the First Amendment, it is certainly too late in the day to suggest that their assumed inattention to the question dilutes the force of these constitutional guarantees in their application to the States. [n23] It is enough to conclude [p258] that the religious liberty embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment would not be viable if the Constitution were interpreted to forbid only establishments ordained by Congress. The issue of what particular activities the Establishment Clause forbids the States to undertake is our more immediate concern. In Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U.S. 1, 15-16, a careful study of the relevant history led the Court to the view, consistently recognized in decisions since Everson, that the Establishment Clause embodied the Framers' conclusion that government and religion have discrete interests which are mutually best served when each avoids too close a proximity to the other. It is not only the nonbeliever who fears the injection of sectarian doctrines and controversies into the civil polity, but in as high degree it is the devout believer who fears the secularization of a creed which becomes too deeply involved with and dependent upon the government. Everson v. our tradition of civil liberty rests not only on the secularism of a Thomas Jefferson, but also on the fervent sectarianism . . . of a Roger Williams. Freund, The Supreme Court of the United States (1961), 84. Our decisions on questions of religious education or exercises in the public schools have consistently reflected this dual aspect of the Establishment Clause. Engel v. Vitale unmistakably has its roots in three earlier cases which, on cognate issues, shaped the contours of the Establishment Clause. First, in Everson, the Court held that reimbursement by the town of parents for the cost of transporting their children by public carrier to parochial (as well as public and private nonsectarian) schools did not offend the Establishment Clause. Such reimbursement, by easing the financial burden upon Catholic parents, may indirectly have fostered the operation of the Catholic schools, and may thereby indirectly have facilitated the teaching of Catholic principles, thus serving ultimately a religious goal. But this form of governmental assistance was difficult to distinguish from myriad other incidental, if not insignificant, government benefits enjoyed by religious institutions -- fire and police protection, tax exemptions, and the pavement of streets and sidewalks, for example. The State contributes no money to the schools. It does not support them. Its legislation, as applied, does no more than provide a general program to help parents get their children, regardless of their religion, safely and expeditiously to and from [p261] accredited schools. 330 U.S. at 18. Yet even this form of assistance was thought by four Justices of the Everson Court to be barred by the Establishment Clause because too perilously close to that public support of religion forbidden by the First Amendment. The other two cases, Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Education, 333 U.S. 203""] 333 U.S. 203, and 333 U.S. 203, and Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306, can best be considered together. Both involved programs of released time for religious instruction of public school students. I reject the suggestion that Zorach overruled McCollum in silence. [n26] The distinction which the Court drew in Zorach between the two cases is, in my view, faithful to the function of the Establishment Clause. Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. I should first note, however, that McCollum and Zorach do not seem to me distinguishable in terms of the free exercise claims advanced in both cases. [n27] The nonparticipant in the McCollum program was given secular instruction in a separate room during the times his classmates had religious lessons; the nonparticipant in any Zorach program also received secular instruction, while his classmates repaired to a place outside the school for religious instruction. The crucial difference, I think, was that the McCollum program offended the Establishment Clause, while the Zorach program did not. This was not, in my view, because of the difference in public expenditures involved. True, the McCollum program involved the regular use of school facilities, classrooms, heat and light and time from the regular school day -- even though the actual [p262] incremental cost may have been negligible. All religious instruction under the Zorach program, by contrast, was carried on entirely off the school premises, and the teacher's part was simply to facilitate the children's release to the churches. The deeper difference was that the McCollum program placed the religious instructor in the public school classroom in precisely the position of authority held by the regular teachers of secular subjects, while the Zorach program did not. [n28] The McCollum program, [p263] in lending to the support of sectarian instruction all the authority of the governmentally operated public school system, brought government and religion into that proximity which the Establishment Clause forbids. To be sure, a religious teacher presumably commands substantial respect and merits attention in his own right. But the Constitution does not permit that prestige and capacity for influence to be augmented by investiture of all the symbols of authority at the command of the lay teacher for the enhancement of secular instruction. More recent decisions have further etched the contours of Establishment. In the Sunday Law Cases, we found in state laws compelling a uniform day of rest from worldly labor no violation of the Establishment Clause (McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420). The basic [p264] ground of our decision was that, granted the Sunday Laws were first enacted for religious ends, they were continued in force for reasons wholly secular, namely, to provide a universal day of rest and ensure the health and tranquillity of the community. In other words, government may originally have decreed a Sunday day of rest for the impermissible purpose of supporting religion, but abandoned that purpose and retained the laws for the permissible purpose of furthering overwhelmingly secular ends. Such was the evolution of the contours of the Establishment Clause before Engel v. Vitale. There, a year ago, we held that the daily recital of the state-composed Regents' Prayer constituted an establishment of religion because, although the prayer itself revealed no sectarian content or purpose, its nature and meaning were quite clearly religious. New York, in authorizing its recitation, had not maintained that distance between the public and the religious sectors commanded by the Establishment Clause when it placed the ""power, prestige and financial support of government"" behind the prayer. In Engel, as in McCollum, it did not matter that the amount of time and expense allocated to the daily recitation was small, so long as the exercise itself was manifestly religious. Nor did it matter that few children had complained of the practice, for the measure of the seriousness of a breach of the Establishment Clause has never been thought to be the number of people who complain of it. We also held two Terms ago, in Torcaso v. Watkins, supra, that a State may not constitutionally require an applicant for the office of Notary Public to swear or affirm that he believes in God. The problem of that case was strikingly similar to the issue presented 18 years before in the flag salute case, West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette, supra. In neither case was there any claim of establishment of religion, but only of infringement of [p265] the individual's religious liberty -- in the one case, that of the nonbeliever who could not attest to a belief in God; in the other, that of the child whose creed forbade in to salute the flag. But Torcaso added a new element not present in Barnette. The Maryland test oath involved an attempt to employ essentially religious (albeit nonsectarian) means to achieve a secular goal to which the means bore no reasonable relationship. No one doubted the State's interest in the integrity of its Notaries Public, but that interest did not warrant the screening of applicants by means of a religious test. The Sunday Law Cases were different in that respect. Even if Sunday Laws retain certain religious vestiges, they are enforced today for essentially secular objectives which cannot be effectively achieved in modern society except by designating Sunday as the universal day of rest. The Court's opinions cited very substantial problems in selecting or enforcing an alternative day of rest. But the teaching of both Torcaso and the Sunday Law Cases is that government may not employ religious means to serve secular interests, however legitimate they may be, at least without the clearest demonstration that nonreligious means will not suffice. Torcaso v. West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette, supra. I turn now to the cases before us. [n30] The religious nature of the exercises here challenged seems plain. Unless Engel v. Vitale is to be overruled or we are to engage in wholly disingenuous distinction, we cannot sustain [p267] these practices. Daily recital of the Lord's Prayer and the reading of passages of Scripture are quite as clearly breaches of the command of the Establishment Clause as was the daily use of the rather bland Regents' Prayer in the New York public schools. Indeed, I would suppose that, if anything, the Lord's Prayer and the Holy Bible are more clearly sectarian, and the present violations of the First Amendment consequently more serious. But the religious exercises challenged in these cases have a long history. And, almost from the beginning, Bible reading and daily prayer in the schools have been the subject of debate, criticism by educators and other public officials, and proscription by courts and legislative councils. At the outset, then, we must carefully canvass both aspects of this history. The use of prayers and Bible readings at the opening of the school day long antedates the founding of our Republic. [t]hat, the Scholars being [p268] called together, the Mr. shall every morning begin his work with a short prayer for a blessing on his Laboures and their learning. . . . When the school begins, one of the children shall read the morning prayer, as it stands in the catechism, and close with the prayer before dinner; in the afternoon, it shall begin with the prayer after dinner, and end with the evening prayer. The evening school shall begin with the Lord's prayer, and close by singing a psalm. After the Revolution, the new States uniformly continued these long-established practices in the private and the few public grammar schools. The school committee of Boston in 1789, for example, required the city's several schoolmasters ""daily to commence the duties of their office by prayer and reading a portion of the Sacred Scriptures. . . ."" [n33] That requirement was mirrored throughout the original States, and exemplified the universal practice well into the nineteenth century. As the free public schools gradually supplanted the private academies and sectarian schools between 1800 and 1850, morning devotional exercises were retained with few alterations. Indeed, public pressures upon school administrators in many parts of the country would hardly have condoned abandonment of practices to which a century or more of private religious education had accustomed the American people. [n34] The controversy centered, in [p269] fact, principally about the elimination of plainly sectarian practices and textbooks, and led to the eventual substitution of nonsectarian, though still religious, exercises and materials. Statutory provision for daily religious exercises is, however, of quite recent origin. At the turn of this century, there was but one State -- Massachusetts -- which had a law making morning prayer or Bible reading obligatory. Statutes elsewhere either permitted such practices or simply left the question to local option. It was not until after 1910 that 11 more States, within a few years, joined Massachusetts in making one or both exercises compulsory. [n36] The Pennsylvania law with which we are [p270] concerned in the Schempp case, for example, took effect in 1913, and even the Rule of the Baltimore School Board involved in the Murray case dates only from 1905. In no State has there ever been a constitutional or statutory prohibition against the recital of prayers or the reading of Scripture, although a number of States have outlawed these practices by judicial decision or administrative order. What is noteworthy about the panoply of state and local regulations from which these cases emerge is the relative recency of the statutory codification of practices which have ancient roots, and the rather small number of States which have ever prescribed compulsory religious exercises in the public schools. The purposes underlying the adoption and perpetuation of these practices are somewhat complex. It is beyond question that the religious benefits and values realized from daily prayer and Bible reading have usually been considered paramount, and sufficient to justify the continuation of such practices. To Horace Mann, embroiled in an intense controversy over the role of sectarian instruction and textbooks in the Boston public schools, there was little question that the regular use of the Bible -- which he thought essentially nonsectarian -- would bear fruit in the spiritual enlightenment of his pupils. As a textbook of morals, the Bible is preeminent, and should have a prominent place in our schools, [p271] either as a reading book or as a source of appeal and instruction. Sectarianism, indeed, should not be countenanced in the schools; but the Bible is not sectarian. . . . The Scriptures should at least be read at the opening of the school, if no more. Prayer may also be offered with the happiest effects. with special favor the use of the Bible in public schools, as preeminently first in importance among textbooks for teaching the noblest principles of virtue, morality, patriotism, and good order -- love and reverence for God -- charity and good will to man. Such statements reveal the understanding of educators that the daily religious exercises in the schools served broader goals than compelling formal worship of God or fostering church attendance. The religious aims of the educators who adopted and retained such exercises were comprehensive, and in many cases quite devoid of sectarian bias -- but the crucial fact is that they were nonetheless religious. While it has been suggested, see pp. 278-281, infra that daily prayer and reading of Scripture now serve secular goals as well, there can be no doubt that the origins of these practices were unambiguously religious, even where the educator's aim was not to win adherents to a particular creed or faith. Almost from the beginning, religious exercises in the public schools have been the subject of intense criticism, vigorous debate, and judicial or administrative prohibition. Significantly, educators and school boards [p272] early entertained doubts about both the legality and the soundness of opening the school day with compulsory prayer or Bible reading. Particularly in the large Eastern cities, where immigration had exposed the public schools to religious diversities and conflicts unknown to the homogeneous academies of the eighteenth century, local authorities found it necessary even before the Civil War to seek an accommodation. RESOLVED, that those children whose parents conscientiously prefer and desire any particular version of the Bible, without note or comment, be furnished with same. A decade later, the Superintendent of Schools of New York State issued an even bolder decree that prayers could no longer be required as part of public school activities, and that, where the King James Bible was read, Catholic students could not be compelled to attend. religious instruction and the reading of religious books, including the Holy Bible, are prohibited in the common schools of Cincinnati, it being the true object and intent of this rule to allow the children of the parents of all sects and opinions, in matters of faith and worship, [p273] to enjoy alike the benefit of the common school fund. The Board repealed at the same time an earlier regulation which had required the singing of hymns and psalms to accompany the Bible reading at the start of the school day. And, in 1889, one commentator ventured the view that ""[t]here is not enough to be gained from Bible reading to justify the quarrel that has been raised over it."" Thus, a great deal of controversy over religion in the public schools had preceded the debate over the Blaine Amendment, precipitated by President Grant's insistence that matters of religion should be left ""to the family altar, the church, and the private school, supported entirely by private contributions."" [n44] There was ample precedent, too, for Theodore Roosevelt's declaration that, in the interest of ""absolutely nonsectarian public schools,"" it was ""not our business to have the Protestant Bible or the Catholic Vulgate or the Talmud read in those schools."" It is my belief that religious teaching in our homes, Sunday schools, churches, by the good [p274] mothers, fathers, and ministers of Ohio is far preferable to compulsory teaching of religion by the state. The spirit of our federal and state constitutions from the beginning. . . [has] been to leave religious instruction to the discretion of parents. The same theme has recurred in the opinions of the Attorneys General of several States holding religious exercises or instruction to be in violation of the state or federal constitutional command of separation of church and state. [n47] Thus, the basic principle upon which our decision last year in Engel v. Vitale necessarily rested, and which we reaffirm today, can hardly be thought to be radical or novel. Particularly relevant for our purposes are the decisions of the state courts on questions of religion in the public schools. Those decisions, while not, of course, authoritative in this Court, serve nevertheless to define the problem before us and to guide our inquiry. With the growth of religious diversity and the rise of vigorous dissent it was inevitable that the courts would be called upon to enjoin religious practices in the public schools which offended certain sects and groups. The earliest of such decisions declined to review the propriety of actions taken by school authorities, so long as those actions were within [p275] the purview of the administrators' powers. [n48] Thus, where the local school board required religious exercises, the courts would not enjoin them, [n49] and where, as in at least one case, the school officials forbade devotional practices, the court refused on similar grounds to overrule that decision. [n50] Thus, whichever way the early cases came up, the governing principle of nearly complete deference to administrative discretion effectively foreclosed any consideration of constitutional questions. The last quarter of the nineteenth century found the courts beginning to question the constitutionality of public school religious exercises. The legal context was still, of course, that of the state constitutions, since the First Amendment had not yet been held applicable to state action. And the state constitutional prohibitions against church-state cooperation or governmental aid to religion were generally less rigorous than the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. It is therefore remarkable that the courts of a half dozen States found compulsory religious exercises in the public schools in violation of their respective state constitutions. [n51] These [p276] courts attributed much significance to the clearly religious origins and content of the challenged practices, and to the impossibility of avoiding sectarian controversy in their conduct. The public school is supported by the taxes which each citizen, regardless of his religion or his lack of it, is compelled to pay. The school, like the government, is simply a civil institution. It is secular, and not religious, in its purposes. The truths of the Bible are the truths of religion, which do not come within the province of the public school. . . . No one denies that they should be taught to the youth of the State. The constitution and the law do not interfere with such teaching, but they do banish theological polemics from the schools and the school districts. This is done not from any hostility to religion, but because it is no part of the duty of the State to teach religion -- to take the money of all and apply it to teaching the children of all the religion of a part only. Instruction in religion must be voluntary. People ex rel. Ring v. Board of Education, 245 Ill. 334, 349, 92 N.E. 251, 256 (1910). People ex rel. Ring v. [t]he state as an educator must keep out of this field, and especially is this true in the common schools, where the child is immature, without fixed religious convictions. . . . State ex rel. Finger v. Weedman, 55 S.D. 343, 357, 226 N.W. 348, 354 (1929). State ex rel. Finger v. Even those state courts which have sustained devotional exercises under state law [n52] have usually recognized the primarily religious character of prayers and Bible readings. If such practices were not for that reason unconstitutional, it was necessarily because the state constitution forbade only public expenditures for sectarian instruction, or for activities which made the schoolhouse a ""place of worship,"" but said nothing about the subtler question of laws ""respecting an establishment of religion."" [n53] Thus, the panorama of history permits no [p278] other conclusion than that daily prayers and Bible readings in the public schools have always been designed to be, and have been regarded as, essentially religious exercises. Unlike the Sunday closing laws, these exercises appear neither to have been divorced from their religious origins nor deprived of their centrally religious character by the passage of time, [n54] cf. McGowan v. Maryland, supra, at 442-445. On this distinction alone we might well rest a constitutional decision. But three further contentions have been pressed in the argument of these cases. These contentions deserve careful consideration, for if the position of the school authorities were correct in respect to any of them, we would be misapplying the principles of Engel v. Vitale. cf. McGowan v. First, it is argued that, however clearly religious may have been the origins and early nature of daily prayer and Bible reading, these practices today serve so clearly secular educational purposes that their religious attributes may be overlooked. I do not doubt, for example, that morning devotional exercises may foster better discipline in the classroom, and elevate the spiritual level on which the school day opens. places upon the children or those hearing the reading of this, and the atmosphere which goes on in the reading . . . one of the last vestiges of moral value [p279] that we have left in our school system. The exercise thus affords, the Superintendent concluded, ""a strong contradiction to the materialistic trends of our time."" [t]he acknowledgement of the existence of God as symbolized in the opening exercises establishes a discipline tone which tends to cause each individual pupil to constrain his overt acts and to consequently conform to accepted standards of behavior during his attendance at school. These views are by no means novel, see, e.g., Billard v. Board of Education, 69 Kan. 53, 57-58, 76 P. 422, 423 (1904). see, e.g., Billard v. It is not the business of this Court to gainsay the judgments of experts on matters of pedagogy. Such decisions must be left to the discretion of those administrators charged with the supervision of the Nation's public schools. The limited province of the courts is to determine whether the means which the educators have chosen to achieve legitimate pedagogical ends infringe the constitutional freedoms of the First Amendment. The secular purposes which devotional exercises are said to serve fall into two categories -- those which depend upon an immediately religious experience shared by the participating children and those which appear sufficiently divorced from the religious content of the devotional material that they can be served equally by nonreligious [p280] materials. With respect to the first objective, much has been written about the moral and spiritual values of infusing some religious influence or instruction into the public school classroom. [n56] To the extent that only religious materials will serve this purpose, it seems to me that the purpose, as well as the means, is so plainly religious that the exercise is necessarily forbidden by the Establishment Clause. The fact that purely secular benefits may eventually result does not seem to me to justify the exercises, for similar indirect nonreligious benefits could no doubt have been claimed for the released time program invalidated in McCollum. The second justification assumes that religious exercises at the start of the school day may directly serve solely secular ends -- for example, by fostering harmony and tolerance among the pupils, enhancing the authority of the teacher, and inspiring better discipline. To the extent that such benefits result not from the content of the readings and recitation, but simply from the holding of such a solemn exercise at the opening assembly or the first class of the day, it would seem that less sensitive materials might equally well serve the same purpose. I have previously suggested that Torcaso and the Sunday Law Cases forbid the use of religious means to achieve secular [p281] ends where nonreligious means will suffice. That principle is readily applied to these cases. It has not been shown that readings from the speeches and messages of great Americans, for example, or from the documents of our heritage of liberty, daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, or even the observance of a moment of reverent silence at the opening of class, may not adequately serve the solely secular purposes of the devotional activities without jeopardizing either the religious liberties of any members of the community or the proper degree of separation between the spheres of religion and government. [n57] Such substitutes would, I think, be unsatisfactory or inadequate only to the extent that the present activities do, in fact, serve religious goals. While I do not question the judgment of experienced educators that the challenged practices may well achieve valuable secular ends, it seems to me that the State acts unconstitutionally if it either sets about to attain even indirectly religious ends by religious means, or if it uses religious means to serve secular ends where secular means would suffice. Second, it is argued that the particular practices involved in the two cases before us are unobjectionable [p282] because the prefer no particular sect or sects at the expense of others. Both the Baltimore and Abington procedures permit, for example, the reading of any of several versions of the Bible, and this flexibility is said to ensure neutrality sufficiently to avoid the constitutional prohibition. One answer, which might be dispositive, is that any version of the Bible is inherently sectarian, else there would be no need to offer a system of rotation or alternation of versions in the first place, that is, to allow different sectarian versions to be used on different days. The sectarian character of the Holy Bible has been at the core of the whole controversy over religious practices in the public schools throughout its long and often bitter history. [n58] To [p283] vary the version as the Abington and Baltimore schools have done may well be less offensive than to read from the King James version every day, as once was the practice. But the result even of this relatively benign procedure is that majority sects are preferred in approximate proportion to their representation in the community and in the student body, while the smaller sects suffer commensurate discrimination. So long as the subject matter of the exercise is sectarian in character, these consequences cannot be avoided. The argument contains, however, a more basic flaw. There are persons in every community -- often deeply devout -- to whom any version of the Judaeo-Christian Bible is offensive. [n59] There are others whose reverence for the Holy Scriptures demands private study or reflection, and to whom public reading or recitation is sacrilegious, as one of the expert witnesses at the trial of the Schempp case explained. To such persons, it is not the fact of using the Bible in the public schools, nor the content of any particular version, that is offensive, but only the manner in [p284] which it is used. [n60] For such persons, the anathema of public communion is even more pronounced when prayer is involved. Many deeply devout persons have always regarded prayer as a necessarily private experience. [n61] One Protestant group recently commented, for example: ""When one thinks of prayer as sincere outreach of a [p285] human soul to the Creator, 'required prayer' becomes an absurdity."" [n62] There is a similar problem with respect to comment upon the passages of Scripture which are to be read. Most present statutes forbid comment, and this practice accords with the views of many religious groups as to the manner in which the Bible should be read. However, as a recent survey discloses, scriptural passages read without comment frequently convey no message to the younger children in the school. Thus, there has developed a practice in some schools of bridging the gap between faith and understanding by means of ""definitions,"" even where ""comment"" is forbidden by statute. [n63] The present practice, therefore, poses a difficult dilemma: while Bible reading is almost universally required to be without comment, since only by such a prohibition can sectarian interpretation be excluded from the classroom, [p286] the rule breaks down at the point at which rudimentary definitions of Biblical terms are necessary for comprehension if the exercise is to be meaningful at all. It has been suggested that a tentative solution to these problems may lie in the fashioning of a ""common core"" of theology tolerable to all creeds but preferential to none. [n64] But as one commentator has recently observed, ""[h]istory is not encouraging to"" those who hope to fashion a ""common denominator of religion detached from its manifestation in any organized church."" Sutherland, Establishment According to Engel, 76 Harv.L.Rev. 25, 51 (1962). Thus, the notion of a ""common core"" litany or supplication offends many deeply devout worshippers who do not find clearly sectarian practices objectionable. The moral code held by each separate religious community can reductively be unified, but the consistent particular believer wants no such reduction. The notion of a common core suggests a watering down of the several faiths to the point where common essentials appear. This might easily lead to a new sect -- a public school sect -- which would take its place alongside the existing faiths and compete with them. Engel is surely authority that nonsectarian religious practices, equally with sectarian exercises, violate the Establishment Clause. Moreover, even if the Establishment Clause were oblivious to nonsectarian religious practices, I think it quite likely that the ""common core"" approach would be sufficiently objectionable to many groups to be foreclosed by the prohibitions of the Free Exercise Clause. A third element which is said to absolve the practices involved in these cases from the ban of the religious guarantees of the Constitution is the provision to excuse or exempt students who wish not to participate. The fact that some pupils, or theoretically all pupils, might be excused from attendance at the exercises does not mitigate the obligatory nature of the ceremony. . . . The exercises are held in the school buildings, and perforce are conducted by and under the authority of the local school authorities and during school sessions. Since the statute requires the reading of the ""Holy Bible,"" a Christian document, the practice, as we said in our first opinion, prefers the Christian religion. The record demonstrates that it was the intention of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to introduce a religious ceremony into the public schools of the Commonwealth. 201 F.Supp. at 819. Thus, the short, and to me sufficient, answer is that the availability of excusal or exemption simply has no relevance to the establishment question, if it is once found that these practices are essentially religious exercises designed at least in part to achieve religious aims through the use of public school facilities during the school day. The more difficult question, however, is whether the availability of excusal for the dissenting child serves to refute challenges to these practices under the Free Exercise Clause. While it is enough to decide these cases to dispose of the establishment questions, questions of free exercise are so inextricably interwoven into the history and present status of these practices as to justify disposition of this second aspect of the excusal issue. The answer is that the excusal procedure itself necessarily operates in such a way as to infringe the rights of free exercise of those children who wish to be excused. We have held in Barnette and Torcaso, respectively, that a State may require neither public school students nor candidates [p289] for an office of public trust to profess beliefs offensive to religious principles. By the same token, the State could not constitutionally require a student to profess publicly his disbelief as the prerequisite to the exercise of his constitutional right of abstention. And apart from Torcaso and Barnette, I think Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, suggests a further answer. We held there that a State may not condition the grant of a tax exemption upon the willingness of those entitled to the exemption to affirm their loyalty to the Government, even though the exemption was itself a matter of grace, rather than of constitutional right. We concluded that to impose upon the eligible taxpayers the affirmative burden of proving their loyalty impermissibly jeopardized the freedom to engage in constitutionally protected activities close to the area to which the loyalty oath related. Speiser v. Randall seems to me to dispose of two aspects of the excusal or exemption procedure now before us. First, by requiring what is tantamount in the eyes of teachers and schoolmates to a profession of disbelief, or at least of nonconformity, the procedure may well deter those children who do not wish to participate for any reason based upon the dictates of conscience from exercising an indisputably constitutional right to be excused. [n68] Thus, the excusal [p290] provision in its operation subjects them to a cruel dilemma. In consequence, even devout children may well avoid claiming their right and simply continue to participate in exercises distasteful to them because of an understandable reluctance to be stigmatized as atheists or nonconformists simply on the basis of their request. Such reluctance to seek exemption seems all the more likely in view of the fact that children are disinclined at this age to step out of line or to flout ""peer-group norms."" Such is the widely held view of experts who have studied the behaviors and attitudes of children. That a child is offered an alternative may reduce the constraint; it does not eliminate the operation of influence by the school in matters sacred to conscience and outside the school's domain. The law of imitation operates, and nonconformity is not an [p292] outstanding characteristic of children. The result is an obvious pressure upon children to attend. 333 U.S. at 227. . . . the excluded pupil loses caste with his fellows, and is liable to be regarded with aversion, and subjected to reproach and insult. But it is a sufficient refutation of the argument that the practice in question tends to destroy the equality of the pupils which the constitution seeks to establish and protect, and puts a portion of them to serious disadvantage in many ways with respect to the others. State ex rel. Weiss v. District Board of School District No. 8, 76 Wis. 177, 200, 44 N.W. 967, 975. State ex rel. Weiss v. District Board of School District No. Under such circumstances, the children would be excused from the opening exercises . . . because of their religious beliefs. And excusing such children on religious grounds, although the number excused might be very small, would be a distinct preference in favor of the religious beliefs of the majority, and would work a discrimination against those who were excused. The exclusion of a pupil under such circumstances puts him in a class by himself; it subjects him to a religious stigma, and all because of his religious belief. Equality in public education would be destroyed by such act, under a Constitution which seeks to establish equality and freedom in religious matters. Herold v. Parish Board of School Directors, 136 La. 1034, 1049-1050, 68 So. 116, 121. See also Tudor v. Board of Education, 14 N.J. 31, 48-52, [p293] 100 A.2d 857, 867-868; Brown v. Orange County Board of Public Instruction, 128 So.2d 181, 185 (Fla.App.). Herold v. See also Tudor v. Brown v. Speiser v. Randall also suggests the answer to a further argument based on the excusal procedure. It has been suggested by the School Board, in Schempp, that we ought not pass upon the appellees' constitutional challenge at least until the children have availed themselves of the excusal procedure and found it inadequate to redress their grievances. Were the right to be excused not itself of constitutional stature, I might have some doubt about this issue. But we held in Speiser that the constitutional vice of the loyalty oath procedure discharged any obligation to seek the exemption before challenging the constitutionality of the conditions upon which it might have been denied. 357 U.S. at 529. Similarly, we have held that one need not apply for a permit to distribute constitutionally protected literature, Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U.S. 444, or to deliver a speech, Thomas v. Collins, 323 U.S. 516, before he may attack the constitutionality of a licensing system of which the defect is patent. Insofar as these cases implicate only questions of establishment, it seems to me that the availability of an excuse is constitutionally irrelevant. Moreover, the excusal procedure seems to me to operate in such a way as to discourage the free exercise of religion on the part of those who might wish to utilize it, thereby rendering it unconstitutional in an additional and quite distinct respect. To summarize my views concerning the merits of these two cases: the history, the purpose and the operation of the daily prayer recital and Bible reading leave no doubt that these practices, standing by themselves, constitute an impermissible breach of the Establishment Clause. Such devotional exercises may well serve legitimate nonreligious purposes. To the extent, however, that such purposes [p294] are really without religious significance, it has never been demonstrated that secular means would not suffice. Indeed, I would suggest that patriotic or other nonreligious materials might provide adequate substitutes -- inadequate only to the extent that the purposes now served are indeed directly or indirectly religious. Under such circumstances, the States may not employ religious means to reach a secular goal unless secular means are wholly unavailing. I therefore agree with the Court that the judgment in Schempp, No. 142, must be affirmed, and that, in Murray, No. 119, must be reversed. These considerations bring me to a final contention of the school officials in these cases: that the invalidation of the exercises at bar permits this Court no alternative but to declare unconstitutional every vestige, however slight, of cooperation or accommodation between religion and government. I cannot accept that contention. While it is not, of course, appropriate for this Court to decide questions not presently before it, I venture to suggest that religious exercises in the public schools present a unique problem. For not every involvement of religion in public life violates the Establishment Clause. Our decision in these cases does not clearly forecast anything about the constitutionality of other types of interdependence between religious and other public institutions. Specifically, I believe that the line we must draw between the permissible and the impermissible is one which accords with history and faithfully reflects the understanding of the Founding Fathers. It is a line which the Court has consistently sought to mark in its decisions expounding the religious guarantees of the First Amendment. What the Framers meant to foreclose, and what our decisions under the Establishment Clause have forbidden, [p295] are those involvements of religious with secular institutions which (a) serve the essentially religious activities of religious institutions; (b) employ the organs of government for essentially religious purposes; or (c) use essentially religious means to serve governmental ends where secular means would suffice. When the secular and religious institutions become involved in such a manner, there inhere in the relationship precisely those dangers -- as much to church as to state -- which the Framers feared would subvert religious liberty and the strength of a system of secular government. On the other hand, there may be myriad forms of involvements of government with religion which do not import such dangers, and therefore should not, in my judgment, be deemed to violate the Establishment Clause. Nothing in the Constitution compels the organs of government to be blind to what everyone else perceives -- that religious differences among Americans have important and pervasive implications for our society. Likewise, nothing in the Establishment Clause forbids the application of legislation having purely secular ends in such a way as to alleviate burdens upon the free exercise of an individual's religious beliefs. Surely the Framers would never have understood that such a construction sanctions that involvement which violates the Establishment Clause. Such a conclusion can be reached, I would suggest, only by using the words of the First Amendment to defeat its very purpose. The line between permissible and impermissible forms of involvement between government and religion has already been considered by the lower federal and state courts. I think a brief survey of certain of these forms of accommodation will reveal that the First Amendment commands not official hostility toward religion, but only a strict neutrality in matters of religion. Moreover, it may serve to suggest that the scope of our holding today [p296] is to be measured by the special circumstances under which these cases have arisen, and by the particular dangers to church and state which religious exercises in the public schools present. It may be helpful for purposes of analysis to group these other practices and forms of accommodation into several rough categories. A. The Conflict Between Establishment and Free Exercise. -- There are certain practices, conceivably violative of the Establishment Clause, the striking down of which might seriously interfere with certain religious liberties also protected by the First Amendment. [n70] Provisions for churches and chaplains at military establishments for those in the armed services may afford one such example. [n71] [p297] The like provision by state and federal governments for chaplains in penal institutions may afford another example. [n72] It is argued that such provisions may be assumed to contravene the Establishment Clause, yet be sustained on constitutional grounds as necessary to secure to the members of the Armed Forces and prisoners those rights of worship guaranteed under the Free Exercise Clause. Since government has deprived such persons of the opportunity [p298] to practice their faith at places of their choice, the argument runs, government may, in order to avoid infringing the free exercise guarantees, provide substitutes where it requires such persons to be. Such a principle might support, for example, the constitutionality of draft exemptions for ministers and divinity students, [n73] cf. Selective Draft Law Cases, 245 U.S. 366, 389-390; of the excusal of children from school on their respective religious holidays, and of the allowance by government of temporary use of public buildings by religious organizations when their own churches have become unavailable because of a disaster or emergency. The Conflict Between Establishment and Free Exercise. cf. Such activities and practices seem distinguishable from the sponsorship of daily Bible reading and prayer recital. For one thing, there is no element of coercion present in the appointment of military or prison chaplains; the soldier or convict who declines the opportunities for worship would not ordinarily subject himself to the suspicion or obloquy of his peers. Of special significance to this distinction is the fact that we are here usually dealing [p299] with adults, not with impressionable children as in the public schools. Moreover, the school exercises are not designed to provide the pupils with general opportunities for worship denied them by the legal obligation to attend school. The student's compelled presence in school for five days a week in no way renders the regular religious facilities of the community less accessible to him than they are to others. The situation of the school child is therefore plainly unlike that of the isolated soldier or the prisoner. The State must be steadfastly neutral in all matters of faith, and neither favor nor inhibit religion. In my view, government cannot sponsor religious exercises in the public schools without jeopardizing that neutrality. On the other hand, hostility, not neutrality, would characterize the refusal to provide chaplains and places of worship for prisoners and soldiers cut off by the State from all civilian opportunities for public communion, the withholding of draft exemptions for ministers and conscientious objectors, or the denial of the temporary use of an empty public building to a congregation whose place of worship has been destroyed by fire or flood. I do not say that government must provide chaplains or draft exemptions, or that the courts should intercede if it fails to do so. B. Establishment and Exercises in Legislative Bodies. -- The saying of invocational prayers in legislative chambers, state or federal, and the appointment of legislative chaplains, might well represent no involvements of the kind prohibited by the Establishment Clause. [n75] Legislators, federal and state, are mature adults who may presumably absent themselves from such public and ceremonial [p300] exercises without incurring any penalty, direct or indirect. It may also be significant that, at least in the case of the Congress, Art. I, § 5, of the Constitution makes each House the monitor of the ""Rules of its Proceedings"" so that it is at least arguable whether such matters present ""political questions"" the resolution of which is exclusively confided to Congress. See Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 232. Finally, there is the difficult question of who may be heard to challenge such practices. See Elliott v. White, 23 F.2d 997. Establishment and Exercises in Legislative Bodies. See Elliott v. C. Non-Devotional Use of the Bible in the Public Schools. -- The holding of the Court today plainly does not foreclose teaching about the Holy Scriptures or about the differences between religious sects in classes in literature or history. Indeed, whether or not the Bible is involved, it would be impossible to teach meaningfully many subjects in the social sciences or the humanities without some mention of religion. [n76] To what extent, and at what points in the curriculum, religious materials should be cited are matters which the courts ought to entrust very largely to the experienced officials who superintend our Nation's public schools. They are experts in such matters, and we are not. Non-Devotional Use of the Bible in the Public Schools. to decree a uniform, rigid and, if we are consistent, an unchanging standard for countless school boards representing [p301] and serving highly localized groups which not only differ from each other, but which themselves from time to time change attitudes. Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. We do not, however, in my view, usurp the jurisdiction of school administrators by holding, as we do today, that morning devotional exercises in any form are constitutionally invalid. But there is no occasion now to go further and anticipate problems we cannot judge with the material now before us. Any attempt to impose rigid limits upon the mention of God or references to the Bible in the classroom would be fraught with dangers. If it should sometime hereafter be shown that, in fact, religion can play no part in the teaching of a given subject without resurrecting the ghost of the practices we strike down today, it will then be time enough to consider questions we must now defer. D. Uniform Tax Exemptions Incidentally Available to Religious Institutions. -- Nothing we hold today questions the propriety of certain tax deductions or exemptions which incidentally benefit churches and religious institutions, along with many secular charities and nonprofit organizations. If religious institutions benefit, it is in spite of, rather than because of, their religious character. For religious institutions simply share benefits which government makes generally available to educational, charitable, and eleemosynary groups. [n77] There is no indication that taxing authorities have used such benefits in any way to subsidize worship or foster belief in God. And as [p302] among religious beneficiaries, the tax exemption or deduction can be truly nondiscriminatory, available on equal terms to small as well as large religious bodies, to popular and unpopular sects, and to those organizations which reject, as well as those which accept, a belief in God. Uniform Tax Exemptions Incidentally Available to Religious Institutions. E. Religious Considerations in Public Welfare Programs. -- Since government may not support or directly aid religious activities without violating the Establishment Clause, there might be some doubt whether nondiscriminatory programs of governmental aid may constitutionally include individuals who become eligible wholly or partially for religious reasons. For example, it might be suggested that, where a State provides unemployment compensation generally to those who are unable to find suitable work, it may not extend such benefits to persons who are unemployed by reason of religious beliefs or practices without thereby establishing the religion to which those persons belong. Therefore, the argument runs, the State may avoid an establishment only by singling out and excluding such persons on the ground that religious beliefs or practices have made them potential beneficiaries. Such a construction would, it seems to me, require government to impose religious discriminations and disabilities, thereby jeopardizing the free exercise of religion, in order to avoid what is thought to constitute an establishment. Religious Considerations in Public Welfare Programs. The inescapable flaw in the argument, I suggest, is its quite unrealistic view of the aims of the Establishment Clause. The Framers were not concerned with the effects of certain incidental aids to individual worshippers which come about as by-products of general and nondiscriminatory welfare programs. If such benefits serve to make [p303] easier or less expensive the practice of a particular creed, or of all religions, it can hardly be said that the purpose of the program is in any way religious, or that the consequence of its nondiscriminatory application is to create the forbidden degree of interdependence between secular and sectarian institutions. I cannot therefore accept the suggestion, which seems to me implicit in the argument outlined here, that every judicial or administrative construction which is designed to prevent a public welfare program from abridging the free exercise of religious beliefs, is for, that reason, ipso facto, an establishment of religion. F. Activities Which, Though Religious in Origin, Have Ceased to Have Religious Meaning. -- As we noted in our Sunday Law decisions, nearly every criminal law on the books can be traced to some religious principle or inspiration. But that does not make the present enforcement of the criminal law in any sense an establishment of religion, simply because it accords with widely held religious principles. As we said in McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. Activities Which, Though Religious in Origin, Have Ceased to Have Religious Meaning. the ""Establishment"" Clause does not ban federal or state regulation of conduct whose reason or effect merely happens to coincide or harmonize with the tenets of some or all religions. This rationale suggests that the use of the motto ""In God We Trust"" on currency, on documents and public buildings and the like may not offend the clause. It is not that the use of those four words can be dismissed as ""de minimis"" -- for I suspect there would be intense opposition to the abandonment of that motto. The truth is that we have simply interwoven the motto so deeply into the fabric of our civil polity that its present use may well not present that type of involvement which the First Amendment prohibits. This general principle might also serve to insulate the various patriotic exercises and activities used in the public schools and elsewhere which, whatever may have been [p304] their origins, no longer have a religious purpose or meaning. The reference to divinity in the revised pledge of allegiance, for example, may merely recognize the historical fact that our Nation was believed to have been founded ""under God."" Thus, reciting the pledge may be no more of a religious exercise than the reading aloud of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, which contains an allusion to the same historical fact. The principles which we reaffirm and apply today can hardly be thought novel or radical. They are, in truth, as old as the Republic itself, and have always been as integral a part of the First Amendment as the very words of that charter of religious liberty. No less applicable today than they were when first pronounced a century ago, one year after the very first court decision involving religious exercises in the public schools, are the words of a distinguished Chief Justice of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Jeremiah S. The manifest object of the men who framed the institutions of this country, was to have a State without religion, and a Church without politics -- that is to say, they meant that one should never be used as an engine for any purpose of the other, and that no man's rights in one should be tested by his opinions about the other. As the Church takes no note of men's political differences, so the State looks with equal eye on all the modes of religious faith. . . . Our fathers seem to have been perfectly sincere in their belief that the members of the Church would be more patriotic, and the citizens of the State more religious, by keeping their respective functions entirely separate.

Instead, therefore, of putting the Bible and Testament into the hands of the children at an age when their judgments are not sufficiently matured for religious inquiries, their memories may here be stored with the most useful facts from Grecian, Roman, European and American history. 2 Writings of Thomas Jefferson (Memorial ed.1903), 204. Compare Jefferson's letter to his nephew, Peter Carr, when the latter was about to begin the study of law, in which Jefferson outlined a suggested course of private study of religion, since ""[y]our reason is now mature enough to examine this object."" Letter to Peter Carr, August 10, 1787, in Padover, The Complete Jefferson (1943), 1058. Jefferson seems to have opposed sectarian instruction at any level of public education, see Healey, Jefferson on Religion in Public Education (1962), 206-210, 256, 264-265. The absence of any mention of religious instruction in the projected elementary and secondary schools contrasts significantly with Jefferson's quite explicit proposals concerning religious instruction at the University of Virginia. His draft for ""A Bill for the More General Diffusion of Knowledge,"" in 1779, for example, outlined in some detail the secular curriculum for the public schools, while avoiding any references to religious studies. See Padover, supra, at 1048-1054. no religious reading, instruction or exercise, shall be prescribed or practiced inconsistent with the tenets of any religious sect or denomination. Padover, supra, at 1076. Reliance upon Jefferson's apparent willingness to permit certain religious instruction at the University seems, therefore, to lend little support to such instruction in the elementary and secondary schools. Compare, e.g., Corwin, A Constitution of Powers in a Secular State (1951), 104-106; Costanzo, Thomas Jefferson, Religious Education and Public Law, 8 J.Pub.Law 81, 100-106 (1959). Cf.

First, the brevity of Congressional debate and the lack of writings on the question by the framers make any historical argument inconclusive, and open to serious question. Second, the amendment was designed to outlaw practices which had existed before its writing, but there is no authoritative declaration of the specific practices at which it was aimed. And third, most of the modern religious freedom cases turn on issues which were, at most, academic in 1789, and perhaps did not exist at all. Public education was almost nonexistent in 1789, and the question of religious education in public schools may not have been foreseen. Beth, The American Theory of Church and State (1958), 88. See generally, for discussion of the early efforts for disestablishment of the established colonial churches, and of the conditions against which the proponents of separation of church and state contended, Sweet, The Story of Religion in America (1950), c.

The origins of the modern movement for free state supported education cannot be fixed with precision. In England, the Levellers unavailingly urged in their platform of 1649 the establishment of free primary education for all, or at least for boys. See Brailsford, The Levellers and the English Revolution (1961), 534. In the North American Colonies, education was, almost without exception, under private sponsorship and supervision, frequently under control of the dominant Protestant sects. This condition prevailed after the Revolution and into the first quarter of the nineteenth century. See generally Mason, Moral Values and Secular Education (1950), c. II; Thayer, The Role of the School in American Society (1960), c. X; Greene, Religion and the State: The Making and Testing of an American Tradition (1941), 120-122. I thank God there are no free schools nor printing, and I hope we shall not have them these hundred years; for learning has brought disobedience, and heresy, and sects into the world. . . . (Emphasis deleted.) Bates, Religious Liberty: An Inquiry (1945), 327. The exclusively private control of American education did not, however, quite survive Berkeley's expectations. Benjamin Franklin's proposals in 1749 for a Philadelphia Academy heralded the dawn of publicly supported secondary education, although the proposal did not bear immediate fruit. See Johnson and Yost, Separation of Church and State in the United States (1948), 26-27. Jefferson's elaborate plans for a public school system in Virginia came to naught after the defeat in 1796 of his proposed Elementary School Bill, which found little favor among the wealthier legislators. See Bowers, The Young Jefferson (1945), 182-186. It was not until the 1820's and 1830's, under the impetus of Jacksonian democracy, that a system of public education really took root in the United States. See 1 Beard, The Rise of American Civilization (1937), 810-818. One force behind the development of secular public schools may have been a growing dissatisfaction with the tightly sectarian control over private education, see Harner, Religion's Place in General Education (1949), 29-30. Yet the burgeoning public school systems did not immediately supplant the old sectarian and private institutions; Alexis de Tocqueville, for example, remarked after his tour of the Eastern States in 1831 that ""[a]lmost all education is entrusted to the clergy."" 1 Democracy in America (Bradley ed.1945) 309, n. 4. And compare Lord Bryce's observations, a half century later, on the still largely denominational character of American higher education, 2 The American Commonwealth (1933), 734-735. Efforts to keep the public schools of the early nineteenth century free from sectarian influence were of two kinds. One took the form of constitutional provisions and statutes adopted by a number of States forbidding appropriations from the public treasury for the support of religious instruction in any manner. See Moehlman, The Wall of Separation Between Church and State (1951), 132-135; Lardner, How Far Does the Constitution Separate Church and State? 45 Am.Pol.Sci.Rev. 110, 122 (1951). The other took the form of measures directed against the use of sectarian reading and teaching materials in the schools. The texts used in the earliest public schools had been largely taken over from the private academies, and retained a strongly religious character and content. See Nichols, Religion and American Democracy (1959), 640; Kinney, Church and State, The Struggle for Separation in New Hampshire, 1630-1900 (1955), 150-153. direct any school books to be purchased or used, in any of the schools . . . which are calculated to favour any particular religious sect or tenet. 2 Stokes, Church and State in the United States (1950), 53. For further discussion of the background of the Massachusetts law and difficulties in its early application, see Dunn, What Happened to Religious Education? (1958), c. IV. As other States followed the example of Massachusetts, the use of sectarian texts was in time as widely prohibited as the appropriation of public funds for religious instruction. It is pertinent to remind that the establishment of this principle of Separation in the field of education was not due to any decline in the religious beliefs of the people. Horace Mann was a devout Christian, and the deep religious feeling of James Madison is stamped upon the Remonstrance. The secular public school did not imply indifference to the basic role of religion in the life of the people, nor rejection of religious education as a means of fostering it. The claims of religion were not minimized by refusing to make the public schools agencies for their assertion. The nonsectarian or secular public school was the means of reconciling freedom in general with religious freedom. The sharp confinement of the public schools to secular education was a recognition of the need of a democratic society to educate its children, insofar as the State undertook to do so, in an atmosphere free from pressures in a realm in which pressures are most resisted and where conflicts are most easily and most bitterly engendered. Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. The comparative religious homogeneity of the United States at the time the Bill of Rights was adopted has been considered in Haller, The Puritan Background of the First Amendment, in Read ed., The Constitution Reconsidered (1938) , 131, 133-134; Beth, The American Theory of Church and State (1958), 74; Kinney, Church and State, The Struggle for Separation in New Hampshire, 1630-1900 (1955), 155-161. However, Madison suggested in the Fifty-first Federalist that the religious diversity which existed at the time of the Constitutional Convention constituted a source of strength for religious freedom, much as the multiplicity of economic and political interests enhanced the security of other civil rights. The Federalist (Cooke ed.1961), 351-352. See Comment, The Power of Courts Over the Internal Affairs of Religious Groups, 43 Calif.L.Rev. 322 (1955); Comment, Judicial Intervention in Disputes Within Independent Church Bodies, 54 Mich.L.Rev. 102 (1955); Note, Judicial Intervention in Disputes Over the Use of Church Property, 75 Harv.L.Rev. 1142 (1962). Compare Vidal v. Girard's Executors, 2 How. 127. The principle of judicial nonintervention in essentially religious disputes appears to have been reflected in the decisions of several state courts declining to enforce essentially private agreements concerning the religious education and worship of children of separated or divorced parents. See, e.g., Hackett v. Hackett, 78 Ohio Abs. 485, 150 N.E.2d 431; Stanton v. Stanton, 213 Ga. 545, 100 S.E.2d 289; Friedman, The Parental Right to Control the Religious Education of a Child, 29 Harv.L.Rev. 485 (1916); 72 Harv.L.Rev. 372 (1958); Note, 10 West.

For a discussion of the difficulties inherent in the Ballard case, see Kurland, Religion and the Law (1962), 75-79. This Court eventually reversed the convictions on the quite unrelated ground that women had been systematically excluded from the jury, Ballard v. United States, 329 U.S. 187. For discussions of the difficulties in interpreting and applying the First Amendment so as to foster the objective of neutrality without hostility, see, e.g., Katz, Freedom of Religion and State Neutrality, 20 U. of Chi.L.Rev. 426, 438 (1953); Kauper, Church, State, and Freedom: A Review, 52 Mich.L.Rev. 829, 842 (1954). Compare, for an interesting apparent attempt to avoid the Ballard problem at the international level, Article 3 of the Multilateral Treaty between the United States and certain American Republics, which provides that extradition will not be granted, inter alia, when ""the offense is . . . directed against religion."" Blakely, American State Papers and Related Documents on Freedom in Religion (4th rev. ed.1949), 316. Ballard v. See Kurland, Religion and the Law (1962), 32-34. (1) No religious instruction shall be provided in any educational institution wholly maintained out of State funds. (2) Nothing in clause (1) shall apply to an educational institution which is administered by the State but has been established under any endowment or trust which requires that religious instruction shall be imparted in such institution. 1 Chaudhri, Constitutional Rights and Limitations (1955), 875-876, 939. See Kurland, Religion and the Law (1962), 231; Fellman, Separation of Church and State in the United State: A Summary View, 1950 Wis.L.Rev. 427, 442. all men should enjoy the fullest toleration in the exercise of religion according to the dictates of conscience, unpunished and unrestrained by the magistrate, unless, under color of religion, any man disturb the peace, the happiness, or safety of society. See Cobb, The Rise of Religious Liberty in America (1902), 491. Concerning various legislative limitations and restraints upon religiously motivated behavior which endangers or offends society, see Manwaring, Render Unto Caesar: The Flag-Salute Controversy (1962), 412. Various courts have applied this principle to proscribe certain religious exercises or activities which were thought to threaten the safety or morals of the participants or the rest of the community, e.g., State v. Massey, 229 N.C. 734, 51 S.E.2d 179; Harden v. State, 188 Tenn. 17, 216 S.W.2d 708; Lawson v. Commonwealth, 291 Ky. 437, 164 S.W.2d 972; cf. Sweeney v. Webb, 33 Tex.Civ.App. 324, 76 S.W. 766. e.g., State v. Lawson v. As to freedom of conscience, I meddle with no man's conscience; but if you mean by that liberty to celebrate the Mass, I would have you understand that in no place where the power of the Parliament of England prevails shall that be permitted. Quoted in Hook, The Paradoxes of Freedom (1962), 23. With respect to the decision in Hamilton v. Regents, compare two recent comments: Kurland, Religion and the Law (1962), 40, and French, Comment, Unconstitutional Conditions: An Analysis 50 Geo.L.J. 234, 246 (1961). See generally as to the background and history of the Barnette case, Manwaring, Render Unto Caesar: The Flag-Salute Controversy (1962), especially at 252-253. Compare, for the interesting treatment of a problem similar to that of Barnette, in a nonconstitutional context, Chabot v. Les Commissaires D'Ecoles de Lamorandiere, Que.B.R. 707, noted in 4 McGill L.J. 268 (1958). Chabot v. See Barron v. Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243; Permoli v. New Orleans, 3 How. 589, 609; cf. Fox v. Ohio, 5 How. 410, 434-435; Withers v. Buckley, 20 How. 84, 89-91. As early as 1825, however, at least one commentator argued that the guarantees of the Bill of Rights, excepting only those of the First and Seventh Amendments, were meant to limit the powers of the States. Rawle, A View of the Constitution of the United States of America (1825), 120-130. See Barron v. Permoli v. In addition to the statement of this Court in Meyer, at least one state court assumed as early as 1921 that claims of abridgment of the free exercise of religion in the public schools must be tested under the guarantees of the First Amendment, as well as those of the state constitution. Hardwick v. Board of School Trustees, 54 Cal.App. 696, 704-705, 205 P. 49, 52. See Louisell and Jackson, Religion, Theology, and Public Higher Education, 50 Cal.L.Rev. 751, 772 (1962). Even before the Fourteenth Amendment, New York State enacted a general common school law in 1844 which provided that no religious instruction should be given which could be construed to violate the rights of conscience ""as secured by the constitution of this state and the United States."" N.Y.Laws, 1844, c. 320, § 12. Hardwick v. See, e.g., Snee, Religious Disestablishment and the Fourteenth Amendment, 1954 Wash.U.L.Q. 371, 373-394; Kruse, The Historical Meaning and Judicial Construction of the Establishment of Religion Clause of the First Amendment, 2 Washburn L.J. 65, 84-85, 127130 (1962); Katz, Religion and American Constitutions, Address at Northwestern University Law School, March 20, 1963, pp.6-7. But see the debate in the Constitutional Convention over the question whether it was necessary or advisable to include among the enumerated powers of the Congress a power ""to establish an University, in which no preferences or distinctions should be allowed on account of religion."" At least one delegate thought such an explicit delegation ""is not necessary,"" for ""[t]he exclusive power at the Seat of Government will reach the object."" The proposal was defeated by only two votes. 2 Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention of 1787 (1911), 616. The last formal establishment, that of Massachusetts, was dissolved in 1833. The process of disestablishment in that and other States is described in Cobb, The Rise of Religious Liberty in America (1902), c. X; Sweet, The Story of Religion in America (1950), c. XIII. The greater relevance of conditions existing at the time of adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment is suggested in Note, State Sunday Laws and the Religious Guarantees of the Federal Constitution, 7 Harv.L.Rev. 729, 739, n. 79 (1960). See Corwin, A Constitution of Powers in a Secular State (1951), 111-114; Fairman and Morrison, Does the Fourteenth Amendment Incorporate the Bill of Rights? 2 Stan.L.Rev. 5 (1949); Meyer, Comment, The Blaine Amendment and the Bill of Rights, 64 Harv.L.Rev. 939 (1951); Howe, Religion and Race in Public Education, 8 Buffalo L.Rev. 242, 245-247 (1959). Cf. Cooley, Principles of Constitutional Law (2d ed. 1891), 213-214. Looking back, it is hard to see how the Court could have done otherwise, how it could have persisted in accepting freedom of contract as a guaranteed liberty without giving equal status to freedom of press and speech, assembly, and religious observance. What does not seem so inevitable is the inclusion within the Fourteenth Amendment of the concept of nonestablishment of religion in the sense of forbidding nondiscriminatory aid to religion, where there is no interference with freedom of religious exercise. Freund, The Supreme Court of the United States (1961), 58-59. The Blaine Amendment, 4 Cong.Rec. no money raised by taxation in any State for the support of public schools or derived from any public fund therefor, nor any public lands devoted thereto, shall ever be under the control of any religious sect or denomination. . . . The Amendment passed the House but failed to obtain the requisite two-thirds vote in the Senate. See 4 Cong.Rec. 5595. The prohibition which the Blaine Amendment would have engrafted onto the American Constitution has been incorporated in the constitutions of other nations; compare Article 28(1) of the Constitution of India (""No religious instruction shall be provided in any educational institution wholly maintained out of State funds""); Article XX of the Constitution of Japan ("". . . the State and its organs shall refrain from religious education or any other religious activity""). See 1 Chaudhri, Constitutional Rights and Limitations (1955), 875, 876. I have never been able to see the necessity or expediency of the movement for obtaining such an amendment. The Constitution was evidently framed and adopted by the people of the United States with the fixed determination to allow absolute religious freedom and equality, and to avoid all appearance even of a State religion, or a State endorsement of any particular creed or religious sect. . . . And after the Constitution in its original form was adopted, the people made haste to secure an amendment that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. This shows the earnest desire of our Revolutionary fathers that religion should be left to the free and voluntary action of the people themselves. I do not regard it as manifesting any hostility to religion, but as showing a fixed determination to leave the people entirely free on the subject. And it seems to me that our fathers were wise; that the great voluntary system of this country is quite as favorable to the promotion of real religion as the systems of governmental protection and patronage have been in other countries. And whilst I do not understand that the association which you represent desire to invoke any governmental interference, still the amendment sought is a step in that direction which our fathers (quite as good Christians as ourselves) thought it wise not to take. In this country, they thought they had settled one thing at least, that it is not the province of government to teach theology. . . . Religion, as the basis and support of civil government, must reside not in the written Constitution, but in the people themselves. And we cannot legislate religion into the people. It must be infused by gentler and wiser methods. Miscellaneous Writings of Joseph P. Bradley (1901), 357-359. For a later phase of the controversy over such a constitutional amendment as that which Justice Bradley opposed, see Finlator, Christ in Congress, 4 J. Church and State 205 (1962). There is no doubt that, whatever ""establishment"" may have meant to the Framers of the First Amendment in 1791, the draftsmen of the Fourteenth Amendment three quarters of a century later understood the Establishment Clause to foreclose many incidental forms of governmental aid to religion which fell far short of the creation or support of an official church. If Congress has passed, or should pass, any law which, fairly construed, has in any degree introduced, or should attempt to introduce, in favor of any church, or ecclesiastical association, or system of religious faith, all or any one of these obnoxious particulars -- endowment at the public expense, peculiar privileges to its members, or disadvantages or penalties upon those who should reject its doctrines or belong to other communions -- such law would be a ""law respecting an establishment of religion,"" and, therefore, in violation of the constitution. S.Rep. No. 376, 32d Cong., 2d Sess. 1-2. Compare Thomas M. 1. Any law respecting an establishment of religion. . . . 2. Compulsory support, by taxation or otherwise, of religious instruction. Not only is no one denomination to be favored at the expense of the rest, but all support of religious instruction must be entirely voluntary. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations (1st ed. 1868), 469. Compare, e.g., Miller, Roger Williams: is Contribution to the American Tradition (1953), 83, with Madison, Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments, reprinted as an Appendix to the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Rutledge, Everson v.

See 343 U.S. at 321-322 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting); Kurland, Religion and the Law (1962), 89. I recognize that there is a question whether, in Zorach, the free exercise claims asserted were, in fact, proved. 343 U.S. at 311. Religious education so conducted on school time and property is patently woven into the working scheme of the school. The Champaign arrangement thus presents powerful elements of inherent pressure by the school system in the interest of religious sects. . . . As a result, the public school system of Champaign actively furthers inculcation in the religious tenets of some faiths, and in the process, sharpens the consciousness of religious differences, at least among some of the children committed to its care. For similar reasons, some state courts have enjoined the public schools from employing or accepting the services of members of religious orders even in the teaching of secular subjects, e.g., Zellers v. Huff, 55 N.M. 501, 236 P.2d 949; Berghorn v. Reorganized School Dist. No. 8, 364 Mo. 121, 260 S.W.2d 573; compare ruling of Texas Commissioner of Education, Jan. 25, 1961, in 63 American Jewish Yearbook (1962), 188. e.g., Zellers v. Berghorn v. Reorganized School Dist. No. Then, all through the school hours, these teachers . . . were before the children as object lessons of the order and church of which they were members. It is within our common observation that young children . . . are very susceptible to the influence of their teachers and of the kind of object lessons continually before them in schools conducted under these circumstances and with these surroundings. O'Connor v. Hendrick, 109 App.Div. 361, 371-372, 96 N.Y.Supp. 161, 169. See also Commonwealth v. Herr, 229 Pa. 132, 78 A. 68; Comment, Religious Garb in the Public Schools -- A Study in Conflicting Liberties, 22 U. of Chi.L.Rev. 888 (1955). Also apposite are decisions of several courts which have enjoined the use of parochial schools as part of the public school system, Harfst v. Hoegen, 349 Mo. 808, 163 S.W.2d 609; or have invalidated programs for the distribution in public school classrooms of Gideon Bibles, Brown v. Orange County Board of Public Instruction, 128 So.2d 181 (Fla.App.); Tudor v. Board of Education, 14 N.J. 31, 100 A.2d 857. See Note, The First Amendment and Distribution of Religious Literature in the Public Schools, 41 Va.L.Rev. 789, 803-806 (1955). O'Connor v. See also Commonwealth v. Brown v. Tudor v. . . . the public school machinery is used to bring about the distribution of these Bibles to the children. . . . In the eyes of the pupils and their parents, the board of education has placed its stamp of approval upon this distribution and, in fact, upon the Gideon Bible itself. . . . This is more than mere ""accommodation"" of religion permitted in the Zorach case. The school's part in this distribution is an active one, and cannot be sustained on the basis of a mere assistance to religion. 14 N.J. at 51-52, 100 A.2d at 868. The school being in session, the right to command was vested in the teacher, and the duty of obedience imposed upon the pupils. Under such circumstances, a request and a command have the same meaning. A request from one in authority is understood to be a mere euphemism. It is, in fact, a command in an inoffensive form. State ex rel. Freeman v. Scheve, 65 Neb. 876, 880, 93 N.W. 169, 170. State ex rel. Freeman v.

And compare Miller v. Cooper, 56 N.M. 355, 244 P.2d 520 (1952), in which a state court permitted the holding of public school commencement exercises in a church building only because no public buildings in the community were adequate to accommodate the ceremony. Bantam Books, Inc., v. And compare Miller v. No question has been raised in these cases concerning the standing of these parents to challenge the religious practices conducted in the schools which their children presently attend. Whatever authority Doremus v. Board of Education, 342 U.S. 429, might have on the question of the standing of one not the parent of children affected by the challenged exercises is not before us in these cases. Neither in McCollum nor in Zorach was there any reason to question the standing of the parent plaintiffs under settled principles of justiciability and jurisdiction, whether or not their complaints alleged pecuniary loss or monetary injury. The free exercise claims of the parents alleged injury sufficient to give them standing. If, however, the gravamen of the lawsuit were exclusively one of establishment, it might seem illogical to confer standing upon a parent who -- though he is concededly in the best position to assert a free exercise claim -- suffers no financial injury, by reason of being a parent, different from that of the ordinary taxpayer, whose standing may be open to question. See Sutherland, Establishment According to Engel, 76 Harv.L.Rev. 25, 41-43 (1962). I would suggest several answers to this conceptual difficulty. First, the parent is surely the person most directly and immediately concerned about and affected by the challenged establishment, and to deny him standing either in his own right or on behalf of his child might effectively foreclose judicial inquiry into serious breaches of the prohibitions of the First Amendment -- even though no special monetary injury could be shown. See Schempp v. School District of Abington Township, 177 F.Supp. 398, 407; Kurland, The Regents' Prayer Case: ""Full of Sound and Fury, Signifying . . . ,"" 1962 Supreme Court Review 1, 22. Second, the complaint in every case thus far challenging an establishment has set forth at least a colorable claim of infringement of free exercise. When the complaint includes both claims, and neither is frivolous, it would surely be overtechnical to say that a parent who does not detail the monetary cost of the exercises to him may ask the court to pass only upon the free exercise claim, however logically the two may be related.

It seems to me that even a cursory examination of the complaints in these two cases and the opinions below discloses that these parents have very real grievances against the respective school authorities which cannot be resolved short of constitutional adjudication.

Mann's continued use of the Bible for what he regarded as nonsectarian exercises represented his response to these cross-pressures.

State courts appear to have been increasingly influenced in sustaining devotional practices by the availability of an excuse or exemption for dissenting students.

It is necessary to have some general exercise after the children come in from the playground to prepare them for their work. You need some general exercise to quiet them down. When asked again if the purpose were not at least partially religious, the teacher replied, ""[i]t was religious to the children that are religious, and to the others it was not."" 69 Kan. at 57-58, 76 P. at 423.

IV; Harner, Religion's Place in General Education (1949). Educators are by no means unanimous, however, on this question. See Boles, The Bible, Religion, and the Public Schools (1961), 223-224. And let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that National morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle. 35 Writings of George Washington (Fitzpatrick ed.1940), 229. 2 Writings of Thomas Jefferson (Memorial ed.1903), 204, is relevant here.

The history, as it bears particularly upon the role of sectarian differences concerning Biblical texts and interpretation, has been summarized in Tudor v.

The Bible, in its entirety, is a sectarian book as to the Jew and every believer in any religion other than the Christian religion, and, as to those who are heretical or who hold beliefs that are not regarded as orthodox . . . , its use in the schools necessarily results in sectarian instruction. There are many sects of Christians, and their differences grow out of their differing constructions of various parts of the Scriptures -- the different conclusions drawn as to the effect of the same words. The portions of Scripture which form the basis of these sectarian differences cannot be thoughtfully and intelligently read without impressing the reader, favorably or otherwise, with reference to the doctrines supposed to be derived from them.

See Torcaso v. You ask me what Bible I take as the standard of my faith -- the Hebrew, the Samaritan, the old English translation, or what? I answer, the Bible containing the sermon upon the mount -- any Bible that I can read and understand. . . . I take any one of them for my standard of faith. If Socinus or Priestley had made a fair translation of the Bible, I would have taken that, but without their comments. John Quincy Adams to John Adams, Jan. 3, 1817, in Koch and Peden, Selected Writings of John and John Quincy Adams (1946), 292. In Judaism, the Bible is not read, it is studied. There is no special virtue attached to a mere reading of the Bible; there is a great deal of virtue attached to a study of the Bible. See Boles, The Bible, Religion, and the Public Schools (1961), 208-218; Choper, Religion in the Public Schools: A Proposed Constitutional Standard, 47 Minn.L.Rev. 39, 372-375 (1963). an observance of this sort is likely to deteriorate quickly into an empty formality with little, if any, spiritual significance. Prescribed forms of this sort, as many colleges have concluded after years of compulsory chapel attendance, can actually work against the inculcation of vital religion. Prayers in Public Schools Opposed, 69 Christian Century, Jan. 9, 1952, p. 35. See Cahn, On Government and Prayer, 37 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 981, 993-994 (1962). Agitation for removal of religious practices in public schools is not prompted or supported entirely by Jews, humanists, and atheists. At both local and national levels, many Christian leaders, concerned both for civil rights of minorities and for adequate religious education, are opposed to religious exercises in public schools. . . . Many persons, both Jews and Christians, believe that prayer and Bible reading are too sacred to be permitted in public schools, in spite of their possible moral value. Smith, The Religious Crisis In Our Schools, 128 The Episcopalian, May 1963, pp. 12-13. See, e.g., for other recent statements on this question, Editorial, Amending the Amendment, 108 America, May 25, 1963, p. 736; Sissel, A Christian View: Behind the Fight Against School Prayer, 27 Look, June 18, 1963, p.25. It should be unnecessary to demonstrate that the Lord's Prayer, more clearly than the Regents' Prayer involved in Engel v. Vitale, is an essentially Christian supplication. See, e.g., Scott, The Lord's Prayer: Its Character, Purpose, and Interpretation (1951), 55; Buttrick, So We Believe, So We Pray (1951), 142; Levy, Lord's Prayer, in 7 Universal Jewish Encyclopedia (1948), 19-193. Statement of the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs, in 4 J. Church and State 144 (1962). See Harrison, The Bible, the Constitution and Public Education, 29 Tenn.L.Rev. 363, 397 (1962). The application of statutes and regulations which forbid comment on scriptural passages is further complicated by the view of certain religious groups that reading without comment is either meaningless or actually offensive. Compare Rabbi Grayzel's testimony before the District Court that ""the Bible is misunderstood when it is taken without explanation."" A recent survey of the attitudes of certain teachers disclosed concern that ""refusal to answer pupil questions regarding any curricular activity is not educationally sound,"" and that reading without comment might create in the minds of the pupils the impression that something was ""hidden or wrong."" Boles, The Bible, Religion, and the Public Schools (1961), 235-236. In no other field of learning would we expect a child to draw the full meaning from what he reads without accompanying explanatory comment. But comment by the teacher will inevitably reveal his own personal preferences, and the exhibition of preferences is what we are seeking to eliminate. MacKinnon, Freedom? -- or Toleration?

For a fuller description of this and other attempts to fashion a ""common core"" or nonsectarian exercise, see Engel v. Vitale, 18 Misc.2d 659, 660-662, 191 N.Y.S.2d 453, 459-460. . . . neither true religion nor good education is dependent upon the devotional use of the Bible in the public school program. . . . Apart from the constitutional questions involved, attempts to establish a ""common core"" of religious beliefs to be taught in public schools for the purpose of indoctrination are unrealistic and unwise. Major faith groups have not agreed on a formulation of religious beliefs common to all. Even if they had done so, such a body of religious doctrine would tend to become a substitute for the more demanding commitments of historic faiths. Washington Post, May 25, 1963, § A, p. 1, col. 4.

See the testimony of Edward L. Schempp, the father of the children in the Abington schools and plaintiff appellee in No. We originally objected to our children being exposed to the reading of the King James version of the Bible . . . , and under those conditions, we would have theoretically liked to have had the children excused. But we felt that the penalty of having our children labelled as ""odd balls"" before their teachers and classmates every day in the year was even less satisfactory than the other problem. . . . The children, the classmates of Roger and Donna are very liable to label and lump all particular religious difference or religious objections as atheism, particularly, today the word ""atheism"" is so often tied to atheistic communism, and atheism has very bad connotations in the minds of children and many adults today. [c]hildren forced by conscience to leave the room during such exercises would be placed in a position inferior to that of students adhering to the State-endorsed religion. 25 Cal.Op.Atty.Gen. 316, 319 (1955). Other views on this question, and possible effects of the excusal procedure, are summarized in Rosenfield, Separation of Church and State in the Public Schools, 22 U. of Pitt.L.Rev. 561, 581-585 (1961); Note, Separation of Church and State: Religious Exercises in the Schools, 31 U. of Cinc.L.Rev. 408, 416 (1962); Note, 62 W.Va.L.Rev. 353, 358 (1960). Extensive testimony by behavioral scientists concerning the effect of similar practices upon children's attitudes and behaviors is discussed in Tudor v. Board of Education, 14 N.J. 31, 50-52, 100 A.2d 857, 867-868. See also Choper, Religion in the Public Schools: A Proposed Constitutional Standard, 47 Minn.L.Rev. 329, 344 (1963). There appear to be no reported experiments which bear directly upon the question under consideration. There have, however, been numerous experiments which indicate the susceptibility of school children to peer group pressures, especially where important group norms and values are involved. See, e.g., Berenda, The Influence of the Group on the Judgments of Children (1950), 26-33; Argyle, Social Pressure in Public and Private Situations, 54 J. Abnormal & Social Psych. 172 (1957); cf. Rhine, The Effect of Peer Group Influence Upon Concept-Attitude Development and Change, 51 J. Social Psych. 173 (1960); French, Morrison and Levinger, Coercive Power and Forces Affecting Conformity, 61 J. Abnormal and Social Psych. 93 (1960). For a recent and important experimental study of the susceptibility of students to various factors in the school environment, see Zander, Curtis and Rosenfeld, The Influence of Teachers and Peers on Aspirations of Youth (U.S. Office of Education Cooperative Research Project No. 451, 1961), 24-25, 78-79. It is also apparent that the susceptibility of school children to prestige suggestion and social influence within the school environment varies inversely with the age, grade level, and consequent degree of sophistication of the child, see Pated and Gordon, Some Personal and Situational Determinants of Yielding to Influence, 61 J. Abnormal and Social Psych. 411, 417 (1960). Tudor v. Experimental findings also shed some light upon the probable effectiveness of a provision for excusal when, as is usually the case, the percentage of the class wishing not to participate in the exercises is very small. It has been demonstrated, for example, that the inclination even of adults to depart or dissent overtly from strong group norms varies proportionately with the size of the dissenting group -- that is, inversely with the apparent or perceived strength of the norm itself -- and is markedly slighter in the case of the sole or isolated dissenter. See, e.g., Asch, Studies of Independence and Conformity: I. A Minority of One Against a Unanimous Majority (Psych. Monographs No. 416, 1956), 69-70; Asch, Effects of Group Pressure upon the Modification and Distortion of Judgments, in Cartwright and Zander, Group Dynamics (2d ed.1960), 189-199; Luchins and Luchins, On Conformity With True and False Communications, 42 J.

Essays on the Australian Constitution (Else-Mitchell ed.1961), 15. There has been much difference of opinion throughout American history concerning the advisability of furnishing chaplains at government expense. Compare, e.g., Washington's order regarding chaplains for the Continental Army, July 9, 1776, in 5 Writings of George Washington (Fitzpatrick ed.1932), 244, with Madison's views on a very similar question, letter to Eduard Livingston, July 10, 1822, 9 Writings of James Madison (Hunt ed.1910), 100-103. To us has been entrusted the spiritual and moral guidance of the young men and women in the Armed Services of this country. A chaplain has many duties -- yet first and foremost is that of presenting God to men and women wearing the military uniform. What happens to them while they are in military service has a profound effect on what happens in the community as they resume civilian life. We, as chaplains, must take full cognizance of that fact and dedicate our work to making them finer, spiritually strengthened citizens. Builders of Faith (U.S. Department of Defense 1955), ii. It is interesting to compare in this regard an express provision, Article 140, of the Weimar Constitution: ""Necessary free time shall be accorded to the members of the armed forces for the fulfillment of their religious duties.""

See, e.g., Washington Ethical Society v. Fellowship of Humanity v. It is instructive, in this connection, to examine the complaints in the two cases before us. Neither complaint attacks the challenged practices as ""establishments."" What both allege as the basis for their causes of actions are, rather, violations of religious liberty. 310 U.S. at 303. The Court's statement as to the Establishment Clause in Cantwell was dictum. The case was decided on free exercise grounds. Government may not finance religious groups nor undertake religious instruction nor blend secular and sectarian education nor use secular institutions to force one or some religion on any person. But we find no constitutional requirement which makes it necessary for government to be hostile to religion and to throw its weight against efforts to widen the effective scope of religious influence. This is, beyond all question, a utilization of the tax established and tax supported public school system to aid religious groups to spread their faith. to spread their faith. McCollum v. Board of Education, 333 U.S. 203, 210. McCollum v. The Pennsylvania statute was specifically amended to remove the compulsion upon teachers. Act of December 17, 1959, p. L.1928, 24 Purdon's Pa.Stat.Ann. § 15-1516. Since the Maryland case is here on a demurrer, the issue of whether or not a teacher could be dismissed for refusal to participate seems, among many others, never to have been raised. See, e.g., the description of a plan permitting religious instruction off school property contained in McCollum v. Board of Education, 333 U.S. 203, 224 (separate opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter). McCollum v. The task of separating the secular from the religious in education is one of magnitude, intricacy and delicacy. To lay down a sweeping constitutional doctrine as demanded by complainant and apparently approved by the Court, applicable alike to all school boards of the nation, . . . is to decree a uniform, rigid and, if we are consistent, an unchanging standard for countless school boards representing and serving highly localized groups which not only differ from each other but which themselves from time to time change attitudes. It seems to me that to do so is to allow zeal for our own ideas of what is good in public instruction to induce us to accept the role of a super board of education for every school district in the nation. McCollum v. Board of Education, 333 U.S. 203, 237 (concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Jackson). McCollum v. For example, if the record in the Schempp case contained proof (rather than mere prophecy) that the timing of morning announcements by the school was such as to handicap children who did not want to listen to the Bible reading, or that the excusal provision was so administered as to carry any overtones of social inferiority, then impermissible coercion would clearly exist. MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG, with whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN joins, concurring. As is apparent from the opinions filed today, delineation of the constitutionally permissible relationship between religion and government is a most difficult and sensitive task, calling for the careful exercise of both judicial and public judgment and restraint. The considerations which lead the Court today to interdict the clearly religious practices presented in these cases are to me wholly compelling; I have no doubt as to the propriety of the decision, and therefore join the opinion and judgment of the Court. The singular sensitivity and concern which surround both the legal and practical judgments involved impel me, however, to add a few words in further explication, while at the same time avoiding repetition of the carefully and ably framed examination of history and authority by my Brethren. The First Amendment's guarantees, as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, foreclose not only laws ""respecting an establishment of religion"", but also those ""prohibiting the free exercise thereof."" These two proscriptions are to be read together, and in light of the single end which they are designed to serve. The basic purpose of the religion clause of the First Amendment is to promote and assure the fullest possible scope of religious liberty and tolerance for all, and to nurture the conditions which secure the best hope of attainment of that end. The fullest realization of true religious liberty requires that government neither engage in nor compel religious practices, that it effect no favoritism among sects or between religion and nonreligion, and that it work deterrence of no religious belief. But devotion even to these simply stated objectives presents no easy course, for the unavoidable accommodations necessary to achieve the [p306] maximum enjoyment of each and all of them are often difficult of discernment. There is for me no simple and clear measure which by precise application can readily and invariably demark the permissible from the impermissible. It is said, and I agree, that the attitude of government toward religion must be one of neutrality. But untutored devotion to the concept of neutrality can lead to invocation or approval of results which partake not simply of that noninterference and noninvolvement with the religious which the Constitution commands, but of a brooding and pervasive devotion to the secular and a passive, or even active, hostility to the religious. Such results are not only not compelled by the Constitution, but, it seems to me, are prohibited by it. Neither government nor this Court can or should ignore the significance of the fact that a vast portion of our people believe in and worship God, and that many of our legal, political and personal values derive historically from religious teachings. Government must inevitably take cognizance of the existence of religion and, indeed, under certain circumstances, the First Amendment may require that it do so. And it seems clear to me from the opinions in the present and past cases that the Court would recognize the propriety of providing military chaplains and of the teaching about religion, as distinguished from the teaching of religion, in the public schools. The examples could readily be multiplied, for both the required and the permissible accommodations between state and church frame the relation as one free of hostility or favor and productive of religious and political harmony, but without undue involvement of one in the concerns or practices of the other. To be sure, the judgment in each case is a delicate one, but it must be made if we are to do loyal service as judges to the ultimate First Amendment objective of religious liberty. The practices here involved do not fall within any sensible or acceptable concept of compelled or permitted accommodation, and involve the state so significantly and directly in the realm of the sectarian as to give rise to those very divisive influences and inhibitions of freedom which both religion clauses of the First Amendment preclude. The state has ordained and has utilized its facilities to engage in unmistakably religious exercises -- the devotional reading and recitation of the Holy Bible -- in a manner having substantial and significant import and impact. That it has selected, rather than written, a particular devotional liturgy seems to me without constitutional import. The pervasive religiosity and direct governmental involvement inhering in the prescription of prayer and Bible reading in the public schools, during and as part of the curricular day, involving young impressionable children whose school attendance is statutorily compelled, and utilizing the prestige, power, and influence of school administration, staff, and authority, cannot realistically be termed simply accommodation, and must fall within the interdiction of the First Amendment. I find nothing in the opinion of the Court which says more than this. And, of course, today's decision does not mean that all incidents of government which import of the religious are therefore, and without more, banned by the strictures of the Establishment Clause. As the Court declared only last Term in Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 435, n. There is, of course, nothing in the decision reached here that is inconsistent with the fact that school children and others are officially encouraged to express love for our country by reciting historical documents such as the Declaration of Independence which contain references to the Deity or by singing officially espoused anthems which include the composer's professions of faith in a Supreme Being, or [p308] with the fact that there are many manifestations in our public life of belief in God. Such patriotic or ceremonial occasions bear no true resemblance to the unquestioned religious exercise that the State . . . has sponsored in this instance. The First Amendment does not prohibit practices which, by any realistic measure, create none of the dangers which it is designed to prevent and which do not so directly or substantially involve the state in religious exercises or in the favoring of religion as to have meaningful and practical impact. It is, of course, true that great consequences can grow from small beginnings, but the measure of constitutional adjudication is the ability and willingness to distinguish between real threat and mere shadow. MR. JUSTICE STEWART, dissenting. I think the records in the two cases before us are so fundamentally deficient as to make impossible an informed or responsible determination of the constitutional issues presented. Specifically, I cannot agree that, on these records, we can say that the Establishment Clause has necessarily been violated. [n1] But I think there exist serious questions under both that provision and the Free Exercise Clause -- insofar as each is imbedded in the Fourteenth Amendment -- which require the remand of these cases for the taking of additional evidence. The First Amendment declares that ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. . . ."" It is, I [p309] think, a fallacious oversimplification to regard these two provisions as establishing a single constitutional standard of ""separation of church and state,"" which can be mechanically applied in every case to delineate the required boundaries between government and religion. We err in the first place if we do not recognize, as a matter of history and as a matter of the imperatives of our free society, that religion and government must necessarily interact in countless ways. Secondly, the fact is that, while in many contexts the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause fully complement each other, there are areas in which a doctrinaire reading of the Establishment Clause leads to irreconcilable conflict with the Free Exercise Clause. A single obvious example should suffice to make the point. Spending federal funds to employ chaplains for the armed forces might be said to violate the Establishment Clause. Yet a lonely soldier stationed at some faraway outpost could surely complain that a government which did not provide him the opportunity for pastoral guidance was affirmatively prohibiting the free exercise of his religion. And such examples could readily be multiplied. The short of the matter is simply that the two relevant clauses of the First Amendment cannot accurately be reflected in a sterile metaphor which by its very nature may distort, rather than illumine, the problems involved in a particular case. Cf. Sherbert v. Verner, post, p. 398. Cf. Sherbert v. As a matter of history, the First Amendment was adopted solely as a limitation upon the newly created National Government. The events leading to its adoption strongly suggest that the Establishment Clause was primarily an attempt to insure that Congress not only would be powerless to establish a national church, but [p310] would also be unable to interfere with existing state establishments. See McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 440-441. Each State was left free to go its own way and pursue its own policy with respect to religion. Thus, Virginia from the beginning pursued a policy of disestablishmentarianism. Massachusetts, by contrast, had an established church until well into the nineteenth century. See McGowan v. So matters stood until the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, or, more accurately, until this Court's decision in Cantwell v. Connecticut, in 1940. 310 U.S. 296. Cantwell v. The First Amendment declares that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. The Fourteenth Amendment has rendered the legislatures of the states as incompetent as Congress to enact such laws. I accept without question that the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment against impairment by the States embraces in full the right of free exercise of religion protected by the First Amendment, and I yield to no one in my conception of the breadth of that freedom. See Braunfeld v. Brown, 366 U.S. 599, 616 (dissenting opinion). I accept too the proposition that the Fourteenth Amendment has somehow absorbed the Establishment Clause, although it is not without irony that a constitutional provision evidently designed to leave the States free to go their own way should now have become a restriction upon their autonomy. But I cannot agree with what seems to me the insensitive definition of the Establishment Clause contained in the Court's opinion, nor with the different, but, I think, equally mechanistic definitions contained in the separate opinions which have been filed. See Braunfeld v. Since the Cantwell pronouncement in 1940, this Court has only twice held invalid state laws on the ground that they were laws ""respecting an establishment of religion"" in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. McCollum v. Board of Education, 333 U.S. 203; Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421. On the other hand, the Court has upheld against such a challenge laws establishing Sunday as a compulsory day of rest, McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, and a law authorizing reimbursement from public funds for the transportation of parochial school pupils. Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U.S. 1. McCollum v. Everson v. Unlike other First Amendment guarantees, there is an inherent limitation upon the applicability of the Establishment Clause's ban on state support to religion. That limitation was succinctly put in Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U.S. 1, 18: ""State power is no more to be used so as to handicap religions than it is to favor them."" [n3] And in a later case, this Court recognized that the limitation was one which was itself compelled by the free exercise guarantee. Everson v. To hold that a state cannot, consistently with the First and Fourteenth Amendments, utilize its public school system to aid any or all religious faiths or sects in the dissemination of their doctrines and ideals does not . . . manifest a governmental hostility to religion or religious teachings. A manifestation of such hostility would be at war with our national tradition as embodied in the First Amendment's guaranty of the free [p312] exercise of religion. McCollum v. That the central value embodied in the First Amendment -- and, more particularly, in the guarantee of ""liberty"" contained in the Fourteenth -- is the safeguarding of an individual's right to free exercise of his religion has been consistently recognized. Thus, in the case of Hamilton v. Regents, 293 U.S. . . . the religious liberty protected by the First Amendment against invasion by the nation [which] is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment against invasion by the states. (Emphasis added.) And in Cantwell v. Cantwell v. On the one hand, it forestalls compulsion by law of the acceptance of any creed or the practice of any form of worship. Freedom of conscience and freedom to adhere to such religious organization or form of worship as the individual may choose cannot be restricted by law. On the other hand, it safeguards the free exercise of the chosen form of religion. It is this concept of constitutional protection embodied in our decisions which makes the cases before us such difficult ones for me. For there is involved in these cases a substantial free exercise claim on the part of those who affirmatively desire to have their children's school day open with the reading of passages from the Bible. It has become accepted that the decision in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, upholding the right of parents to send their children to nonpublic schools, was ultimately based upon the recognition of the validity of the free exercise claim involved in that situation. It might be argued here that parents who wanted their children to be exposed to religious influences in school could, under Pierce, send their children to private or parochial [p313] schools. But the consideration which renders this contention too facile to be determinative has already been recognized by the Court: ""Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion are available to all, not merely to those who can pay their own way."" Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105, 111. Pierce v. Murdock v. It might also be argued that parents who want their children exposed to religious influences can adequately fulfill that wish off school property and outside school time. With all its surface persuasiveness, however, this argument seriously misconceives the basic constitutional justification for permitting the exercises at issue in these cases. For a compulsory state educational system so structures a child's life that, if religious exercises are held to be an impermissible activity in schools, religion is placed at an artificial and state-created disadvantage. Viewed in this light, permission of such exercises for those who want them is necessary if the schools are truly to be neutral in the matter of religion. And a refusal to permit religious exercises thus is seen not as the realization of state neutrality, but rather as the establishment of a religion of secularism, or, at the least, as government support of the beliefs of those who think that religious exercises should be conducted only in private. What seems to me to be of paramount importance, then, is recognition of the fact that the claim advanced here in favor of Bible reading is sufficiently substantial to make simple reference to the constitutional phrase ""establishment of religion"" as inadequate an analysis of the cases before us as the ritualistic invocation of the nonconstitutional phrase ""separation of church and state."" What these cases compel, rather, is an analysis of just what the ""neutrality"" is which is required by the interplay of the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment, as imbedded in the Fourteenth. Our decisions make clear that there is no constitutional bar to the use of government property for religious purposes. On the contrary, this Court has consistently held that the discriminatory barring of religious groups from public property is itself a violation of First and Fourteenth Amendment guarantees. Fowler v. Rhode Island, 345 U.S. 67; Niemotko v. Maryland, 340 U.S. 268. A different standard has been applied to public school property, because of the coercive effect which the use by religious sects of a compulsory school system would necessarily have upon the children involved. McCollum v. Board of Education, 333 U.S. 203. But insofar as the McCollum decision rests on the Establishment, rather than the Free Exercise, Clause, it is clear that its effect is limited to religious instruction -- to government support of proselytizing activities of religious sects by throwing the weight of secular authority behind the dissemination of religious tenets. Fowler v. Niemotko v. McCollum v. The dangers both to government and to religion inherent in official support of instruction in the tenets of various religious sects are absent in the present cases, which involve only a reading from the Bible unaccompanied by comments which might otherwise constitute instruction. Indeed, since, from all that appears in either record, any teacher who does not wish to do so is free not to participate, [n5] it cannot even be contended that some [p315] infinitesimal part of the salaries paid by the State are made contingent upon the performance of a religious function. In the absence of evidence that the legislature or school board intended to prohibit local schools from substituting a different set of readings where parents requested such a change, we should not assume that the provisions before us -- as actually administered -- may not be construed simply as authorizing religious exercises, nor that the designations may not be treated simply as indications of the promulgating body's view as to the community's preference. We are under a duty to interpret these provisions so as to render them constitutional if reasonably possible. Compare Two Guys v. McGinley, 366 U.S. 582, 592-595; Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U.S. 1, 4, and n. 2. In the Schempp case there is evidence which indicates that variations were, in fact, permitted by the very school there involved, and that further variations were not introduced only because of the absence of requests from parents. And in the Murray case, the Baltimore rule itself contains a provision permitting another version of the Bible to be substituted for the King James version. Compare Two Guys v. Everson v. If the provisions are not so construed, I think that their validity under the Establishment Clause would be extremely doubtful, because of the designation of a particular religious book and a denominational prayer. But since, even if the provisions are construed as I believe they must be, I think that the cases before us must be remanded for further evidence on other issues -- thus affording the plaintiffs an opportunity to prove that local variations are not, in fact, permitted -- I shall for the balance [p316] of this dissenting opinion treat the provisions before us as making the variety and content of the exercises, as well as a choice as to their implementation, matters which ultimately reflect the consensus of each local school community. In the absence of coercion upon those who do not wish to participate -- because they hold less strong beliefs, other beliefs, or no beliefs at all -- such provisions cannot, in my view, be held to represent the type of support of religion barred by the Establishment Clause. For the only support which such rules provide for religion is the withholding of state hostility -- a simple acknowledgment on the part of secular authorities that the Constitution does not require extirpation of all expression of religious belief. I have said that these provisions authorizing religious exercises are properly to be regarded as measures making possible the free exercise of religion. But it is important to stress that, strictly speaking, what is at issue here is a privilege, rather than a right. In other words, the question presented is not whether exercises such as those at issue here are constitutionally compelled, but rather whether they are constitutionally invalid. And that issue, in my view, turns on the question of coercion. It is clear that the dangers of coercion involved in the holding of religious exercises in a school room differ qualitatively from those presented by the use of similar exercises or affirmations in ceremonies attended by adults. Even as to children, however, the duty laid upon government in connection with religious exercises in the public schools is that of refraining from so structuring the school environment as to put any kind of pressure on a child to participate in those exercises; it is not that of providing an atmosphere in which children are kept scrupulously insulated from any awareness that some of their fellows [p317] may want to open the school day with prayer, or of the fact that there exist in our pluralistic society differences of religious belief. These are not, it must be stressed, cases like Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, in which this Court held that, in the sphere of public education, the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection of the laws required that race not be treated as a relevant factor. A segregated school system is not invalid because its operation is coercive; it is invalid simply because our Constitution presupposes that men are created equal, and that, therefore, racial differences cannot provide a valid basis for governmental action. Accommodation of religious differences on the part of the State, however, is not only permitted but required by that same Constitution. Brown v. The governmental neutrality which the First and Fourteenth Amendments require in the cases before us, in other words, is the extension of evenhanded treatment to all who believe, doubt, or disbelieve -- a refusal on the part of the State to weight the scales of private choice. In these cases, therefore, what is involved is not state action based on impermissible categories, but rather an attempt by the State to accommodate those differences which the existence in our society of a variety of religious beliefs makes inevitable. The Constitution requires that such efforts be struck down only if they are proven to entail the use of the secular authority of government to coerce a preference among such beliefs. It may well be, as has been argued to us, that even the supposed benefits to be derived from noncoercive religious exercises in public schools are incommensurate with the administrative problems which they would create. The choice involved, however, is one for each local community and its school board, and not for this Court. For, as I have said, religious exercises are not constitutionally invalid if they simply reflect differences which exist in the [p318] society from which the school draws its pupils. They become constitutionally invalid only if their administration places the sanction of secular authority behind one or more particular religious or irreligious beliefs. To be specific, it seems to me clear that certain types of exercises would present situations in which no possibility of coercion on the part of secular officials could be claimed to exist. Thus, if such exercises were held either before or after the official school day, or if the school schedule were such that participation were merely one among a number of desirable alternatives, [n6] it could hardly be contended that the exercises did anything more than to provide an opportunity for the voluntary expression of religious belief. On the other hand, a law which provided for religious exercises during the school day and which contained no excusal provision would obviously be unconstitutionally coercive upon those who did not wish to participate. And even under a law containing an excusal provision, if the exercises were held during the school day, and no equally desirable alternative were provided by the school authorities, the likelihood that children might be under at least some psychological compulsion to participate would be great. In a case such as the latter, however, I think we would err if we assumed such coercion in the absence of any evidence. Viewed in this light, it seems to me clear that the records in both of the cases before us are wholly inadequate to support an informed or responsible decision. Both cases involve provisions which explicitly permit any student who wishes, to be excused from participation in the exercises. There is no evidence in either case as to whether there would exist any coercion of any kind upon a student who did not want to participate. No evidence at all was adduced in the Murray case, because it was decided upon a demurrer. All that we have in that case, therefore, is the conclusory language of a pleading. While such conclusory allegations are acceptable for procedural purposes, I think that the nature of the constitutional problem involved here clearly demands that no decision be made except upon evidence. In the Schempp case, the record shows no more than a subjective prophecy by a parent of what he thought would happen if a request were made to be excused from participation in the exercises under the amended statute. No such request was ever made, and there is no evidence whatever as to what might or would actually happen, nor of what administrative arrangements the school actually might or could make to free from pressure of any kind those who do not want to participate in the exercises. There were no District Court findings on this issue, since the case under the amended statute was decided exclusively on Establishment Clause grounds. 201 F.Supp. What our Constitution indispensably protects is the freedom of each of us, be he Jew or Agnostic, Christian or [p320] Atheist, Buddhist or Freethinker, to believe or disbelieve, to worship or not worship, to pray or keep silent, according to his own conscience, uncoerced and unrestrained by government. It is conceivable that these school boards, or even all school boards, might eventually find it impossible to administer a system of religious exercises during school hours in such a way as to meet this constitutional standard -- in such a way as completely to free from any kind of official coercion those who do not affirmatively want to participate. [n8] But I think we must not assume that school boards so lack the qualities of inventiveness and good will as to make impossible the achievement of that goal. I would remand both cases for further hearings."

Miley Cyrus didn’t leave the United States to become a British citizen. Sylvester Stallone didn’t say that Barack Obama is a “closet homosexual.”Unless you’re searching on Facebook, that is.Over the past few months, searching for celebrities’ names on Facebook has yielded fake news stories pretty high up in results. That’s despite the fact that several of these articles had already been debunked .A fabricated story about Tina Turner attacking Trump opponents was published on several fake news sites a week and a half ago, amassing more than 8,000 Facebook engagements as of publication, according to BuzzSumo.Turns out the story wasn’t much of a story at all; it only included a photo and a falsified headline.But according to Alex Kaplan of Media Matters for America, a left-wing media monitoring group, at least nine other fake celebrity stories have achieved similar virality on the platform — even after they’d been debunked by Facebook’s fact-checking partners.Targets include Harrison Ford , Jim Carrey , Malia Obama , Katy Perry and Bruce Willis. While we're at it, that trailer for a ""Friends"" movie isn't real, either.At the same time, it seems that not everyone receives an “Articles” module in Facebook search. When Poynter attempted to recreate its prior search for Bacon, it surfaced “People Are Saying” and “Posts from Friends” sections — no links. A Facebook spokesperson told Poynter in an email that the feature’s appearance is personalized for each user and the specific search term.The Bacon story, which was published on several fake sites last month, received more than 3,000 Facebook engagements as of publication, according to BuzzSumo. It also rose to the top of Facebook search results for the actor’s name, despite having previously been debunked by Factcheck.org.Kaplan, a Media Matters researcher, first flagged the Bacon story and several others on Twitter. It cites fake quotes from a fabricated interview with ABC’s “This Week” that express support for Trump’s presidency. Bacon — who contributed to Hillary Clinton’s campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential election — later tweeted to say that he isn’t, in fact, a Trump supporter.And just to be clear to those of you read or believed this original blog. There’s nothing about this presidents policy’s that I agree with. And nothing about his character that I admire. https://t.co/dq10K6ZMh9— Kevin Bacon (@kevinbacon) December 4, 2017After debunking the story, Factcheck.org submitted the link to Facebook for flagging, director Eugene Kiely told Poynter in an email. Under the social media company’s partnership with fact-checkers — of which Factcheck.org is a part (and the International Fact-Checking Network helps facilitate ) — fake stories are algorithmically demoted in the news feed and given more context in a related articles section after being debunked by at least two fact-checkers.However, another spokesperson for Facebook told Poynter in an email that it’s still possible for fake news stories to show up in search even after they’ve been labeled false by fact-checkers, as long as they don't violate the company's community standards . That explains why fake celebrity stories that have already been debunked — three of the nine Media Matters identified, by Poynter’s count — often surface high up in search results.That’s different from search engines like Google, which take sources’ reputability more heavily into account when ranking results. Facebook recently announced major changes to the news feed to both decrease the reach of brands in the news feed and solicit users’ input on which publishers they trust most. It’s unclear how that will impact the distribution of fake news on the platform — especially in search — but for now, engagement is still the name of the game.And to Michael Lewittes, that’s a problem.“Obviously it’s not working — that’s the blunt, honest truth,” said the founder of Gossip Cop , a celebrity fact-checking site. “There’s either something wrong in the mechanism or the commitment to it, but clearly it’s not working because the inaccurate and false stories are surfacing to the top irrespective of the hard work of the fact-checkers.”Why so many fabricated celebrity stories? It’s simple: They tend to be more salacious and do better on social media — and fact checks, which could potentially limit their reach, can’t keep up.“Sometimes we see our story three or four rungs below the fake story (in search),” Lewittes said. “And ideally it would be nice if everyone read the first, second, third and fourth — but that doesn’t work.Plus, they’re a safer bet for fake news writers.Following the 2016 election, increasing pressure on the platforms to do something about political misinformation led to a few changes, notably Facebook and Google going after some of the advertisers that peddle fake news (This move didn’t always work in 2017). Lewittes said that since celebrities are more reluctant to publicly correct fake stories because they could inadvertently give them more attention, it’s often harder to correct them than political hoaxes.“Having done this for 25 years, it takes time to fact-check,” he said. “The manufactured story could take maybe 20 minutes to write.”Daniel Harrison, a technology communications manager at Facebook, told Poynter in an email that the platform takes into account fake news and other quality signals from the news feed when determining search results. He said the company is working on new ways to use those signals to improve search.But until Facebook seriously alters its algorithm to include site authority as a determining ranking measure, Lewittes said users and journalists alike will keep finding misinformation in search.“Sometimes the most inaccurate stories become the most visual ones,” he said. “Either you weigh what the fact-checkers are saying more, or you don’t pretend that you’re really trying to eradicate this stuff.”"	
https://www.factcheck.org/2018/01/out-with-the-old-dixie/	Out With the ‘Old Dixie’	false	['Florida', 'fake news', 'highways', 'Barack Obama', 'Donald Trump']	http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/	http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/lifestyles/take-look-back-the-road-that-created-florida/GW1RlpS1FYRzlMUg1Wz1EJ/	2018/01/24	We take a look back at the road that created Florida100 years ago, Dixie Highway began winding through Palm Beach County, spawning today’s tourism industry.By Barbara Marshall - Palm Beach Post Staff Writer...In 192?, Boca Raton erected a camel over Dixie Highway to attract the shriners driving to their national convention in Miami.Posted: 1:13 p.m. Wednesday, January 13, 2016Twenty years after Henry Flagler brought his railroad and private rail cars full of swells to Florida in the 1890s, Henry Ford’s Model T and Carl Fisher’s Dixie Highway brought everyone else.Beginning in 1915 and for decades afterward, “The Dixie” was the artery that delivered the tourists who became residents, transforming America’s last frontier into a balmy, palmy middle-class paradise.In towns such as West Palm Beach, Dixie was the main drag where courthouses and businesses were built. Dixie spawned theme motels, juice stands and wacky roadside attractions.They’re almost all gone in 21st century Florida, but stretches of Dixie — truncated, relocated and sometimes renamed — remain.In the highway’s 100th birthday year, we’re still driving Dixie, the road that created Florida.A rough, rutted roadInteractive: Then and now photos of Dixie HighwayFor intrepid tourists and adventurers at the dawn of the Automobile Age, a trip south on “The Dixie” was a grueling, often dangerous journey.It could take 10 days to two weeks to drive on a Tin Lizzie’s narrow tires from Chicago to Miami, down the Deep South’s dirt roads and Florida’s lonely sand tracks.Coming into Palm Beach County, Dixie followed the dry ridge that Flagler’s railroad crews had surveyed two decades earlier.“The FEC had taken the high ground, so basically they had whatever was left,” said Lake Park historian L.J. Parker. “When they came to a lake or a sinkhole, they moved the road to the other side of the tracks.”Today, the road is still called Dixie Highway in downtown West Palm Beach, but farther north the city’s Evergreen and Poinsettia avenues also follow the century-old route.After U.S. 1 was built in the 1920s, the highway became known as Old Dixie in Lake Park and Delray Beach. Alternate A1A through Palm Beach Gardens follows Dixie’s old track. In Riviera Beach, Dixie was recently renamed President Barack Obama Highway.Its location sometimes shifted. In Boca Raton, today’s Dixie is on the east side of the tracks, but the road’s original route is on the west side, now known as Southwest First Avenue.Dixie Highway, argues historian Tammy Ingram, modernized the South by providing its first good farm-to-market roads while simultaneously creating the dream of a winter Florida vacation.“Auto tourism opened up Florida to middle class tourism. You didn’t need a train depot anymore,” said Ingram, author of “ Dixie Highway: Road Building and the Making of the Modern South ” and a history professor at the University of Charleston.Credit goes to Carl Fisher, the founder of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and an early automobile enthusiast. He helped form the Dixie Highway Association in 1914 to create a reliable route to remote and undeveloped Florida.His idea was to cobble together the country’s existing north-south roads and improve them, creating an interstate highway. (He’d done the same thing earlier with his transcontinental Lincoln Highway, connecting New York to San Francisco.) His genius was persuading states and cities to tax themselves into paying for improving those existing roads.Unlike Flagler, who used his personal fortune to build his railroad, Fisher didn’t spend a dime on road construction.‘Not a trip for faint of heart’At first, Dixie was hardly worthy of the name “highway.” Much of it was a rutted sand track through Florida’s piney woods and coastal scrub. Nevertheless, it still funneled tourists and new residents into the state, which ultimately resulted in real estate sales.Which was Fisher’s idea from the start.He wanted a way to get Midwesterners down to his latest project: a mangrove swamp he was busy transforming into Miami Beach.When it officially opened in the fall of 1915, the road wandered south via two meandering, gerrymandered routes. The eastern route started in Detroit then entered Florida at Jacksonville before following the Atlantic coast. The western route left Chicago, connecting Tallahassee with Orlando then continued down the peninsula’s west coast.Eventually, the combined Dixie Highway routes stretched 5,786 miles across 10 states from the Canadian border at Sault Sainte Marie in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula to Miami on Biscayne Bay.“Before that, you had to find your own way down without maps or road signs,” said Susan Gillis, curator at the Boca Raton Historical Society, which is sponsoring a lecture on the history of Dixie Highway later this month.In 1916, a Palm Beach Post article encouraged locals to welcome a 500-car cavalcade that was to start in Cincinnati in October and run “the entire length of the Dixie Highway” through West Palm Beach ending in Miami.“It was very treacherous, but that was part of the appeal,” said Ingram. “It was not a trip for the faint of heart. You left early and timed it so you were hitting major towns to eat lunch, get gas, have a place to stay overnight. You carried supplies including extra tires and gas. Wealthy people would have a driver and mechanic go with them.”Florida’s torrential downpours were big trouble for those early motorists.Yet, thousands came and stayed, starting Florida’s 1920s land boom.By 1920, Motor Travel magazine wrote that Florida “no longer lay beyond arduous and impassable sands … just around the corner from Stygian cypress swamps …”But many of those who followed Dixie to the boom did a U-turn during the bust that began in 1926.By May of 1928, Boca Raton was so desperate for tourists it erected a painted plywood camel over the road to attract Shriners headed to a national convention in Miami. A sign advertised that its new town hall (now the city’s history museum) had restrooms.A month later during a Miami Elks convention, said Gillis, the city added antlers to transform the camel into an elk.Today, most of what remains of Dixie’s original route through Palm Beach is Old Dixie, a workingman’s road lined with thrift shops and car repair places.But a tiny abandoned stretch of road in North Palm Beach offers a glimpse of how the road once looked.Old Dixie dead-ends at the south bank of the C-17 canal/Earman River. The old roadbed once led to a bridge that burned in 1933. Shading the cracked roadbed is a line of the Australian pines once planted along Dixie as a windbreak.It’s a lonely forgotten spot. Four wood storks stood on the bank on a recent afternoon.“Time kind of passed her by,” said Gillis of the road that created Florida.DIXIE HIGHWAY’S WINDING PATHNorth county:In 1915, Dixie Highway ran through what is now Jonathan Dickinson State Park and into today’s Jupiter Hills Club, which removed the road to build a golf course.Today, you can pick up N. Old Dixie Highway at County Line Road, bearing right onto Alternate A1A/ State Road 811 and over the Intracoastal Waterway bridge. On the other side of the bridge, another section of Old Dixie begins west of the railroad and ends south of Jupiter Lakes Blvd. This is the road’s original path through northern Palm Beach County. Pavement remnants can be seen west of the tracks.Backtrack and return to Alternate A1A/SR 811 and head south through Palm Beach Gardens. After crossing the C-17 Canal/Earman River into North Palm Beach, turn right on Richard Road then right onto Old Dixie/95th Court. On your right, you’ll see a short remaining line of the old Australian pine windbreaks that were planted along Dixie before coming to a dead end at the canal. This is the site of a wooden Dixie Highway bridge that burned in 1933. After the fire, Dixie was rebuilt on the east side of the tracks where Alternate A1A/SR 811 is today.Return to Old Dixie and head south. Until the road was widened in the 1980s, an arch spanned Old Dixie at Watertower Road at the entrance to Kelsey City, now called Lake Park.Continue south through Riviera Beach, where Dixie has been renamed President Barack Obama Highway.Central county:In West Palm Beach, the road becomes Greenwood Avenue, still running on the west side of the tracks. At 36th Street, turn left then right onto Poinsettia Avenue/N. Flagler Drive. Continue south through West Palm Beach and Lake Worth on Dixie Highway/U.S. 1.South county:In south Boynton Beach past Woolbright Road, veer right onto Old Dixie and head south into Delray Beach, where the road runs along the railroad’s east side. Merge with Federal Highway/Fifth Avenue and continue south.Turn right on Southeast 10th Street, then left onto Dixie Highway/FL 811 before the railroad tracks. This road becomes Old Dixie Highway/Dixie Highway at Yamato Road in Boca Raton and leads past the 1930 Boca Raton Train Depot and out of Palm Beach County.To see a short remnant of Dixie’s original path through Boca Raton, turn right at Palmetto Park Road, then take the first turn right or left onto Southwest First Avenue on the west side of the tracks.Source: Historical Society of Palm Beach CountyTHE HISTORY OF DIXIEHistorian Amy An will present a lecture on Dixie Highway’s centennial Wednesday at 7 p.m., at the Boca Raton History Museum, 71 N.

https://www.factcheck.org/2018/01/oprahs-2013-quote-racism-context/	Oprah’s 2013 Quote on Racism, in Context	false	['National', 'presidential campaigns', 'Oprah Winfrey']	https://www.washingtonpost.com/	https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/talk-of-oprah-running-for-president-captivates-democrats/2018/01/08/2498180c-f4a5-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html?tid=a_mcntx&utm_term=.d58a4a334d4c	2018/01/19	"From Hollywood to Iowa, a sudden wave of enthusiasm for Oprah Winfrey as a potential presidential candidate swept through the Democratic Party on Monday, beginning as a social-media sensation after her rousing remarks at Sunday night's Golden Globes ceremony and escalating nationally as party officials and activists earnestly considered the possibility. The calls for Winfrey, a cultural icon and friend of former president Barack Obama's, to look hard at entering the 2020 race against President Trump revealed a longing among Democrats for a global celebrity of their own who could emerge as their standard-bearer and his foil. The clamor also exposed how the crowded class of Democrats mulling over bids for the White House so far lacks a front-runner or someone who could easily unite the party's key coalitions of women, minorities and working-class voters. ""Lord, we need passion and excitement,"" said state Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter, a prominent Demo­crat in South Carolina, one of the early-voting states in the race for the nomination. ""I know it's conjecture right now, but I'd ask her to give it serious consideration. If anybody could bring us together, it's her."" Winfrey's inner circle did little Monday to tamp down the frenzy. Her spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment, but several people close to Winfrey said she was keeping tabs on the news coverage and appreciated the response. ""She's overwhelmed by the groundswell of support, the absolute avalanche of hashtags and phone calls about running for president,"" said Richard Sher, a friend and former broadcasting partner in Baltimore who spoke with Winfrey by phone Monday. Sher added: ""If she set out to do it, she'd win. But at this point it's other people, not her, that's talking about it. She's just taking it all in and happy that what she had to say struck such a chord around the country."" Stedman Graham, Winfrey's longtime partner who joined her at the Globes ceremony, whipped up speculation Sunday evening when he told a Los Angeles Times reporter that ""it's up to the people"" and said Winfrey ""would absolutely do it,"" although he did not specify what she would do. There were no signs, however, that Winfrey has done anything to formally prepare for a 2020 campaign or has spoken with Democratic operatives. Instead, her speech at the Globes, where she received the Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement, was widely seen by Democrats as a visceral moment on the national stage that catapulted her into the discussion, regardless of whether she wanted to be part of it or eventually inches closer to running. That view was felt not only among Democrats watching the Golden Globes and cheering her on social media but among Hollywood players who immediately latched onto Winfrey's speech, putting her in the position of being courted by grass-roots Democrats and Academy Award winners. Winfrey, tracing her path from her Midwestern roots to the pinnacle of the American media, drew ovations Sunday for her message of hope amid despair, generating praise from those working to counter sexual misconduct as well as, notably, from Democrats troubled by the Trump presidency. A speech without overt political notes became a political rallying cry in an instant. Winfrey spoke with an impassioned voice of a ""culture broken by brutally powerful men"" and how ""for too long, women have not been heard or believed if they dared to speak their truth to the power of those men. But their time is up. Their time is up. Their time is up."" Later, she added, ""I've interviewed and portrayed people who've withstood some of the ugliest things life can throw at you, but the one quality all of them seem to share is an ability to maintain hope for a brighter morning, even during our darkest nights."" The 2020 calls came fast and fervently. ""She launched a rocket tonight. I want her to run for president,"" actress Meryl Streep told The Washington Post on Sunday. ""I don't think she had any intention [of declaring]. But now she doesn't have a choice."" Talk of Winfrey rippled through Iowa, whose caucuses are traditionally the first contest in the battle for the party's nomination and have a history of thrusting unconventional candidates forward. ""I can guarantee county chairs in Iowa would love to have a conversation with her,"" said Brad Anderson, who ran Obama's reelection campaign in the state in 2012. ""People could be looking for an outsider who could heal the country, and if that's the case, I have no doubt that Oprah would be powerful."" Liz Purdy, who led Democrat Hillary Clinton's presidential primary campaign in New Hampshire in 2008, said as long as Winfrey ""ran the New Hampshire way and went to Main Street after Main Street,"" she could have a path to victory in the state. ""If anyone could do retail politics right, it'd be her."" While the draft-Oprah buzz struck some Democrats as a red-carpet-turned-Twitter boomlet that could quickly fade, few veteran strategists were ready to ignore the talk about her among rank-and-file Democrats, especially after Trump, who is less popular than Winfrey in polls, was able to mount an insurgent, reality-television-style campaign and win the White House. There were also questions about whether Winfrey, 63, a self-made billionaire whose groundbreaking broadcast and media career has made her an admired figure around the world, would ever be willing to take the plunge and enter a presidential race that could be polarizing and force her to tangle daily with a combative president. ""I have no doubt that she's filled with a desire to make the greatest possible impact in the world,"" said former Obama adviser David Axelrod, who heads the University of Chicago's Institute of Politics. ""But whether she would want to submit herself and her brand to this process is a real question. Running for president is relentless, all-involving, sometimes degrading and often annoying."" Robert Shrum, who has worked on Democratic presidential campaigns for decades and teaches at the University of Southern California, said ""media fascination,"" more than any particular opening in the field, was driving the interest. He said it did not necessarily mean voters would rush to abandon the current and former officials mentioned as 2020 contenders, such as former vice president Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.). ""There could be a backlash to Trump and people look for experience,"" Shrum said. ""She'd have to show that she could formulate an economic message, assemble a top campaign organization."" In the past, Winfrey has said experience in elected office should not be a prerequisite for a role on the national stage. ""I challenge you to see through those people who try to convince you that experience with politics as usual is more valuable than wisdom won from years of serving people outside the walls of Washington, D.C.,"" she told a crowd in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in December 2007 while stumping for Obama. Asked on Bloomberg Television last year about running for president, Winfrey said that she ""never considered the question even a possibility,"" but Trump's election prompted her to reconsider. ""I thought, 'Oh, gee, I don't have the experience, I don't know enough,' "" Winfrey said. ""And now I'm thinking, 'Oh.' "" The crop of expected 2020 hopefuls, such as Gillibrand, reacted warmly to Winfrey on Monday, seeing her not yet as a rival but as an ally in their effort to raise awareness of sexual harassment and assault, an issue that has upended the entertainment industry and prompted congressional resignations. ""Her voice is powerful and important, and whatever she wants to do, she should do,"" Gillibrand said in New York. There have been many draft movements in previous election cycles that have fizzled, such as the highly publicized push in 1995 among Republicans for Colin Powell, the general who was riding a surge of popularity because of his leadership during the Gulf War. Powell declined to run, and Bill Clinton won reelection. And, of course, Trump, a wealthy real estate tycoon who later became a reality-television impresario on NBC's ""The Apprentice,"" had been wooed by some conservative voters going back to 1987, when he began to flirt with a White House run. Part of Trump's unconventional political past includes Winfrey. During a 1999 push for the Reform Party nomination that never panned out, Trump said that ""Oprah would always be my first choice"" as running mate. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), speaking to reporters Monday at the Capitol, said Winfrey could be a force in presidential politics if she surrounded herself with experienced advisers. But she did not fully embrace the idea of a Winfrey candidacy. ""I think one of the arguments for Oprah is 45,"" Pelosi said, referencing Trump's celebrity appeal as well as his lack of experience in elected office. ""I think one of the arguments against Oprah is 45."" Trump-aligned Republicans mostly shrugged off Winfrey. Jason Miller, a former Trump campaign adviser, mocked the notion of Winfrey and other celebrities jumping in the 2020 race. ""This is going to be a crowded Democratic primary: Oprah and George Clooney and Mark Cuban and Mark Zuckerberg and Dwayne Johnson, the Rock,"" Miller said. ""At a certain point, someone's going to have to remind the Democrats running for president that Hollywood is not an early primary state."" But some of Trump's critics on the right argued that Winfrey would immediately be a formidable candidate — and said they could support her over Trump. ""Oprah: sounder on economics than Bernie Sanders, understands Middle America better than Elizabeth Warren, less touchy-feely than Joe Biden,"" conservative commentator William Kristol tweeted, adding ""#ImWithHer."" Philip Rucker, Erica Werner and Steven Zeitchik contributed to this report."

According to reports, the bodies had the words “Black Lives Matter” carved into the foreheads of the corpses.The Chicago coroners office made a gruesome discovery today after several 911 calls were placed by neighbors regarding their concern of suspicious activity at the residence of Thompson. At approximately 8 p.m., police were dispatched to South Pulaski Road and West Lexington Street. Upon their arrival, their arrival, authorities were met by a group of residents at the corner where they assisted police in locating the home in question. Police proceeded to the 3000 Block of West Lexington Street where they located the home. Authorities knocked on the door of the residence and was met by an African-American male, who appeared to be in his late 30’s and seemed to be “under the influence of drugs”.Upon entering the home, authorities indicated that the home “smelled of death”. The power was off in the house however authorities found a gasoline powered generated running in the kitchen.“A Black male, approximately in his 30’s, opened the door with the smell of alcohol and marijuana on his body. He appeared to be somewhat disoriented and his speech was slurred. We asked him for permission to enter the premises, however he seems reluctant to allow us to enter,” said Lt. Kyle Jennings. “After a few seconds, he mumbled “yes” to us. Once we entered the home, we were met with a very foul odor as if something was dead in the home. The power was off so we used our flash lights to look around. As we approached the rear of the home, a light was on in the kitchen. We asked the occupant for his name. He identified himself and told us he lived with his grandmother. In the kitchen, we found several handsaws covered in blood. Mr. Thompson pushed one of the officers and ran downstairs through a half-opened door in the kitchen.”MUST READ: 7 Eleven Cashier Stabbed To Death Over Arizona Iced Tea Price IncreaseOne of the freezers found by police containing bodiesLt. Jennings and two other officers chased Thompson down the stairs which is where the foul odor had gotten stronger. When the officers got to the basement, they found a series of freezers scattered around the basement. With no trace of Thompson, one officer continued to search for him as the other two pried opened three locked deep freezers. Upon their discovery, 11 decapitated bodies were found frozen, while the heads where in ziplock freezer bags. All of the bodies appeared to have been Caucasian women, possibly in their early to mid-20’s. The heads that were found all had the words “Black Lives Matter” carved into the foreheads. The bodies were were preserved, possibly from being stored in the deep freezers.The police radioed for back up and the other freezers were opened where 8 more bodies in similar condition were found, however one of the women was still alive.

We talked for while at Starbucks, where I work, before everything happened. At first he seemed pretty nice but he had this weird twitch that happened every couple of minutes. He asked if he could walk me to my car and I said yes, but that is when everything went dark. When I woke up, I was in this basement and I saw that guy I was with earlier taking saws up the stairs. I cried for help and that is when he stuffed me into a freezer where I saw dead bodies. I must have passed out from shock or something but I am happy you guys found me,” said to police by the victim.Officer Douglas, who was searching for Thompson, found him in a crawl space in the basement. Police ran a background check on him and discovered that he was arrested during a protest for the police involved shooting death of Laquan McDonald. Thompson had no prior criminal record according to authorities.The names of the victims have not been released. Thompson was taken into custody by police and had later tested positive for PCP which authorities believe may have lead to Thompson’s crimes.SHARE

Scott Applewhite / APSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said he was the victim of a fake news hit on Tuesday, and has turned over to Capitol Police a document that purports to detail lurid sexual harassment accusations by a former staffer.Why it matters: This was an apparent effort to dupe reporters and smear a senator — both symptoms of an amped-up news environment where harassment charges are proliferating and reporters have become targets for fraud.The former staffer told me in a phone interview that she did not author the document, that none of the charges ring true, and that her signature was forged.She said she had never heard of the document before Axios took it to Schumer's office for comment on Tuesday.Matt House, Schumer's communications director, told me: ""The document is a forged document and every allegation is false. We have turned it over to the Capitol Police and asked them to investigate and pursue criminal charges because it is clear the law has been broken.""House continued: ""We believe the individual responsible for forging the document should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law to prevent other malicious actors from doing the same.""The backstory:A password-protected PDF of the 13-page document was shopped to Axios and other outlets. The document, which is dated 2012 and has the file name ""Schumer_Complaint,"" looks like a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.One of many red flags: No lawyer for the staffer is named.The woman named in the document was a legislative staffer for Schumer from 2009 to 2012, and is now a career employee of the federal government.The former staffer said she took the matter to Washington, D.C. police on Tuesday. She said the police told her they were unsure of their jurisdiction in the case. She said she now plans to go to Capitol Police.She told me in a statement: ""The claims in this document are completely false, my signature is forged, and even basic facts about me are wrong. I have contacted law enforcement to determine who is responsible. I parted with Senator Schumer's office on good terms and have nothing but the fondest memories of my time there.""Axios agreed to her stipulation that she not be named, because she said she is the victim of a crime.A source close to Schumer said the document is full of errors:""The document contains an allegation of inappropriate behavior on September 16th 2011 in Washington, but Schumer was in New York City.""""It contains an allegation of inappropriate behavior by Schumer on August 25th 2011 in Washington, but Schumer was in France.""The source tells Axios that reporters from the Washington Post, CNN, BuzzFeed, The New Yorker and ABC all inquired about the document Tuesday.Be smart: Look for more hits like this, aimed at victimizing both reporters and public figures.Sign up for Axios newsletters to get our smart brevity delivered to your inbox every morning.Plus box"

https://www.factcheck.org/2017/12/false-stories-roy-moore-accusers/	False Stories About Roy Moore Accusers	false	[]	https://www.washingtonpost.com/	https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/woman-says-roy-moore-initiated-sexual-encounter-when-she-was-14-he-was-32/2017/11/09/1f495878-c293-11e7-afe9-4f60b5a6c4a0_story.html?utm_term=.29698967aa00	2017/12/11	Leigh Corfman says she was 14 years old when an older man approached her outside a courtroom in Etowah County, Ala. She was sitting on a wooden bench with her mother, they both recall, when the man introduced himself as Roy Moore. It was early 1979 and Moore — now the Republican nominee in Alabama for a U.S. Senate seat — was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney. He struck up a conversation, Corfman and her mother say, and offered to watch the girl while her mother went inside for a child custody hearing. “He said, ‘Oh, you don’t want her to go in there and hear all that. I’ll stay out here with her,’ ” says Corfman’s mother, Nancy Wells, 71. Alone with Corfman, Moore chatted with her and asked for her phone number, she says. Days later, she says, he picked her up around the corner from her house in Gadsden, drove her about 30 minutes to his home in the woods, told her how pretty she was and kissed her. On a second visit, she says, he took off her shirt and pants and removed his clothes. He touched her over her bra and underpants, she says, and guided her hand to touch him over his underwear. “I wanted it over with — I wanted out,” she remembers thinking. “Please just get this over with. Whatever this is, just get it over.” Corfman says she asked Moore to take her home, and he did. Two of Corfman’s childhood friends say she told them at the time that she was seeing an older man, and one says Corfman identified the man as Moore. Wells says her daughter told her about the encounter more than a decade later, as Moore was becoming more prominent as a local judge. Aside from Corfman, three other women interviewed by The Washington Post in recent weeks say Moore pursued them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18 and he was in his early 30s, episodes they say they found flattering at the time, but troubling as they got older. None of the three women say that Moore forced them into any sort of relationship or sexual contact. Wendy Miller says she was 14 and working as a Santa’s helper at the Gadsden Mall when Moore first approached her, and 16 when he asked her on dates, which her mother forbade. Debbie Wesson Gibson says she was 17 when Moore spoke to her high school civics class and asked her out on the first of several dates that did not progress beyond kissing. Gloria Thacker Deason says she was an 18-year-old cheerleader when Moore began taking her on dates that included bottles of Mateus Rosé wine. The legal drinking age in Alabama was 19. Of the four women, the youngest at the time was Corfman, who is the only one who says she had sexual contact with Moore that went beyond kissing. She says they did not have intercourse. In a written statement, Moore denied the allegations. “These allegations are completely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and the Washington Post on this campaign,” Moore, now 70, said. After The Post published this story Thursday afternoon, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and a handful of other GOP senators said Moore must step aside if Corfman’s account is true. According to campaign reports, none of the women has donated to or worked for Moore’s Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, or his rivals in the Republican primary, including Sen. Luther Strange, whom he defeated this fall in a runoff election. Corfman, 53, who works as a customer service representative at a payday loan business, says she has voted for Republicans in the past three presidential elections, including for Donald Trump in 2016. She says she thought of confronting Moore personally for years, and almost came forward publicly during his first campaign for state Supreme Court in 2000, but decided against it. Her two children were still in school then and she worried about how it would affect them. She also was concerned that her background — three divorces and a messy financial history — might undermine her credibility. “There is no one here that doesn’t know that I’m not an angel,” Corfman says, referring to her home town of Gadsden. Corfman described her story consistently in six interviews with The Post. The Post confirmed that her mother attended a hearing at the courthouse in February 1979 through divorce records. Moore’s office was down the hall from the courtroom. Neither Corfman nor any of the other women sought out The Post. While reporting a story in Alabama about supporters of Moore’s Senate campaign, a Post reporter heard that Moore allegedly had sought relationships with teenage girls. Over the ensuing three weeks, two Post reporters contacted and interviewed the four women. All were initially reluctant to speak publicly but chose to do so after multiple interviews, saying they thought it was important for people to know about their interactions with Moore. The women say they don’t know one another. “I have prayed over this,” Corfman says, explaining why she decided to tell her story now. This account is based on interviews with more than 30 people who said they knew Moore between 1977 and 1982, when he served as an assistant district attorney for Etowah County in northern Alabama, where he grew up. Moore was 30 and single when he joined the district attorney’s office, his first government job after attending the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, serving in Vietnam, graduating from law school and working briefly as a lawyer in private practice in Gadsden, the county seat. “I believed that many of the young criminals whom I had to prosecute would not have committed criminal acts if they had been taught these rules as children,” Moore writes. Outside work, Moore writes that he spent his free time building rooms onto a mobile home in Gallant, a rural area about 25 miles west of Gadsden. According to colleagues and others who knew him at the time, Moore was rarely seen socializing outside work. He spent one season coaching the Gallant Girls, a softball team that his teenage sister had joined, said several women who played on the team. He spent time working out at the Gadsden YMCA, according to people who encountered him there. And he often walked, usually alone, around the newly opened Gadsden Mall — 6 feet tall and well-dressed in slacks and a button-down shirt, say several women who worked there at the time. Corfman describes herself as a little lost — “a typical 14-year-old kid of a divorced family” — when she says she first met Moore that day in 1979 outside the courtroom. She says she felt flattered that a grown man was paying attention to her. “He was charming and smiley,” she says. After her mother went into the courtroom, Corfman says, Moore asked her where she went to school, what she liked to do and whether he could call her sometime. She remembers giving him her number and says he called not long after. She says she talked to Moore on her phone in her bedroom, and they made plans for him to pick her up at Alcott Road and Riley Street, around the corner from her house. “I was kind of giddy, excited, you know? An older guy, you know?” Corfman says, adding that her only sexual experience at that point had been kissing boys her age. She says that it was dark and cold when he picked her up, and that she thought they were going out to eat. “I remember the further I got from my house, the more nervous I got,” Corfman says. She remembers an unpaved driveway. She remembers going inside and him giving her alcohol on this visit or the next, and that at some point she told him she was 14. She says they sat and talked. She remembers that Moore told her she was pretty, put his arm around her and kissed her, and that she began to feel nervous and asked him to take her home, which she says he did. Soon after, she says, he called again, and picked her up again at the same spot. “This was a new experience, and it was exciting and fun and scary,” Corfman says, explaining why she went back. She says that Moore drove her back to the same house after dark, and that before long she was lying on a blanket on the floor. She remembers Moore disappearing into another room and coming out with nothing on but “tight white” underwear. She remembers that Moore kissed her, that he took off her pants and shirt, and that he touched her through her bra and underpants. She says that he guided her hand to his underwear and that she yanked her hand back. “I wasn’t ready for that — I had never put my hand on a man’s penis, much less an erect one,” Corfman says. She remembers thinking, “I don’t want to do this” and “I need to get out of here.” She says that she got dressed and asked Moore to take her home, and that he did. The legal age of consent in Alabama, then and now, is 16. Under Alabama law in 1979, and today, a person who is at least 19 years old who has sexual contact with someone older than 12 and younger than 15 has committed sexual abuse in the second degree. Sexual contact is defined as touching of sexual or intimate parts. The crime is a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail. The law then and now also includes a section on enticing a child younger than 16 to enter a home with the purpose of proposing sexual intercourse or fondling of sexual and genital parts. That is a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison. In Alabama, the statute of limitations for bringing felony charges involving sexual abuse of a minor in 1979 would have run out three years later, and the time frame for filing a civil complaint would have ended when the alleged victim turned 21, according to Child USA, a nonprofit research and advocacy group at the University of Pennsylvania. Corfman never filed a police report or a civil suit. She says that after their last encounter, Moore called again, but that she found an excuse to avoid seeing him. She says that at some point during or soon after her meetings with Moore, she told two friends in vague terms that she was seeing an older man. Betsy Davis, who remains friendly with Corfman and now lives in Los Angeles, says she clearly remembers Corfman talking about seeing an older man named Roy Moore when they were teenagers. She says Corfman described an encounter in which the older man wore nothing but tight white underwear. She says she was firm with Corfman that seeing someone as old as Moore was out of bounds. “I remember talking to her and telling her it’s not a good idea,” Davis says. A second friend, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of losing her job, has a similar memory of a teenage Corfman telling her about seeing an older man. After talking to her friends, Corfman says, she began to feel that she had done something wrong and kept it a secret for years. “I felt responsible,” she says. “I felt like I had done something bad. She says that her teenage life became increasingly reckless with drinking, drugs, boyfriends, and a suicide attempt when she was 16. As the years went on, Corfman says, she did not share her story about Moore partly because of the trouble in her life. She has had three divorces and financial problems. While living in Arizona, she and her second husband started a screen-printing business that fell into debt. They filed for bankruptcy protection three times, once in 1991 with $139,689 in unpaid claims brought by the Internal Revenue Service and other creditors, according to court records. In 2005, Corfman paid a fine for driving a boat without lights. In 2010, she was working at a convenience store when she was charged with a misdemeanor for selling beer to a minor. The charge was dismissed, court records show. The three other women who spoke to The Post say that Moore asked them on dates when they were between 16 and 18 and he was in his early 30s. Gloria Thacker Deason says she was 18 and Moore was 32 when they met in 1979 at the Gadsden Mall, where she worked at the jewelry counter of a department store called Pizitz. She says she was attending Gadsden State Community College and still living at home. “My mom was really, really strict and my curfew was 10:30 but she would let me stay out later with Roy,” says Deason, who is now 57 and lives in North Carolina. “She just felt like I would be safe with him. . . . Deason says that they dated off and on for several months and that he took her to his house at least two times. She says their physical relationship did not go further than kissing and hugging. “He liked Eddie Rabbitt and I liked Freddie Mercury,” Deason says, referring to the country singer and the British rocker. She says that Moore would pick her up for dates at the mall or at college basketball games, where she was a cheerleader. She remembers changing out of her uniform before they went out for dinners at a pizzeria called Mater’s, where she says Moore would order bottles of Mateus Rosé, or at a Chinese restaurant, where she says he would order her tropical cocktails at a time when she believes she was younger than 19, the legal drinking age. “If Mother had known that, she would have had a hissy fit,” says Deason, who says she turned 19 in May 1979, after she and Moore started dating. Around the same time that Deason says she met Moore at the jewelry counter, Wendy Miller says that Moore approached her at the mall, where she would spend time with her mom, who worked at a photo booth there. Miller says this was in 1979, when she was 16. She says that Moore’s face was familiar because she had first met him two years before, when she was dressed as an elf and working as a Santa’s helper at the mall. She says that Moore told her she looked pretty, and that two years later, he began asking her out on dates in the presence of her mother at the photo booth. She says she had a boyfriend at the time, and declined. Her mother, Martha Brackett, says she refused to grant Moore permission to date her 16-year-old daughter. “I’d say, ‘You’re too old for her . . . let’s not rob the cradle,’ ” Brackett recalls telling Moore. Debbie Wesson Gibson says that she was 17 in the spring of 1981 when Moore spoke to her Etowah High School civics class about serving as the assistant district attorney. She says that when he asked her out, she asked her mother what she would say if she wanted to date a 34-year-old man. Gibson says that they dated for two to three months, and that he took her to his house, read her poetry and played his guitar. She says he kissed her once in his bedroom and once by the pool at a local country club. “Looking back, I’m glad nothing bad happened,” says Gibson, who now lives in Florida. By 1982, Moore was by his own account in his book causing a stir in the district attorney’s office for his willingness to criticize the workings of the local legal system. He convened a grand jury to look into what he alleged were funding problems in the sheriff’s office. In response, Moore writes, the state bar association investigated him for going against the advice of the district attorney, an inquiry that was dismissed. Soon after, Moore quit and began his first political campaign for the county’s circuit court judge position. He lost overwhelmingly, and left Alabama shortly thereafter, heading to Texas, where he says in his book that he trained as a kickboxer, and to Australia, where he says he lived on a ranch for a year wrangling cattle. He returned to Gadsden in 1984 and went into private law practice. In 1985, at age 38, he married Kayla Kisor, who was 24. The two are still married. A few years later, Moore began his rise in Alabama politics and into the national spotlight. In 1992, he became a circuit court judge and hung his wooden Ten Commandments plaque in his courtroom. In 2000, he was elected chief justice of Alabama’s Supreme Court, and he soon installed a 5,280-pound granite Ten Commandments monument in the judicial building. Moore was again elected chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court in 2012, and was again dismissed for ignoring a judicial order, this time for instructing probate judges not to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. All of this has made Moore a hero to many Alabama voters, who consider him a stalwart Christian willing to stand up for their values. In a September Republican primary for the seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Moore defeated the appointed sitting senator, Luther Strange, who was backed by President Trump and other party leaders in Washington. Moore faces the Democratic nominee, Doug Jones, in a special election scheduled for Dec. 12. On a visit home in the mid-1990s to see her mother and stepfather in Alabama, Corfman says, she saw Moore’s photo in the Gadsden Times. “ ‘Mother, do you remember this guy?’ ” Wells says Corfman said at the time. That’s when Corfman told her, Wells recalls. Her daughter said that not long after the court hearing in 1979, Moore took her to his house. Wells says that her daughter conveyed to her that Moore had behaved inappropriately. “I was horrified,” Wells says. Years later, Corfman says, she saw a segment about Moore on ABC News’s “Good Morning America.” She says she threw up. There were times, Corfman says, she thought about confronting Moore. At one point during the late 1990s, she says, she became so angry that she drove to the parking lot outside Moore’s office at the county courthouse in Gadsden. She sat there for a while, she says, rehearsing what she might say to him. “ ‘Remember me?’ ” she imagined herself saying.

Palmer, an avid hunter, is accused of illegally killing a well-known and protected lion, named Cecil, during a big game hunt in Zimbabwe. The killing has outraged animal conservationists and others worldwide. (AP Photo/Amy Forliti)BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) — An avid Minnesota hunter accused of illegally killing a protected lion in Zimbabwe said Tuesday that he thought everything about his trip was legal and wasn't aware of the animal's status ""until the end of the hunt.""Walter Palmer, who has a felony record in the U.S. related to shooting a black bear in Wisconsin, released a statement through a public relations firm after being identified by Zimbabwean authorities as the American involved in the July hunt. They said Palmer is being sought on poaching charges, but Palmer said he hasn't heard from U.S. or Zimbabwean authorities.""I had no idea that the lion I took was a known, local favorite, was collared and part of a study until the end of the hunt. I relied on the expertise of my local professional guides to ensure a legal hunt,"" said Palmer, a dentist who lives in the Minneapolis suburb of Eden Prairie.The 55-year-old was identified by the Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force, the Safari Operators Association of Zimbabwe and police as the American facing poaching charges for the crossbow killing of Cecil, a well-known and protected lion. Local authorities allege the lion was lured from a protected area and killed in early July. Zimbabwean conservationists said the American allegedly paid $50,000 for the trip.The lion's death has outraged animal conservationists and others, including U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum, a Minnesota Democrat. In a statement late Tuesday, the congresswoman called for an investigation by the U.S. attorney's office and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to see whether any U.S. laws were violated.Palmer's hired spokesman, Jon Austin, said he believed Palmer was in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area on Tuesday. No one answered the door at Palmer's home, and a woman who came out of his dental office in nearby Bloomington said he wasn't there or taking patients Tuesday. Phone calls to listed home numbers went unanswered.According to U.S. court records, Palmer pleaded guilty in 2008 to making false statements to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service about a black bear he fatally shot in western Wisconsin. Palmer had a permit to hunt but shot the animal outside the authorized zone in 2006, then tried to pass it off as being killed elsewhere, according to court documents. He was given one year probation and fined nearly $3,000.Doug Kelley, a former federal prosecutor and Palmer's attorney in the bear case, was unavailable for immediate comment Tuesday, according to his assistant.Palmer has several hunts on record with the Pope and Young Club, where archers register big game taken in North America for posterity, said Glenn Hisey, the club's director of records. Hisey said he didn't have immediate access to records showing the types and number of animals killed by Palmer but noted that club records involve legal hunts ""taken under our rules of fair chase.""Although African game wouldn't be eligible, Hisey said he alerted the group's board that Palmer's ethics were being called into question. He said Palmer's domestic records could be jeopardized if he's found to have done something illegal abroad.A Facebook page for Palmer's Minnesota dental practice was taken offline Tuesday after users flooded it with comments condemning Palmer's involvement in the hunt. Hundreds of similar comments inundated a page for his dental practice on the review platform Yelp, which before Tuesday had only three comments.Palmer is properly licensed and able to practice in the state, according to the Minnesota Board of Dentistry. Board records show Palmer was the subject of a sexual harassment complaint settled in 2006, with Palmer admitting no wrongdoing and agreeing to pay a former receptionist more than $127,000.___Bakst reported from St. Paul, Minnesota.

https://www.factcheck.org/2017/11/debunking-false-vaccine-claim/	Debunking False Vaccine Claim	false	['National', 'autism', 'conspiracy theories', 'fake news', 'vaccines']	https://www.fda.gov/	https://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/ResourcesforYou/Consumers/ucm345587.htm	2017/11/22	"Parents and Caregivers are Asking Vaccines have contributed to a significant reduction in many childhood infectious diseases, such as diphtheria, measles, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Some infectious diseases, such as polio and smallpox, have been eliminated in the United States due to effective vaccines. It is now rare for children in the United States to experience the devastating and often deadly effects of these diseases that were once common in the United States and other countries with high vaccination coverage.The vast majority of vaccines are given to healthy babies, children and adults; therefore, it is critical that vaccines be demonstrated to be safe and effective. Ensuring the safety and effectiveness of vaccines is one of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) top priorities. The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) is the center within FDA that has regulatory oversight of vaccines in the United States assuring the availability of safe and effective vaccines.Because immunization programs of the 20th century were so successful, many of today’s parents have never seen many vaccine-preventable diseases and do not understand the potential for them to re-emerge. If too many individuals choose not to vaccinate themselves or their children, some diseases that are now rare or non-existent in this country may resurface.The viruses and bacteria that cause vaccine-preventable diseases and death still exist and can cause disease in people who are not protected by vaccines. For example, although measles has not been constantly present in the United States since 2000, sporadic cases continue to occur, primarily from unvaccinated visitors who are bringing the disease into the United States from other countries or unvaccinated U.S. travelers returning to the U.S. from countries where measles is still common, including countries in Europe, Asia, the Pacific, and Africa. The United States experienced a large multi-state measles outbreak in December 2014 that started in California and spread to additional states and Mexico. The majority of people who got measles were unvaccinated. The initial patients who were confirmed with measles reported visiting two Disneyland Resort Theme Parks in Orange County, California, from December 17 through December 20, 2014. The source of the outbreak is unknown, but it is likely that a traveler (or more than one traveler) who became infected with measles overseas visited one or both of the Disney parks in December during the time that they were infectious.Measles is one of the most contagious diseases and can cause severe complications, including pneumonia, swelling of the brain, and death. Outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as measles, serve as a reminder that they are only a plane-ride away and the best way not to get sick is to get vaccinated.topBenefits and RisksA vaccine is a medication. Like any medicine, vaccines have benefits and risks, and although highly effective, no vaccine is 100 percent effective in preventing disease or 100 percent safe in all individuals. Most side effects of vaccines are usually minor and short-lived. For example, a person may feel soreness at the injection site or experience a mild fever. Serious vaccine reactions are extremely rare, but they can happen.""Parents should know that the risk of being harmed by a vaccine is significantly smaller than the risk of serious illness from infectious diseases,"" says Marion Gruber, Ph.D., director of the Office of Vaccines Research and Review in CBER. ""Vaccination is a very important step to get children off to a healthy start.""For more information on potential adverse events or reactions, talk with your healthcare provider, and many vaccines also have FDA-approved labeling for the patient that can be a resource of information. It is important to discuss with your healthcare provider any prior reactions to vaccines and any adverse reactions following vaccination.Types of Routinely Administered Vaccines for ChildrenHow vaccines workVaccines work by preparing the body’s immune system for future attacks by a certain disease, caused by either viruses or bacteria. Vaccines contain weakened bacteria or viruses, or parts of bacteria or viruses, and mimic these disease-causing agents (which are called antigens). As a result of vaccination, the body’s immune system thinks the antigens from the vaccine are foreign and shouldn’t be in the body, but the antigens don’t cause disease in the person receiving the vaccine. After receiving the vaccine, if the virus or bacteria that cause the real disease then enters the body in the future, the immune system is prepared and responds quickly and forcefully to attack the disease-causing agent to prevent the person from getting sick. Vaccines are frequently given by injection (a shot), but some are given by mouth and one is sprayed into the nose.There are various types of vaccines that are routinely given to childrenAttenuated (weakened) live viruses- These vaccines contain a live virus that has been weakened during the manufacturing process so that they do not cause the actual disease in the person being vaccinated. However, because they contain a small amount of the weakened live virus, people with weakened immune systems should talk to their healthcare provider before receiving them. Examples include vaccines that prevent chickenpox and rotavirus and measles, mumps and rubella.Inactivated (killed) viruses- These vaccines contain a virus that has been killed so as not to cause disease, but the body still recognizes it and stimulates production of antibodies against the disease. They can be given to individuals with weakened immune systems. Examples include vaccines to prevent polio and hepatitis A.Subunits- In some cases, the entire virus or bacteria is not required for an immune response to prevent disease; just the important parts, a portion or a ""subunit"" of the disease-causing bacteria or virus is needed to provide protection. The vaccine to prevent influenza (the flu) that is given as a shot is an example of a subunit vaccine, because it is made with parts of the influenza virus.Toxoids- Some bacteria cause illness in people by secreting a poison (a toxin). Scientists discovered that weakening the toxins, so that they are “detoxified” does not cause illness. Examples of vaccines that contain toxoids include those to prevent tetanus and diphtheria disease.Recombinant- These vaccines are made by genetic engineering, the process and method of manipulating the genetic material of an organism. An example of this type of vaccine is those that prevent certain diseases caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), such as cervical cancer. In this case, the genes that code for a specific protein from each of the virus types of HPV included in the vaccine are expressed in yeast to create large quantities of the protein. The protein that is produced is purified and then used to make the vaccine. Because the vaccine only contains a protein, and not the entire virus, the vaccine cannot cause the HPV infection. It is the body's immune response to the recombinant protein(s) that then protects against infection by the naturally occurring virus.Polysaccharides- To protect against certain disease-causing bacteria, the main antigens in vaccine are sugar-like substances called polysaccharides; these are purified from the bacteria to make polysaccharide vaccines. However, vaccines composed solely of purified polysaccharides are only effective in older children and adults. Pneumovax 23, a vaccine for the prevention of pneumococcal disease caused by 23 different strains, is an example of a polysaccharide vaccine.Conjugates- Vaccines made only with polysaccharides do not work very well in young children because their immune system has not fully developed. To make vaccines that protect young children against diseases caused by certain bacteria, the polysaccharides are connected to a protein so that the immune system can recognize and respond to the polysaccharide. The protein acts as a “carrier” for the part of the vaccine that will make protective antibodies in the body. Examples of conjugate vaccines include those to prevent invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib).Steps to Take When Your Child is VaccinatedReview the vaccine information sheetsThese sheets explain both the benefits and risks of a vaccine. Healthcare providers are required by law to provide them.Talk to your healthcare provider about the benefits and risks of vaccinesLearn the facts about the benefits and risks of vaccines, along with the potential consequences of not vaccinating against diseases. Some parents and caregivers are surprised to learn that children can be harmed or die of measles, diphtheria, pertussis, and other vaccine-preventable diseases. Conditions to make your healthcare provider aware of before vaccinationThis might include being sick or having a history of certain allergic or other adverse reactions to previous vaccinations or their components. For example, eggs are used to grow many influenza (flu) vaccines; therefore, it is important to inform the healthcare provider if a child is severely allergic to eggs.The packaging of some vaccines that are supplied in vials or prefilled syringes may contain natural rubber latex, which may cause allergic reactions in latex-sensitive individuals; therefore, an allergy to latex is helpful to inform healthcare providers of beforehand.It is also particularly important to discuss with your healthcare provider which vaccines should or should not be given to children who have weakened immune systems.Report adverse reactionsAdverse reactions and other problems related to vaccines should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which is maintained by FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For a copy of the vaccine reporting form, call 1-800-822-7967, or report online to www.vaers.hhs.govtopRoutinely Administered Vaccines for ChildrenSome of the most commonly administered vaccines are briefly discussed below. A complete list of licensed vaccines in the United States and additional information, such as prescribing information and patient labeling are available at: http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/ucm093833.htm .Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed (DTaP)Brand Names: Daptacel and InfanrixWhat it's for: Prevents the bacterial infections diphtheria, tetanus (lockjaw), and pertussis (whooping cough). This combination vaccine is given as a series in infants and children 6 weeks through 6 years of age, prior to their 7th birthday. Diphtheria can infect the throat, causing a thick covering that can lead to problems with breathing, paralysis, or heart failure. Tetanus can cause painful tightening (spasms) of the muscles, seizures, paralysis, and death. Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, has the initial symptoms of runny nose, sneezing, and a mild cough, which may seem like a typical cold. Usually, the cough slowly becomes more severe. Eventually the patient may experience bouts of rapid coughing followed by the “whooping” sound that gives the disease its common name as they try to inhale. While the coughing fit is occurring, the patient may vomit or turn blue from lack of air. Patients gradually recover over weeks to months.Common side effects may include: Fever, drowsiness, fussiness/irritability, and redness, soreness, or swelling at the injection site.Tell your health care provider beforehand if: The child is moderately or severely ill, has had swelling of the brain within 7 days after a previous dose of vaccine, has a neurologic disorder such as epilepsy, or has had a severe allergic reaction to a previous shot.Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed (Tdap)Brand Names: Adacel and BoostrixWhat it's for: Booster shot for kids at 10 or 11 years of age to prevent the bacterial infections diphtheria, tetanus (lockjaw), and pertussis (whooping cough). In addition, Boostrix is approved for all individuals 10 years of age and older, (including the elderly). Adacel is approved for use in people ages 10 through 64 years.Common side effects may include: Pain, redness and swelling at the injection site, headache, and tiredness.Tell your health care provider beforehand if: The child is moderately or severely ill, has had swelling of the brain within 7 days after a previous dose of pertussis vaccine, or any allergic reaction to any vaccine that protects against diphtheria, tetanus or pertussis diseases.Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (Hib)Brand Names: ActHIB, Hiberix, PedvaxHIBWhat it's for: Prevents Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) invasive disease. Before the availability of Hib vaccines, Hib disease was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis among children under 5 years of age in the United States. Meningitis is an infection of the tissue covering the brain and spinal cord, which can lead to lasting brain damage and deafness. Hib disease can also cause pneumonia, severe swelling in the throat, infections of the blood, joints, bones, and tissue covering of the heart, as well as death. Both ActHIB and PedvaxHIB are approved for routine administration for infants and children beginning at 2 months and through 5 years of age and 71 months of age respectively; Hiberix is approved for children 6 weeks through the age of 4 (prior to their 5th birthday).Common side effects may include: Fussiness, sleepiness, and soreness, swelling and redness at the injection site.Tell your health care provider beforehand if: The child is moderately or severely ill, or has ever had an allergic reaction to a previous dose of Hib vaccine.Hepatitis A VaccineBrand Names: Havrix and VaqtaWhat it's for: Prevents disease caused by hepatitis A virus. People infected with hepatitis A may not have any symptoms; and if they do have symptoms, they may feel like that they have a mild ""flu-like"" illness; or they may have jaundice (yellow skin or eyes), tiredness, stomachache, nausea and diarrhea. Young children may not have any symptoms, so when a child’s caregiver becomes sick, that is when it is recognized that the child is infected. Hepatitis A is most often spread by an object contaminated with the feces of a person with hepatitis A, such as when a parent or caregiver does not properly wash his or her hands after changing diapers or cleaning up the stool of an infected person. Both vaccines are approved for use in people 12 months of age and older.Common side effects may include: Soreness and redness at the injection site, and loss of appetite.Tell your health care provider beforehand if: The child is moderately to severely ill, or has ever had an allergic reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine.Hepatitis B VaccineBrand Names: Engerix-B and Recombivax HBWhat it's for: Prevents infection caused by hepatitis B virus. Hepatitis B is spread when body fluid infected with hepatitis B enters the body of a person who is not infected. Hepatitis B can lead to chronic hepatitis (liver inflammation), liver cancer, and death. The vaccines are approved for individuals of all ages, including newborns. It is particularly important for those at increased risk of exposure to hepatitis B virus such as a baby born to mom who is infected with the virus.Common side effects may include: Soreness, redness, swelling at injection site, irritability, fever, diarrhea, fatigue/weakness, loss of appetite and headache.Tell your health care provider beforehand if: The child is moderately or severely ill, or has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to yeast or to a previous dose of the vaccine.Human Papillomavirus VaccineBrand Names: Gardasil 9What it's for: Gardasil 9 is for use in females and males ages 9 through 26. It prevents cervical, vulvar, vaginal and anal cancers caused by any of the following human papillomavirus (HPV) Types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58. Overall, Gardasil 9 has the potential to prevent approximately 90% of cervical, vulvar, vaginal and anal cancers. Gardasil 9 is also approved for the prevention of genital warts caused by types 6 and 11 in both males and females.Common side effects may include: Headache, fever, nausea, dizziness, fainting, and pain, swelling, redness, itchiness or bruising at the injection site.Tell your health care provider beforehand if: The individual has had an allergic reaction to yeast or to a previous dose of the vaccine.Influenza Vaccine (administered with a needle)Brand Names (for children): Afluria, Fluarix, FluLaval, Fluvirin, Fluarix Quadrivalent, Flucelvax Quadrivalent, FluLaval Quadrivalent, and Fluzone QuadrivalentWhat it's for: Different vaccines are approved for different age groups to prevent influenza disease, caused by the strains of influenza virus that are included in the vaccine.Influenza, commonly called “flu,” is a contagious respiratory virus that can cause mild to severe illness. The elderly, young children and people with certain health conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease) are at high risk for serious influenza-related complications. Complications may include pneumonia, ear infections, sinus infections, dehydration, and worsening of certain medical conditions such as congestive heart failure, asthma or diabetes.The strains of influenza virus that cause disease in people frequently change, so yearly vaccination is needed to provide protection against the influenza viruses likely to cause illness each winter.Common side effects may include: Pain, redness and swelling at the injection site, low grade fever, and muscle aches, headache, fatigue and general feeling of being unwell.Tell your health care provider beforehand if: The child is moderately or severely ill, has immune system problems, or has had Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), a neurological disorder that causes severe muscle weakness. Also, tell your healthcare provider about any allergies, including severe allergies to eggs and any allergic reaction to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine.Influenza Vaccine, Intranasal (nasal spray)Brand Names (for children): FluMist QuadrivalentWhat it's for: Protects against four different strains of influenza virus included in the vaccine; for children and adults ages 2 through 49 years of age.Common side effects may include: Runny or stuffy nose and cough.Tell your health care provider beforehand if: The child is moderately or severely ill, has a weakened immune system, has asthma or recurrent wheezing, or has a history of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), a neurological disorder that causes severe muscle weakness. Also, tell your healthcare provider about any allergies, including severe allergies to eggs and any allergic reaction to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine. In addition, because of the association of Reye's syndrome with aspirin and wild-type influenza infection, the healthcare provider should be made aware if the child is currently receiving aspirin or aspirin-containing therapy. Measles, Mumps and Rubella VaccineBrand Name: M-M-R IIWhat it's for: Prevents measles, mumps, and rubella in those 12 months of age and older. Measles is a respiratory disease that causes a skin rash all over the body, and fever, cough and runny nose. Measles can be severe, causing ear infections, pneumonia, seizures, and swelling of the brain. Mumps causes fever, headache, loss of appetite and the well-known sign of swollen cheeks and jaw which is from the swelling of the salivary glands. Rare complications include deafness, meningitis (infection of the lining that surrounds the brain and spinal cord), and painful swelling of the testicles or ovaries. Rubella, also called German Measles, causes fever, a rash, and--mainly in women--can also cause arthritis. Rubella infection during pregnancy can lead to birth defects.Common side effects may include: Fever, mild rash, fainting, headache, dizziness, irritability and burning/stinging, redness, swelling, and tenderness at the injection site.Tell your health care provider beforehand if: The child is ill and has a fever or has ever had an allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or a previous dose of the vaccine, has immune system problems, or cancer, or problems with the blood or lymph system.Meningococcal VaccineBrand Names: Bexsero, Menactra, Menveo, and TrumenbaWhat it's for: Prevents certain types of meningococcal disease, a life-threatening illness caused by the bacteria Neisseria meningitidis that infects the bloodstream and the lining that surrounds the brain and spinal cord (meningitis). Neisseria meningitidis is a leading cause of meningitis in young children. Even with appropriate antibiotics and intensive care, between 10 and 15 percent of people who develop meningococcal disease die from the infection. Another 10 to 20 percent suffer complications such as brain damage or loss of limb or hearing. Bexsero and Trumenba are approved for use in those 10 through 25 years of age to prevent invasive meningococcal disease caused by N. meningitidis serogroup B. Menactra is approved for use in those 9 months through 55 years of age. Menveo is approved for use in those 2 months through 55 years of age. Both Menactra and Menveo prevent meningococcal disease caused by N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, Y and W.Common side effects may include: Tenderness, pain, redness and swelling at the injection site, irritability, headache, fever, tiredness, chills, diarrhea and loss of appetite for a short while.Tell your health care provider beforehand if: The child is moderately or severely ill, has had a severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of meningococcal vaccine or diphtheria toxoid, has a known sensitivity to vaccine components, or a history of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS).Pneumococcal 13-valent Conjugate VaccineBrand Name: Prevnar 13What it's for: Prevents invasive disease caused by 13 different types of the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae in infants, children and adolescents ages 6 weeks through 17 years. In infants and children 6 weeks through 5 years of age, it is also approved for the prevention of otitis media (ear infection) caused by 7 different types of the bacterium. Streptococcus pneumonie can cause infections of the blood, middle ear, and the covering of the brain and spinal cord, as well as pneumonia. Prevnar 13 is also approved for adults 18 years of age and older.Common side effects may include: Pain, redness and swelling at the injection site, irritability, decreased appetite and fever.Tell your health care provider beforehand if: The child is moderately or severely ill, has ever had an allergic reaction to a previous dose or component of the vaccine, including diphtheria toxoid (for example, DTaP vaccine).Poliovirus VaccineBrand Name: IpolWhat it's for: Prevents polio in infants as young as 6 weeks of age. Polio is a disease that can cause paralysis or death.Common side effects may include: Redness, hardening and pain at the injection site, fever, irritability, sleepiness, fussiness, and crying.Tell your health care provider beforehand if: The child is moderately or severely ill, including illness with a fever, has ever had a severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of polio vaccine, any component of the vaccine, or an allergic reaction to the antibiotics neomycin, streptomycin, or polymyxin B.Rotavirus VaccineBrand Names: Rotarix and RotaTeqWhat it's for: Prevents gastroenteritis caused by rotavirus infection in infants as young as 6 weeks of age. Rotavirus disease is the leading cause of severe diarrhea and dehydration in infants worldwide. In the United States, the disease occurs more often during the winter. Before rotavirus vaccines were available, most children in the United States were infected with rotavirus before the age of two. In addition, rotavirus resulted in about 55,000-70,000 hospitalizations and 20-60 infant deaths in the United States each year.Common side effects may include: Fussiness/irritability, cough/runny nose, fever, and loss of appetite.Tell your health care provider beforehand if: The child has illness with a fever, a weakened immune system because of a disease, has a blood disorder, any type of cancer, has gastrointestinal problems, has had stomach surgery or ever had intussusception, which is a form of blockage of the intestines, is allergic to any of the ingredients of the vaccine, or has ever had an allergic reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine, or has regular close contact with a member of a family or household who has a weak immune system.Varicella Virus VaccineBrand Name: VarivaxWhat it's for: Prevents varicella (chickenpox) in children 12 months of age and older. Chickenpox usually causes a blister-like itchy rash, tiredness, headache and fever. It can be serious, particularly in babies, adolescents, adults and people with weak immune systems, causing less common, but more serious complications such as skin infection, scarring, pneumonia, brain swelling, Reye's syndrome, (which affects the liver and brain), and death.Common side effects may include: Soreness, pain, redness or swelling at the injection site, fever, irritability, and chicken-pox like rash on the body or at the site of the shot.Tell your health care provider beforehand if: The child is moderately or severely ill, including a fever, has a weak immune system, has received a blood or plasma transfusion or immune globulin within the last 5 months, takes any medicines, has allergies including any life-threatening allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or a previous dose of chickenpox or any other vaccine.Your healthcare provider may decide to use the following vaccines to prevent the diseases described previously. These are also approved by FDA and could reduce the total number of shots a child receives.Brand Name: KinrixWhat it’s for: Prevents diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and polio in children 4 through 6 years of age (prior to 7th birthday).Common side effects: Similar to those vaccines described previously for the prevention of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and polio.Tell your healthcare provider beforehand: See information included in the sections for those vaccines that prevent diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and polio.Brand Name: PediarixWhat it’s for: Prevents diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and polio in children 6 weeks of age through 6 years of age (prior to the 7th birthday).Common side effects: Similar to those vaccines described previously for the prevention of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and polio.Tell your healthcare provider beforehand: See information included in the sections for those vaccines that prevent diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and polio.Brand Name: PentacelWhat it’s for: Prevents diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio and invasive Hib disease in children 6 weeks through 4 years of age (prior to 5th birthday).Common Side Effects: Similar to those vaccines described previously for the prevention of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio and Hib.Tell your healthcare provider beforehand: See information included in the sections for those vaccines that prevent diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio and Hib.Brand Name: ProQuadWhat it’s for: Prevents measles, mumps, rubella (German measles), and varicella (chicken pox) in children 12 months through 12 years of age.Common side effects: Fever, measles-like rash and injection site reactions such as pain, tenderness, soreness, redness and swelling.Tell your healthcare provider beforehand: See information included in the sections for those vaccines that prevent measles, mumps, rubella and chicken pox.Brand Name: QuadracelWhat it’s for: Prevents diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and polio in children 4 through 6 years of age.Common side effects: muscle aches, fever and injection site reactions such as pain, swelling and rednessTell your healthcare provider beforehand: See information included in the sections for those vaccines that prevent diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and polio.Parents and Caregivers are AskingShould I be worried about the increasing number of vaccines recommended for children?No. Because of advances in science and manufacturing, it is easier than in the past to be sure that vaccines are highly pure. Vaccines represent only a minor stimulation of the infant immune system compared to the large number of potentially dangerous bacteria and viruses babies routinely encounter: starting immediately after a baby is born; thousands of different bacteria begin to live on the skin and the lining of the nose, throat, and intestines. The baby’s immune system rapidly launches immune responses to these bacteria that prevent them from invading the blood stream.Are the ingredients that are used to make vaccines safe?Yes. Each ingredient in a vaccine is included for a reason. Before FDA determines that a vaccine is safe and effective and licenses it for use by the public in the United States, the vaccine is carefully evaluated by FDA scientists and doctors, taking into account the ingredients that make up the entire vaccine.Are vaccines linked to autism?No, the scientific evidence does not support a link between vaccination and autism or other developmental disorders."

Some historians say the first organized baseball game was played there in 1846. The first zipper was believed to have been invented there, too.And now the city of some 55,000 people on the Hudson River can boast another first: Councilman Ravi Bhalla on Tuesday became the first Sikh elected mayor in New Jersey, and one of only a few Sikhs to become mayor of an American city.“I feel exhilarated,” Mr. Bhalla, 44, said in an interview on Wednesday. “I didn’t have any expectations one way or another of victory or defeat, I was prepared for both. And I feel very grateful to have the opportunity to serve Hoboken.”Mayor-elect Bhalla, a 17-year resident of the city, had won elections in 2009 and 2013 to the City Council and twice served as its president. He was endorsed for mayor by the incumbent, Dawn Zimmer, who announced in June that she would not seek re-election. Mr. Bhalla and Ms. Zimmer are both Democrats, though Hoboken’s mayoral elections are nonpartisan.But even his deep roots and prior success among the city’s voters did not make Mr. Bhalla immune from racist attacks. On Friday night, doctored campaign fliers appeared on car windows in Hoboken featuring a picture of Mr. Bhalla, who wears the turban that is traditional to his faith. Above his picture was the message: “Don’t let TERRORISM take over our Town!”The implication was one that is familiar to many Sikhs, who are part of a separate, monotheistic faith that is neither Hinduism nor Islam, but who are often mistaken for being something that they are not. Particularly after Sept. 11, Sikhs have found themselves the target of hate crimes that often appear to be based in a belief that they are Muslim.Mr. Bhalla said that the public reaction to the fliers was largely a desire to refute the hate they represented. The police are investigating the matter as a bias incident.“It is not what Hoboken is about, it is not reflective of our community,” he said. “It’s just unfortunate.”He went on to win Tuesday, with 34 percent of the vote in a six-way race. Of the 14,000 votes cast, he received 4,781, according to the Hudson County Board of Elections . There are no runoffs so a plurality was enough to win.“Is there something special about his victory? Without a doubt,” said Chief Kenneth F. Ferrante of the Hoboken Police Department. “This is already an exciting city. His victory just gives it more character.”ImageMr. Bhalla was stopped by a steady stream of well-wishers in Hoboken on Wednesday. Some said they considered his win a victory for multiculturalism and a rejection of the forces that propelled President Trump to victory a year ago.CreditBryan Anselm for The New York TimesMr. Bhalla, the child of Indian immigrants who was born and raised in New Jersey, said that his victory was because of his stance on the issues: pushing for more open space, holding the line on taxes, and working to solve the flooding problem, particularly after the devastation of Hurricane Sandy five years ago.It certainly wasn’t because of a Sikh voting block. There is only a tiny Sikh community in Hoboken of about 15-20 families, he said, including his brother, whose family lives next door to Mr. Bhalla. (The Bhallas live on the same street where Frank Sinatra grew up as a teenager.) Mr. Bhalla and his wife have two children, ages 5 and 10, who attend a local charter school.While Mr. Bhalla, who is a lawyer , was humble in talking about his victory, it has resonated well behind Hoboken. His campaign was covered by newspapers as far away as India. And his victory brought a surge of joy on social media from some of the approximately 500,000 Sikhs in America.Sikhs, who largely hail from the Punjab region of modern-day India and Pakistan, have lived in America for about a century. In that time, they have often felt frustrated because they are “constantly perceived as people that they are not,” said Simran Jeet Singh , senior religion fellow at the Sikh Coalition, a civil rights organization based in New York City.Still, Sikhs have risen in public life, particularly in Canada, where the current defense minister is Sikh. In the United States, there have been at least two Sikh mayors in recent years, according to the Sikh Coalition. In 2009, Kashmir Gill was elected mayor of Yuba City, Calif., but he did not wear a turban. In 2012 and again in 2014, Satyendra Huja, who wears a turban, was selected by the Charlottesville, Va., City Council to be mayor.But Mr. Bhalla’s election felt like a milestone because it is believed to be the first time a turban-wearing Sikh has been directly elected by voters to lead an American city, Mr. Singh said.“This, in many ways for the community, marks a signal shift,” he said, “that now we can maintain our distinct identity, we can practice our faith, and still be seen as part and parcel of the American experience.”In Hoboken on Wednesday, Mr. Bhalla was stopped by a steady stream of well-wishers. Some said they considered his win a victory for multiculturalism, and a rejection of the forces that propelled President Trump to victory a year ago.“People are upset, but we now have a medium, the electoral process, to express that,” said John Bredlin, 54, a college professor. “They are rejecting Trump.”Mr. Bhalla said that while he is happy to talk about his faith, he is a mayor for all Hoboken. He has big plans for the city after he officially starts his term on Jan. 1, particularly to improve its infrastructure and public transportation.“I didn’t run as the Sikh candidate,” he said. “I ran as the candidate who happened to be Sikh.”Jeffery C. Mays contributed reporting.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A20 of the New York edition with the headline: Hoboken, City of Firsts, Elects a Sikh as Mayor.

It got weird from there.Oct 31 2017, 7:23pmImage by Lia KantrowitzWhat is it like to attend your own funeral? In my mind, it has to be something like waking up on a Monday morning, logging onto Twitter, and finding out that your account, 112,000 followers and all, has been suspended. You can see everything everyone is saying about you, but you cannot cry out ""LOL."" Nobody can hear you. Your 140 characters exist in a void.To be clear, much of what transpires online is Extremely Dumb, and there are many more important things happening in the world right now than some white guy's lefty humor account getting 86'd . But my temporary—the account was restored late Monday—ouster from the outlet I use so often does speak to a persistent problem with one of the world's largest social media platforms. It's a place where suspensions often seem to be dished out in arbitrary fashion, and clamping down on, say, actual racism or misogyny is a work in progress at best. A few weeks ago, actress Rose McGowan endured a suspension after speaking out strongly about her allegation of rape against disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein. McGowan is verified, which should theoretically provide some protection from this stuff, but Twitter (temporarily) shut her down, later citing the fact that she allegedly posted a screenshot of a private phone number.The ensuing uproar was loud enough that Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey felt compelled to publicly promise to update the company's standards. But as anyone who uses Twitter knows, the company's process for addressing this sort of thing has long been fucked all the way down to its roots, and the problem may be getting worse. Twitter's "" safety "" system appears to be mostly based on a combination of keywords and frequency of reports, so if a group of extremely alpha gamergate types decide they don't like someone, all they need to do is wait to see the right word and then coordinate a mass-reporting.In my case, I decided to mock festering panic over an exceedingly fake Civil War plot for which thousands of FOX News grandparents may, at this very moment, be boarding up their windows in panicked preparation. Right wingers have a predilection for fearing Antifa , despite the fact that they only seem to show up at neo-Nazi rallies and to protest police brutality. Anyone with a single crease in their brain could see that my post was satire, but alas, the internet has no shortage of morons, and the tweet was apparently reported into oblivion. The ensuing suspension was so thorough that my work account was axed for using the same phone number. (I reached out to Twitter for comment in connection with this story, but had yet to hear back at the time of publication.)Screenshot courtesy of the authorIf you doubt the utter gullibility of the people I'm referencing, look no further than this article from the Gateway Pundit, which breathlessly reported the obvious parody, after it was tweeted again by someone else, as factual news. (This is a ""publication"" that at least at one point had White House press credentials , by the way.) I should qualify here that while I have no love whatsoever for fascists, I am neither the president, the chairman, nor the CEO of Antifa. Either the author of the aforementioned piece was cynically using the joke to stoke the fears of elderly conservatives, or else he is just a fucking idiot.People were not happy about the tweet. Screenshot courtesy of the authorPeople have screamed for years about the weird shit Twitter inexplicably tolerates, chiefly the ability of coordinated hate mobs to drive people off of the site. But if you weren't familiar with my account before, all I can say is that it was significantly less toxic than that of the American Nazi Party. I may have poked fun at the Scaramucci Post 's editorial strategy or Mike Huckabee's inconceivably bad attempts at jokes. But weren't those jabs less worthy of punishment than say, calling for America to return to an all-white ethno-state?Maybe it's just me.If I have some hope going forward, it would be that Twitter start from scratch on the whole security thing. It's been ten years, and the entire system is clearly broken at its core. But since that seems unlikely, I guess my slightly more reasonable expectation is that this joke continues to pick up steam in right-wing circles (as it appears to be doing). The last time a bunch of white supremacists were tricked into believing something like this, a mob of them showed up at a confederate graveyard to fight the nonexistent Antifa threat, and one guy ended up accidentally shooting himself in the leg. Just saying.Despite being suspended (and at least temporarily reinstated) from twitter dot com, the fallout from the joke has been infinitely amusing and, again, it's just the Internet we're talking about. Would I be sad if my joke-post incited a civil war? Sure. But I am glad to, at least for now, have a means of skewering our pathetic politics relentlessly.Follow Krang T. Nelson on Twitter ."

Mr. Gonzalez was observed around 3:00 p.m. PDT wearing a jacket and walking out of the creek area and a plume of smoke behind him, according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.Mr. Gonzalez, who is homeless and reportedly known by law enforcement to have been living under a nearby bridge, claimed he was cold and had lit the fire to stay warm. But it was a balmy 78 degrees when he and the plume of smoke were first observed.Mr. Gonzalez was booked into the Sonoma County Jail for suspicion of felony arson. His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer.Sargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a sanctuary county in May 2014. The county only cooperates with ICE holds if the prisoner has been convicted of a felony or any misdemeanor offence that falls within the Trust Act within the last five years.

Lawmakers claim the current felony charge for the crime is ‘discriminatory.’Foxnews.com reports: State Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat who introduced the bill, said the current law discriminates against people with HIV because people who expose others with different viruses get only a misdemeanor rather than a felony.“Right now HIV is singled out for uniquely harsh treatment as a felony,” Wiener said during the floor debate, according to the L.A. Times. He added that modern drugs allow someone with HIV to be noninfectious to others, while the felony charge may discourage some from getting tested.“These laws do not prevent HIV infections. All they do is stigmatize people living with HIV and reduce access to testing and care.”“These laws do not prevent HIV infections. All they do is stigmatize people living with HIV and reduce access to testing and care.”– State Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco DemocratThe bill – if passed – would also apply to people who donated semen or blood without disclosing they have HIV or AIDS.All Republicans came out against the bill, claiming a reduction in penalties for exposing someone to HIV puts the public at risk.“I’m of the mind that if you purposefully inflict another with a disease that alters their lifestyle the rest of their life, puts them on a regiment of medications to maintain any kind of normalcy, it should be a felony,” state Sen. Joel Anderson, of San Diego, said, the L.A. Times reported.“It’s absolutely crazy to me that we should go light on this,” he added, suggesting tougher penalties should be applicable to those with other diseases.“It’s absolutely crazy to me that we should go light on this.”– State Sen. Joel Anderson, San DiegoJeff Stone, a Republican senator and former pharmacist from Murrieta, said the law should remain unchanged as someone exposing their partner to HIV would “condemn one to probably $1 million in drug therapy for the rest of their lives.”

The same week that conservatives argued in the Supreme Court that employers should be able to stop their employees from getting contraception outside of the company health plan, Indiana joined the ranks of states like Texas and Florida in passing a draconian law that purports to protect women, while in fact, endangering their health by making safe abortion much harder to get. And Gov. Mike Pence recently signed it. The bill is stuffed with as many asinine restrictions on abortion with an eye towards making abortion as miserable and humiliating an experience as possible, and ideally something women can’t get legally at all.Asked to comment on his approval of a piece of legislation that basically promotes hatred towards women once stripped of all the legal terms, Pence argued in an interview with The Huffington Post that “abortion as such was a mistake since the day it was first invented.” “So, let’s get that straight right away – I oppose abortion for any reason whatsoever because I believe that killing someone, or something, if you will, that hasn’t developed a consciousness just yet is the ultimate act of crime. And if we’re murderers of innocent beings who can’t defend themselves, how are we to expect people with a fully developed consciousness to stop murdering each other?” the Indiana governor said.“And as if that wasn’t enough,” Pence continued, “we’ve got this situation now throughout different states where some lawmakers allow abortion under some circumstances like rape or when the fetus is diagnosed with an illness, and others just flat out prohibit it. And that’s bad for a number of reasons. First and foremost – we can’t have this kind of freedom of choice. This is bad, let’s be clear. And that’s part of the reason why I signed this bill, because I believe abortion, or I’m going to flat out call it murder, this murdering of children has to stop and it has to be prohibited in every state. So Indiana is just a step in the right direction.”Pence also tried to offer his opinion on what would have happened had he allowed rape victims to still have abortion. “First and foremost, because this is such a sensitive topic, let me just say that I sympathize with rape victims not just in America, but around the world. I can only imagine what it must be like to experience such trauma,” he said. “However, that does not justify murder, not even that justifies murdering a baby, not in my book. Because what would happen? We’d then have an epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion. And that has to be stopped at all cost.”Donald Trump’s new running mate also said, “Basically, if I’d have said no on the bill, that would be just like giving out get-pregnant-without-fear cards, because at the end of the day, women could have unprotected sex without worrying about what they’d do in the event of pregnancy. And you know, it’s not supposed to be like that. That would be equal to me picking up a butcher’s knife and slicing people open in the middle of the street. That would be murder. And I’m not a murderer.”“And it gets worse – when you get an abortion, you get several days off of work and whatnot to recover. And there are a lot of crazy people out there. What if women would go out and get raped on purpose just so they could get off work? I mean, Indiana’s economy is struggling as it is, and having thousands of women absent from their jobs would be horrific for the state, I’m telling you. I made the right call and that will be confirmed in the long run,” Pence concluded.Most Popular >>

Trump granted a Presidential pardon to Joe Arpaio, former Sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona. Arpaio’s life and career, which began at the age of 18 when he enlisted in the military after the outbreak of the Korean War, exemplify selfless public service. After serving in the Army, Arpaio became a police officer in Washington, D.C. and Las Vegas, NV and later served as a Special Agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), formerly the Bureau of Narcotics. After 25 years of admirable service, Arpaio went on to lead the DEA’s branch in Arizona.In 1992, the problems facing his community pulled Arpaio out of retirement to return to law enforcement. He ran and won a campaign to become Sheriff of Maricopa County. Throughout his time as Sheriff, Arpaio continued his life’s work of protecting the public from the scourges of crime and illegal immigration. Sheriff Joe Arpaio is now eighty-five years old, and after more than fifty years of admirable service to our Nation, he is worthy candidate for a Presidential pardon.The White House

Through the call-in program, C-SPAN encourages viewer interactivity by enabling viewers and listeners to talk directly to elected officials, policymakers, and journalists covering the national policy debate. C-SPAN frequently incorporates viewer call-ins into its programming schedule, both in regularly scheduled call-ins and open-phones programs that allow people to react to breaking news events.When was C-SPAN's first viewer call? On October 7, 1980, just 18 months into its history, C-SPAN inaugurated television's first-ever, regularly scheduled national viewer call-in program from the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., following a speech by then- FCC Chair Charles Ferris. C-SPAN's first caller was from Yankton, South Dakota. See the video here: /video/?6780-1/cspan-tenth-anniversary-retrospective&start=8889&end=9250 Now, where can viewer voices be heard regularly? C-SPAN frequently incorporates viewer calls into its live programming offerings. More regularly, calls are a major focus of the network's morning interview program Washington Journal (7 to 10am ET). The program is always live (except when a segment is replayed later) every day, 365 days a year. On January 4, 1995, Washington Journal replaced earlier call-in incarnations as C-SPAN's flagship viewer call-in program. See the video of that first Journal program here: /video/?62484-1 How is the program staffed and run - and who decides the guests? Washington Journal, guided by an Executive Producer, has a professional staff of producers, guest bookers, and production assistants who work as a team to decide what topics are covered on each day's program and which guests should be booked to discuss those topics. Each program strives to educate the viewing public about national issues and to learn from them.What is there to know about Washington Journal hosts? The role of the C-SPAN call-in host is to facilitate the dialogue between callers and our guests. Throughout its history, C-SPAN has drawn call-in hosts from its ranks; they host the program in addition to other roles at the network. The idea behind this practice is to avoid creating ""personalities"" so that the focus of the program remains on the guests and the callers.How many calls does Washington Journal air? The program strives to take about 60 callers per three-hour program-another way that callers are emphasized over comments and questions from the C-SPAN host. That translates into more than 400 calls per week - which works out roughly to 20,000 calls per year.What's the concept behind ""open phones"" segments? During open phone segments, viewers can discuss a topic or news item of their choosing, giving them an opportunity to drive the discussion. This open forum is a regular part of the Washington Journal, and also can be heard on other programming on all three C-SPAN television networks and C-SPAN Radio.How does C-SPAN deal with calls that are distasteful in nature or factually inaccurate? Our program is modeled on a live town hall format during which participants are encouraged to ask questions of our guests or express their opinions via phone calls, social media and emails. Our program hosts are tasked with being the facilitators of the on-air conversation. By dividing our call-in lines, we attempt to encourage a wide variety of view points during the program and it is the nature of an opinion forum that views will be expressed that some will find offensive. Being supporters of free speech, we don’t want our hosts to be arbiters of callers’ opinions. Nor can program hosts be expected to be on-the-fly fact checkers about the wide variety of subjects discussed on the program. Over the 30 plus years we’ve been airing call-in programs, we observed that the vast majority of our callers are respectful participants. However, if callers make ad hominem attacks or use indecent language, program hosts are expected to step in to cut off the call. Given that this involves quick judgment on their part in the midst of a live television production, it can be an imperfect process. Airing of callers opinions’ does not constitute endorsement of the views expressed, just as we do not endorse the opinions or analysis offered by the guests on our program. Are the calls aired live? Yes. This is another philosophical aspect of our ""town hall format."" We've always taken the calls as they come in so that the agenda is set by the callers, not by our producers in Washington. We don't screen - except if callers violate the 30-day rule, explained next - and we have different lines for different positions on issues. Typically these lines are for Republicans, Democrats, and Independents to ensure ideological diversity among callers, but they may be changed up for specific issues.Why the ""30-day rule"" for callers? To encourage an ""open dialogue' we don't want the program to be dominated by a small cadre of regular callers. The program hosts remind viewers to allow one month between calls to allow as many voices to be heard as possible. This is another ""not perfect"" aspect of the program--there are callers who violate this rule, as is sometimes pointed out by other regular listeners.Are telephone calls the only way viewer's voices are heard? No. In addition to calls, hosts will take viewers questions and comments via e-mail ( journal@c-span.org ) and Twitter ( @cspanwj ). Also, we frequently continue Washington Journal conversations on C-SPAN's Facebook page, and we welcome audience comments and a robust discussion there as well ( https://www.facebook.com/CSPAN ).How many people watch Washington Journal? C-SPAN's public affairs programming is available in nearly 100 million households. C-SPAN, as a non-commercial network, doesn't measure viewership; we conduct occasional demographic surveys to measure reach and impact. The most recent was a March 2013 survey, which estimated 47 million Americans watch C-SPAN regularly -- at least once or twice a week. We don't have viewing numbers for the Washington Journal but we know from several such surveys that the percentage of viewers who attempt to call in is approximately five percent.Guest Lineup"	
https://www.factcheck.org/2017/08/25-million-clinton-votes-werent-fake/	25 Million Clinton Votes Weren’t Fake	false	['National', 'voter fraud', 'Hillary Clinton']	http://yournewswire.com/	http://yournewswire.com/npr-25-million-fake-clinton-votes/	2017/08/03	Home News NPR: 25 Million Votes For Clinton ‘Completely Fake’ – She Lost Popular VoteNPR: 25 Million Votes For Clinton ‘Completely Fake’ – She Lost Popular VoteJanuary 29, 2017 Sean Adl-Tabatabai News , US 955A study published by NPR reveals that over 25 million Hillary Clinton votes were completely fraudulent, meaning that the Democratic candidate actually lost the popular vote by a huge margin. A study by the Pew Center claiming that over 800,000 non-citizens voted for Hillary Clinton failed to take into account dead and fraudulent voters which totalled over 25 million “registered voters”.According to reports, illegal aliens combined with dead voters and “multiple state” voters explains why Hillary appeared to have won the popular vote over Trump during this years presidential race.Infowars.com reports:“A report by the Pew Center on the States finds that more than 1.8 million dead people are currently registered to vote, and 24 million registrations are either invalid or inaccurate,” NPR reported in 2012, which is ironic given how NPR is heavily controlled by Democrats.And many of the dead, registered voters somehow keep voting Democrat from beyond the grave, most recently in Philadelphia, Penn. and Colorado .It’s also worth noting that the U.S. population has increased since 2012, meaning that there’s likely more dead and invalid voters than before.“…The Pew study found that almost 3 million people are registered to vote in more than one state,” NPR added.That’s because when a new resident registers to vote in a state, officials usually never bother to tell his former state about the change in voter residency.Under the “catch and release” immigration program by the Obama administration, illegal aliens were routinely given bus tickets to travel to other states by immigration officials, so it was theoretically possible for non-citizens to register to vote in a border country illegally, then register to vote in another state after their taxpayer-funded bus dropped them off.Clinton won most of the 163 most populous counties in the US that account for half of the total votes in the election, including dense urban areas in New York and California, yet she only won the popular vote by 2.8 million votes, which reveals the lack of enthusiasm voters had for her in comparison to Trump – and that Democrats would have depended more on illegal votes.A portion of the 24 million invalid voter registrations combined with a portion of the 1.8 million dead voters and the over 800,000 known illegal voters could explain the difference of 2.8 million votes, and it’s worth noting that the 800,000 figure could be a low, conservative estimate.That said, a popular vote victory is meaningless; if the president was elected by popular vote, then both Trump and Clinton would have campaigned in entirely different states because only densely population regions of the U.S. would decide who would become president.Without the electoral college, the United States of America would be reduced to the United States of New York and California, with 48 other vassal states.Yet notice how Clinton campaigned in other, less populated states. They knew the popular vote was meaningless ahead of the election.However, the popular vote is useful as a barometer for voter fraud since the most populous countries are also the most susceptible to election tampering by illegal, invalid and dead voters.	
https://www.factcheck.org/2017/08/celebrity-quote-mismatch/	Celebrity Quote Mismatch	false	['National', 'fake news', 'Kanye West', 'Kim Kardashian', 'Lana Del Ray', 'Rihanna']	http://pitchfork.com/	http://pitchfork.com/features/interview/life-liberty-and-the-pursuit-of-happiness-a-conversation-with-lana-del-rey/	2017/08/01	Share on TwitterOpen share drawerFamous artists are notoriously late, but when I arrive about 20 minutes early for an interview at Lana Del Rey ’s Santa Monica studio, she is ready for me, offering a handshake and a smile. It is the week before her new album, Lust for Life , will be released, but she seems unhurried and relaxed; when I ask if she’s been busy in the leadup to such a big day, she says “no” with a laugh, as if she knows she probably should be. She is not dressed like the glammed-up mystic you see in music videos and photographs: her hair, long and brown, is tied functionally behind her neck, and she is in a white T-shirt and blue jeans, with cream canvas sneakers and white ankle socks on her feet. Right away, she invites me through a side door into the inner sanctum where her brooding songs are created.For Lana acolytes, this is a mythic place. She has recorded here since 2012’s Born to Die , her major label debut. It is a beautiful room filled with sun coming in from a skylight and two windows, the opposite of the average dank music studio. It looks a bit like how you’d expect Lana Del Rey’s workplace to look: vaguely and warmly retro, with dark wood cabinets and a mid-century-looking painting with interlacing geometric shapes hanging on the back wall. In the center of the room is a scratched-up leather club chair with a Tammy Wynette album cover facing it. (“I always have Tammy there,” she says of the country singer best known for her ode to everlasting devotion, “Stand by Your Man.”) This chair, and not the actual booth in the front of the room, is where Lana sits to record her vocals. “I get red light fever in the booth,” she says. She likes that the studio is by the beach, where she’ll sometimes go to listen to mixes of songs on her iPhone.The studio is owned and operated by Rick Nowels , her longtime producer. He has come down today to listen to the album with us, a pair of sunglasses firmly on his face. Nowels has more than 20 years on Lana, who is 32, and he inhabits something of an uncle role, making the songwriter a bit bashful when he sweetly refers to a ballad called “When the World Was at War We Kept Dancing” as a “masterpiece” for its lyrical message about the importance of finding ways to have fun, even in the Trump era. Gearing up to record what would become Born to Die, Lana had met with a number of producers who all tried to tell her what she should or should not sound like, with some encouraging her to ditch the breathy vocal style that would become her signature. When she finally met Nowels, he didn’t want to change a thing. “I went through a hundred and eleven producers just to find someone who says ‘yes’ all the time,” she says. “Everyone is so obsessed with saying ‘no’—they break you down to build you up.”Lana is a studio junkie—Lust for Life is her fourth album in about five years. She says a day that she works is better than a day that she doesn’t. Nowels tells me that even though the new album isn’t out yet, she’s already making new music. “If I get a great melody in my head, I know it’s a gift,” she says. As we sit down to listen to Lust for Life, she is clearly at home: Like a good host, she offers me her comfy leather singing chair and instead curls up on a blue velvet couch nearby. She has a familial rapport with not just Nowels, but engineers Dean Reid and Kieron Menzies, who she credits again and again for making her work better, and the four of them ruminate on mastering, making jokes about Lana’s perfectionism when it comes to the final cuts of her songs.The album, like all of her work, is fastidiously and emphatically Lana in its sound and atmosphere: a haze of lazy pacing and flowery melodies, conjuring a foreboding backdrop for lyrics about summer and antique celebrity icons and dangerous, dissatisfying relationships. Front and center in the mix is her voice, which has a crooner’s tone and an especially wide range, from deep and low to high and sharp. Most pop stars rely on reinvention to retain relevance, but her output is remarkably consistent. She says her main criteria is whether or not a song sounds like it will transport listeners to somewhere else in their minds. On each album, the skeleton remains more or less the same while she infuses her work with stylistic elements from different genres, from rap to rock to jazz. Lust for Life draws from folk and hip-hop, two genres that she says she loves because they both privilege real storytelling.The new record is a departure in key ways, though. In the past, Lana has become famous for themes that are, at times, hopeless: toxic romance, violence, drug use, despair, aging, death. This isn’t to say every song she has ever recorded is a downer, or that she hasn’t displayed a knowing sense of humor about her reputation. But her relentless obsession with the dark arts is a reason why her fans love her with an almost religious fervor; she’s had issues with people breaking into her house. “They want to talk,” she says chillingly. Her menacing themes have also led to resistance at certain moments from larger audiences who, perhaps trained to think of pop music as a tool of empowerment and empathy, just can’t face her nihilism.While Lust for Life certainly has its share of grim moments, it is not as much of an avalanche of gloom, and perhaps offers signposts to a happier future. At times, Lana even approaches uncomplicated joy, like on first single “ Love .” The album also contains some of her first songs that deal with a universe larger than the tangled intensity of one-on-one relationships—there are tracks intended to be balms and battle cries for trying times, which, like many Americans, she found herself fretting over constantly during the 2016 election campaign. And for the first time on any Lana album, she’s also opening the door to a number of guest vocalists: A$AP Rocky, Playboi Carti, the Weeknd, Stevie Nicks, and Sean Ono Lennon on a Beatles-referencing song called “Tomorrow Never Came.” “I FaceTimed with Yoko, and she said it was her most favorite thing Sean’s ever done,” Lana says.After listening to the album, Lana and I peel off to a small office on the other side of the studio for our interview. Before we begin, she pulls out her iPhone to record the conversation along with me, a defensive move she’s taken up after years of feeling manipulated and harangued by the media. When answering questions, she is at turns thoughtful and strident, seriously considering topics like her attempts at a brighter life and how Trump has affected her love of Americana, and also entirely unafraid to bat away questions she finds boring or irrelevant. At one point, she laughs so hard at a silly sidebar in our conversation that she has a coughing fit and has to take a break. She says she binge watches “The Bachelor,” and that while all of her friends now call her Lana—not Elizabeth Grant, her birth name—her parents are the two people who do not. She is wry about the new song “ Groupie Love ,” in which she writes herself not as the star but in the role of a worshipful devotee: “Old habits die hard—I still love a rock star.” When I ask her if she is bothered by TMZ dating rumors, which have recently speculated about her relationship with rapper G-Eazy, she gives an unexpectedly goading answer: “They’re usually true. Maybe where there’s smoke there’s fire.”Which is to say: She’s kinda regular, not the hardened artist we’ve heard in her songs, but someone, it would seem, who likes to hang out and chat about life and music. Talking about good times brings up memories of rough ones, and when the conversation veers towards rocky terrain, she reveals an artist—and a person—at a pivotal moment.Pitchfork: A few years ago you were singing lyrics like “ I have nothing much to live for ,” and now you’re smiling on the cover of Lust for Life. How’d you get to a happier place? Lana Del Rey: I made personal commitments. Commitments to what?Well, they’re personal. [laughs] I had some people in my life that made me a worse person. I was not sure if I could step out of that box of familiarity, which was having a lot of people around me who had a lot of problems and feeling like that was home base. Because it’s all I know. I spent my whole life reasoning with crazy people. I felt like everyone deserved a chance, but they don’t. Sometimes you just have to step away without saying anything.Your past albums often presented a claustrophobic universe made up of just you and one other person, but all of a sudden it’s like you’ve got your eyes wide open and you’re looking at the world around you.Developmentally, I was in the same place for a very long time, and then it just took me longer than most people to be able to be more out there. Being more naturally shy, it’s taken stretching on my part to just continue to integrate into the local community, global community, to grow as a person. Also, getting really famous doesn’t help you grow with the community. It’s important to have your own life. It’s hard with how accessible things are. Hacking? Email is just a no for me. I do a lot to make sure I don’t feel trapped. Your fans are famously obsessive. Do they ever cross the line?They fucking have. Someone stole both my cars. All the scary shit. I’ve had people in my house for sure, and I didn’t know they were there while I was there. I fucking called the police. I locked the door. Obviously, that’s the one in one-hundred-thousand people who’s crazy. But I [had a hard time sleeping] for a minute.Fame can be isolating, but you are making a real effort to not let it be.It’s going to be isolating. Period. Unless you stretch past it. But it takes so much footwork. Getting over the uncomfortability of being the one person in the room who everyone recognizes. The last few years, I’m out all the time: clubs, bars, shows. For years I was more quietly in the mix, always through the back door, do not tell anyone I’m coming. And now I’ve relaxed into it where I’ll just show up. I don’t need a special ticket. I’ll just go sit wherever. It feels a little more like I’m myself again.If you’re happier these days, what do you think when you hear an old lyric from an old record, like, “He hit me and it felt like a kiss,” from “ Ultraviolence ”?I don’t like it. I don’t. I don’t sing it. I sing “Ultraviolence” but I don’t sing that line anymore. Having someone be aggressive in a relationship was the only relationship I knew. I’m not going to say that that [lyric] was 100 percent true, but I do feel comfortable saying what I was used to was a difficult, tumultuous relationship, and it wasn’t because of me. It didn’t come from my end. Now you want to present a different face to the world on Lust for Life?No. I don’t care. I would just say I am different. And even being a little bit different makes me not want to sing that line. To me, it just was what it was. I deal with what’s in my lyric—you’re not dealing with it. I was annoyed when people would ask me about that lyric. Like, who are you?Do you think you romanticize danger in your music?No. I don’t like it. It’s just the only thing [I’ve known]. So I’m trying to do a new thing. I never wrote better when I had a lot of turmoil going on. Born to Die was already done before any of the shit hit the fan. When things are good, the music is better. I’m trying to change from the way I thought things were gonna be to what I feel like they could be, which is maybe just brighter. But, even with some new perspectives, Lust for Life is still very melancholy at moments. If you make sad music, which you’ve done for so long, does it necessarily mean you’re sad?Yeah. I think for most people, regardless of what they say, it’s probably a direct reflection of their inner world. With my first record, I didn’t feel upset. I felt very excited, and then I felt a little more confused.After the release of Born to Die, you faced a lot of criticism, partly around the issue of whether you were or were not authentic. Do you think of yourself as authentic?Of course. I’m always being myself. They don’t know what authentic is. If you think of all the music that came out until 2013, it was super straight and shiny. If that’s authentic to you, this is going to look like the opposite. I think that shit is stylized. Just because I do my hair big does not mean I’m a product. If anything, I’m doing my own hair, stuffing my own fucking stuffing in there if I have a beehive. Music was in a super weird place when I became known, and I didn’t really like any of it.Did you ever feel like the criticism had a misogynistic bent? No. Women hated me. I know why. It’s because there were things I was saying that either they just couldn’t connect to or were maybe worried that, if they were in the same situation, it would put them in a vulnerable place.You weren’t singing empowering things.No, I wasn’t. That wasn’t my angle. I didn’t really have an angle—that’s the thing.Have you noticed that all songs on the radio are bummers now? That Lil Uzi Vert lyric—“ All my friends are dead ”—sounds almost like a Lana lyric.There’s been a major sonic shift culturally. I think I had a lot to do with that. I do. I hear a lot of music that sounds like those early records. It would be weird to say that it didn’t. I remember seven years ago I was trying to get a record deal, and people were like, “Are you kidding? These tunes? There’s zero market for this.” There was just such a long time where people had to fit into that pop box. With all the flak you’ve received over the years, particularly after Born to Die, some people would have thrown in the towel. But you doubled down and made an even more fucked up, almost hyper-Lana record with Ultraviolence. I so double downed. [The early criticism] made me question myself—I didn’t know if it was always going to be that way. You can’t put out records if 90 percent of the reviews in places like the Times are going to be negative. That would be crazy. It would have made sense to step all the way back, but I was like, Let me put out three more records and see if I can just stand in the eye of the storm. Not shift too much. Let me just take some of the [production] off so you can hear things a little bit better; I thought people were maybe getting distracted. I did the same thing with Honeymoon. Everyone around here heard it and was like, “It’s a cool record, but you know it’s not going to be on the radio, right?” And I was like, “Yeah. I told [record executive] Jimmy [Iovine] when I signed, ‘If you want to sign me, this is all it’s ever going to be.’” I was just so committed to making music because I believe in what I do. All I had to do was not quit.So that Ultraviolence woman who is so swept up in turmoil—is she still there on Lust for Life?We’ll see. That’s been my experience up until now, but, like, I’m trying.Some of the sparer, really heartfelt songs on Lust for Life reminded me of the Ultraviolence song “ Black Beauty .”That’s a sad song. In that song—[sings] I keep my lips red like cherries in the spring/Darling, you can’t let everything seem so dark blue—that’s a girl who is still seeing the blue sky and a putting on a pop of color just for herself. But this [other] person—it was all black for them. And my world became inky with those overtones. [At this, Lana begins to cry, and we pause for a moment.] What made you cry just now?In that moment, when I said “pop of color,” I was connected to that feeling of only being able to see a portion of the world in color. And when you feel that way, you can feel trapped.Are you seeing the world in color now? [sighs] I don’t really know how to describe my perspective at the moment. But you’re trying, and that’s what Lust for Life is about?It’s not. I don’t know what it’s about. I don’t know what it is. Is the album a way of saying that you at least want to be happy?No. It’s just that something is happening.What makes you happy?I’m really simple. I love nature. I like hikes. Being by the water—I don’t always get in. I love the elements. Playing an outdoor festival. Love that feeling.What bums you out? Is there a storyline to the album? Yeah.What’s the story? You have to figure it out.Just a few years ago you were saying you didn’t care about feminism, and now you are writing protest songs and meditations on war and peace.Because things have shifted culturally. It’s more appropriate now than under the Obama administration, where at least everyone I knew felt safe. It was a good time. We were on the up-and-up. Women started to feel less safe under this administration instantly. What if they take away Planned Parenthood? What if we can’t get birth control? Now, when people ask me those questions, I feel a little differently. The reason why I asked Stevie Nicks to be on the record is because she changes when her environment changes, and I’m like that as well. In “When the World Was at War We Kept Dancing,” I wrote, “Boys, don’t make too much noise/Don’t try to be funny/Other people may not be understanding.” Like, Can you tone down your over-boisterous rhetoric that isn’t working? “God Bless America - And All the Beautiful Women in It” is a little shoutout to the women and anyone else who doesn’t always feel safe walking down the street late at night. That’s what I was thinking of when I wrote, “Even when I’m alone I’m not lonely/I feel your arms around me.” It’s not always how I feel when I’m walking down the street, but sometimes in my music I try to write about a place that I’m going to get to.Do you feel unsafe? I feel less safe than I did when Obama was president. When you have a leader at the top of the pyramid who is casually being loud and funny about things like that, it’s brought up character defects in people who already have the propensity to be violent towards women. I saw it right away in L.A. Walking down the street, people would just say things to you that I had never heard.When people asked me the feminist question before, I was like, “I’m not really experiencing personal discrimination as a woman. I feel like I’m doing well. I headline shows just like the Weeknd does. I got tons of women in my life, love women, support women.” I just felt like, Why don’t we talk about the music first? I can tell you that what I have done for women is tell my own story, and that’s all anyone can do. Is it harder to be romantic about America when Trump is the nation’s biggest celebrity?It’s certainly uncomfortable. I definitely changed my visuals on my tour videos. I’m not going to have the American flag waving while I’m singing “Born to Die.” It’s not going to happen. I’d rather have static. It’s a transitional period, and I’m super aware of that. I think it would be inappropriate to be in France with an American flag. It would feel weird to me now—it didn’t feel weird in 2013. All the guys in the studio—we didn’t know we were going to start walking in every day and talking about what was going on. We hadn’t ever done that before, but everyday during the election, you’d wake up and some new horrible thing was happening. Korea, with missiles suddenly being pointed at the western coast. With “When the World Was at War We Kept Dancing,” I was posing a real question to myself: Could this be the end of an era? The fall of Rome?Nostalgia can be really corny when it’s not done well, and you’re all about nostalgia. How do you try to get it right?I know I walk the line sometimes. [laughs] I saw comments that people said about my little “Coachella - Woodstock in my Mind” song. I write that title and I’m like, OK, I know I went there. But I think it’s amazing. It’s on the nose. It’s so on the nose. But sometimes things just are what they are. I’m at Coachella for three days, and North Korea is pointing a missile at us, and I’m watching Father John Misty with my best friend, who’s his wife—that’s all I’m literally saying. It’s just like, Yeah, I’m a hipster. I know it. Got it.You mentioned working with Stevie Nicks on this album, what was it like recording with her? She came in straight off a plane from her last show of like 60 cities, which I was actually supposed to open for. She had asked me, and I was like, “Oh my god.” But I couldn’t because I don’t want to do a 60-show tour.She flew through the door. Blond highlights, rose gold glasses, gold-tipped nails, rose gold lipstick, gold chains, gold rings, black on black on black. Very stylish. And meanwhile, I looked like a housewife of 15—flannel on flannel, because it was a cold night. And I was like, Why did I not dress up for Stevie Nicks?At the end of the track, she sings, then I sing, then she sings. I was kinda embarrassed. I was like, “I sound so little compared to you.” And she was like, “That’s good, you’re my little echo.” And I was like, Stevie called me her little echo. It’s a stupid little thing, but she was very nurturing in that way, and not belittling of the fact that I had a more breathy voice. Which I wasn’t even aware of until I was shoulder-to-shoulder on a track with someone with less air in their voice. I felt a little more exposed in that moment. But she was like, “That’s you. You just be you.” Speaking of musical icons, can you tell me about performing at Kim and Kanye’s wedding party?It was a surprise for Kim. I hadn’t met her. I sang “Young and Beautiful,” “Summertime Sadness,” “Blue Jeans.” Kanye requested “Young and Beautiful.” The girls—the Kardashians—were so nice. There was only one front row, just them, right there. They were living for it. They started playing Kanye and Jay-Z records for the rest of the thing and it rained and everyone was just up dancing in the rain. I stayed for like 40 minutes and then I left.People have made a big deal about that necklace you are selling that seems to have a coke spoon. Is it a coke spoon?Yeah. It’s funny. I have a flask and a lighter as well. I don’t do coke.You’ve said in the past that you weren’t drinking either, and yet it turns up in your music. Do you drink now?No comment. You sing about drugs and alcohol a lot.Not on this record. I well used to do a lot of drugs, but I actively don’t now.What kind of drugs did you do?No comment. [laughs] But I think the coke spoon is kinda funny. I’m just like, Whatever. I don’t think it’s going to make anyone do coke.Are you conscious of when you walk right up to a taboo in your work?Not really. That’s the one thing I don’t have my finger on. I am there, but there are times I don’t really know it. There’s certain stuff that I think is kinda dope that I know other people might be like, Okayyyyy.Like singing about death?That’s real life though. Super real life.You got a lot of shit for saying “I wish I was dead” to a journalist a few years ago.Fuck that guy, though. I didn’t think he would print it and make it the headline. I was having a really tough time. I had been on the road for a year. I was really struggling. I was just stupid, I was like, “I fucking want to die.” Maybe I meant it. I don’t really know. Which of your albums is the most autobiographical?All of them. The last record—I listen to a song like “ Terrence Loves You ,” and I just really feel for myself at the time. The person I’m singing about—[sings] You are what you are/I don’t matter to anyone—did I really just say I don’t matter to anyone? That’s fucking crazy. Did you feel that way?I guess so. I sang it.What makes you feel proud?My records. I love my records. I love them. I’m proud of the way I’ve put parts of my story into songs in ways that only I understand. In terms of my gauge of what’s good, it’s really just what I think. I have an internal framework that is the only thing I measure it by. My own opinion is really important to me. It starts and stops there.

Dispensaries and clinics will be opening in October of this year and begin taking new patients. There are many medicinal reasons for medical marijuana in the state of Indiana as explained by Dr. Reginald Vanderhough, a medical scientist at Indiana State University. Our surrounding states have all agreed to legalize marijuana and the use of THC products for medicinal reasons only and have given patients that are in need of this drug a medical card that will cover various types of marijuana and THC products. “It works like an insurance card” states Dr. Vanderhough, all they need to do is present it at their local dispensary and they will have a choice between hundreds of products but will be limited to the amount of purchases they can make within a certain time.

During an interview that aired on Tuesday, Fox News host Brian Kilmeade asked Ryan to respond to a recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report that said there would be 22 million more people without health insurance by 2026 if the Senate’s version of the health care bill is signed into law. “What they are basically saying at the Congressional Budget Office, if you’re not going to force people to buy Obamacare, if you’re not going to force people to buy something they don’t want, then they won’t buy it,” the Speaker opined. “So, it’s not that people are getting pushed off a plan, it’s that people will choose not to buy something that they don’t like or want.”Kilmeade then asked Ryan to comment on the fact that the Republican health care platform is going to make health insurance plans significantly less affordable by decreasing subsidies for poorer Americans. Ryan replied by ranting about how being poor is “a choice.” “This is something we’ve been over on more than once occasion,” Ryan said. “I know why you’re asking me this; you want me to feel guilty for depriving 22 million people of health insurance, right? Well, I’m sorry Brian, but it’s not working. And the reason why it’s not working is, you’re using the wrong logic here. You’re using the wrong logic alongside millions of other Americans, because all of you feel that those who get up every day and work hard for some reason owe something to those who just lie around doing nothing. That’s not right.”“Why should anybody who has the willpower to tackle problems and obstacles in order to provide a good life for themselves and their family be obligated to set aside some of their hard earned money to help other people who don’t want to work hard and, instead, rely on policymakers to ensure they have welfare or, in this case, affordable health insurance?” Ryan opined. “The answer is – they shouldn’t. This is a land of opportunities; but, the thing is, to be able to capitalize on those opportunities, one has to be willing to work hard. And that’s the only condition, working hard. If you work your butt off every single day, you can afford whatever you want, including the best health insurance possible. Now we arrive at my ultimate point: if you choose to work hard, if that’s a choice you make every time you wake up in the morning, then this is something that guarantees your success. But, if you choose to be lazy all day and expect the government to take care of you, then you’re doomed.”“Being rich or poor is a matter of choice; that’s all there is to it. So, let me ask you this, Brian: if 22 million people consciously make the choice to not work hard day in and day out, why on earth should the rest of us be concerned with whether or not they’re going to be healthy? If they choose to be poor, then it’s their own problem if they can’t afford to be healthy. Think of the message we’d be sending to poor people around the world by nurturing laziness and providing affordable healthcare to poor people. We’d be sending them an open invitation to come here and do nothing. ‘Just come on over and become a U.S. citizen – the government will get you free food, free shelter and free health insurance, and you don’t even have to get a job.’ That’s preposterous, anyone who thinks that’s a good thing deserves to be poor,” he concluded.Most Popular >>

Trump Tweet Unites a Bewildered NationImageAn image of President Trump’s Twitter account. “Despite the constant negative press covfefe,” the post began, at 12:06 a.m. And there it ended.By Matt FlegenheimerMay 31, 2017WASHINGTON — And on the 132nd day, just after midnight, President Trump had at last delivered the nation to something approaching unity — in bewilderment, if nothing else.The state of our union was … covfefe.The trouble began, as it so often does, on Twitter, in the early minutes of Wednesday morning. Mr. Trump had something to say. Kind of.“Despite the constant negative press covfefe,” the Twitter post began, at 12:06 a.m., from @realDonaldTrump, the irrepressible internal monologue of his presidency.And that was that.A minute passed. Then another. Then five.Surely he would delete the message.Ten. Twenty. It was nearly 12:30 a.m.Forty minutes. An hour. The questions mounted.Had the president’s lawyers, so eager to curb his stream-of-consciousness missives, tackled the commander in chief under the cover of night?Perhaps, some worried aloud, Mr. Trump had experienced a medical episode a quarter of the way through his 140 characters.Or maybe he had simply gazed upon his work, paused and thought: “Yes. Nailed it.”No one at the White House could immediately be reached for comment overnight.But by 1 a.m., the debate had effectively consumed Twitter — or at least a certain segment of insomniac Beltway types, often journalists and political operatives — ascending the list of trending topics. “Of course #covfefe is real word,” wrote @Diane_7A , recalling an invented tragedy once invoked by the Trump White House. “It was coined during the Bowling Green Massacre .”“What if this is it,” asked Emily Nussbaum , The New Yorker television critic, after just five minutes. “That is his final tweet & the rest of history stops.”Some appeared to temper their whimsy as more sobering news dominated the medium: a huge explosion in Kabul , Afghanistan, leaving dozens dead or wounded.Yet the instinct to linger was powerful, for those who had glimpsed the initial post, even if they did not seem entirely sure why they were still awake.“Covfefe,” said Tasneem Raja , a journalist, perhaps chafing at the growing communal giddiness. “There, I participated.”Eventually, the jokes lurched into delirium. Twitter users held forth on the former F.B.I. director James Covfefe. They pledged to order a grande covfefe during their next Starbucks runs. They announced they had at last discovered what Bill Murray whispered to Scarlett Johansson at the end of “Lost in Translation.”And as the hour wore on, stragglers turned their lonely eyes to the only account that could save them. “Help, @MerriamWebster,” pleaded Jessica Taylor , a reporter at NPR, one of several to make the request.The dictionary obliged .“Wakes up. Checks Twitter. Uh...” it began . “Regrets checking Twitter. Goes back to bed.”Just after 6 a.m., the president resurfaced, finally deleting the Twitter post and tapping out another.“Who can figure out the true meaning of ‘covfefe’ ???” he wrote. “Enjoy!”Little became clearer in daylight hours.Consensus proved elusive — to say nothing of pronunciation guidelines — and the White House appeared disinclined to help. “The president and a small group of people know exactly what he meant,” Sean Spicer, the press secretary, said flatly. He did not elaborate.But someone else had a theory — the American perhaps most attuned to the power of the president’s Twittering hand. “I thought it was a hidden message,” Hillary Clinton told a crowd in California, “to the Russians.”Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook , Twitter and in the Morning Briefing newsletter .A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A15 of the New York edition with the headline: Trump’s ‘Covfefe’ Tweet Unites U.S. in Confusion.

https://www.factcheck.org/2017/06/fake-dig-dumb-scientists/	Fake Dig at ‘Dumb’ Scientists	false	['National', 'fake news', 'science', 'USDA', 'Sam Clovis']	https://www.washingtonpost.com/	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/05/13/trumps-expected-choice-for-the-leading-usda-science-job-isnt-a-trained-scientist/?utm_term=.71191dd9f8fb	2017/06/06	The Trump administration is planning to nominate Sam Clovis — the Department of Agriculture’s senior White House adviser — as head of USDA’s Research, Education and Economics division, according to individuals briefed on the decision. The move would mark a break with recent Republican and Democratic administrations alike, which have previously reserved the high-level position for scientists with expertise in agricultural research. Clovis — a former economics professor and talk radio host in Iowa who served as one of the Trump campaign’s first policy advisers — has bachelor’s degrees in political science and government, a master’s in business administration and a doctoral degree in public administration, according to his LinkedIn page. In other public biographies he’s emphasized his 25-year stint in the Air Force and expertise in national security and foreign policy. As Agriculture’s White House senior adviser, Clovis has played a key role in the department since President Trump took office. He helped run USDA during the time before Secretary Sonny Perdue took office, and he signed off on directives such as one employees received just after Inauguration Day that instructed them to clear any public communications in advance with the secretary’s office. The job he’s now under consideration for, Agriculture’s undersecretary of research, education and economics, ranks as a top-level science position that oversees the department’s extensive scientific mission. The department’s chief scientist also oversees Agriculture’s economic bureaus, including the Natural Agricultural Statistics Service and the Economic Research Service. Clovis’s expertise appears most closely related to these bureaus. The possible appointment of Clovis was first suggested Friday by Agri-Pulse. An Agriculture spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday. Congress established the post in the 1994 Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act, and during the past two presidential administrations, it has been occupied by scientists and public health professionals. In 2001, then-President George W. Bush appointed to the post Joseph Jen, a comparative biochemistry PhD who had previously headed the University of Georgia’s Division of Food Science and Technology and served as the dean of the College of Agriculture at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. Bush later nominated Gale Buchanan, a plant physiologist, to the post in 2006. When Barack Obama took office he tapped Rajiv Shah, who holds both a medical degree and a master of science in health economics from the University of Pennsylvania, for the post. Catherine Woteki, who earned her doctorate from Virginia Tech and held senior positions at USDA, Health and Human Services and the White House Office of Science and Technology, served as Agriculture’s chief scientist from Sept. 16, 2010 until Jan. 20, 2017. A food nutrition expert, Woteki served as Iowa State University’s dean of agriculture for five years between Bill Clinton’s and Obama’s time in office. The current acting undersecretary, Ann Bartuska, is described as an ecosystem ecologist who’s served on multiple scientific councils and panels, including the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. Ricardo Salvador, director of the Food and Environment Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, criticized the prospect of Clovis’s selection. “If the president goes forward with this nomination, it’ll be yet another example of blatant dismissal of the value of scientific expertise among his administration appointees,” Salvador said in a statement. In the same radio interview, Clovis said, “I have enough of a science background to know when I’m being boofed,” though he did not detail any past research experience involving the hard sciences. While Clovis does not appear to have conducted extensive research in the hard sciences, he is a veteran Republican Party activist who joined Trump’s presidential campaign. In addition to working as a talk radio host, he served as a professor of economics at Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa, and made an unsuccessful run for the U.S. Senate in 2014. In 2015, Clovis took a leave of absence from his position at Morningside College to join the Trump campaign as a chief policy adviser. Chris Mooney contributed to this report.

Participants' general health and fitness are evaluated prior to the 90-day test period. Image Credit: Heather ArchulettaEarlier this year Heather Archuletta experienced what it's like to be in space -- well, sort of. Archuletta lay in bed for nearly two months as part of NASA's bed rest study. The study simulates the effects of long-duration spaceflight by having test subjects lie in beds for 90 days. (Archuletta's study was cut short by Hurricane Ike.) The beds are tilted head-down at a six-degree angle. This tilt causes body fluids to shift to the upper part of the body much like they do in space. ""I don't think I could ever do what a real astronaut does, but I am happy to mimic their journey for the sake of keeping future ones more healthy,"" Archuletta said. Through bed rest studies, NASA scientists develop new ways to keep astronauts healthier when they spend a long time in the microgravity of space. NASA calls these methods countermeasures. NASA uses countermeasures to minimize the changes that occur to the body during spaceflight and to enable the return of normal body functions once back on Earth. The studies are conducted at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas, as part of the Flight Analog Project at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. The facility opened in 2005, but project manager Joe Neigut said the concept of bed rest studies has been around for a long time. ""What we're trying to do with bed rest is enable researchers to be able to perform science and different areas of research on these subjects,"" Neigut said. ""We're really about countermeasures and trying to use our facility to test countermeasures that may end up in flight."" While in space, astronauts are limited in the amount of time they spend conducting research. So, scientists have to be selective about what new countermeasures are submitted for in-flight testing. Being able to test new ideas on Earth saves invaluable flight time, Neigut said. So just what exactly goes on while people are lying in bed for a 90-day bed rest study? During the 90-day bed rest study, participants do everything in bed, from showering to eating to socializing with other participants. Image Credit: NASA""They do basically everything in bed, and they're not allowed to get up until the 90 days is over,"" said Ronita Cromwell, the Flight Analogs Project scientist. ""They are allowed to move in bed. We encourage them to use their upper bodies, which mimics the astronauts who rely more on their upper bodies for mobility while in space."" Archuletta said the hardest adjustment for her was not being able to get out of bed and exercise every day. ""I always get out of bed and either run, go rollerblading or to the gym,"" she said. ""That's a big change, and I have bottled-up energy in place of all the calories I'm not burning."" Another recent participant, 27-year-old Devin Juel, related the feeling of lying in bed to that of a baby who can't walk. An electrical engineer and machinist from Iowa, Juel said his biggest challenge during the study was depending on someone else and asking for help for nearly everything. ""At first it felt like my head and upper torso was underwater, like under pressure,"" Juel said. ""But after a few days it went away (and felt) normal."" Study participants have access to television, movies, video games, computers and the Internet to help them occupy their time during bed rest studies. Image Credit: NASANeigut said the most common misconception is that a bed rest study is a sleep study. It is not a sleep study, and in fact participants are not allowed to sleep during the day. ""If you walk though our unit, you will not see people lying around bored,"" Neigut said. ""They're very busy. Their phones are ringing. They're usually enjoying themselves. Sometimes they'll bring musical instruments. ... After a few days it feels very normal to them."" Participants also interact with each other, have televisions in their rooms, and have access to board games, video games, computers and the Internet. Cromwell said the project encourages people to have a goal, such as learning a language or taking an online course. During Archuletta's bed rest study, the 38-year-old learned sign language and studied for graduate school. ""It's all about putting the free time to good use when you can't move around much,"" she said. The San Francisco native said the study gave her a good break from her work routine as an information technology specialist and gave her a chance to catch up on her reading. She initially applied for the study just to see what questions were asked on the application. ""When screeners contacted me, I considered it carefully, due to the risks, but finally felt I couldnâ€™t pass up the opportunity!"" Archuletta said. ""I've always been fascinated by space exploration, launches, NASA artifacts and so on."" She said it was a privilege to help NASA achieve its space goals to go to the moon and beyond. A mission to Mars, for example, would take at least six months just to reach the planet. Astronauts may then live on the surface for 18 months. ""When we land on the Red Planet, we need people healthy enough to walk about! ... I imagine what it would be like to see on the news that a manned trip to Mars was successful, and I will get to say, 'When I was young, I was a small part of helping to make that happen.'"" Astronaut Peggy Whitson has spent a total of 377 days in space and currently holds the U.S. record for the most days in space. Image Credit: NASABorn in 1969 -- the same year as the first moon landing -- Archuletta said she is in awe of how far spaceflight has come and also where it's headed just in her own lifetime. ""When I was a child, going into space for three days was amazing. This last astronaut who stayed in the space station long-term, Garrett Reisman of STS-124, was there for nearly 96 days, and another will soon be going to the ISS (International Space Station) for six months. Two of my 'heroes' are the first female shuttle commander Eileen Collins and also astronaut Peggy Whitson, who holds the American record for spending more than a year of her life (377 days) in space! ""I think sometimes people forget to pause and ponder how truly incredible that is and the dedication it takes. Humans have made such remarkable efforts in terms of exploration, and maybe sometimes we forget how special it is to even have the capability to leave the planet.""

Describing Hollywood as “the base of the entire modern American culture“, the group also claims to be speaking on behalf of “all of humanity.”“It’s about time people understood that we’re the ones with the power and that the president is there to serve us, not the other way around“, a spokesperson for the group told The New York Times.“We’re calling for a general strike that would include every single person involved in making motion pictures in Hollywood, starting with the actors and celebrities themselves and encompassing companies in charge of making props, movie memorabilia and even souvenir shops.”Spinzon reports : Rosie O’Donnell, Debra Messing, Ed Asner and Michael Shannon are among the dozens of artists, entertainers, and activists who have attached their names to an effort calling for a month-long protest to stop President Donald Trump.“No! In the Name of Humanity We Refuse to Accept a Fascist America!” reads a full-page ad placed in the New York Times on Wednesday by the group Refuse Racism. “Donald Trump, the President, is assembling a regime of grave danger,” the ad says.“Millions of people in the US and around the world are filled with deep anxiety, fear and disgust. Our anguish is right and just. Our anger must now become massive resistance”Other Hollywood celebrities who have also joined the campaign, however, are calling for an all-out strike that would span the entire movie industry in the hopes that such a move would urge the President to resign from his position as the newly elected President of the United States.“We’re calling for a general strike that would include every single person involved in making motion pictures in Hollywood, starting with the actors and celebrities themselves and encompassing companies in charge of making props, movie memorabilia and even souvenir shops,” a spokesperson for the Refuse Racism group told The New York Times. “It’s about time people understood that we’re the ones with the power and that the president is there to serve us, not the other way around.”Asked to elaborate on why the group is targeting Hollywood out of all the industries in the country as their bargaining chip, the spokesperson argued that Hollywood “is, simply put, the base of the entire modern American culture. It is the foundation of the country, so to speak, the glue that’s holding it together. And think about what happens when you destroy the foundation of a house. It comes crashing down, right? Well, that’s exactly what’s going to happen to America unless Donald Trump realizes how real the danger of that actually is, and chooses to step down as President of his own free will. And while we’re on the subject, between you and me – nobody wants Hollywood to stop doing its thing, but this is a necessary move.”“Besides, it’s not like the billionaire-businessman-turned-president hasn’t ventured into movies in his day, right? So, he’ll understand firsthand what’s going to happen if Hollywood goes to strike. Without the work of Hollywood and the lifestyle promoted by it, there will literally be no more America to rule for Trump. So, in effect, it’s not us that are going to force Donald Trump to resign his office; it’s the people of America who are going to make him do it, because the God’s honest truth is – without Hollywood, there is no America. It’s like trying to run Nazi Germany without Hitler at the forefront – it just becomes pointless,” the spokesperson concluded.Search for:

https://www.factcheck.org/2017/05/no-first-grandma-charges/	No ‘First Grandma’ Charges	false	['National', 'Marian Robinson']	https://web.archive.org/	https://web.archive.org/web/20161026173831/http://thebostontribune.com/first-grandma-marian-robinson-receive-lifetime-160k-government-pension/	2017/05/09	tweetPhoto by Steve Jurvetson via Flickr (CC BY 4.0)Washington D.C. – First Grandma Marian Robinson, 79, will receive a lifetime 160K government pension when she leaves the White House next year, according to congressional budget statements.According to documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Mrs. Robinson earned the lifetime pension for “services rendered as full-time/in-home caregiver” for granddaughters Malia, 18, and Sasha, 15, during President Obama’s two terms in office.In January of 2009, it was reported that Mrs. Robinson was living in the White House full-time to tend to her granddaughters. She was the first live-in grandmother at the White House since Elivera M. Doud, the mother of Mamie Eisenhower, during the Eisenhower Administration.Critics say Mrs. Robinson should not profit from something as simple as taking care of family. Sally Kellner, volunteer/activist for the National Taxpayers Union , says this is a prime example of needless spending. “I think it’s ridiculous that taxpayers must pay this woman a lifetime salary for something everyday Americans do for free. We take care of our families because we love them, not for profit.”When asked if Mrs. Robinson’s lifetime pension was justified, Senator Mike Enzi (R-WY), Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, declined to comment but said a special oversight committee would review all post-Obama Administration budgetary obligations.Before her son-in-law became President of the United States, Mrs. Robinson had never been abroad. Now, after almost eight years of being the nation’s Grandmother-In-Chief, she’s a seasoned world traveler who has, accompanied by her granddaughters, been to Senegal, Tanzania, China and Italy, where she even met the Pope.“She’s been the rock of the family,” says Obama family friend and biographer Peter Slevin. “It’s been a real blessing for the girls (Malia & Sasha) to have their grandma with them during these formative years,” he said.Shortly after the 2008 presidential election, President Obama called Robinson “One of the unsung heroes” of his campaign, and said, “We couldn’t have done it without her.” First Lady Michelle Obama has said that if Robinson had not been available to step in and watch over the girls, Obama might never have launched his campaign.While holding no official job title, Mrs. Robinson likely qualified for her lifetime pension under the “optional” eligibility requirement for the Civil Service Retirement Act (CSRS).	
https://www.factcheck.org/2017/04/scotus-didnt-ban-teaching-islam/	SCOTUS Didn’t Ban Teaching About Islam	false	['National', 'Islam', 'religion', 'supreme court', 'Neil Gorsuch']	http://www.cnn.com/	http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/07/politics/neil-gorsuch-senate-vote/	2017/04/21	"Gorsuch's confirmation essentially continues the ideological balance that existed before Scalia's death, with four conservatives, four liberals and Justice Anthony Kennedy as a swing vote between the blocs. At the same time, several justices are over 70 years of age, and retirement rumors surrounding Kennedy could give Trump other opportunities during his presidency to add to the conservative bloc. ""He has sterling credentials, an excellent record and an ideal judicial temperament,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. ""He has the independence of mind for fairness."" Gorsuch is a former clerk for Kennedy, who will swear in the newest associate justice Monday. It will mark the first time a law clerk and the justice he or she served for will sit on the bench together. Democrats consistently tried to tie Gorsuch to Trump, suggesting he won't be independent from the President who nominated him. ""I hope Judge Gorsuch has listened to our debate here in the Senate, particularly about our concerns about the Supreme Court increasingly drifting towards becoming a more pro-corporate court that favors employers, corporations and special interests over working Americans,"" said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer. ""So we are charging Judge Gorsuch to be the independent and fair-minded justice that America badly needs. If he is instead a justice for the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation, that will spell trouble for America."" During his Senate hearings last month, Gorsuch sought to address those attacks head-on, insisting he ""doesn't give a whit"" about politics, and that he treats his plaintiffs fairly. Democrats eventually staged a filibuster of Gorsuch this week, leading Senate Republicans triggered the so-called ""nuclear option."" The move changed Senate rules to allow them to break the filibuster with only 51 votes rather than the traditional 60, something senators on both sides of the aisle said could change the chamber's role in the political sphere. But despite the opposition to Gorsuch, his confirmation was never seriously in doubt and he flew remarkably under the radar. After Trump nominated Gorsuch on January 31, he essentially enjoyed a stealth confirmation process, as near daily stories from the White House overshadowed the fight. Democrats were often drowned out and distracted by issues ranging from the investigation over Russia's activities in the 2016 presidential election to the March effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Gorsuch's opinions on religious liberty, where he sided with the challengers to the so-called Obamacare contraceptive mandate, and on the separation of powers, where he said too much deference was given by the courts to administrative agencies, are key to his appeal to Trump and Republicans. During his time on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, Gorsuch joined an opinion siding with closely held corporations who believed that the so-called contraceptive mandate of Obamacare violated their religious beliefs. The ruling was later upheld by the Supreme Court. Gorsuch wrote separately holding that the mandate infringed upon the owners' religious beliefs ""requiring them to lend what their religion teaches to be an impermissible degree of assistance to the commission of what their religion teaches to be a moral wrong."" He also wrote a majority opinion in a separation of powers case holding that too much deference was given to administrative agencies. This issue is a favorite of conservatives and Gorsuch's beliefs align with those of Scalia and Justice Clarence Thomas. Gorsuch, in a speech last year at Case Western Reserve University School of law, aligned himself with Scalia's judicial philosophy. ""The great project of Justice Scalia's career was to remind us of the differences between judges and legislators. To remind us that legislators may appeal to their own moral convictions and to claims about social utility to reshape the law as they think it should be in the future, "" he said. ""But that judges should do none of these things in a democratic society."" While Gorsuch is a fourth-generation Coloradan, his confirmation means a return to Washington and the Supreme Court. He is a former clerk to both Justices Byron White and Kennedy. He also spent part of his youth in Washington when his mother, Anne Gorsuch Burford, served in the Reagan administration as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. She resigned in 1983 under controversy after refusing to turn over toxic waste records to Congress. He served as a partner at a prestigious Washington Law firm, Kellogg, Huber as well as Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General. Gorsuch and his wife, Louise, have two daughters. They currently live in Boulder, Colorado."
