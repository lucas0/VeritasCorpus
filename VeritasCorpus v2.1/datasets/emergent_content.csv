https://www.emergent.info/human-death-GMO	Claim: Doctors confirmed the first case of death by genetically modified food	false	['Fake News', 'Hoaxes', 'World News Daily Report']	https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/	https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/doctors-confirm-first-human-death-officially-caused-by-gmos/	2015/03/09	 Share192K TweetMadrid | Doctors of the Carlos III hospital confirmed this morning in a press conference, the first case of human death caused by the ingestion of genetically modified food. Juan Pedro Ramos died from anaphylaxis after eating some recently developed tomatoes containing fish genes, which provoked a violent and lethal allergic reaction.This surprising announcement comes after the autopsy of the 31-year old Spanish man who died at the Madrid hospital at the beginning of January.The young mans health rapidly deteriorated after he suffered an unexplained allergic reaction, and all the drugs used to refrain the anaphylaxis were entirely inefficient.The team of experts claims to have been able to determine that the genetically modified tomatoes that the victim ingested at lunch were the cause of the allergic reaction that caused his death.Mr. Ramos was working as a clerk in a Madrid warehouse on January 7, when he started feeling ill just after lunch.A number of symptoms started to manifest themselves, including a violent itchy rash, some serious swelling of the throat and a drastic drop in blood pressure.The man, who was known to have allergies, quickly injected himself some epinephrine, but his health condition continued to deteriorate.The young man was rapidly carried to the hospital by co-workers, but the medical staff was unable to identify the cause of his allergic reaction in time and none of the usual treatments or drugs seemed to work. Mr. Ramos was confirmed dead just over an hour after arriving at the hospital.The young man appeared happy and healthy when this picture was taken by his roommate, less than 24 hours before he died.The medical examiners and forensic experts at the Carlos III hospital had to execute a lot of tests and analysis before they could precisely determine what caused Mr. Ramos to die of an allergic reaction to seafood since all he had eaten before his death was a bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich with a diet cola.They were astonished when they discovered that the tomato he had ingested, not only contained some fish-related allergens, but also some antibiotic resistant genes which had prevented Mr. Ramos white blood cell from saving his life.At first we thought that there had been some form of contamination of his food, from contact with fish or seafood during the preparation explained Dr. Rafael Perez-Santamarina. It was only when we tested the tomato itself that we noticed that it contained some allergens usually found in seafood. We did many different analysis and they all confirmed that the tomato was indeed the source of the allergens that killed Mr. Ramos. Many experiments on GMOs had produced some horrible tumors and event death in rats and other lab animals, but most genetically modified products on the market were considered to be harmless to humans.The case of Mr. Ramos is the first human death officially confirmed to be linked to the ingestion of genetically modified food. It contradicts most studies on GMOs which had concluded that genetically engineered crops currently on the market were completely safe to eat.A team led by University of Nebraska scientists had anticipated this kind of problem in 1996 when they found that a Brazil nut protein introduced to improve the nutritional quality of genetically modified soybeans was able to provoke an allergic reaction in people with Brazil nut allergies.However, this kind of problem was dismissed by most scientists as very improbable, since it could easily be avoided with proper safety testing.The soybean injected with the Brazil nut gene was indeed abandoned during development, but it seems that the genetically modified tomato that caused Mr. Ramos death had not been submitted to sufficient testing and the lethal risk had not been identified before it was marketed.The Spanish Ministry of Health, Social Services, and Equality ordered for the tomatoes of Portuguese origin which infected the young man, to be recalled and removed from stores and markets for safety reasons.More than 7,000 tons of tomatoes will, therefore, be ceased across the country by ministry inspectors and public safety officials.The ministry also issued a public statement about the death of Mr. Ramos in which it sends its condolences to his family and adds that it will immediately demand further research on the subject to determine if other genetically modified food products on the European market could represent a risk for the Spanish population.

https://www.emergent.info/gold-Apple-Watch-straps	Claim: Apple will offer gold Watch straps	false	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Accessories', 'Daring Fireball', 'Jon Gruber']	https://daringfireball.net/	https://daringfireball.net/2015/03/apple_watch_prelude	2015/03/07	Apple Watch PreludeSaturday, 7 March 2015I realize thereâs little purpose to further Apple Watch speculation at this point â in two days, weâll know most of the answers. But there is one good reason for last-minute speculation: this is fun. Apple tends to be such a predictable company that we often know the basic gist of what to expect before one of their media events. Not this time. The many unknowns surrounding the watch are what makes it so fun to ponder prior to next weekâs event. So letâs have some fun.First, thereâs this . The same day I published my piece on Apple Watch pricing, MacRumors forum member âpgiguere1â created a graphic with possible prices, posting it with the comment:I made this speculative price list based in large part on Gruberâs speculation:The graphic is a pastiche of genuine Apple marketing material. A trained eye can easily tell itâs not from Apple â the typefaces are ones Apple uses (San Francisco and Helvetica Neue) but the way theyâre used is wrong. But itâs close enough to fool many, and the image has now circled the social media globe several times. Iâve received at least 50 emails and tweets from DF readers asking if Iâve seen this âleaked price listâ.So letâs put it to rest. This graphic is not a leaked price list. Itâs speculation from a MacRumors forum member who read my piece on Apple Watch pricing. And, I think, itâs off in numerous ways.But there is one thing about pgiguere1âs speculation that I hadnât really considered: that the 42mm models might cost more than the 38mm ones, across the board. On pgiguere1âs list, the 42mm Sport models are $30 more expensive than the corresponding 38mm ones: $349/379. Iâm torn on whether this will be the case. Apple isnât referring to the two sizes as womenâs and menâs â some women will wear the 42 and some men (and, I suspect, many boys) will wear the 38 â but in broad strokes the 38 is the womenâs version and the 42 is the menâs. You can see that in the high-end leather straps. The feminine âModern Buckleâ is only available for the 38mm size, and the âLeather Loopâ is only available for 42mm.âBigger costs moreâ makes sense â and itâs true for most Apple products, from iPhones to iPads to MacBooks. But with those products, your choice of device size is a matter of taste and personal preference. With Apple Watch, your choice of size is in large part determined by your anatomy.If I had to wager today, Iâd bet that 42mm models will cost more across all three collections. A nominal difference for Apple Sport â $349/379 looks right to my eyes. The difference for Edition models could be $1000 or more because theyâre made from solid 18K gold. Iâm not sure what to expect for the steel ones, though. $100 difference?Bands as Stratifying DifferentiatorsI think Appleâs messaging back in September was misleading, and I donât think it was purposeful. I think it was a mistake that they will correct on Monday.In September, the basic message was something like this: Watches are personal, and different people have different tastes, so we created a wide variety of bands to choose from so you can pick one that reflects your taste, and we made them easy to swap so you can change them depending on your mood or the occasion.Most people took that to mean that your choice of band will largely be a matter of taste â that the various bands will be close to each other in terms of price. I know for a fact â from my email and tweets â that many Daring Fireball readers are hoping to buy an entry-level Apple Watch Sport and an optional Link Bracelet or Milanese Loop for maybe $150 or $200. And I also think most people expect the steel Apple Watches that come with the Link Bracelet or Milanese Loop to cost only, say, $150-200 more than the entry level models with the rubber â er, fluoroelastomer â bands.I donât think this is the case, at all.I wrote about this two weeks ago , and upon further consideration, I am now thinking that the various Apple Watch bands will be priced in significantly stratified tiers.Consider Appleâs description of what I am convinced is the highest-end strap, the Link Bracelet:Crafted from the same 316L stainless steel alloy as the case, the Link Bracelet has more than 100 components. The machining process is so precise, it takes nearly nine hours to cut the links for a single band. In part thatâs because they arenât simply a uniform size, but subtly increase in width as they approach the case. Once assembled, the links are brushed by hand to ensure that the texture follows the contours of the design. The custom butterfly closure folds neatly within the bracelet. And several links feature a simple release button, so you can add and remove links without any special tools. Available in stainless steel and space black stainless steel.Now, if you start with the assumptions that (a) the various watch bands are largely a matter of personal choice, (b) Apple will encourage Apple Watch buyers to mix and match bands, and (c) even the most expensive of them will only cost $200 or so, the above description reads as marketing braggadocio.But if you start with the premise that the top-of-the-line steel Apple Watch will cost $1499 or maybe even $1999, the above description makes more sense. Itâs an explanation for why the bracelet is so expensive. If it truly takes nine hours to cut the links for each band, and each one is polished by hand, and theyâre mechanically complex (and they definitely are), this is not a $200 bracelet. Iâm thinking itâs about $1000, judging by the description, and based on the prices for replacement stainless steel link bracelets from Rolex, Tudor, and Omega.The three collections of Apple Watch â Sport, steel, and Edition â will not, I think, be represented by three basic prices. Instead, the three collections will comprise a continuum of price points, ranging from $349 to $10,000 (or $20,000, if my hunch is correct that there are gold Link Bracelets waiting to be revealed).Here are my final guesses (38mm/42mm):Apple Watch Sport (all colors, with Sport Band): $349/399Apple Watch, steel, Sport Band: $749/799Apple Watch, steel, Classic Buckle: $849/899Apple Watch, steel, Milanese Loop: $949/999Apple Watch, steel, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $1199Apple Watch, steel, Leather Loop (42mm only): $1299Apple Watch, steel, Link Bracelet: $1499/1599Apple Watch, space black steel, Link Bracelet: $1899/1999Apple Watch Edition, Sport Band: $7499/7999Apple Watch Edition, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $9999Apple Watch Edition, Classic Buckle (42mm only): $10,999And purely based on my own speculation â the following configurations have not been announced, have not even been rumored, and have not been suggested to me by any sort of sources:Apple Watch Edition, Gold Milanese Loop: $14,999/$16,999Apple Watch Edition, Gold Link Bracelet: $17,999/$19,999In my first draft of this piece, I had the regular steel Link Bracelet models at $1899/1999, and the space black ones at $2299/2499, and thereâs a notion in my gut that I should have stuck with them. Iâm out on a limb here, and itâs quite possible Iâll be serving up some home-cooked claim chowder Monday. Every single number above other than $349 is truly just a guess on my part. My predictions are way higher than almost everyone elseâs:Marco Arment ($5000 starting price for Edition). 1Kirk McElhearn (steel starting at $500, Edition at $2000).Gene Munster (steel starting at $500, Edition starting at $5000 with an average sale price of $7500).Citi Group analyst Jim Suva (steel starting at $550, Edition at the cuckoo price of $950).Back in September, I wrote :When the prices of the steel and (especially) gold Apple Watches are announced, I expect the tech press to have the biggest collective shit-fit in the history of Apple-versus-the-standard-tech-industry shit-fits. The utilitarian mindset that asks âWhy would anyone waste money on a gold watch?â isnât going to be able to come to grips with what Apple is doing here. Theyâre going to say that Jony Ive and Tim Cook have lost their minds. Theyâre going to wear out their keyboards typing âThis never would have happened if Steve Jobs were alive.â Theyâre going to predict utter and humiliating failure . In short, theyâre going to mistake Apple for Vertu.The only thing I would change about this is that I now think itâs the steel Apple Watch pricing that is going to cause the massive collective shit-fit. Most people have wrapped their heads around the fact that the gold Edition models are going to cost at least $5000, and so have already written off Apple Watch Edition as something for the wealthy luxury market.But the steel Apple Watch, thatâs something that most people still look at as for them. And so they expect the starting price to be around $500, and the various leather and metal band options to cost $100-300 more.But if the starting price for the steel Apple Watch is $500, I donât see why Apple Watch Sport exists at $350. $150 difference does not justify the difference. If they were that close in price, thereâd only be one of them. Sport and steel only make sense as separate collections if the steel collection is significantly higher in price, even at the entry level with the rubber Sport band. People are looking at this as a $100-200 upsell, like going from 16 to 64 to 128 GB iPhones and iPads. Technically thatâs possible, but it doesnât make any sense to me strategically or in terms of operational efficiency. With storage tiers in iOS devices, the only difference is the capacity of the flash memory chip. Thatâs it. All the other components, and the machining and tooling required to produce them, are the same. With Sport and steel Apple Watches, everything you can see or touch is different. Different metal (aluminum vs. steel), different finishes (matte vs. highly-polished), different displays (glass vs. sapphire), different case backs (plastic vs. ceramic and sapphire). If the marketing argument doesnât persuade you, the operations angle should. I just donât see why Apple would bother with all this if the starting price for steel Apple Watch wasnât at least around double that of Sport.Thatâs why I think the pricing for the steel Apple Watch collection is whatâs going to raise a ruckus, because there are a lot of people who want one and expect that theyâll only have to pay $500 or $600, regardless of their strap preference.At the introduction event in September, Tim Cook explicitly billed Apple Watch as the next flagship product line in the companyâs history: Apple II, Macintosh, iPod, iPhone, iPad, and now the watch. There will be no brushing it off as a mere âhobbyâ if it isnât successful.The thing is, for all the griping about the prices that I expect come Monday, at $349, Apple Watch has the lowest entry-level price for any first-generation flagship product from Apple. The first iPod cost $399. The iPhone was $599 (before the infamous $200 price cut a few months later, which still left the entry model at $399). iPad was $499.The fact that so many people want the steel Apple Watch and non-Sport bands shows why they will cost more: desire. Apple sets prices not based on what people want to pay, but what people are willing to pay.This is without question new territory for Apple. Theyâve never sold products with the same computing internals at different pricing tiers based solely on the luxuriousness of the materials.Third-Party BandsNo matter what the pricing is, third-party Apple Watch bands seem like an inevitable thing. But will Apple stock them in its stores? Will there be a Made for Apple Watch program to certify them? I donât think so.If Appleâs prices are as high as Iâm predicting, demand for third-party link bracelets and leather straps will be high. Itâll be interesting to see how it plays out. I never would have predicted the size and scope of todayâs iPhone case market back in 2007.The MessagingIf Iâm even close to correct regarding steel Apple Watch pricing, and if Iâm also correct that thereâs going to be a vociferous backlash, Apple has only itself to blame. The September event and Appleâs marketing to date have created the impression that the differences between collections are largely about style, not price.Using the name âApple Watchâ for the stainless steel collection â the collection with the widest variety of straps â clearly establishes it as the âregularâ collection. In turn, that has left many with the impression that it will be the best-selling, the most common, the one most people walk out of the store with â and thus priced near the $349 baseline.âApple Watch starts at $349â as the one and only mention of price left too much room for bad assumptions, I think.To play devilâs advocate, perhaps Apple did this deliberately. They showed all these different watch bands knowing that they would spark desire, and that people get their heart set on a certain combination based purely on how it looks â including combinations which they wouldnât have allowed themselves to consider in the first place if theyâd known the eventual price back in September. In other words, someone whoâs had their heart set on a model with the Milanese Loop, under the assumption that it would cost, say, $600, might still go ahead and buy it for $1200 even though they wouldnât have considered it in the first place if theyâd known it would cost $1200 back in September.I think that devilâs advocate take is over-thinking things. Itâs just the only explanation I can think of other than that Apple kind of botched the pricing expectations for Apple Watch. Actually, there is one other explanation I can think of: Apple didnât want its competition to know how much Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition were going to cost, and they decided the competitive value of keeping prices secret outweighed the value of setting accurate expectations for customers.Storage CapacityApple has revealed nothing about internal storage capacity in Apple Watch. I could see this playing out two ways:Apple never talks about storage capacity for Apple Watch. It becomes a âsecretâ tech spec, like the amount of RAM in iOS devices. Weâll figure it out once we get our hands on them, but it wonât be something Apple talks about.If they do talk about it, each collection will get its own tier. Say, 8 GB for Sport, 32 GB for steel, 64 GB for Edition.I donât think Apple Watch will need much storage, but theyâve said you can store music and photos directly on the device. So itâs not like storage doesnât matter at all. Itâs just another upsell to push people to higher-priced models.The Modular S1 and UpgradeabilityThereâs been a lot of speculation about the modular nature of Apple Watchâs S1 âcomputer on a chipâ. Why brag about that? Why encase the whole thing in resin? Why make this photograph ? My wild guess back in September: perhaps Apple Watch, or at least the Edition models, would be upgradeable in future years. Take it in for service, pay $500, walk out with your âoldâ Apple Watch Edition upgraded with an S2.I now think this theory is bunk. Not going to happen.Take a first generation iPhone. Now imagine if you could upgrade it to todayâs A8 SoC. Itâd be better than it was before, thatâs for sure. But itâd still have a low-resolution non-retina display. Itâd still be stuck with EDGE cellular networking. Itâd still have a crappy camera that couldnât even shoot video. Etc. The âcomputerâ inside Apple Watch isnât centrally important. Everything is important. The health sensors, the display, the battery, the Taptic Engine, the digital crown, the networking capabilities, everything.A few years from now we might have Apple Watches that support Wi-Fi or even cellular networking. They might go several days on a single charge. None of those improvements would come from an upgrade to an S2 or S3 chip.Iâd love to be wrong on this one, but I donât think it makes any sense. And if I am wrong, the upgrade would have to include the entire innards of the watch â new display, new electronics, new battery, new sensors. Everything but the case and the bands. That still seems unlikely to me, but itâs at least plausible. And it could put Apple Watch Edition on par with existing luxury watches in terms of lifespan. But even in that case, the modular nature of the S1 doesnât really have much to do with it.Lastly, many readers have suggested a trade-in program, where you could bring in your old Apple Watch Edition and get a significant trade-in on a new one. No way. First, as stated earlier, the value of the raw gold in a gold watch is just a small fraction of the price. Second, trading in used goods is not part of a luxury shopping experience.One More ThingHolding the event at Yerba Buena instead of the smaller confines of their campus Town Hall makes me think Apple has a lot to show. There must be more to learn about Apple Watchâs software and experience â Tim Cook even said so back in September, explaining that they simply didnât have enough time then to show more. Iâve heard that Apple has been hosting over 100 third-party developers and designers in Cupertino for the last month, to test and refine WatchKit apps on production Apple Watch hardware, so I expect a bunch of third-party Watch app demos too.The new Mac version of Photos is in public beta, so I expect a full demo of that and the now-complete iCloud Photos cross-device experience. And if theyâre going to talk about Mac software, maybe theyâll reveal the rumored 12-inch thinner-than-ever MacBook Air , too. My gut tells me the new MacBook Air could be ready, and it also tells me that the purported bigger iPad is not.Update: If Apple is ready to unveil the upcoming redesign of its retail stores, we will see Angela Ahrendtsâs first on-stage appearance since joining Apple last year.Marco expressed a thought Iâve considered myself:Appleâs letting the $10,000â20,000 guesses simmer in the press to set price expectations high, just as they stayed quiet when everyone thought the first iPad would cost $1000. Maybe itâs for the same reason: maybe the Edition wonât be completely unreasonably priced for a piece of electronic jewelry that will probably be completely obsolete in five years but happens to be encased in a thousand bucks worth of solid gold. Letting people believe itâll cost so much will make the real price seem like a great deal when itâs announced.Thatâs certainly possible. But what makes me think otherwise is that $1000 was the rumored starting price for the iPad. When Steve Jobs unveiled the â$499â slide, it was our collective expectation for the iPadâs entry-level price that was exceeded. (I remember being in the Yerba Buena theater at that moment â everyone, yours truly included, was genuinely surprised by that. It was palpable.) The âbestâ iPad â 64 GB with cellular networking â cost $829, which isnât that much less than $1000. With Apple Watch we know the starting price: $349. What we donât know is how much the higher-end models will cost. â©ï¸Previous:

The feminine âModern Buckleâ is only available for the 38mm size, and the âLeather Loopâ is only available for 42mm.âBigger costs moreâ makes sense â and itâs true for most Apple products, from iPhones to iPads to MacBooks. But with those products, your choice of device size is a matter of taste and personal preference. With Apple Watch, your choice of size is in large part determined by your anatomy.If I had to wager today, Iâd bet that 42mm models will cost more across all three collections. A nominal difference for Apple Sport â $349/379 looks right to my eyes. The difference for Edition models could be $1000 or more because theyâre made from solid 18K gold. Iâm not sure what to expect for the steel ones, though. $100 difference?Bands as Stratifying DifferentiatorsI think Appleâs messaging back in September was misleading, and I donât think it was purposeful. I think it was a mistake that they will correct on Monday.In September, the basic message was something like this: Watches are personal, and different people have different tastes, so we created a wide variety of bands to choose from so you can pick one that reflects your taste, and we made them easy to swap so you can change them depending on your mood or the occasion.Most people took that to mean that your choice of band will largely be a matter of taste â that the various bands will be close to each other in terms of price. I know for a fact â from my email and tweets â that many Daring Fireball readers are hoping to buy an entry-level Apple Watch Sport and an optional Link Bracelet or Milanese Loop for maybe $150 or $200. And I also think most people expect the steel Apple Watches that come with the Link Bracelet or Milanese Loop to cost only, say, $150-200 more than the entry level models with the rubber â er, fluoroelastomer â bands.I donât think this is the case, at all.I wrote about this two weeks ago , and upon further consideration, I am now thinking that the various Apple Watch bands will be priced in significantly stratified tiers.Consider Appleâs description of what I am convinced is the highest-end strap, the Link Bracelet:Crafted from the same 316L stainless steel alloy as the case, the Link Bracelet has more than 100 components. The machining process is so precise, it takes nearly nine hours to cut the links for a single band. In part thatâs because they arenât simply a uniform size, but subtly increase in width as they approach the case. Once assembled, the links are brushed by hand to ensure that the texture follows the contours of the design. The custom butterfly closure folds neatly within the bracelet. And several links feature a simple release button, so you can add and remove links without any special tools. Available in stainless steel and space black stainless steel.Now, if you start with the assumptions that (a) the various watch bands are largely a matter of personal choice, (b) Apple will encourage Apple Watch buyers to mix and match bands, and (c) even the most expensive of them will only cost $200 or so, the above description reads as marketing braggadocio.But if you start with the premise that the top-of-the-line steel Apple Watch will cost $1499 or maybe even $1999, the above description makes more sense. Itâs an explanation for why the bracelet is so expensive. If it truly takes nine hours to cut the links for each band, and each one is polished by hand, and theyâre mechanically complex (and they definitely are), this is not a $200 bracelet. Iâm thinking itâs about $1000, judging by the description, and based on the prices for replacement stainless steel link bracelets from Rolex, Tudor, and Omega.The three collections of Apple Watch â Sport, steel, and Edition â will not, I think, be represented by three basic prices. Instead, the three collections will comprise a continuum of price points, ranging from $349 to $10,000 (or $20,000, if my hunch is correct that there are gold Link Bracelets waiting to be revealed).Here are my final guesses (38mm/42mm):Apple Watch Sport (all colors, with Sport Band): $349/399Apple Watch, steel, Sport Band: $749/799Apple Watch, steel, Classic Buckle: $849/899Apple Watch, steel, Milanese Loop: $949/999Apple Watch, steel, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $1199Apple Watch, steel, Leather Loop (42mm only): $1299Apple Watch, steel, Link Bracelet: $1499/1599Apple Watch, space black steel, Link Bracelet: $1899/1999Apple Watch Edition, Sport Band: $7499/7999Apple Watch Edition, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $9999Apple Watch Edition, Classic Buckle (42mm only): $10,999And purely based on my own speculation â the following configurations have not been announced, have not even been rumored, and have not been suggested to me by any sort of sources:Apple Watch Edition, Gold Milanese Loop: $14,999/$16,999Apple Watch Edition, Gold Link Bracelet: $17,999/$19,999In my first draft of this piece, I had the regular steel Link Bracelet models at $1899/1999, and the space black ones at $2299/2499, and thereâs a notion in my gut that I should have stuck with them. Iâm out on a limb here, and itâs quite possible Iâll be serving up some home-cooked claim chowder Monday. Every single number above other than $349 is truly just a guess on my part. My predictions are way higher than almost everyone elseâs:Marco Arment ($5000 starting price for Edition). 1Kirk McElhearn (steel starting at $500, Edition at $2000).Gene Munster (steel starting at $500, Edition starting at $5000 with an average sale price of $7500).Citi Group analyst Jim Suva (steel starting at $550, Edition at the cuckoo price of $950).Back in September, I wrote :When the prices of the steel and (especially) gold Apple Watches are announced, I expect the tech press to have the biggest collective shit-fit in the history of Apple-versus-the-standard-tech-industry shit-fits. The utilitarian mindset that asks âWhy would anyone waste money on a gold watch?â isnât going to be able to come to grips with what Apple is doing here. Theyâre going to say that Jony Ive and Tim Cook have lost their minds. Theyâre going to wear out their keyboards typing âThis never would have happened if Steve Jobs were alive.â Theyâre going to predict utter and humiliating failure . In short, theyâre going to mistake Apple for Vertu.The only thing I would change about this is that I now think itâs the steel Apple Watch pricing that is going to cause the massive collective shit-fit. Most people have wrapped their heads around the fact that the gold Edition models are going to cost at least $5000, and so have already written off Apple Watch Edition as something for the wealthy luxury market.But the steel Apple Watch, thatâs something that most people still look at as for them. And so they expect the starting price to be around $500, and the various leather and metal band options to cost $100-300 more.But if the starting price for the steel Apple Watch is $500, I donât see why Apple Watch Sport exists at $350. $150 difference does not justify the difference. If they were that close in price, thereâd only be one of them. Sport and steel only make sense as separate collections if the steel collection is significantly higher in price, even at the entry level with the rubber Sport band. People are looking at this as a $100-200 upsell, like going from 16 to 64 to 128 GB iPhones and iPads. Technically thatâs possible, but it doesnât make any sense to me strategically or in terms of operational efficiency. With storage tiers in iOS devices, the only difference is the capacity of the flash memory chip. Thatâs it. All the other components, and the machining and tooling required to produce them, are the same. With Sport and steel Apple Watches, everything you can see or touch is different. Different metal (aluminum vs. steel), different finishes (matte vs. highly-polished), different displays (glass vs. sapphire), different case backs (plastic vs. ceramic and sapphire). If the marketing argument doesnât persuade you, the operations angle should. I just donât see why Apple would bother with all this if the starting price for steel Apple Watch wasnât at least around double that of Sport.Thatâs why I think the pricing for the steel Apple Watch collection is whatâs going to raise a ruckus, because there are a lot of people who want one and expect that theyâll only have to pay $500 or $600, regardless of their strap preference.At the introduction event in September, Tim Cook explicitly billed Apple Watch as the next flagship product line in the companyâs history: Apple II, Macintosh, iPod, iPhone, iPad, and now the watch. There will be no brushing it off as a mere âhobbyâ if it isnât successful.The thing is, for all the griping about the prices that I expect come Monday, at $349, Apple Watch has the lowest entry-level price for any first-generation flagship product from Apple. The first iPod cost $399. The iPhone was $599 (before the infamous $200 price cut a few months later, which still left the entry model at $399). iPad was $499.The fact that so many people want the steel Apple Watch and non-Sport bands shows why they will cost more: desire. Apple sets prices not based on what people want to pay, but what people are willing to pay.This is without question new territory for Apple. Theyâve never sold products with the same computing internals at different pricing tiers based solely on the luxuriousness of the materials.Third-Party BandsNo matter what the pricing is, third-party Apple Watch bands seem like an inevitable thing. But will Apple stock them in its stores? Will there be a Made for Apple Watch program to certify them? I donât think so.If Appleâs prices are as high as Iâm predicting, demand for third-party link bracelets and leather straps will be high. Itâll be interesting to see how it plays out. I never would have predicted the size and scope of todayâs iPhone case market back in 2007.The MessagingIf Iâm even close to correct regarding steel Apple Watch pricing, and if Iâm also correct that thereâs going to be a vociferous backlash, Apple has only itself to blame. The September event and Appleâs marketing to date have created the impression that the differences between collections are largely about style, not price.Using the name âApple Watchâ for the stainless steel collection â the collection with the widest variety of straps â clearly establishes it as the âregularâ collection. In turn, that has left many with the impression that it will be the best-selling, the most common, the one most people walk out of the store with â and thus priced near the $349 baseline.âApple Watch starts at $349â as the one and only mention of price left too much room for bad assumptions, I think.To play devilâs advocate, perhaps Apple did this deliberately. They showed all these different watch bands knowing that they would spark desire, and that people get their heart set on a certain combination based purely on how it looks â including combinations which they wouldnât have allowed themselves to consider in the first place if theyâd known the eventual price back in September. In other words, someone whoâs had their heart set on a model with the Milanese Loop, under the assumption that it would cost, say, $600, might still go ahead and buy it for $1200 even though they wouldnât have considered it in the first place if theyâd known it would cost $1200 back in September.I think that devilâs advocate take is over-thinking things. Itâs just the only explanation I can think of other than that Apple kind of botched the pricing expectations for Apple Watch. Actually, there is one other explanation I can think of: Apple didnât want its competition to know how much Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition were going to cost, and they decided the competitive value of keeping prices secret outweighed the value of setting accurate expectations for customers.Storage CapacityApple has revealed nothing about internal storage capacity in Apple Watch. I could see this playing out two ways:Apple never talks about storage capacity for Apple Watch. It becomes a âsecretâ tech spec, like the amount of RAM in iOS devices. Weâll figure it out once we get our hands on them, but it wonât be something Apple talks about.If they do talk about it, each collection will get its own tier. Say, 8 GB for Sport, 32 GB for steel, 64 GB for Edition.I donât think Apple Watch will need much storage, but theyâve said you can store music and photos directly on the device. So itâs not like storage doesnât matter at all. Itâs just another upsell to push people to higher-priced models.The Modular S1 and UpgradeabilityThereâs been a lot of speculation about the modular nature of Apple Watchâs S1 âcomputer on a chipâ. Why brag about that? Why encase the whole thing in resin? Why make this photograph ? My wild guess back in September: perhaps Apple Watch, or at least the Edition models, would be upgradeable in future years. Take it in for service, pay $500, walk out with your âoldâ Apple Watch Edition upgraded with an S2.I now think this theory is bunk. Not going to happen.Take a first generation iPhone. Now imagine if you could upgrade it to todayâs A8 SoC. Itâd be better than it was before, thatâs for sure. But itâd still have a low-resolution non-retina display. Itâd still be stuck with EDGE cellular networking. Itâd still have a crappy camera that couldnât even shoot video. Etc. The âcomputerâ inside Apple Watch isnât centrally important. Everything is important. The health sensors, the display, the battery, the Taptic Engine, the digital crown, the networking capabilities, everything.A few years from now we might have Apple Watches that support Wi-Fi or even cellular networking. They might go several days on a single charge. None of those improvements would come from an upgrade to an S2 or S3 chip.Iâd love to be wrong on this one, but I donât think it makes any sense. And if I am wrong, the upgrade would have to include the entire innards of the watch â new display, new electronics, new battery, new sensors. Everything but the case and the bands. That still seems unlikely to me, but itâs at least plausible. And it could put Apple Watch Edition on par with existing luxury watches in terms of lifespan. But even in that case, the modular nature of the S1 doesnât really have much to do with it.Lastly, many readers have suggested a trade-in program, where you could bring in your old Apple Watch Edition and get a significant trade-in on a new one. No way. First, as stated earlier, the value of the raw gold in a gold watch is just a small fraction of the price. Second, trading in used goods is not part of a luxury shopping experience.One More ThingHolding the event at Yerba Buena instead of the smaller confines of their campus Town Hall makes me think Apple has a lot to show. There must be more to learn about Apple Watchâs software and experience â Tim Cook even said so back in September, explaining that they simply didnât have enough time then to show more. Iâve heard that Apple has been hosting over 100 third-party developers and designers in Cupertino for the last month, to test and refine WatchKit apps on production Apple Watch hardware, so I expect a bunch of third-party Watch app demos too.The new Mac version of Photos is in public beta, so I expect a full demo of that and the now-complete iCloud Photos cross-device experience. And if theyâre going to talk about Mac software, maybe theyâll reveal the rumored 12-inch thinner-than-ever MacBook Air , too. My gut tells me the new MacBook Air could be ready, and it also tells me that the purported bigger iPad is not.Update: If Apple is ready to unveil the upcoming redesign of its retail stores, we will see Angela Ahrendtsâs first on-stage appearance since joining Apple last year.Marco expressed a thought Iâve considered myself:Appleâs letting the $10,000â20,000 guesses simmer in the press to set price expectations high, just as they stayed quiet when everyone thought the first iPad would cost $1000. Maybe itâs for the same reason: maybe the Edition wonât be completely unreasonably priced for a piece of electronic jewelry that will probably be completely obsolete in five years but happens to be encased in a thousand bucks worth of solid gold. Letting people believe itâll cost so much will make the real price seem like a great deal when itâs announced.Thatâs certainly possible. But what makes me think otherwise is that $1000 was the rumored starting price for the iPad. When Steve Jobs unveiled the â$499â slide, it was our collective expectation for the iPadâs entry-level price that was exceeded. (I remember being in the Yerba Buena theater at that moment â everyone, yours truly included, was genuinely surprised by that. It was palpable.) The âbestâ iPad â 64 GB with cellular networking â cost $829, which isnât that much less than $1000. With Apple Watch we know the starting price: $349. What we donât know is how much the higher-end models will cost. â©ï¸Previous:	
https://www.emergent.info/Gruber-Apple-Watch-Edition-Sport-band	Claim: The gold Apple Watch Edition with a sport band will cost $7499/7999 USD.	false	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Edition', 'Apple Watch Price', 'Daring Fireball', 'Jon Gruber']	https://daringfireball.net/	https://daringfireball.net/2015/03/apple_watch_prelude	2015/03/07	Apple Watch PreludeSaturday, 7 March 2015I realize thereâs little purpose to further Apple Watch speculation at this point â in two days, weâll know most of the answers. But there is one good reason for last-minute speculation: this is fun. Apple tends to be such a predictable company that we often know the basic gist of what to expect before one of their media events. Not this time. The many unknowns surrounding the watch are what makes it so fun to ponder prior to next weekâs event. So letâs have some fun.First, thereâs this . The same day I published my piece on Apple Watch pricing, MacRumors forum member âpgiguere1â created a graphic with possible prices, posting it with the comment:I made this speculative price list based in large part on Gruberâs speculation:The graphic is a pastiche of genuine Apple marketing material. A trained eye can easily tell itâs not from Apple â the typefaces are ones Apple uses (San Francisco and Helvetica Neue) but the way theyâre used is wrong. But itâs close enough to fool many, and the image has now circled the social media globe several times. Iâve received at least 50 emails and tweets from DF readers asking if Iâve seen this âleaked price listâ.So letâs put it to rest. This graphic is not a leaked price list. Itâs speculation from a MacRumors forum member who read my piece on Apple Watch pricing. And, I think, itâs off in numerous ways.But there is one thing about pgiguere1âs speculation that I hadnât really considered: that the 42mm models might cost more than the 38mm ones, across the board. On pgiguere1âs list, the 42mm Sport models are $30 more expensive than the corresponding 38mm ones: $349/379. Iâm torn on whether this will be the case. Apple isnât referring to the two sizes as womenâs and menâs â some women will wear the 42 and some men (and, I suspect, many boys) will wear the 38 â but in broad strokes the 38 is the womenâs version and the 42 is the menâs. You can see that in the high-end leather straps. The feminine âModern Buckleâ is only available for the 38mm size, and the âLeather Loopâ is only available for 42mm.âBigger costs moreâ makes sense â and itâs true for most Apple products, from iPhones to iPads to MacBooks. But with those products, your choice of device size is a matter of taste and personal preference. With Apple Watch, your choice of size is in large part determined by your anatomy.If I had to wager today, Iâd bet that 42mm models will cost more across all three collections. A nominal difference for Apple Sport â $349/379 looks right to my eyes. The difference for Edition models could be $1000 or more because theyâre made from solid 18K gold. Iâm not sure what to expect for the steel ones, though. $100 difference?Bands as Stratifying DifferentiatorsI think Appleâs messaging back in September was misleading, and I donât think it was purposeful.

They showed all these different watch bands knowing that they would spark desire, and that people get their heart set on a certain combination based purely on how it looks â including combinations which they wouldnât have allowed themselves to consider in the first place if theyâd known the eventual price back in September. In other words, someone whoâs had their heart set on a model with the Milanese Loop, under the assumption that it would cost, say, $600, might still go ahead and buy it for $1200 even though they wouldnât have considered it in the first place if theyâd known it would cost $1200 back in September.I think that devilâs advocate take is over-thinking things. Itâs just the only explanation I can think of other than that Apple kind of botched the pricing expectations for Apple Watch. Actually, there is one other explanation I can think of: Apple didnât want its competition to know how much Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition were going to cost, and they decided the competitive value of keeping prices secret outweighed the value of setting accurate expectations for customers.Storage CapacityApple has revealed nothing about internal storage capacity in Apple Watch. I could see this playing out two ways:Apple never talks about storage capacity for Apple Watch. It becomes a âsecretâ tech spec, like the amount of RAM in iOS devices. Weâll figure it out once we get our hands on them, but it wonât be something Apple talks about.If they do talk about it, each collection will get its own tier. Say, 8 GB for Sport, 32 GB for steel, 64 GB for Edition.I donât think Apple Watch will need much storage, but theyâve said you can store music and photos directly on the device. So itâs not like storage doesnât matter at all. Itâs just another upsell to push people to higher-priced models.The Modular S1 and UpgradeabilityThereâs been a lot of speculation about the modular nature of Apple Watchâs S1 âcomputer on a chipâ. Why brag about that? Why encase the whole thing in resin? Why make this photograph ? My wild guess back in September: perhaps Apple Watch, or at least the Edition models, would be upgradeable in future years. Take it in for service, pay $500, walk out with your âoldâ Apple Watch Edition upgraded with an S2.I now think this theory is bunk. Not going to happen.Take a first generation iPhone. Now imagine if you could upgrade it to todayâs A8 SoC. Itâd be better than it was before, thatâs for sure. But itâd still have a low-resolution non-retina display. Itâd still be stuck with EDGE cellular networking. Itâd still have a crappy camera that couldnât even shoot video. Etc. The âcomputerâ inside Apple Watch isnât centrally important. Everything is important. The health sensors, the display, the battery, the Taptic Engine, the digital crown, the networking capabilities, everything.A few years from now we might have Apple Watches that support Wi-Fi or even cellular networking. They might go several days on a single charge. None of those improvements would come from an upgrade to an S2 or S3 chip.Iâd love to be wrong on this one, but I donât think it makes any sense. And if I am wrong, the upgrade would have to include the entire innards of the watch â new display, new electronics, new battery, new sensors. Everything but the case and the bands. That still seems unlikely to me, but itâs at least plausible. And it could put Apple Watch Edition on par with existing luxury watches in terms of lifespan. But even in that case, the modular nature of the S1 doesnât really have much to do with it.Lastly, many readers have suggested a trade-in program, where you could bring in your old Apple Watch Edition and get a significant trade-in on a new one. No way. First, as stated earlier, the value of the raw gold in a gold watch is just a small fraction of the price. Second, trading in used goods is not part of a luxury shopping experience.One More ThingHolding the event at Yerba Buena instead of the smaller confines of their campus Town Hall makes me think Apple has a lot to show. There must be more to learn about Apple Watchâs software and experience â Tim Cook even said so back in September, explaining that they simply didnât have enough time then to show more. Iâve heard that Apple has been hosting over 100 third-party developers and designers in Cupertino for the last month, to test and refine WatchKit apps on production Apple Watch hardware, so I expect a bunch of third-party Watch app demos too.The new Mac version of Photos is in public beta, so I expect a full demo of that and the now-complete iCloud Photos cross-device experience. And if theyâre going to talk about Mac software, maybe theyâll reveal the rumored 12-inch thinner-than-ever MacBook Air , too. My gut tells me the new MacBook Air could be ready, and it also tells me that the purported bigger iPad is not.Update: If Apple is ready to unveil the upcoming redesign of its retail stores, we will see Angela Ahrendtsâs first on-stage appearance since joining Apple last year.Marco expressed a thought Iâve considered myself:Appleâs letting the $10,000â20,000 guesses simmer in the press to set price expectations high, just as they stayed quiet when everyone thought the first iPad would cost $1000. Maybe itâs for the same reason: maybe the Edition wonât be completely unreasonably priced for a piece of electronic jewelry that will probably be completely obsolete in five years but happens to be encased in a thousand bucks worth of solid gold. Letting people believe itâll cost so much will make the real price seem like a great deal when itâs announced.Thatâs certainly possible. But what makes me think otherwise is that $1000 was the rumored starting price for the iPad. When Steve Jobs unveiled the â$499â slide, it was our collective expectation for the iPadâs entry-level price that was exceeded. (I remember being in the Yerba Buena theater at that moment â everyone, yours truly included, was genuinely surprised by that. It was palpable.) The âbestâ iPad â 64 GB with cellular networking â cost $829, which isnât that much less than $1000. With Apple Watch we know the starting price: $349. What we donât know is how much the higher-end models will cost. â©ï¸Previous:	
https://www.emergent.info/steel-Apple-Watch-sport-band	Claim: The steel Apple Watch with a sport band will cost $749/799 USD.	false	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Price', 'Daring Fireball', 'Jon Gruber']	https://daringfireball.net/	https://daringfireball.net/2015/03/apple_watch_prelude	2015/03/07	Apple Watch PreludeSaturday, 7 March 2015I realize thereâs little purpose to further Apple Watch speculation at this point â in two days, weâll know most of the answers. But there is one good reason for last-minute speculation: this is fun. Apple tends to be such a predictable company that we often know the basic gist of what to expect before one of their media events. Not this time. The many unknowns surrounding the watch are what makes it so fun to ponder prior to next weekâs event. So letâs have some fun.First, thereâs this . The same day I published my piece on Apple Watch pricing, MacRumors forum member âpgiguere1â created a graphic with possible prices, posting it with the comment:I made this speculative price list based in large part on Gruberâs speculation:The graphic is a pastiche of genuine Apple marketing material. A trained eye can easily tell itâs not from Apple â the typefaces are ones Apple uses (San Francisco and Helvetica Neue) but the way theyâre used is wrong. But itâs close enough to fool many, and the image has now circled the social media globe several times. Iâve received at least 50 emails and tweets from DF readers asking if Iâve seen this âleaked price listâ.So letâs put it to rest. This graphic is not a leaked price list. Itâs speculation from a MacRumors forum member who read my piece on Apple Watch pricing. And, I think, itâs off in numerous ways.But there is one thing about pgiguere1âs speculation that I hadnât really considered: that the 42mm models might cost more than the 38mm ones, across the board. On pgiguere1âs list, the 42mm Sport models are $30 more expensive than the corresponding 38mm ones: $349/379. Iâm torn on whether this will be the case. Apple isnât referring to the two sizes as womenâs and menâs â some women will wear the 42 and some men (and, I suspect, many boys) will wear the 38 â but in broad strokes the 38 is the womenâs version and the 42 is the menâs. You can see that in the high-end leather straps. The feminine âModern Buckleâ is only available for the 38mm size, and the âLeather Loopâ is only available for 42mm.âBigger costs moreâ makes sense â and itâs true for most Apple products, from iPhones to iPads to MacBooks. But with those products, your choice of device size is a matter of taste and personal preference. With Apple Watch, your choice of size is in large part determined by your anatomy.If I had to wager today, Iâd bet that 42mm models will cost more across all three collections. A nominal difference for Apple Sport â $349/379 looks right to my eyes. The difference for Edition models could be $1000 or more because theyâre made from solid 18K gold. Iâm not sure what to expect for the steel ones, though. $100 difference?Bands as Stratifying DifferentiatorsI think Appleâs messaging back in September was misleading, and I donât think it was purposeful. I think it was a mistake that they will correct on Monday.In September, the basic message was something like this: Watches are personal, and different people have different tastes, so we created a wide variety of bands to choose from so you can pick one that reflects your taste, and we made them easy to swap so you can change them depending on your mood or the occasion.Most people took that to mean that your choice of band will largely be a matter of taste â that the various bands will be close to each other in terms of price. I know for a fact â from my email and tweets â that many Daring Fireball readers are hoping to buy an entry-level Apple Watch Sport and an optional Link Bracelet or Milanese Loop for maybe $150 or $200. And I also think most people expect the steel Apple Watches that come with the Link Bracelet or Milanese Loop to cost only, say, $150-200 more than the entry level models with the rubber â er, fluoroelastomer â bands.I donât think this is the case, at all.I wrote about this two weeks ago , and upon further consideration, I am now thinking that the various Apple Watch bands will be priced in significantly stratified tiers.Consider Appleâs description of what I am convinced is the highest-end strap, the Link Bracelet:Crafted from the same 316L stainless steel alloy as the case, the Link Bracelet has more than 100 components. The machining process is so precise, it takes nearly nine hours to cut the links for a single band. In part thatâs because they arenât simply a uniform size, but subtly increase in width as they approach the case. Once assembled, the links are brushed by hand to ensure that the texture follows the contours of the design. The custom butterfly closure folds neatly within the bracelet. And several links feature a simple release button, so you can add and remove links without any special tools. Available in stainless steel and space black stainless steel.Now, if you start with the assumptions that (a) the various watch bands are largely a matter of personal choice, (b) Apple will encourage Apple Watch buyers to mix and match bands, and (c) even the most expensive of them will only cost $200 or so, the above description reads as marketing braggadocio.But if you start with the premise that the top-of-the-line steel Apple Watch will cost $1499 or maybe even $1999, the above description makes more sense. Itâs an explanation for why the bracelet is so expensive. If it truly takes nine hours to cut the links for each band, and each one is polished by hand, and theyâre mechanically complex (and they definitely are), this is not a $200 bracelet. Iâm thinking itâs about $1000, judging by the description, and based on the prices for replacement stainless steel link bracelets from Rolex, Tudor, and Omega.The three collections of Apple Watch â Sport, steel, and Edition â will not, I think, be represented by three basic prices. Instead, the three collections will comprise a continuum of price points, ranging from $349 to $10,000 (or $20,000, if my hunch is correct that there are gold Link Bracelets waiting to be revealed).Here are my final guesses (38mm/42mm):Apple Watch Sport (all colors, with Sport Band): $349/399Apple Watch, steel, Sport Band: $749/799Apple Watch, steel, Classic Buckle: $849/899Apple Watch, steel, Milanese Loop: $949/999Apple Watch, steel, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $1199Apple Watch, steel, Leather Loop (42mm only): $1299Apple Watch, steel, Link Bracelet: $1499/1599Apple Watch, space black steel, Link Bracelet: $1899/1999Apple Watch Edition, Sport Band: $7499/7999Apple Watch Edition, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $9999Apple Watch Edition, Classic Buckle (42mm only): $10,999And purely based on my own speculation â the following configurations have not been announced, have not even been rumored, and have not been suggested to me by any sort of sources:Apple Watch Edition, Gold Milanese Loop: $14,999/$16,999Apple Watch Edition, Gold Link Bracelet: $17,999/$19,999In my first draft of this piece, I had the regular steel Link Bracelet models at $1899/1999, and the space black ones at $2299/2499, and thereâs a notion in my gut that I should have stuck with them. Iâm out on a limb here, and itâs quite possible Iâll be serving up some home-cooked claim chowder Monday. Every single number above other than $349 is truly just a guess on my part. My predictions are way higher than almost everyone elseâs:Marco Arment ($5000 starting price for Edition). 1Kirk McElhearn (steel starting at $500, Edition at $2000).Gene Munster (steel starting at $500, Edition starting at $5000 with an average sale price of $7500).Citi Group analyst Jim Suva (steel starting at $550, Edition at the cuckoo price of $950).Back in September, I wrote :When the prices of the steel and (especially) gold Apple Watches are announced, I expect the tech press to have the biggest collective shit-fit in the history of Apple-versus-the-standard-tech-industry shit-fits. The utilitarian mindset that asks âWhy would anyone waste money on a gold watch?â isnât going to be able to come to grips with what Apple is doing here. Theyâre going to say that Jony Ive and Tim Cook have lost their minds. Theyâre going to wear out their keyboards typing âThis never would have happened if Steve Jobs were alive.â Theyâre going to predict utter and humiliating failure . In short, theyâre going to mistake Apple for Vertu.The only thing I would change about this is that I now think itâs the steel Apple Watch pricing that is going to cause the massive collective shit-fit. Most people have wrapped their heads around the fact that the gold Edition models are going to cost at least $5000, and so have already written off Apple Watch Edition as something for the wealthy luxury market.But the steel Apple Watch, thatâs something that most people still look at as for them. And so they expect the starting price to be around $500, and the various leather and metal band options to cost $100-300 more.But if the starting price for the steel Apple Watch is $500, I donât see why Apple Watch Sport exists at $350. $150 difference does not justify the difference. If they were that close in price, thereâd only be one of them. Sport and steel only make sense as separate collections if the steel collection is significantly higher in price, even at the entry level with the rubber Sport band. People are looking at this as a $100-200 upsell, like going from 16 to 64 to 128 GB iPhones and iPads. Technically thatâs possible, but it doesnât make any sense to me strategically or in terms of operational efficiency. With storage tiers in iOS devices, the only difference is the capacity of the flash memory chip. Thatâs it. All the other components, and the machining and tooling required to produce them, are the same. With Sport and steel Apple Watches, everything you can see or touch is different. Different metal (aluminum vs. steel), different finishes (matte vs. highly-polished), different displays (glass vs. sapphire), different case backs (plastic vs. ceramic and sapphire). If the marketing argument doesnât persuade you, the operations angle should. I just donât see why Apple would bother with all this if the starting price for steel Apple Watch wasnât at least around double that of Sport.Thatâs why I think the pricing for the steel Apple Watch collection is whatâs going to raise a ruckus, because there are a lot of people who want one and expect that theyâll only have to pay $500 or $600, regardless of their strap preference.At the introduction event in September, Tim Cook explicitly billed Apple Watch as the next flagship product line in the companyâs history: Apple II, Macintosh, iPod, iPhone, iPad, and now the watch. There will be no brushing it off as a mere âhobbyâ if it isnât successful.The thing is, for all the griping about the prices that I expect come Monday, at $349, Apple Watch has the lowest entry-level price for any first-generation flagship product from Apple. The first iPod cost $399. The iPhone was $599 (before the infamous $200 price cut a few months later, which still left the entry model at $399). iPad was $499.The fact that so many people want the steel Apple Watch and non-Sport bands shows why they will cost more: desire. Apple sets prices not based on what people want to pay, but what people are willing to pay.This is without question new territory for Apple. Theyâve never sold products with the same computing internals at different pricing tiers based solely on the luxuriousness of the materials.Third-Party BandsNo matter what the pricing is, third-party Apple Watch bands seem like an inevitable thing. But will Apple stock them in its stores? Will there be a Made for Apple Watch program to certify them? I donât think so.If Appleâs prices are as high as Iâm predicting, demand for third-party link bracelets and leather straps will be high. Itâll be interesting to see how it plays out. I never would have predicted the size and scope of todayâs iPhone case market back in 2007.The MessagingIf Iâm even close to correct regarding steel Apple Watch pricing, and if Iâm also correct that thereâs going to be a vociferous backlash, Apple has only itself to blame. The September event and Appleâs marketing to date have created the impression that the differences between collections are largely about style, not price.Using the name âApple Watchâ for the stainless steel collection â the collection with the widest variety of straps â clearly establishes it as the âregularâ collection.

In other words, someone whoâs had their heart set on a model with the Milanese Loop, under the assumption that it would cost, say, $600, might still go ahead and buy it for $1200 even though they wouldnât have considered it in the first place if theyâd known it would cost $1200 back in September.I think that devilâs advocate take is over-thinking things.

And I also think most people expect the steel Apple Watches that come with the Link Bracelet or Milanese Loop to cost only, say, $150-200 more than the entry level models with the rubber â er, fluoroelastomer â bands.I donât think this is the case, at all.I wrote about this two weeks ago , and upon further consideration, I am now thinking that the various Apple Watch bands will be priced in significantly stratified tiers.Consider Appleâs description of what I am convinced is the highest-end strap, the Link Bracelet:Crafted from the same 316L stainless steel alloy as the case, the Link Bracelet has more than 100 components. The machining process is so precise, it takes nearly nine hours to cut the links for a single band. In part thatâs because they arenât simply a uniform size, but subtly increase in width as they approach the case. Once assembled, the links are brushed by hand to ensure that the texture follows the contours of the design. The custom butterfly closure folds neatly within the bracelet. And several links feature a simple release button, so you can add and remove links without any special tools. Available in stainless steel and space black stainless steel.Now, if you start with the assumptions that (a) the various watch bands are largely a matter of personal choice, (b) Apple will encourage Apple Watch buyers to mix and match bands, and (c) even the most expensive of them will only cost $200 or so, the above description reads as marketing braggadocio.But if you start with the premise that the top-of-the-line steel Apple Watch will cost $1499 or maybe even $1999, the above description makes more sense. Itâs an explanation for why the bracelet is so expensive. If it truly takes nine hours to cut the links for each band, and each one is polished by hand, and theyâre mechanically complex (and they definitely are), this is not a $200 bracelet. Iâm thinking itâs about $1000, judging by the description, and based on the prices for replacement stainless steel link bracelets from Rolex, Tudor, and Omega.The three collections of Apple Watch â Sport, steel, and Edition â will not, I think, be represented by three basic prices. Instead, the three collections will comprise a continuum of price points, ranging from $349 to $10,000 (or $20,000, if my hunch is correct that there are gold Link Bracelets waiting to be revealed).Here are my final guesses (38mm/42mm):Apple Watch Sport (all colors, with Sport Band): $349/399Apple Watch, steel, Sport Band: $749/799Apple Watch, steel, Classic Buckle: $849/899Apple Watch, steel, Milanese Loop: $949/999Apple Watch, steel, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $1199Apple Watch, steel, Leather Loop (42mm only): $1299Apple Watch, steel, Link Bracelet: $1499/1599Apple Watch, space black steel, Link Bracelet: $1899/1999Apple Watch Edition, Sport Band: $7499/7999Apple Watch Edition, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $9999Apple Watch Edition, Classic Buckle (42mm only): $10,999And purely based on my own speculation â the following configurations have not been announced, have not even been rumored, and have not been suggested to me by any sort of sources:Apple Watch Edition, Gold Milanese Loop: $14,999/$16,999Apple Watch Edition, Gold Link Bracelet: $17,999/$19,999In my first draft of this piece, I had the regular steel Link Bracelet models at $1899/1999, and the space black ones at $2299/2499, and thereâs a notion in my gut that I should have stuck with them. Iâm out on a limb here, and itâs quite possible Iâll be serving up some home-cooked claim chowder Monday. Every single number above other than $349 is truly just a guess on my part. My predictions are way higher than almost everyone elseâs:Marco Arment ($5000 starting price for Edition). 1Kirk McElhearn (steel starting at $500, Edition at $2000).Gene Munster (steel starting at $500, Edition starting at $5000 with an average sale price of $7500).Citi Group analyst Jim Suva (steel starting at $550, Edition at the cuckoo price of $950).Back in September, I wrote :When the prices of the steel and (especially) gold Apple Watches are announced, I expect the tech press to have the biggest collective shit-fit in the history of Apple-versus-the-standard-tech-industry shit-fits. The utilitarian mindset that asks âWhy would anyone waste money on a gold watch?â isnât going to be able to come to grips with what Apple is doing here. Theyâre going to say that Jony Ive and Tim Cook have lost their minds. Theyâre going to wear out their keyboards typing âThis never would have happened if Steve Jobs were alive.â Theyâre going to predict utter and humiliating failure . In short, theyâre going to mistake Apple for Vertu.The only thing I would change about this is that I now think itâs the steel Apple Watch pricing that is going to cause the massive collective shit-fit. Most people have wrapped their heads around the fact that the gold Edition models are going to cost at least $5000, and so have already written off Apple Watch Edition as something for the wealthy luxury market.But the steel Apple Watch, thatâs something that most people still look at as for them. And so they expect the starting price to be around $500, and the various leather and metal band options to cost $100-300 more.But if the starting price for the steel Apple Watch is $500, I donât see why Apple Watch Sport exists at $350. $150 difference does not justify the difference. If they were that close in price, thereâd only be one of them. Sport and steel only make sense as separate collections if the steel collection is significantly higher in price, even at the entry level with the rubber Sport band. People are looking at this as a $100-200 upsell, like going from 16 to 64 to 128 GB iPhones and iPads. Technically thatâs possible, but it doesnât make any sense to me strategically or in terms of operational efficiency. With storage tiers in iOS devices, the only difference is the capacity of the flash memory chip. Thatâs it. All the other components, and the machining and tooling required to produce them, are the same. With Sport and steel Apple Watches, everything you can see or touch is different. Different metal (aluminum vs. steel), different finishes (matte vs. highly-polished), different displays (glass vs. sapphire), different case backs (plastic vs. ceramic and sapphire). If the marketing argument doesnât persuade you, the operations angle should. I just donât see why Apple would bother with all this if the starting price for steel Apple Watch wasnât at least around double that of Sport.Thatâs why I think the pricing for the steel Apple Watch collection is whatâs going to raise a ruckus, because there are a lot of people who want one and expect that theyâll only have to pay $500 or $600, regardless of their strap preference.At the introduction event in September, Tim Cook explicitly billed Apple Watch as the next flagship product line in the companyâs history: Apple II, Macintosh, iPod, iPhone, iPad, and now the watch. There will be no brushing it off as a mere âhobbyâ if it isnât successful.The thing is, for all the griping about the prices that I expect come Monday, at $349, Apple Watch has the lowest entry-level price for any first-generation flagship product from Apple. The first iPod cost $399. The iPhone was $599 (before the infamous $200 price cut a few months later, which still left the entry model at $399). iPad was $499.The fact that so many people want the steel Apple Watch and non-Sport bands shows why they will cost more: desire. Apple sets prices not based on what people want to pay, but what people are willing to pay.This is without question new territory for Apple. Theyâve never sold products with the same computing internals at different pricing tiers based solely on the luxuriousness of the materials.Third-Party BandsNo matter what the pricing is, third-party Apple Watch bands seem like an inevitable thing. But will Apple stock them in its stores? Will there be a Made for Apple Watch program to certify them? I donât think so.If Appleâs prices are as high as Iâm predicting, demand for third-party link bracelets and leather straps will be high. Itâll be interesting to see how it plays out. I never would have predicted the size and scope of todayâs iPhone case market back in 2007.The MessagingIf Iâm even close to correct regarding steel Apple Watch pricing, and if Iâm also correct that thereâs going to be a vociferous backlash, Apple has only itself to blame. The September event and Appleâs marketing to date have created the impression that the differences between collections are largely about style, not price.Using the name âApple Watchâ for the stainless steel collection â the collection with the widest variety of straps â clearly establishes it as the âregularâ collection. In turn, that has left many with the impression that it will be the best-selling, the most common, the one most people walk out of the store with â and thus priced near the $349 baseline.âApple Watch starts at $349â as the one and only mention of price left too much room for bad assumptions, I think.To play devilâs advocate, perhaps Apple did this deliberately. They showed all these different watch bands knowing that they would spark desire, and that people get their heart set on a certain combination based purely on how it looks â including combinations which they wouldnât have allowed themselves to consider in the first place if theyâd known the eventual price back in September. In other words, someone whoâs had their heart set on a model with the Milanese Loop, under the assumption that it would cost, say, $600, might still go ahead and buy it for $1200 even though they wouldnât have considered it in the first place if theyâd known it would cost $1200 back in September.I think that devilâs advocate take is over-thinking things. Itâs just the only explanation I can think of other than that Apple kind of botched the pricing expectations for Apple Watch. Actually, there is one other explanation I can think of: Apple didnât want its competition to know how much Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition were going to cost, and they decided the competitive value of keeping prices secret outweighed the value of setting accurate expectations for customers.Storage CapacityApple has revealed nothing about internal storage capacity in Apple Watch. I could see this playing out two ways:Apple never talks about storage capacity for Apple Watch. It becomes a âsecretâ tech spec, like the amount of RAM in iOS devices. Weâll figure it out once we get our hands on them, but it wonât be something Apple talks about.If they do talk about it, each collection will get its own tier. Say, 8 GB for Sport, 32 GB for steel, 64 GB for Edition.I donât think Apple Watch will need much storage, but theyâve said you can store music and photos directly on the device. So itâs not like storage doesnât matter at all. Itâs just another upsell to push people to higher-priced models.The Modular S1 and UpgradeabilityThereâs been a lot of speculation about the modular nature of Apple Watchâs S1 âcomputer on a chipâ. Why brag about that? Why encase the whole thing in resin? Why make this photograph ? My wild guess back in September: perhaps Apple Watch, or at least the Edition models, would be upgradeable in future years. Take it in for service, pay $500, walk out with your âoldâ Apple Watch Edition upgraded with an S2.I now think this theory is bunk. Not going to happen.Take a first generation iPhone. Now imagine if you could upgrade it to todayâs A8 SoC. Itâd be better than it was before, thatâs for sure. But itâd still have a low-resolution non-retina display. Itâd still be stuck with EDGE cellular networking. Itâd still have a crappy camera that couldnât even shoot video. Etc. The âcomputerâ inside Apple Watch isnât centrally important. Everything is important. The health sensors, the display, the battery, the Taptic Engine, the digital crown, the networking capabilities, everything.A few years from now we might have Apple Watches that support Wi-Fi or even cellular networking. They might go several days on a single charge. None of those improvements would come from an upgrade to an S2 or S3 chip.Iâd love to be wrong on this one, but I donât think it makes any sense. And if I am wrong, the upgrade would have to include the entire innards of the watch â new display, new electronics, new battery, new sensors. Everything but the case and the bands. That still seems unlikely to me, but itâs at least plausible. And it could put Apple Watch Edition on par with existing luxury watches in terms of lifespan. But even in that case, the modular nature of the S1 doesnât really have much to do with it.Lastly, many readers have suggested a trade-in program, where you could bring in your old Apple Watch Edition and get a significant trade-in on a new one. No way. First, as stated earlier, the value of the raw gold in a gold watch is just a small fraction of the price. Second, trading in used goods is not part of a luxury shopping experience.One More ThingHolding the event at Yerba Buena instead of the smaller confines of their campus Town Hall makes me think Apple has a lot to show. There must be more to learn about Apple Watchâs software and experience â Tim Cook even said so back in September, explaining that they simply didnât have enough time then to show more. Iâve heard that Apple has been hosting over 100 third-party developers and designers in Cupertino for the last month, to test and refine WatchKit apps on production Apple Watch hardware, so I expect a bunch of third-party Watch app demos too.The new Mac version of Photos is in public beta, so I expect a full demo of that and the now-complete iCloud Photos cross-device experience. And if theyâre going to talk about Mac software, maybe theyâll reveal the rumored 12-inch thinner-than-ever MacBook Air , too. My gut tells me the new MacBook Air could be ready, and it also tells me that the purported bigger iPad is not.Update: If Apple is ready to unveil the upcoming redesign of its retail stores, we will see Angela Ahrendtsâs first on-stage appearance since joining Apple last year.Marco expressed a thought Iâve considered myself:Appleâs letting the $10,000â20,000 guesses simmer in the press to set price expectations high, just as they stayed quiet when everyone thought the first iPad would cost $1000. Maybe itâs for the same reason: maybe the Edition wonât be completely unreasonably priced for a piece of electronic jewelry that will probably be completely obsolete in five years but happens to be encased in a thousand bucks worth of solid gold. Letting people believe itâll cost so much will make the real price seem like a great deal when itâs announced.Thatâs certainly possible. But what makes me think otherwise is that $1000 was the rumored starting price for the iPad. When Steve Jobs unveiled the â$499â slide, it was our collective expectation for the iPadâs entry-level price that was exceeded. (I remember being in the Yerba Buena theater at that moment â everyone, yours truly included, was genuinely surprised by that. It was palpable.) The âbestâ iPad â 64 GB with cellular networking â cost $829, which isnât that much less than $1000. With Apple Watch we know the starting price: $349. What we donât know is how much the higher-end models will cost. â©ï¸Previous:

Such followers, who would become impotent, can be used as potent weapon against his enemiesâ.Hans Raj was a sadhu in Dera Sacha Sauda from 1996 to 2012 and worked as a musician for Dera chiefâs religious programmes.Hans Raj said he was awed by Dera chiefâs power. But when one after another sadhus who dared to raise voice against the chief were eliminated, he decided to face his fear by filing petition for a CBI probe in July, 2012.The court had then directed the state government to investigate the case and a medical examination found his testis surgically removed, which is in sync with his claims that over 400 followers were castrated at Sirsa Dera. On why they agreed to undergo castration, Gurdas Singh Toor alias Bitu (46), a witness in this case, claimed it was done on the pretext that removing testis would lead to salvation. âCastrated followers were not allowed to meet their family or venture outside DSS campus on their own,â he said.While handing over the probe to CBI, the HC had observed that Haryana policeâs investigation was worthless.Dera Sacha Sauda spokesperson Dr Aditya Insan rubbished the allegations. He said all the allegations were false and baseless and the petitioner in the case had left dera 3 years ago. He said the controversies were the handiwork of drug mafia who were up in arms against them.	
https://www.emergent.info/Jihadi-John-is-Mohammed-Emwazi	Claim: 'Jihadi John' is a Londoner named Mohammed Emwazi	unverified	['ISIS', 'Jihadi John', 'Mohammed Emwazi', 'Washington Post']	https://www.washingtonpost.com/	https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/jihadi-john-the-islamic-state-killer-behind-the-mask-is-a-young-londoner/2015/02/25/d6dbab16-bc43-11e4-bdfa-b8e8f594e6ee_story.html	2015/02/26	 LONDON â The world knows him as âJihadi John,â the masked man with a British accent who has beheaded several hostages held by the Islamic State and who taunts audiences in videos circulated widely online. But his real name, according to friends and others familiar with his case, is Mohammed Emwazi, a Briton from a well-to-do family who grew up in West London and graduated from college with a degree in computer programming. He is believed to have traveled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined the Islamic State, the group whose barbarity he has come to symbolize. âI have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John,â said one of Emwaziâs close friends who identified him in an interview with The Washington Post. âHe was like a brother to me. . . . A representative of a British human rights group who had been in contact with Emwazi before he left for Syria also said he believed Emwazi was Jihadi John, a moniker given to him by some of the hostages he once held. âThis is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person,â Qureshi added. Authorities have used a variety of investigative techniques, including voice analysis and interviews with former hostages, to try to identify Jihadi John. James B. Comey, the director of the FBI, said in September â only a month after the Briton was seen in a video killing American journalist James Foley â that officials believed they had succeeded. Nevertheless, the identity of Jihadi John has remained shrouded in secrecy. Since Foleyâs killing, he has appeared in a series of videos documenting the gruesome killings of other hostages, including four other Westerners, some of whom he personally beheaded. In each, he is dressed in all black, a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose. He wears a holster under his left arm. A spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Washington said: âOur prime minister has been clear that we want all those who have committed murder on behalf of ISIL to face justice for the appalling acts carried out. There is an ongoing police investigation into the murder of hostages by ISIL in Syria. It is not appropriate for the government to comment on any part of it while this continues.â ISIL is another name for the Islamic State. U.S. officials declined to comment for this report. Emwaziâs family declined a request for an interview, citing legal advice. The Kuwaiti-born Emwazi, in his mid-20s, appears to have left little trail on social media or elsewhere online. Those who knew him say he was polite and had a penchant for wearing stylish clothes while adhering to the tenets of his Islamic faith. He had a beard and was mindful of making eye contact with women, friends said. He was raised in a middle-class neighborhood in London and on occasion prayed at a mosque in Greenwich. The friends, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the investigation, believe that Emwazi started to radicalize after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster. Emwazi and two friends â a German convert to Islam named Omar and another man, Abu Talib â never made it on the trip. Once they landed in Dar es Salaam, in May 2009, they were detained by police and held overnight. Itâs unclear whether the reason for the detention was made clear to the three, but they were eventually deported. Emwazi flew to Amsterdam, where he claimed that an officer from MI5, Britainâs domestic security agency, accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates in the southern part of the country, according to e-mails that he sent to Qureshi and that were provided to The Post. Emwazi denied the accusation and claimed that MI5 representatives had tried to recruit him. But a former hostage said Jihadi John was obsessed with Somalia and made his captives watch videos about al-Shabab, which is allied with al-Qaeda. The episode was described in the Independent, a British newspaper, which identified Emwazi as Muhammad ibn Muazzam. Emwazi and his friends were allowed to return to Britain, where he met with Qureshi in the fall of 2009 to discuss what had happened. âMohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated,â Qureshi said. Shortly afterward, Emwazi decided to move to his birthplace, Kuwait, where he landed a job working for a computer company, according to the e-mails he wrote to Qureshi. He came back to London twice, the second time to finalize his wedding plans to a woman in Kuwait. In June 2010, however, counterterrorism officials in Britain detained him again â this time fingerprinting him and searching his belongings. When he tried to fly back to Kuwait the next day, he was prevented from doing so. âI had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started,â he wrote in a June 2010 e-mail to Qureshi. But now âI feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London. Nearly four months later, when a court in New York sentenced Aafia Siddiqui, an al-Qaeda operative convicted for the attempted murder of U.S. personnel in Afghanistan, Emwazi expressed sympathy for her, saying he had âheard the upsetting news regarding our sister. . . . In the interview, Qureshi said he last heard from Emwazi in January 2012, when Emwazi sent him an e-mail seeking advice. âThis is a young man who was ready to exhaust every single kind of avenue within the machinery of the state to bring a change for his personal situation,â Qureshi said. Close friends of Emwaziâs also said his situation in London had made him desperate to leave the country. Itâs unclear exactly when he reached Syria or how. One friend said he believed Emwazi wanted to travel to Saudi Arabia to teach English in 2012 but was unsuccessful. Soon afterward, the friend said, he was gone. âHe was upset and wanted to start a life elsewhere,â one of the friends said. Once in Syria, Emwazi contacted his family and at least one of his friends. Itâs unclear what he told them about his activities there. A former hostage who was debriefed by officials upon release said that Jihadi John was part of a team guarding Western captives at a prison in Idlib, Syria, in 2013. The hostages nicknamed the facility âthe box.â Emwazi was joined by two other men with British accents, including one who was dubbed âGeorge.â A former hostage said Emwazi participated in the waterboarding of four Western hostages. Former hostages described George as the leader of the trio. Jihadi John, they said, was quiet and intelligent. âHe was the most deliberate,â a former hostage said. Beginning in early 2014, the hostages were moved to a prison in the Syrian city of Raqqa, the Islamic Stateâs de facto capital, where they were visited often by the trio. They appeared to have taken on more powerful roles within the Islamic State. About the same time, Qureshi said, he sent an e-mail to Emwazi. âI was wondering if you could send me your number,â he wrote. There was no response. Goldman reported from Washington.

(Updated: Feb. 24, 2015 8:49 P.M.)GAZA CITY (Ma'an) -- Hundreds of Palestinians were evacuated from their homes Sunday morning after Israeli authorities opened a number of dams near the border, flooding the Gaza Valley in the wake of a recent severe winter storm.The Gaza Ministry of Interior said in a statement that civil defense services and teams from the Ministry of Public Works had evacuated more than 80 families from both sides of the Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) after their homes flooded as water levels reached more than three meters.Gaza has experienced flooding in recent days amid a major storm that saw temperatures drop and frigid rain pour down.The storm displaced dozens and caused hardship for tens of thousands, including many of the approximately 110,000 Palestinians left homeless by Israel's assault over summer.The suffering is compounded by the fact that Israel has maintained a complete siege over Gaza for the last eight years, severely limiting electricity and the availability of fuel for generators. It has also prevented the displaced from rebuilding their homes, as construction materials are largely banned from entering.Gaza civil defense services spokesman Muhammad al-Midana warned that further harm could be caused if Israel opens up more dams in the area, noting that water is currently flowing at a high speed from the Israel border through the valley and into the Mediterranean sea.Evacuated families have been sent to shelters sponsored by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, in al-Bureij refugee camp and in al-Zahra neighborhood in the central Gaza Strip.The Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) is a wetland located in the central Gaza Strip between al-Nuseirat refugee camp and al-Moghraqa. It is called HaBesor in Hebrew, and it flows from two streams -- one whose source runs from near Beersheba, and the other from near Hebron.Israeli dams on the river to collect rainwater have dried up the wetlands inside Gaza, and destroyed the only source of surface water in the area.Locals have continued to use it to dispose of their waste for lack of other ways to do so, however, creating an environmental hazard.This is not the first time Israeli authorities have opened the Gaza Valley dams.In Dec. 2013, Israeli authorities also opened the dams amid heavy flooding in the Gaza Strip. The resulting floods damaged dozens of homes and forces many families in the area from their homes.In 2010, the dams were opened as well, forcing 100 families from their homes. At the time civil defense services said that they had managed to save seven people who had been at risk of drowning.Related

He was 81 years old. Rumors of Nelsonâs death first circulated early July 21, 2015 on social media outlets but was later confirmed by police.A groundskeeper scheduled to perform yard maintenance on Nelsonâs property reportedly found the singer/songwriter unresponsive on the front lawn and immediately called 911.âThere was no evidence of drug abuse or alcohol and no signs of foul play,â said Det. Aldeson.âDetermining an official cause of death could take as long as 3 weeks,â said County Coroner Frank Shultz. âItâs just too early to tell what caused his tragic death.âThe shocking news comes just days after a recent â60 Minutesâ interview where Nelson was quoted as saying âLife is good and I have never felt better or been happier.âThis story is still developing and all information is not yet officially verified.Related Posts	
https://www.emergent.info/priest-says-god-is-female	Claim: A Catholic priest who was declared clinically dead says he met God and she's a woman	false	['Catholic Church', 'Fake News', 'Hoaxes', 'World News Daily Report']	https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/	https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/catholic-priest-who-died-for-48-minutes-claims-that-god-is-a-woman/	2015/02/22	TweetBoston | AÂ Catholic priest from MassachusettsÂ was officially dead for more than 48Â minutes before medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart. During that time, Father John Micheal OâNealÂ claims he went to heaven and met God, which he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure.TheÂ 71-year old clericÂ was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival.With the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2,Â that kept the blood flowing to his brain, doctors atÂ Massachusetts General Hospital managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm.The doctors were afraid he would have suffered some brain damage from the incident, but he woke up less than 48 hours later and seems to have perfectly recovered.Doctors at the Massachusetts General Hospital say thatÂ Father OâNeal is extremely lucky to be alive, while he is convinced that it is God who sent him back to tell the world who âsheâ really is.The elderly man claims that he has clear and vivid memories of what happened to him while he was dead.He describes a strange out-of-body experience, experiencing an intense feeling of unconditional love and acceptance, as well asÂ being surrounded byÂ an overwhelming light.He claims that at that point in his experience, he went to heaven andÂ encountered God, which he describes as a feminine, mother-likeÂ âBeing of Lightâ.âHer presence was both overwhelming and comfortingâ states the Catholic priest. âShe had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a motherâs embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesnâtÂ disturbÂ me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!âThe declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the Catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days, causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.The Archbishop of Boston, Cardinal Sean P. OâMalley, made a public statement this morning statingÂ that Father Oâneal suffered hallucinations linked to a near-death experience and that God clearly isnât a female.Despite the disapproval of his superiors, Father OâNeal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the wordÂ of the âHoly Motherâ.âI wish to continue preachingâ says the elderly cleric. âI would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a womanâ¦âThe Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston has not confirmed, however, if they will allow Father OâNeal to resume his preaching in his former parish in South Boston.

Chief Executive Officer Shane Smith paid for a $300,000 Las Vegas dinner last month, according to a person who asked not to be identified because the meal was private. Smith, a Vice co-founder, had been on a lucky gambling run, the person said.Brooklyn-based Vice has grown from a free, whiskey-stained Montreal monthly into a media titan. Technology Crossover Ventures and A+E Networks each invested $250 million for 10 percent stakes in the company last year.After Gawker published complaints about Viceâs low wages and freelance pay last year, the company released a statement describing the insurance, vacation days and stock program for its employees. Smith, 45, gave $1 million to staff at last yearâs holiday party, Gawker reported.The cost of the meal at the Bellagio casinoâs Prime Steakhouse was reported by Bloomberg News earlier Wednesday, after MGM Resorts International revealed on an earnings call Tuesday that unidentified guests had enjoyed a $300,000 meal. The dinner was held during the Consumer Electronics Show, according to MGM Chief Financial Officer Dan DâArrigo.It was a party of 12, MGM spokesman Clark Dumont said in an e-mail. A guest at the dinner, who asked not to be identified, put the number closer to 25.âNo brainer quiz. What media co exec did I watch win $100k at blackjack last nite?â David Carr, the New York Times media columnist wrote last month on Twitter, weeks before his death at 58. âHint: gambling not his only vice.â(Updates with number of attendees in sixth paragraph.)Share

Read MoreRAMPUR: All was going well at the wedding ceremony of 25-year-old Jugal Kishore, a resident of Moradabad, and his 23-year-old bride Indira from Rampur. That's until the ""varmala"" ceremony, where the groom garlands his would-be wife, began.Just as he extended his arms to do that, Kishore had an epileptic fit, falling to the ground in front of the whole gathering.The young bride, angry that her family had been kept in the dark about Kishoreâs medical condition, promptly changed her mind and announced that she would happily marry at the same ceremony a guest at the wedding, a man called Harpal Singh. The latter, incidentally, turned out to be her sister's brother-in-law.Singh, caught unawares and dressed in jeans and a leather jacket, fumbled for a moment before declaring he would willingly take Indira as his wife. This time the ""varmala"" was exchanged between Singh and Indira, which went off without any hitch, with the pandit reciting the mantras and asking the new couple to take the seven ""pheras"".Meanwhile, Kishore, who had been rushed to a doctor by his relatives, went back to the venue after he regained consciousness to see that his wife-to-be was now someone else's.Kishore pleaded with Indira, telling her that he would not be able to face friends and neighbours if he returned without her. His relatives, too, tried to intervene on his behalf. Where persuasion failed, violence was used â spoons, plates and dishes became weapons as wedding guests tried to force the bride to change her mind. But all in vain. The young woman stood firm.Kishore and his relatives later filed an FIR at the Milak police station in Rampur district, which they eventually withdrew after elders intervened. SHO, Milak police station, RP Solanki said on Monday that cops had detained a few people who were there at the wedding.âBoth families have amicably resolved the matter,"" Solanki said. ""The complaints have been withdrawn. Kishore and his family have now returned in peace to Moradabad.âGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App .

https://www.emergent.info/feminist-blogger-abortion	Claim: A woman aborted a fetus after discovering it was male	unverified	['Abortion', 'Blogging', 'Feminism', 'Hoaxes']	https://injusticestories.com/	https://injusticestories.com/i-aborted-my-baby-because-it-was-a-boy/	2015/02/11	I Aborted My Baby â Because it was a Boy13324Facebook TwitterShareOver the past 3 years, I have lost many friends, and several of my own family members have completely cut off communication with me. I now know that these are âadultsâ who just cannot handle the fact that I have the right to make choices, and that these choices ultimately hardly even affect them.1/17/15 â Editorâs note: Due to the large number of interview requests, I have extended an invitation to the author to post her response to the comments and general negative feelings towards her. I will post an update as soon as she responds.In the spring of 2012, I found out that I was pregnant. I had a good idea who the donator was, but money wasnât really an issue, and I knew that I would be a good mother-like figure for the child by myself. I have always believed in the right for all women to have a choice in terminating their pregnancy, but when I confirmed the diagnosis about a month into into it, I decided that I WAS ready to have this child.My journey has taken me to many different places fighting for womenâs rights and carrying the banner of the Feminist Movement, even to the point of eschewing a career. One of the more prominent themes that I saw in these places was that men generally would look down on us, refuse to help us, or hardly even lend an ear so that we could air our grievances. This didnât surprise me, the patriarchy has been well entrenched since the dawn of time, but here I was, here I am, ready to change it.One of the more alarming incidents happened while I was on my way to San Francisco to participate in an Occupy Wall Street rally. I sat down in my seat on the plane, which happened to be extra full for that day, and a particularly well dressed man happened to be sitting in the seat beside me, in the aisle. After takeoff, he asked me what I was going to San Francisco for, while I generally wouldnât talk to a man sitting next to me on an airplane, I told him I was going to the OWS rally.The man literally scoffed when I spoke those words and leaned in and quietly said to me âB****** like you need to learn their placeâ. Stunned, I screamed âASSAULT!â while other passengers looked at us, the woman across the aisle from him immediately told him to get away from me, but not 5 seconds passed before a flight attendant had rushed over to intervene.Â [sociallocker id=â86â³]Â As I explained to the flight attendant what had happened and I demanded to move seats, I was told that there were only 2 other open seats available, both back in Economy.*Trigger warning* â Extreme patriarchyBy this time, a male flight attendant was on the scene and I told him to have the man moved. The woman-hater just laughed as the flight attendant continued to press me on if he made any physical contact with me. For a moment, I contemplated bending the truth in order to get the woman-hater away from me. His words had violated both my feelings, and my trust, perhaps as much of a violation as actual physical touch. In the end, I confirmed that no physical contact was made, to which both flight attendants told me they couldnât make him move.I was flabbergasted, and then betrayed as they recommended that I move to one of the empty seats. This left me in tears. I knew the only way to get away was to move seats so I did so tearfully and having felt as though I had been verbally and emotionally raped.By the time we landed, my outlook had changed, I could no longer depend on men to be an ally of the cause.As spring turned into summer and my belly started to grow, my mind ran wild with the thoughts of teaching my daughter from a young age tolerance and feminist ideals. Choosing the right all-girls daycare, then elementary school, all so that she could grow up and thrive in an environment where women are told that they can do anything that they want to do. No man will be around to hurt her progress, no boys there to demean her or call her names.I had already started buying gender neutral clothing since I did not want outside influences affecting what gender she would ultimately become. My research on nannies one day came to an abrupt end when my cell phone alarm went off â time for my 5 month appointment. These early appointments had gone well enough, my baby was progressing in a healthy manner.Today, my doctor, who I will call âSandyâ did an ultrasound and everything appeared to be fine. âWould you like to know the gender?â Sandy asked. I thought to myself âThat machine is an ultrasound, not a crystal ball, you couldnât tell me the gender of my baby even if you wanted toââSureâ was my response.âItâs a boyââ¦..â¦â¦âWhat?â I managed to sputter. Sandy then showed me on the ultrasound how exactly my body had betrayed me even worse than the misogynistic suit jockey on the airplane so many months before. I was in shock, I started crying, weeping at the thought of what I was about to curse the world with.On my way home, my driver asked if I was ok and if I needed anything. âJUST STOP RIGHT HEREâ I yelled. Deciding to walk the 4 blocks back home. My home became my prison and my fetus became my warden the next 48 hours. Crying, sobbing, uncontrollable weeping, mental anguish the likes of which may only be experienced by those who have had their lives destroyed by war, I was a refugee, and my home was my refugee camp, an unfamiliar place that was justâ¦.sheltering me.By the third day, I started regaining some of my mental strength and knew what I had to do. I couldnât bring another monster into the world. We already have enough enemies as it is. It didnât matter that I would be raising a son, he would still come into contact with boys, men, perhaps even the suit jockey who would inevitably twist his carefully constructed upbringing with their kindness. He would think âThese men arenât so bad, why would mom say that they are holding me down?âNot all men are bad, my driver showed genuine concern for my well-being that day and I may have taken my anger out on him. That may have been uncalled for. But I knew what I had to do.A few days later, I went in for the procedure, as it was fairly later in my pregnancy, I was aware there were certain risks, but it went off without a hitch. My bodyâs betrayal was no more, I was free, and for the first time since the airplane incident, I felt strong. I had done something positive, something that would actually make a difference, something good, even though as I would find out, many others wouldnât see it that way.Today, I have a beautiful 1 year old female who will hopefully grow up to be just as strong and driven as her mother. I have endured a lot regarding my first pregnancy, but I donât care. Sometimes, even allies will turn on you, but I donât care.I stand by my decision to abort my baby because it was a male.I donât hate men, I hate the patriarchy, what men, and even some women, turn into, I wasnât going to let that happen with my offspring. The chances were greater that it would with a male, it was unacceptable.If the curse returns, I would do the exact same thing all over again.[/sociallocker]30 thoughts on âI Aborted My Baby â Because it was a BoyâMy internet name says:TL:DR womans meets an asshole on a plane, who happens to be a man, falsely claims assault and 5 MONTHS aborts a boy because itâs a boy EVEN THOUGH she made a point of raising her girl gender neutral.Dave Spiller says:Doesnât all-girl daycare and schooling just reinforce the gender divide, telling boys and girls they are defined by their sex?Totally says:No no no, this is gender equality did you even read the tags. Itâs all good, all good.Sammy says:January 17, 2015 at 10:11 amThis is not meant to be hateful or condescending so please please read this. I feel like youâre taking the wrong mentality with this. Part of how we change society is by teaching our children. If your child is a boy, you can help change society by teaching him that misogyny is wrong and to treat women with respect and equality. He would then, in turn pass that on to his children, and so on, and so forth. Iâm not saying a girl doesnât also have the power to change things for the better but when the issue lies with the way men think, you had a chance to bring a respectful male into the world who would then be helping to pass on that mentality. I support a womanâs right to an abortion because there are several reasons why it might be necessary. Be it an inability to care for the child, the womanâs life being in danger, or an unwanted pregnancy due to rape, just to name a few. However I feel the gender of your child is not a valid reason as itâs extremely superficial and even somewhat hypocritical, especially when gender is a social construct anyway. Nothing can be changed and what youâve done cannot be taken back so I wonât dwell on it and berate you for it but I do sincerely hope that if you ever have any more children, please give them all an equal chance, regardless of gender. If the child is a boy, use it as an opportunity to teach them whatâs right so they can pass it down. If the child is a girl, then teach them to be strong like you currently are with your daughter. The gender of your child should never matter and by being selective, all youâre doing is supporting inequality in either gender.Disa says:January 27, 2015 at 10:33 amAGREED! Doesnât matter the gender of your child, it is your child so you get to teach them what you think is right and they will pick that up and teach it to more people, male or female. Boy children are not born with any hatred for women. They are born with compassion and love for their mother and or other caretaker. Their mother, father, or other caretakers are who teach the child who to hate, not their assigned gender.Ashish says:ââTeach them to be strong like you currently areâââ¦.Sabrina Parnas says:January 17, 2015 at 12:42 pmYou are a sick and twisted individual. A man hater like no other. Having a young child that is male, it makes me think that you could just abort it because it was a boy. You donât deserve to have children if you discriminate based on their sex. You are no worse than all the men who are misogynist.Although I am very much pro choice, I find your reasoning flawed and disturbing. I hope you wonât damage your child with your vitriol.And where is the gender equality, if you are ready to abort at the first sign that it is a boy.Michael G says:January 17, 2015 at 2:39 pmYour loss.

You are a misandrist, plain and simple.Jen says:thatâs the most immature thing done by a sane adult.unborn says:You clearly have no idea what assault is.Ted says:January 25, 2015 at 6:37 pmWhile I find the choice horrendous, I canât fault the logic involved. If abortion is truly a womanâs choice, then what business is it of ours to question the reasons behind her choice? As I see it, there are only two possibilities*:A fetus is a meaningless bundle of tissue, without whatever makes life worthy of protection.or:A fetus is a human being.If the first is true, then what difference does it make why she had the abortion? It was a lifeless ball of inanimate matter. It was no more legally or morally wrong than choosing to play checkers, or choosing not to. And if the second is true, again, why should it matter? Aborting for ANY reason would be murder. (health reasons may leave no alternative, but the result is still a purposefully dead child) In either case, the reasoning behind the decision to abort is irrelevant. The only question is whether the concept of abortion (for non-health reasons) is morally defensible.*Of course, itâs entirely possible that a fetus is both, starting as lifeless, then becoming human at some point. In that case, no one knows when that transition occurs, leaving us again with only the above two choices.Joe Wilson says:That was disturbing and sad.scott not scared to use my real name mother fucking rodger says:I dont even have words.Ravi says:Umâ¦not clear on how a fetus can be called a âboy.â It could easily have been a trans girl, gay boy or non-binary person.

YOU my dear are not a feminist, aborting your child because itâs a boy :-0.. The anger that fills me right now can not be put into words. Women like you give the rest of us who are feminists an awful name.I have a son, I adore him and heâs my world. . My husband is an amazing caring smart guy whom i hope my son takes after and weâll do our best to help him grown into a wonder man.All I see from this is hatred of men instead of thinking you could have helped bring a wonderful man into the world you chose to KILL him. . Itâs heartbreaking.Iâm not against abortion for the RIGHT reasons.. Medical or rape but because itâs the wrong gender??????.Feminist you are not! And I as one am ashamed of youwhy says:Love how you delete hateful comments so much for freedom of speech.Bombe 20 says:January 29, 2015 at 4:20 pmLet me start by saying this: I totally respect and support the right of every woman to decide whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term. For any reason at all. A pregnancy has all sorts of effects on the body (and the mind) and while I find the slogan âmy body, my choiceâ a bit too slogan-ish, I consider it basically correct.Now, I do think it is too late for an abortion once the fetus could be kept alive outside the womb, but that is a different discussion.But I have just had a look into my crystal ball and learned a few interesting about your daughter:In one to two years, she will find out that she has a sex â that she is a girl. And she will strongly defend that. She will love Arielle and Barbie and all things pink. She will want to be a princess for Halloween.Maybe you will try to push her in a different direction. You will give her a toy car. She will cuddle it, give it a name and put it to bed. Then you will give her a toy plane. She will make sure the plane becomes friends with the car and put them to bed together. You will give her toy tools. She will use the hammer as a baby bottle to feed the plane and the car. And sheâll still like pink.Sure, you will try to reason with her, argue with her, maybe shout at her. But that wonât change anything. At the most, she will learn not to talk about what she likes because it upsets mommy; in that case, you will not have liberated her, you will have broken her.Eventually she will learn what you did. That you betrayed her out of having an elder brother. An elder brother who would have loved her, cherished her, protected her. Maybe you will be able to outwardly convince her that your decision and your reasons were right. But deep inside she will despise you.And somewhere around 13 to 16 years of age she will start to rebel. On whatever the internet looks like then, she will find intelligent, thoughful and outspoken women like Erin Pizzey, Karen Staughan and the rest of the Honey Badgers. She will listen to what they have to say, see that it has merit and she will think of what you did to her brother.And she will become a vocal Menâs Human Rights Activist. You will have raised the next leader of the MHRM. Just by being who you are, doing what you do.Like making light of a horrendous crime. A man on a plane says something mean to you and you have the gall to claim you feel like you had been raped? Can you even imagine how reading such a sentence must feel to an actual victim of rape?But maybe you do. Everything that you write makes it very clear that you are harboring some kind of trauma. Maybe something really bad happened to you at some point in your life, maybe you even inherited it from your parents.But one thing is very clear: Joining a hateful ideology is not a healthy and productive way to process trauma. Therapy is.B20January 29, 2015 at 8:42 pmWhat the author is describing, frankly, is full-on, cold-blooded, willful, premeditated murder, and a hate crime against that.

https://www.emergent.info/brokaw-wants-williams-fired	Claim: Tom Brokaw wants Brian Williams fired	false	['Brian Williams', 'NBC', 'Tom Brokaw']	https://pagesix.com/	https://pagesix.com/2015/02/05/tom-brokaw-wants-brian-williams-fired/	2015/02/06	You know youâre in trouble when Tom Brokaw is out for your blood. NBCâs most revered journalist is furious that Brian Williams is still in the anchor chair after he sheepishly admitted he hadnât traveled on a helicopter hit by enemy fire. âBrokaw wants Williamsâ head on a platter,â an NBC source said. On Wednesday, Williams, 55, acknowledged that he had repeatedly said he was aboard a chopper that had been hit by a rocket-propelled grenade during a 2003 reporting trip to Iraq, when he was actually safely traveling in a different aircraft. Brokaw, 74, was still the âNightly Newsâ anchor when Williams came back from his Iraq expedition â and an insider said he knew the story Williams later spouted was bunk. âTom Brokaw and [former NBC News President] Steve Capus knew this was a false story for a long time and have been extremely uncomfortable with it,â the source said. NBC News execs had counseled him to stop telling the tale. Williams still took the anchorâs seat for his âNightly Newsâ broadcast Thursday evening â and was working at 30 Rock all day despite calls for his dismissal. He didnât address the issue during the broadcast. âHe is not going to be suspended or reprimanded in any way. He has the full support of NBC News,â a network source said. Many of Williamsâ colleagues believe his claim that he simply âconflatedâ two versions of what happened in 2003. âThere have been meetings about it all day. They are taking it very seriously,â the NBC source said. âBut we believe that Brianâs apology on the air speaks for himself. NBC brass hasnât been talking to lower-level employees about the situation, leaving people in a panic, the insider said. âNBC bosses donât understand how serious this is. Nobody in a leadership position is talking to the troops. Nobody has addressed it,â the source said. âHeâs an aâhole,â he fumed. âHeâs not a journalist. âOh, the fireworks that are going off inside,â he said. âItâs embarrassing. Heâs the face on NBC. Heâs a liar. On Friday, Brokaw responded to reports that he wanted Williams axed. âI have neither demanded nor suggested Brian be fired,â Brokaw said in an email to The Huffington Post.

Animals are our brothers and sisters and what she has done to my eyes is comparable to mass murder she explains. She has taken the lives of hundreds of cats just to make fur coats out of them, this is tragic. How would people react if someone made coats out of human skin? These cats are living beings and all living beings are equal to Mother Earth. I hope she goes to jail for a very long time Legal experts assess the 85-year-old woman could spend up to 18 months in jail for her crimes. Share962K Tweet

McDonaldâs has just announced that it will be phasing out 8 menu items the beginning of next year andÂ most McDonaldâs customers are not happy. With McDonaldâs profits tanking over the recent months, the company has had to make some tough decisions to find adequate solutions for their financial distress by shrinking menu sizes. âOur intent is to have a cleaner menu board that is easier for customers to absorb,â spokeswoman Lisa McComb said in a statement. âTo do so we must simplify our current menu. This means the end of the Big Mac, apple pie and large size menu items. Currently, the Big Mac has a whopping 550 calories and 29g of fat. The Apple pie contains 250 cal, and it would take a full 69 minute to walk that off! With that being said, those two menu items were not a tough decision for elimination. McDonaldâs is currently testing out a new version of their slim down menu in Delaware, Little Rock, Waco, Bakersfield, Macon and Knoxville. They plan a full nationwide rollout beginning February 1, 2015. One notable âingredientâ â preservatives â might also be eliminated from the menu altogether. What do you think about this new menu transformation at McDonaldâs? In an attempt to make America healthier, do you think it will work?	
https://www.emergent.info/hackers-thank-sony-for-pulling-film	"Claim: The group behind the Sony hack sent a message to company execs praising their decision to pull ""The Interview"""	unverified	['Sony', 'The Interview']	https://money.cnn.com/	https://money.cnn.com/2014/12/19/media/insde-sony-hack-interview/index.html	2014/12/19	"Hackers to Sony: We'll stand down if you never release the movieby Brian Stelter @brianstelter December 19, 2014: 2:50 PM ETHackers claim they're done if film never airsThe hackers behind a devastating cyberattack at Sony Pictures have sent a new message to executives at the company, crediting them for a ""very wise"" decision to cancel the Christmas day release of ""The Interview,"" a source close to the company told CNN.The email message was received by Sony's top executives on Thursday night and was obtained by CNN.The source said that the company believes the email was from the hackers because it followed a pattern of previous messages, sent to a list of particular executives and formatted in a particular way.A Sony spokesman declined to comment.Also on Friday, President Obama said he disagreed with Sony's decision.""I am sympathetic to the concerns that they face. Having said all that, yes I think they made a mistake,"" Obama said at a White House press conference.""We cannot have a society where some dictator someplace can impose censorship here in the U.S.,"" he added.Obama: Sony made a 'mistake'Related: FBI: North Korea responsible for Sony hackThe FBI has officially linked the cyberattack at Sony to the North Korean government.""The destructive nature of this attack, coupled with its coercive nature, sets it apart,"" the FBI said in a statement.The Motion Picture Association of America called the hack a ""despicable, criminal act"" on Friday.""This situation is larger than a movie's release or the contents of someone's private emails,"" said Chris Dodd, CEO of the lobbying group. ""This is about the fact that criminals were able to hack in and steal what has now been identified as many times the volume of all of the printed material in the Library of Congress.""The hacker message is effectively a victory lap, telling the studio, ""Now we want you never let the movie released, distributed or leaked in any form of, for instance, DVD or piracy.""The message also says, ""And we want everything related to the movie, including its trailers, as well as its full version down from any website hosting them immediately.""It warns the studio executives that ""we still have your private and sensitive data"" and claims that they will ""ensure the security of your data unless you make additional trouble.""The email was titled ""Message from GOP."" The anonymous hackers have called themselves ""Guardians of Peace.""Sony is still reeling from the late November cyberattack that crippled its computer systems, and now it is under severe scrutiny for canceling the Christmas release of ""The Interview,"" Seth Rogen and James Franco's comedy about an attempted assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.U.S. officials now believe North Korea instigated the hack , lending credence to the Sony executives who privately started calling it a ""terrorist act"" weeks ago.Since the cancellation on Wednesday, the same executives have been wondering whether the leaks of private emails and corporate documents would now stop.Thursday night's message implied that the leaks will stop.In a statement on Wednesday when the film's release was scrapped, the company said ""we stand by our filmmakers and their right to free expression and are extremely disappointed by this outcome.""Many lashed out at the studio for its unprecedented decision to pull the movie. Others have rallied around Sony's predicament.George Clooney, in an interview with Deadline.com on Thursday, revealed that he had circulated a petition earlier in the week saying ""we fully support Sony's decision not to submit to these hackers' demands"" -- but no one was willing to sign it.""It was a large number of people. It was sent to basically the heads of every place,"" Clooney said without naming names.The petition said, ""This is not just an attack on Sony. It involves every studio, every network, every business and every individual in this country,"" and it concluded, ""We hope these hackers are brought to justice but until they are, we will not stand in fear. We will stand together.""It's outdated now, since Sony did cancel ""The Interview."" In the interview, Clooney expressed sadness that ""as we watched one group be completely vilified, nobody stood up.""CNNMoney (New York) First published December 19, 2014: 10:12 AM ET"

https://www.emergent.info/robot-security-guards-microsoft	Claim: Robot security guards are patrolling a Microsoft campus in Silicon Valley	false	['Microsoft', 'Robots']	https://www.extremetech.com/	https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/194338-here-come-the-autonomous-robot-security-guards-what-could-possibly-go-wrong	2014/11/25	Here come the autonomous robot security guards: What could possibly go wrong?Here come the autonomous robot security guards: What could possibly go wrong?By Sebastian Anthony on November 17, 2014 at 8:58 amCommentThis site may earn affiliate commissions from the links on this page. Terms of use .Showing a rather shocking disregard for the long-term safety of human civilization, Microsoft has become one of the first companies to deploy autonomous robot security guards. Dubbed the K5, Microsoftâs Silicon Valley campus was being policed last week by five of theseÂ roughly human-sized 300-pound (136 kg) robots, each equipped with enough cameras, sensors, artificial intelligence, and alarms that they can replace most human security patrols. Fortunately, despite looking like uncomfortably like a Dalek from the Doctor Who universe, the K5 is not (yet)Â equipped with a ray gun or any other method for harming or detaining humans.Updated: Microsoft contacted ExtremeTech to tell us that the robots were only temporarily deployed at its Silicon Valley campus, as part of a demonstration put on by Knightscope. Microsoft PR says it isnât âaware of any future plansâ to deploy such robots.The K5 , built by the Californian company Knightscope,Â is billed rather euphemistically as an âautonomous data machineâ that provides a âcommanding but friendly physical presence.â Basically, itâs a security guard on wheels. Inside that rather large casing (itâs 5 foot tall!) there are four high-def cameras facing in each direction, another camera that can do car license plate recognition, four microphones, gentle alarms, blaring sirens, weather sensors, and WiFi connectivity so that each robot can contact HQ if thereâs some kind of security breach/situation. For navigating the environment, thereâs GPS and âlaser scanningâ ( LIDAR I guess).Â And of course, at the heart of each K5 is a computer running artificial intelligence software that integrates all of that data and tries to make intelligent inferences â like, should I tell HQ about that large gathering of teenagers, or should that man be climbing in through that window?K5 security robot. The lights can change color (red for trouble, orange for caution, etc.)If a K5 decides that thereâs a situation, it can use one of its built-in sirens to try and diffuse things â or it can message HQ to summon a human. If you step in front of the K5, or otherwise interfere with it, it will gently warn you with some chimes â but if you donât move, an âear-piercing alarmâ is triggered . Other than its sirens and its rather imposing design, the K5 isnât equipped with any weapons or other tools for resolving situations. (Does anyone else think it looks like the lovechild of a Dalek and EVE from WALL-E?)A slightly odd photo of a US sheriff holding a gun to the head of a K5 robotK5 isnât just for catching criminals, either: If you find yourself in trouble/danger, thereâs also a button on the top of the robot thatÂ summons help from HQ.Read: Microsoft wants to be part of Judgment Day, tooThe purpose of the K5, like most robots, is straightforward: To replaceÂ expensive human workers. The K5 can run for around 24 hours on a single battery charge, automatically navigates back to the charging point when itâs running low, and only takes 15-20 minutes to recharge. Obviously, in the long run, this is cheaper and more efficient than a human security guard â plus, as technology improves, the K5 will probablyÂ be more vigilant and capable of spotting smaller discrepancies than a human. In theory, because of the lower cost, you could also field lots ofÂ K5 robots, reducing the number of potential holes in security coverage.It goes without saying, though, that deploying a fleet of roughly human-sized, autonomous robots is just a little bit scary. At the very least, a 300-pound robot wouldÂ cause a lot of damage if it ran into something â a car, a shop window, a child. In all likelihood, though, if these robotic security guards are popular, theyâll eventually be equipped with weapons â perhaps a taser for subduing a suspect, and a tear gas launcher for clearing groups of people. At that point, you need to be really sure thatÂ the AI is free of bugs.	
https://www.emergent.info/amazon-streaming-video	Claim: Amazon will launch an ad-supported video streaming service in early 2015	unverified	['Amazon', 'Video']	https://nypost.com/	https://nypost.com/2014/11/21/amazon-plans-a-streaming-video-alternative/	2014/11/23	Amazon boss Jeff Bezos is primed and ready for a fresh assault on the streaming-video space. The e-commerce giant will roll out a new ad-supported streaming offering early next year that will be separate from its $99-a-year Prime membership, which includes a video service, sources said. The ad-supported option â part of an overhaul of its media offerings â poses a serious challenge to streaming rivals such as Hulu and Netflix, analysts said. âIf they do an ad-supported service, they will decouple it from Prime and that is a Netflix killer,â Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. Pachter suggested Amazon would undercut Netflixâs current monthly price of $7.99. âWho wouldnât switch if you were poor or youâre a cord-cutter?â he added. Although it will be separate from Prime, the ad-supported service is ultimately a bid by Amazon to lure people to eventually pay up for Prime membership, said one ad source familiar with Amazonâs plans. âThe main point is to bring in more users that you can eventually up-sell to Prime, or to get to a broader audience that doesnât want to pay for Prime, in order to increase their video share,â the source said. The Wall Street Journal reported in March that Amazon was weighing such a move, but sources confirmed that itâs a definite go. Amazon is prepping a new attack at a time when its video service is gaining ground, sources said. Amazon doesnât disclose the number of Prime members, but RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney estimates it has 50 million global customers. While Primeâs big draw has been two-day shipping, about half of Prime subscribers use the video service that is included with it, or around 25 million, sources said. By comparison, Netflix has 33 million domestic subscribers. A recent Sandvine study also shows that Amazon is making major strides â but has a long way to go before catching Netflix. Amazonâs broadband traffic on fixed networks grew from 1.61 percent to 2.58 percent, the study showed. One change is that Amazon snagged popular HBO content, including âThe Wire,â âTrue Bloodâ and âBoardwalk Empire.â Netflix accounts for 32.39 percent of aggregate traffic. Rumors have been rampant that Amazon plans to let advertisers into its media ecosystem. Amazon has already experimented with ads in some shows, according to tech site Re/code. For advertisers, the service could be the Holy Grail in terms of targeting. In theory, Amazon could tell if ads viewed online led to purchases on its retail site. The news that Nielsen will start rating shows on subscription video services starting with Netflix is likely to encourage advertisers who want to make the leap without forcing Amazon to give up its own data. Amazon will also have leverage over content producers when it comes to the way it chooses to promote shows and movies within its growing ecosystem, a Hollywood source said. Amazon didnât return a call seeking comment.

There has been quite a few people pretending to be 'the sun' but only I could tell you the real story.""The 19-year-old broke the news on Facebook (SWNS.com)In 1996, her mother, Anji Smith, 44, took her to Edenbridge Hospital to be weighed and a health visitor, who had been asked by Ragdoll Productions to find smiley babies, put Jess's name forward.Mrs Smith said it was never intended to be a big thing: ""It was just something a bit different to do and we didn't expect it to be as big as it was.""They just sat her in front of a camera and she just laughed and smiled at her dad.""We didn't hear anything until we got a letter when she was 18 months old saying she'd been picked.""It was really weird seeing her on television.""Jess was put in a high chair for the filming so she would be looking down like the sun.Her furniture deliverer father Bill, 49, made her giggle by playing with a teddy bear behind the camera.And as no one could predict the success of the show, Jess was paid just Â£250 for filming and given a box of toys to take home."

https://www.emergent.info/seth-rogen-woz	Claim: Seth Rogen will play Steve Wozniak in a film about Steve Jobs	true	['Apple', 'Seth Rogen', 'Steve Jobs']	https://variety.com/	https://variety.com/2014/film/news/seth-rogen-steve-wozniak-steve-jobs-biopic-1201338038/	2014/10/31	Seth Rogen has been set to star as Steve Wozniak opposite Christian Bale in Sonyâs Steve Jobs biopic, sources confirm. Variety reported on Oct. 15 that Bale was in talks to star in âJobs,â Sonyâs biopic about the late Apple co-founder. Writer Aaron Sorkin recently confirmed the Bale casting. Jessica Chastain is being eyed for an unspecified role. Based on Walter Isaacsonâs biography âSteve Jobs,â the real-life drama is directed by Oscar-winner Danny Boyle. Scott Rudin is producing the tech drama along with Mark Gordon and Guymon Casady. Sorkin, who also penned the Facebook drama âThe Social Network,â has publicly said the movie will be divided into three long scenes, each taking place backstage before one of Appleâs famous product launches. Sony acquired rights following the Apple mogulâs death in 2011. Wozniak founded Apple with Jobs and Ronald Wayne and is credited with launching the AppleÂ I and AppleÂ II computers in the late 1970s, which had a profound impact on the microcomputer revolution. He left Apple as a full-time employee in 1987. Last yearâs independently financed âJobsâ starred Ashton Kutcher as Jobs and Josh Gad as Wozniak and covered the era from 1974 to 2001 when the iPod launched. Worldwide box office was modest at $36 million. He is represented by UTA, Principal Entertainment LA and attorney Fred Toczek.

WONKET EXCLUSIVE MUST CREDIT WONKetTE! So you all saw the video, today or alllll the way back on Saturday, of a bunch of Dallas airport heroes tackling the fuck out of that violent homophobe guy. But you DID NOT know one of the heroes was Paul Rudd, because you are not Internet sleuth Sara Benincasa.This is even better than the time Ryan Gosling Hey Girled Laurie Penny from getting hit by a lorrie!Well, that is proof enough for us!So here is a thing, about this, for blogging. When we saw the video alllll the way back on Saturday, we said, âthat is nice when men choose to be manly by physically â and at risk to themselves â keeping the peace. But we are guessing everyone here is bored and also on the lookout for troublemakers and terrorists. Call us when they stop a gaybashing in front of the Crowing Cock.â But we did not say it out loud.Well! Now that Paul Rudd is involved â which we know thanks to Sara Benincasa and also this dude @msigs â we are going to guess that FUCK YEAH they would have stopped that nonsense in the streets too, because we give Paul Rudd more credit than random Dallas cowboys, because we are regionist and also classist and probably racist too, the end.Go ahead! Go back to about a minute twenty and watch Paul Rudd full-on tackle the asshole!Good job everybody! Keep calm and keep the nutpunchers down!UPDATE AND RECANTATION! Paul Ruddâs publicist has apparently told The Hollywood Reporter that nuh uh. Stupid publicist.

https://www.emergent.info/ESPN-domestic-violence-panel	Claim: ESPN planned a special domestic violence panel that didn't include any women	false	['ESPN', 'NFL']	https://www.esquire.com/	https://www.esquire.com/blogs/news/espn-has-a-women-problem?src=soc_fcbks	2014/09/29	"Sep 26, 2014Rob Poetsch/FlickrUPDATE: The original opening sentence of this piece was widely interpreted as saying that ESPN was set to run a special panel, hosted only by men, which would address the specific subject of domestic violence in the NFL. In fact, we believed the pre-game show was to run as normal, with a segment on domestic violence. We apologize for the confusion that the language of our opening statement created and we have been told that ESPN was not planning to cover this topic in such a format and has covered domestic violence on air before with its female commentators . The first sentence and headline have been amended to reflect this change.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowAdditionally, we would like to apologize for saying that ESPN is not in the business of journalism. They have produced excellent journalism over the years, such as last year's NFL At a Crossroads: Investigating a Health Crisis .âKate Lewis, VP, Content Operations & Editorial DirectorESPN has issued a statement in response to this story, as seen below.Statement from John Wildhack, ESPN EVP, Programming and ProductionContrary to published reports in Esquire, there was no panel on domestic violence ever planned for tonight's Monday Night Countdown. We will present our normal Monday Night Football pre-game show, with Suzy Kolber hosting. ESPN is proud of the work it has done covering the issue of domestic violence, and is committed to continued coverage. Much of that work has been informed by several talented female colleagues from our television and espnW platforms, including Hannah Storm, Jemele Hill, Jane McManus, Kate Fagan, Sarah Spain and more.Here is a rundown of tonight's show .On Monday night, during Monday Night Football's two-hour pregame show, I thought it likely that the regular commentators were going to discuss domestic abuse in the NFL. Last week, seven men, but no women, discussed Ray Rice's punishment in the opening block of Monday Night Countdown. Victims of domestic violence in America are most likely to be women aged 20-24 .When the show has updates from the fieldâbrief reports about injuries and the upcoming gameâthey'll cut to female sideline reporters, Lisa Salters and, on some weeks, Suzy Kolber.These people are not allowed at the table.On Monday, you will hear the voices of 11 men tripping over themselves to condemn the actions of one man who knocked his wife unconscious and dragged her motionless body into a casino lobby, and another man who head-butted his wife because she would not have sex with him.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowYou will hear their beliefs on the commissioner who did not punish Ray Rice appropriately and whose investigation into Rice's domestic violence incident is currently unclear, and might have been intentionally obfuscated or covered up.But you will not hear these words: ""Roger Goodell is a liar.""You will not hear these words because ESPN has a $15.2 billion broadcasting agreement with the NFL. You will not hear these words because it would interfere with the amount of money both ESPN and the NFL can make.You will not hear these words because ESPN has intimidated its on-air staff into standing down against domestic violence.Last week, ESPN suspended one of its editors, Bill Simmons, for calling NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell ""a liar"" and daring his bosses to suspend him for it. They suspended him for it.Long-tenured editors and personalities of ESPN: It is now time for you to walk out with him.This is the kind of moment that separates a ""journalist"" from a ""commentator."" What do you want to be?Simmons' suspension at ESPN will last three weeksâone week longer than Ray Rice's initial suspension by Goodell himself. Ray Rice punched his fiancÃ©e in the face, knocking her unconscious. Bill Simmons called the head of a corporate interest a liar. His suspension is one of the longest in the history of his company .Simmons' ascendence is credited to his willingness to say sentences exactly like this. By refusing to wait in line or repeat pabulum and talking points all the way to a potential columnist job later in life, he gained an audience. The network hired Simmons to absorb his growing readership into its offshoot Page 2 section, developing a major success in spite of itself.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowSimmons disabused the language of testosterone-soaked talking heads, and it worked. He avoided the intentionally adversarial outrage only created for TV ratings purposes, like the collection of recent controversies by Stephen A. Smith.Before the second, damning tape in the Ray Rice incident became available, Smith initially attempted to deflect the blame of Ray Rice's domestic incident onto Rice's fiancÃ©e , Janay.[pullquote align='C']""What I've tried to employ the female members of my family â some of who you all met and talked to and what have youâis that: Let's make sure we don't do anything to provoke wrong actions. Because if I comeâor somebody else come, whether it's law enforcement officials, your brother or the fellas that you knowâif we come after somebody (who) has put their hands on you, it doesn't negate the fact that they already put their hands on you.""Advertisement - Continue Reading Below[/pullquote]Smith had seen Ray Rice dragging a lifeless body out of an elevator and assumed the victim was somehow asking for it.He was suspended for one week for those comments. Bill Simmons was suspended for three weeks.Not even six weeks after returning from his suspension, Smith was back on First Take, an ESPN morning debate show, having a partial statement read to him from the National Organization for Women about Roger Goodell and Ray Rice. In the statement, NOW President Terry O'Neill implored Goodell to resign. Exactly 39 seconds after hearing her words for the first time in his life, Smith said that the President for the National Organization for Women had ""lost her mind.""Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below""I'm sorry, I think this woman is off her rocker. I think she's lost her mind. That's right, I said it. This is the most ridiculous nonsense I've ever heard in my life. Roger Goodell deserves to lose his job?"" he said. ""That's crazy. That's crazy.""It was a temper tantrum. Smith was not suspended. Simmons was suspended for three weeks. ESPN has no affiliation with the National Organization for Women. ESPN has a broadcasting agreement with the NFL until 2021.Still, this week, ESPN's ombudsman Robert Lipsyte called this ""ESPN's finest hour during my tenure.""Last night, Lipsyte defended Simmons' suspension with this sentence : ""Bill Simmons has no license to call him (a liar) without more justification than 'I'm just saying it.'""Six weeks ago, this is how Stephen A. Smith defended advocating for the discussion of ""the elements of provocation"" that could lead to a man hitting a woman : ""I don't think that's broached enough, is all I'm saying.""Bill Simmons was suspended for three weeks. Stephen A. Smith was suspended for one.In the old boys club of sports mediaâone with no room for reflection and one that empowers only those who can speak about a base emotion in the fastest and loudest wayâSimmons succeeded by writing differently. When his contract expired, Simmons was convinced to stay after ESPN promised him his own outlet, Grantland. The site has since produced thoughtful pieces from different voicesânot just retired, bravado-filled athletes or 50-something male anchors who have paid their corporate dues, but also writers who would rather drill deep into statistics, experiment with art and new media, or write contemplatively, creatively and passionately, sometimes under pseudonyms.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowGrantland finally allowed for the journalism and opinions of, basically, anyone else.When female contributors write features for Grantland, they are equalâanother voice amidst other smart ideas. Women at Grantland are not cast aside to a separate, less-visited section of their website. That's precisely what happens at ESPN proper, the home of ESPNWâa well-intentioned, largely ignored property at the bottom of ESPN.com , called upon only when ""women's issues"" affect sports.This is the kind of tokenism that affected FoxSports.com's Katie Nolan. In August, before the elevator footage of Ray Rice's domestic abuse incident was released, Nolan had the chance to ask Roger Goodell about why he didn't suspend Rice for more games, based on the first video. She didn't. ""I'm really going to hear about it from my bosses,"" she said. ""It's really not my role,"" she said. ""I played the role that had been assigned to me,"" she said.A month later, she understood this to be a part of a culture of quiet repression. ""Women in sports television are allowed to read headlines, patrol sidelines and generally facilitate conversation for their male colleagues,"" she said. ""Sometimes they even let us monitor the Internet from a couch.""She said all of this in a video on FoxSports.com. She ended it with, ""I'm ready when you are, Fox.""Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowShe was not suspended. She was applauded on the company's website .And that is the problem with ESPN and the old-wave of sports media: Sports are not now being infiltrated by ""women's issues"" that demand one-off responses. Women are half the population of the worldâand sports are a part of that world.There are 11 seats at the table at ESPN. All of them go to men. Women get their own table, but only sometimesâand ESPN has placed that table where no one can hear them.ESPN personalitiesâeven those 11 menâhave spent the last two weeks on television defending their position atop a moral high-ground. Each retired player and 60-year-old man has had his chance to spout tough talk about how he would never personally commit or condone domestic violence.Now that their company is standing behindâas ESPN anchor Keith Olbermann put itâ ""an enabler of men who beat women"" instead of an employee, where have these personalities gone?They are silent.Long-tenured editors and personalities of ESPN: Those condemnations mean nothing if you don't stand up for your ideals, your integrity, and the rights of women when your paycheck is on the line.It means you, too, are just like your bosses: When faced with reporting the truth or collecting a paycheckâeven at the most critical moment of your journalistic careerâyou will take the paycheck.It means every word spoken about morality from now on is simply just posturing to protect your public image.It means you are not a journalist. It means you are a commentator, for now and forever.So stand up. You'd stand for the defining issues of the moment: Corporate entanglement, equal rights, the idea of journalism, and your own integrity.You would be vindicated in the eyes of history during this very tiresome moment. You would be standing for the truth.Advertisement - Continue Reading Below"	
https://www.emergent.info/rivers-selfie	Claim: Joan Rivers' doctor took a selfie during her operation	true	[]	https://www.cnn.com/	https://www.cnn.com/2014/09/16/showbiz/joan-rivers-clinic/index.html?sr=sharebar_twitter	2014/09/17	"See more of Susan Candiotti's investigation of Yorkville Endoscopy at 8 p.m. ET/PT Wednesday on ""Anderson Cooper 360"" on CNN. (CNN) -- The cardiac arrest leading to Joan Rivers' death happened as the comedian's personal doctor began performing a biopsy on her vocal cords, a source close to the death investigation told CNN. A staff member at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic told investigators that the doctor, who has not been publicly identified, took a selfie photo in the procedure room while Rivers was under anesthesia, the source said. Rivers, 81, was at the clinic for a scheduled endoscopy by another doctor, gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen. That procedure, intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat, involved the insertion of a camera down her throat. After Cohen, the clinic's medical director, finished his work, a biopsy was done on Rivers without her prior consent, according to the source. Comedian Joan Rivers died Thursday, September 4, a week after suffering cardiac arrest during a medical procedure, her daughter said. She was 81. Click through the gallery to look back at her career. Rivers' big break came in an appearance on Johnny Carson's ""Tonight Show"" in 1965. It was the beginning of a relationship that would include dozens of appearances as guest and guest host. Rivers followed her Carson breakthrough with appearances on talk and variety shows. Ed Sullivan had her as a guest in 1966. Rivers hit a peak in the 1980s, headlining in Las Vegas and becoming a regular guest host on the ""Tonight Show."" Rivers is famed for her quick wit, which she often uses against herself. Rivers later hosted talk shows of her own. Here, she chats with Dolly Parton. She starred on the daytime ""Joan Rivers Show,"" for which she won a Daytime Emmy, for five seasons, from 1989-1994. Here, she poses with her dog, Spike. Rivers wanted to be an actress when she was young, and she fulfilled that goal after her success as a comedian -- though sometimes playing herself, as she did on ""Nip/Tuck,"" with Julian McMahon, left, and Dylan Walsh. Rivers and her daughter, Melissa, have been regulars on awards show red carpets, critiquing celebrity fashion with lines both generous and cutting. Rivers talks with Tim McGraw and his wife, Faith Hill, at the Grammys in 2005. Rivers with Tina O'Brien at the British Academy Television Awards in 2007. Rivers was a star among comedians, admired for her longevity and wit. She attended the Mark Twain Prize ceremony in 2008. The honor that year went to the late George Carlin. Kathy Griffin is one of many comedians who can cite Rivers as an influence. Like Rivers, Griffin is known for mocking celebrities at various events. Here, she and Rivers share a stage during a Rivers roast in 2009. Rivers proved herself to be quite the savvy businessperson by winning a season of Donald Trump's ""Celebrity Apprentice."" Trump and his wife, Melania, join Rivers at the season finale in 2009. Katie Finneran and Rivers attend the Broadway opening after-party of ""Promises, Promises"" at the Plaza Hotel in New York in 2010. Rivers, a fashion lover, attends the LensCrafters' reveal of Sunglass Fashion Crimes in 2011. In February 2013, she attended the Dennis Basso Fall 2013 fashion show. Alongside her, from left, are Martha Stewart, Star Jones and Kelly Bensimon. After a falling-out with Johnny Carson, Rivers didn't return to the ""Tonight Show"" until earlier this year, when Jimmy Fallon took over as host. She was a guest on Fallon's show on February 17. Rivers officiates the wedding of William ""Jed"" Ryan, left, and Joseph Aiello at the Plaza Athenee on August 15 in New York. An ear, nose and throat specialist not certified by the clinic as required by law performed a biopsy on her vocal cords. The doctor is described by the source as Rivers' personal ear-nose-throat physician. ""Even though you are a licensed physician, you still should have, if you will, the checks and balances to get your approval to practice in that particular place,"" said Dr. Arthur Caplan, a medical ethicist at New York University's Langone Medical Center. Investigators believe that Rivers' vocal cords began to swell during the allegedly unauthorized biopsy, cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which led to cardiac arrest on the morning of August 29, the source said. Rivers, 81, was rushed by paramedics from Yorkville Endoscopy to New York's Mount Sinai Hospital a mile away, where she died a week later. Yorkville Endoscopy issued a statement last Thursday denying reports that any vocal cord biopsy has ever been done at the clinic, although federal privacy law prevented any patient information from being released. The day after the denial was issued, the clinic confirmed that Dr. Cohen ""is not currently performing procedures... nor is he currently serving as medical director."" The source said that at this time neither Cohen nor the ear, nose and throat doctor have been accused of wrongdoing by investigators. The clinic declined to respond to the source's comments about a biopsy or a selfie, citing federal privacy law."

https://www.emergent.info/scorpion-delays-plane	Claim: An Alaska Airlines plane was delayed when a scorpion stung a woman onboard	true	['Alaska Airlines', 'ESPN', 'Scorpions']	https://espn.go.com/	https://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/12328436/oregon-state-beavers-flight-delayed-scorpion-stings-woman-aboard-plane	2015/02/17	" Senior college basketball reporter. Graduate of the University of Wisconsin. Oregon State's trip home from Los Angeles was delayed Saturday after a scorpion stung a woman aboard the commercial plane. An Alaska Airlines spokesperson confirmed in an email to ESPN that the incident occurred while the plane was on the tarmac. Oregon State coach Wayne Tinkle said a woman sitting two rows in front of him on the team's commercial flight was stung by a scorpion. ""The woman was a real champ,"" he said. ""She acted like it was a mosquito bite."" The woman reported being stung on the hand, and the plane returned to the gate, where she was checked by medical personnel but declined further treatment. Alaska Airlines stated that it is uncertain how the scorpion got on the plane but acknowledged that the flight originated in Los Cabos, Mexico, where the plane was on the ground for approximately one hour. Reached by phone aboard the plane Saturday night before the team took off for Oregon, Beavers coach Wayne Tinkle told ESPN that the woman was sitting two rows in front of him. ""The plane was coming from Mexico before us, and [the scorpion] was on the plane,'' Tinkle said. ""The woman was a real champ. She acted like it was a mosquito bite. They got it off her but the needle was stuck."" Alaska Airlines stated that flight attendants killed the scorpion before maintenance staff checked the plane's overhead bins. The airline planned to have an exterminator ""thoroughly check the plane"" once the flight arrived in Portland. The Beavers lost to USC 68-55 earlier Saturday night."

Based on actual facts isnât it? I mean correct me if Iâm wrong but isnât it based on the top sellers of each category? Grammys and other shows like that are based upon a group of peopleâs opinions. Itâs subjective. Artist that I actually like and listen to donât even get nominated. Hell I didnât even know Beck or Beyounce had an album out. So in a way it is a popularity contest because little indie records that in my opinion are way better never even have a chance.

https://www.emergent.info/manson-fiance-wants-his-corpse	Claim: Charles Manson's fiance wanted to marry him to obtain custody of his corpse	unverified	['Charles Manson', 'Marriage']	https://nypost.com/	https://nypost.com/2015/02/08/charles-mansons-fiancee-wanted-to-marry-him-for-his-corpse-source/	2015/02/10	This plot was too crazy even for Charles Manson. Mansonâs engagement to a woman 53 years his junior was part of a wild scheme of hers to profit by putting his body on public display after his death, says the author of an upcoming book. Mansonâs fiancÃ©e, 27-year-old Afton Elaine Burton, known as Star, sought to wed the convicted mastermind of the Sharon Tate murder and eight other slayings so that she could gain possession of his corpse, according to journalist Daniel Simone. Burton and a pal, Craig Hammond, planned to lay out Mansonâs remains in a glass crypt, Simone says. The pair figured their bizarre California version of Leninâs Tomb would draw huge crowds and make big money. But Manson, 80, does not want to marry Burton and has no interest in spending eternity displayed in a glass coffin, Simone told The Post. âHeâs finally realized that heâs been played for a fool,â Simone said. Another reason the madman balked at the plan is because he believes he is immortal. âHe feels he will never die,â Simone said. Mansonâs and Burtonâs marriage license expired Thursday. âThey plan on renewing the license, and things will move forward in the coming months,â says a statement posted on Burtonâs and Hammondâs website. Burton and Hammond â who uses the nickname Gray Wolf â could not be reached for comment. The wedding was postponed âdue to an unexpected interruption in logistics,â the site says. Manson entered a prison medical facility for treatment of an infection about two months ago and cannot receive visitors, Simone said. California prison officials would not comment on either Mansonâs medical condition or his whereabouts. Simone and a collaborator, Heidi Jordan Ley, are seeking a publisher for their book, âThe Retrial of Charles Manson.â Manson and other inmates at Corcoran State Prison in California are helping the project. The authors say they spoke with Manson regularly before his phone privileges were suspended two years ago. They also corresponded with Manson and his inmate friends by mail. According to the authors, Burton and Hammond hatched their plan to display Mansonâs corpse about two years ago. Initially, the duo asked Manson to sign a document that would let them take his body when he dies. âHe didnât give them a yes, he didnât give them a no. He sort of strung them along,â Simone said. Burton and Hammond regularly brought Manson toiletries and other items. Stringing them along kept the goodies coming, Simone said. When it became clear last year that the purportedly death-proof Manson would not green-light the plan, Burton and Hammond switched to the marriage idea, Simone says. If Burton married Manson, the pair realized, California law would give her possession of Mansonâs remains upon his death, Simone said. Simone believes Manson never intended to marry Burton. âManson never consented to the wedding in the first place and never will,â he said. Another Simone book, âThe Lufthansa Heist,â about a $6 million armed robbery at Kennedy Airport in 1978, is due out next month. He co-authored it with âGoodÂ­Fellasâ mobster Henry Hill, who died in 2012.

Staff at the animal shelter in Knyszynska ForestÂ in Poland where she lives, had introduced a male snow owl into her enclosure to offer her company. However, two days later, her mate was found dead and half-devoured. Shelter spokesman, RobertÂ Konowal said: âThe first two days were fine and they seemed to get on very well. âWe were horrified when we then discovered she had killed him. âAt first we couldnât understand why but we took the remains to a vet who after examining him found that his testicle sack and private parts were underdeveloped. For any Harry Potter fans out there, this may change your opinion of Hedwig who was also a female snowy owl.

https://www.emergent.info/miracle-cat-back-from-grave	Claim: A cat that was hit by a car and believed dead dug himself out of his grave	true	['Animals', 'Cats', 'Florida', 'Zombies']	https://humanesocietytampa.org/	https://humanesocietytampa.org/miracle-cat-comes-back-from-the-grave/	2015/01/28	January 26, 2015 February 2, 2017Miracle Cat Comes Back From The Grave!By Humane Society of Tampa Bay In In The News Tags bart the cat , miracle cat , tampa bay , zombie catUPDATE! February 2, 2017 Here is how comfortable Bart feels in his new home: His mom purchased a soft, stuffed elephant as a Christmas present for her baby niece. Bart proceeded to pilfer through the bag, drag the elephant out, carry it to his sleeping spot and snuggle up with it for a nap. Itâs been his ever since and is the only toy in the house the other animals donât dare touch. The niece did receive a holiday gift, just not the elephant.UPDATE! September 14, 2016 Itâs Official, Bart is OURS!After 20 months in our care, countless hours of paperwork, and millions of prayers and well-wishes from across the world, we finally have been legally granted ownership of Bart the Miracle Cat to the Humane Society of Tampa Bay! But he was only ours for a few hours as his foster family prepared to make his place in their home permanent. At 1:00pm Wednesday, September 14th at our shelter we celebrated the end of the custody battle and, consequently, his adoption, with a âGotcha Dayâ party (âGotcha Daysâ are adoption birthdays in the animal welfare world).In January 2015 Bart became an internet sensation after being hit by a car, buried alive, and clawing his way out of his grave. He ended up at our animal hospital where we preformed extensive surgery to repair his broken jaw, remove his eye, and nurse him back to strength and health. The questionable circumstances surrounding his injuries led us to fight for his custody so that we could find him a loving home. To many he became known as âZombie Catâ but to us heâs always been nothing short of a miracle. Not because we believe he rose from the dead, but because his gentle spirit, will to survive, and resilience in the face of extreme trauma embody all that we love and admire about animals. He is truly an ambassador for second chances and continues to inspire people the world over. We love you, Bart, always and forever.UPDATE! April 24, 2016 We know you havenât heard from Bart in awhile, but he is still doing GREAT! In fact, he recently got visits from a couple of his fans. First, he and this special young lady really bonded when she was with us for Critter Camp. When he saw her last week he got so excited and rolled right over so that she could pet him. Second, this wonderful lady has been following his story since the beginning and came by to see how healthy and happy he has become. He was happy to show her the ropes of life at HSTB (sleep, eat, play, snuggle, repeat). And, finally, we wanted you to see how exhausting the celebrity life can be; here is Bart mid-yawn and ready for a nap after his morning of socializingUPDATE! February 23, 2016 Bart really is the sweetest thing but, every once in awhile, the cattitude comes out! While being visited by a friend, Bart promptly plopped on top of the toy basket so that the curious interloper would not have access. Silly kitty, we love you!UPDATE! January 13, 2016 See how Bart is doing nearly one year after being hit by a car, buried alive, and clawing from his grave! Thanks to FOX 13 News for shooting the footage.UPDATE! January 1, 2016 Happy New Year from our sweet boy, Bart! As you can see, he is fairly unimpressed with the festivitiesUPDATE! November 29, 2015 Looks like Bart had a little to much Thanksgiving. Well, he deserves it!UPDATE! October 30, 2015 You asked for it, you got it! Many of you have been wondering how our famous, one-eyed friend is doing. Well, heâs fantastic and happier than ever, and weâre still waiting on the courts to decide custody. Here, he is guarding the entrance to the break area where the staff keeps their snacks because, you know, he gets first dibs.UPDATE! September 22, 2015 Here is a picture of handsome Bart taking a moment out of his play time to pose for the camera. Such a silly kitty. He is doing well, loving life and getting more spoiled by the day. Still no news on the legal case with his previous âownerââ¦ so for now heâs still living it up at HSTB.UPDATE! July 22, 2015 It was a snuggle up and nap kind of day for Bart. Or, is that the Princess and the Pea? Whichever, the more layers of fluff, the better the snooze!Still no update on the pending court case, we apologize!UPDATE! June 25, 2015 We post a lot about how much love Bart is getting, and he is! BUT, we may have neglected to inform you about how much love and joy he brings to US! He is a courageous, friendly, silly and affectionate kitty who greets us each day with happy enthusiasm and makes us laugh with his goofy way of jumping on our keyboards and trying to eat our lunches. Here, he made a volunteerâs day by giving her a cuddle and a kiss when she went visited him over the weekend.UPDATE! June 19, 2015 While we donât have any information to share about the court case (still in process) we do have a cute picture to share. Yesterday, Bart got a visit from an avid fan and had a wonderful time showing off his skills with his favorite toys. The little girl had so much fun, she and her mom went out and bought him a laser toy then came back to give it to him and play some moreUPDATE! June 8, 2015 While there is still no news about the ongoing court case, we can report that Bart is doing very well in our care. He is a happy, playful and affectionate kitty who LOVES to meet new friends, like the little girl pictured here. She came in with her mom to finish registering for Critter Camp and was so excited to meet Bart. They played together for quite awhile and weâre sure sheâll be back to say hello.UPDATE! May 12, 2015 Bart had to share his space with a former adoptable who was visiting for the day. Bert the gentle giant, and Bart the feisty feline were doing great until the unknowing pit mix traveled too close to the room where Bartâs food is kept (behind and to the left of Bart). At that point there was a hallway stare down with kitty growls and doggie whimpers. The poor, intimidated pup quickly loped off to find a different office to nap in while Bart pranced around in victory.Note: Bert belongs to a staff member and is gentle with cats. We know him very well and he was supervised at all times, as was Bart.Â UPDATE! April 29, 2015 This lovely Canadian family was vacationing in Tampa Bay and took time out of their week to come visit with Bart! He loved meeting them and showing the children how good he was at chasing his toys around the desk. Heâs an international star who just wants to be snuggled and loved!UPDATE! April 24, 2015 Itâs getting pretty warm here in Tampa Bay, so Bart spent this lazy, hazy afternoon fishing.UPDATE! April 16, 2015 Bart helps comfort a nervous kitten who recently arrived at the shelter.UPDATE! April 14, 2015 Bart got a visit from a two-legged friend who came by to read him a story before his afternoon nap.[easingslider id=â24342â³]UPDATE! April 13, 2015 Today, depositions began in the custody case for Bart. Ellis Hutson and Dusty Allbritton were deposed today and HSTB Executive Director Sherry Silk will be deposed next week. We wanted to let you all know that the case is in process. We are still hopeful of a victory so that Bart can continue to thrive (see pictures above) and find a loving forever home.UPDATE! April 2, 2015 Is Jack searching the basket for the perfect toy to share with his friend, Bart? Or is he simply hoarding all the goods? Either way, these two are TOO CUTE together!UPDATE! April 1, 2015 No April Fools joke here, Jack actually allowed Bart to nap in his favorite purple bed! They are becoming fast friends. Unfortunately, our staff member was without a desktop for a little while!UPDATE! March 30, 2015 Bart is a happy camper as he recently got the wires removed from his jaw and received some further repair to his palate. Dr. Justin Boorstein is very happy with his healing progress and how well he came through the surgery, although it will still be quite some time before his mouth is completely healed. He said that Bart should soon be able to start eating dry food again! In the picture above, he is happily giving himself a post-surgical bath while overseeing some of the staff in their office.UPDATE! March 25, 2015 Today, our good friends from Humane Society of Pinellas came by for a visit and got to play with Bart. He showed them his favorite toy and how he has mastered the art of snagging that ribbon!UPDATE! March 20, 2015 Bart got a visit from some young fans today and got to take his first unselfie with them! He continues to do well and will most likely get the wires removed from his jaw in the next two weeks. Weâll keep you updated!UPDATE! March 12, 2015 Bart got a visit from some very generous fans who personally presented him with his very own stroller! They wanted him to be able to get some fresh air, safely! These wonderful ladies from Sunshine Accessories in Tarpon Springs had a great time visiting with Bart and introducing him to his new ride. We canât thank them enough! UPDATE! March 11, 2015 Today, the author of Buzz Beau Blatt the Wonder Cat sent Dr. Justin Boorstein (Bartâs surgeon) a signed copy of her childrenâs book In Honor of Bart! As you can see, Bart was much more interested in a snuggle with his favorite doc, but thatâs OK; this book will be perfect for our Critter Camp to help teach humane values and the resilience of animals! Thank you, Linda Sumas Blatt!UPDATE! March 9, 2015 Bart has received several wonderful beds from fans across the country. Today, he found this one particularly snuggly. The perfect place to spend a Monday, donât you think? Many thanks to all the generous folks who have sent him beds, toys, blankets, treats, cards and well-wishes.UPDATE! March 6, 2015 Bart got a luxurious bath today with a safe whitening shampoo to help make him look even more handsome than he already was! He also got a little bling on his collar and a bow to match. But his favorite part of the pampering session was a post-spa snuggle fest with a favorite staffer.UPDATE! March 5, 2015 Today, the legal process to determine custody of Bart began in court. Over the next few weeks our legal team will conduct discovery into the circumstances surrounding his situation. We will provide legal updates as they come available. In the meantime, Bart continues to do well, making great strides in his recovery, lounging in sunbeams and enjoying attention and affection from volunteers and staff.UPDATE! February 27, 2015 Not only is Bart healing well but he is also making friends! Our former feral boy, Jack, who lives at our administrative building was happy to share his favorite desk with a new friend. He didnât budge from the bed or offer to share, but weâll give it some time! Weâre just happy to see Bart acting like a happy, normal cat again!UPDATE! February 25, 2015 Itâs been a busy day for Mr. Personality! He received a letter from a fan in Germany, a new bed and treats from an admirer in Pittsburgh, and this toy from our staff which he LOVED! You can see from the picture the progression from vague interest to âoh I get what Iâm supposed to doâ to âSUCCESS!â.UPDATE! February 23, 2015 We donât have much new to report on the custody case but we can say that Bart is doing fantastic. He is still healing and eating well, and has mastered the litter box! We are so proud of him. Above is a picture of him taking a nap in one of our stafferâs laps after eating his lunch.UPDATE! February 16, 2015-Bart is thriving under our care, eating well and gaining weight. He is enjoying more mobility and gets frequent visits from staff, volunteers and visitors. He loves the attention and has become quite the cuddle bug.We know there are questions about Bartâs situation and future stemming from the pending lawsuit with Mr. Hutson. Because this is an open case, there are things about which we cannot go into detail. However, we would like to try and answer some of the most frequently asked questions in the best way we can.QUESTION 1Why did you change your mind about returning Bart to his owner? We received information that the owner was actually present when Bart was buried and there was a witness claiming the cat was still alive. In addition, we discovered that Bart was not brought to us immediately after he crawled out of the grave. He suffered from severe injuries for at least 2-4 days in the care of his owner before the medical treatment was sought; this is against the law.QUESTION 2Hillsborough County Pet Resource Center is stating that they have not filed cruelty or neglect charges against the owner. Is that true? Although no charges have been filed to date, we are still hopeful that the county will file charges based on evidence of violation of the following Hillsborough County Ordinances:Sec. 6-21 Rabies Vaccination RequirementSec. 6-22 Registration & License tags RequirementSec. 6-24 Display of Tag Requirement; Cat IdentificationSec. 6-25 Humane Treatment of AnimalsSec. 6-26 Cruelty to AnimalsSec. 6-28 Confinement to Property; Dogs and Cats at LargeÂ QUESTION 3Is the Humane Society of Tampa Bay using Bart to âline their pocketsâ (raise money)? The Humane Society of Tampa Bay is a Charity Navigator 4-Star Charity for five years running. This is the highest rating possible for fiscal responsibility and transparency. Only 3% of money we receive goes towards administrative costs (including salaries). No oneâs pockets are being lined.Most importantly, all money we have received as a result of Bartâs story has gone into a restricted fund called âSave-A-Pet Medical Fundâ to pay for Bartâs medical care. This money can only be used to cover the cost of medical care for pets, like Bart, whose owners are unable to afford veterinary treatment. So, in actuality, the money weâve raised is being given right back to the community by offering free medical treatment to pets in need.In 2014 we provided $53,413 in financial assistance from our Save-A-Pet Medical Fund for the treatment of 261 dogs and cats.Â QUESTION 4When will the issue of Bartâs custody be resolved? As of today, February 16, 2015, a court date has not been set. We will announce the date once it is determined.QUESTION 5How can I adopt Bart? If you are interested in adopting Bart, please send an email with your contact information to communications@humanesocietytampa.org and we will add you to the list. Please understand that the list of potential adopters for Bart currently stands at more than 100 individuals.UPDATE! February 11, 2015â On Tuesday, February 10, 2015, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay was served with official Hillsborough County Court documents notifying the Society that it is being sued by Ellis Wayne Hutson for the custody of Bart the cat.Mr. Thomas Gonzalez, of Thompson Sizemore, Gonzalez & Hearing , has agreed to volunteer his time to represent the interests of Sherry Silk, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay, and Bart the cat. The Humane Society of Tampa Bay will review all legal options to keep Bart safe and secure. Bart continues his medical treatment and care at the Societyâs animal hospital.UPDATE! February 6, 2015â We have some great news about Bart! Check out that empty dish to his right, he is eating like a champ and taking his meds orally with no complaint. When we went to visit him, he was cleaning himself and full of meows and headbutts for us. He is definitely feeling better and his cute little personality is starting to shine through even more. And, we got word from Hillsborough County Pet Resource Center that they will be sending an officer to investigate the situation at the Hutson residence.UPDATE! February 4, 2015â We are so pleased that Bart continues to improve, day by day. Today when we approached his cage, he actually got up and walked to the door to greet us with chirps and meows. He is also showing a good appetite and interest in eating. He still needs the feeding tube and his jaw will remained wired for another 6 weeks, but he is definitely on the mend. We are proud of the little guy!UPDATE! February 2, 2015â Well, Bart surprised us today by taking his first bites of food since coming to our facility on January 23. This is a very good sign of his continued recovery. Because he is unable to eat enough food to sustain him, he will still need his feeding tube for several more weeks. He receives feedings every 4 hours through the tube to ensure that he is getting enough nutrients. We are so proud of this brave boy!UPDATE! February 2, 2015â Bart is resting comfortably this morning but is still unable to eat on his own. Our Director of Medical Operations believes he will need his feeding tube for a few more weeks until his jaw and palate are completely healed.UPDATE! January 30, 2105â New Information About Bart: Recently we have learned new information about Bartâs home environment and the circumstances leading up to his burial. Therefore, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay does not intend to return Bart to the Hutson family. We are prepared to fight for the best interests of this cat. We hope the Hutson family will do the right thing and surrender Bart to our care so that we can find an appropriate environment for him to live out his life.The Humane Society of Tampa Bayâs Save-A-Pet Medical Fund, along with donations for Bart that we have received from generous individuals all over the world, will cover the cost of all medical care required and will help replenish our Save-A-Pet fund for other animals in need. We are not asking the Huston family for any money to cover any costs.The Humane Society of Tampa Bay had no involvement with the creation of the GoFundMe campaign set up to cover the cost of Bartâs medical care, nor have we received any funds from the account to date. Again, Bartâs medical costs are being covered by our own Save-A-Pet Medical Fund. Our concern is for Bartâs future.As always, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay is dedicated to the plight of companion animals in our area and strives to protect and promote their best interests at all times.UPDATE! January 28, 2015â Bart was struggling due to anemia. One of our shelter cats, Draco, was the donor for a blood transfusion to help Bart feel better. The transfusion went well and both cats are happy and resting comfortably.UPDATE! January 28, 2015â Bart came through his surgery very well and is resting comfortably in our care. He will be able to go home in 5-7 days once he is able to eat on his own. Full recovery will take about six weeks. He is a brave boy!UPDATE! January 27, 2015â Bart will be having surgery to repair his jaw and remove his eye today.We have seen many amazing cases at our full-service veterinary clinic, but this situation may take the cake! Our public hospital is currently caring for Bart, a 1.5 year old cat who was found by his owner after being hit by a car. The cat appeared to be lifeless and the owner buried him. Five days later, the cat showed up in a neighbors yard, alive! He had dug himself out of the grave and slowly made his way back home, albeit weak, dehydrated and in need of medical attention.The owner reached out to area veterinary clinics but, unable to afford their fees, brought him to the our Animal Health Center where he is being treated for a broken jaw, open facial wounds and a ruined eye, which will have to be removed. Luckily, the injuries sustained were not more serious. HSTB veterinarians expect him to recover and be able to go back home.CLICK HERE to donate to Bartâs care and to help other animals in need!

https://www.emergent.info/argentina-president-adopts-boy-werewolf	Claim: The president of Argentina became the adopted godmother of a boy to help stop him from becoming a werewolf	false	['Argentina', 'Christina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner', 'Werewolf']	https://www.jta.org/	https://www.jta.org/2014/12/25/news-opinion/world/argentinas-president-adopts-jewish-godson	2014/12/29	Argentinaâs president adopts Jewish godson under law to counteract werewolf legendDecember 25, 2014 12:17pmArgentine President Christina Fernandez lighting Hanukkah candles with the family of Shlomo and Nechama Tawil, whose son became the first Jewish boy adopted under a law intended to counteract an old Argentine legend.BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (JTA) â Argentinaâs president adopted a Jewish godson under a law intended to counteract an old legend about werewolves.President Christina Fernandez described in seven tweets her meeting with her new godson, Yair Tawil, a member of a Chabad-Lubavitch family.The adoption practice derives fromÂ an old custom byÂ which the presidentÂ adopts theÂ seventh son born after six boys with no girls in between to prevent him from becoming a werewolf. Belief in the legend was once so widespread that families were abandoning, giving up for adoption and even killing their own sons.The custom became a law in the 1970s and provided the boys withÂ presidential protection, a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until their 21st birthday. Until 2009, the law only applied to Catholic boys.Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, in 1993 wrote a letter to the president asking for the honor and were denied. But this year, Yair wrote a letter to the president citing the 2009 decree and asking for the designation of godson.OnÂ Tuesday, he became the first Jewish godson of a president in Argentinaâs history. Fernandez received Yair, his parents and three of his brothers in her office, where they lit Hanukkah candles together.The president in herÂ tweets and photos described to her 3.4 million Twitter followers aÂ âmagical momentâ with a âmarvelous family.â She described Yair asÂ âa total sweety,â and his mother a âQueen Esther.âShe tweeted that the Tawils âare a very special family. They have a sort of peace, happiness and a lot of love that is not common.â The tweet included a link to the presidential blog, which includes more photos from the meeting.CORRECTION: The original brief stated incorrectly that Shlomo Tawil was the director of the Chabad House in Rosario, located in central Argentina. The sentence has been deleted.Â The original brief also stated incorrectly that the original law was adopted in the 1920s. It was actually adopted in the 1970s.

https://www.emergent.info/Planetary-alignment-weightlessness-hoax	Claim: A unique planetary alignment on Jan. 4, 2015 will cause partial weightlessness on earth	false	['Daily Buzz Live', 'Fake News', 'Hoaxes', 'Science']	https://dailybuzzlive.com/	https://dailybuzzlive.com/planetary-alignment-jan-4-2015-will-decrease-gravity-5-minutes-partial-weightlessness/	2014/12/29	"Sharing is caring!0Tweet0Share0Share0Pin0Mail0SharePlanetary Alignment On Jan 4, 2015 Will Decrease Gravity For 5 Minutes Causing Partial Weightlessness.Strange natural occurrences are happening in the world today. But nothing more magnificent than the one you will experience on January 4, 2015.According to British astronomer Patrick Moore, at exactly 9:47 PST AM on January 4th, Pluto will pass directly behind Jupiter, in relation to Earth. This rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull, temporarily counteracting the Earths own gravity and making people virtually weightless. Moore calls this the Jovian-Plutonian Gravitational Effect.Moore told scientists that they could experience the phenomenon by jumping in the air at the precise moment the alignment occurred. If they do so, he promised, they would experience a strange floating sensation.Astronomers have long been aware that there would be an alignment of the planets on that date, when Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto would be on the same side of the sun, within an arc 95 wide. But now they are guaranteeing the occurrence as the gravitational effect of the other planets on the Earths crust is maximum even at their closest approach.But dont get too excited. If you think youll be able to float around your house, youre wrong. But, if you jump in the air at 9:47 AM PST, on January 4, 2015, it should take you about 3 seconds to land back on your feet instead of the usual 0.2 seconds.So, mark this date on your calendar and share it with your friends! Zero gravity day is just around the corner!UPDATE: In case you missed it, CLICK HERE to check out the photos and video of people who successfully participated in Zero G Day!

https://www.emergent.info/bosnian-girls-pregnant-school-trip	Claim: Seven underage Bosnian girls got pregnant on a school trip	unverified	['Bosnia', 'Pregnancy']	https://inserbia.info/	https://inserbia.info/today/2014/12/bih-seven-primary-school-students-pregnant-after-five-day-excursion/	2014/12/23	BANJA LUKA â Primary school students from a small town in Bosnia and Herzegovina went to a five-day excursion, and after some time it turned out that seven schoolgirls got pregnant on it.Illustration National Coordinator for Reproductive Health of the Republika Srpska Nenad Babici said that children engage in sexual relations as early as at age of 13 or 14 and added that primary school students from a small town in Bosnia and Herzegovina went to a five-day trip, and after some time it turned out that seven schoolgirls got pregnant on it.He said that the reason for this was neglect of parents, but also educational institutions, toward the education of children.Babic said that early engagement in sexual relations later leads to a series of consequences such as infertility, various diseases, miscarriages and premature births.âIn the Republika Srpska between 15 to 18 percent of people are struggling with infertility, we have 15 percent of miscarriages and between 5 to 10 percent premature births,â he said.Only last year, according to the Clinical Center of the University in Sarajevo, 31 minors gave birth, four of them are 15 years old, ten are 16 years old and 17 are 17 years old.The problem of adolescent in Bosnia and Herzegovina is becoming more prominent, but information on the increasing number of sexually active girls aged between 13 and 15 years of age is also shocking.Thus, on a website where girls seek advice from experts, gynecologists, peers, one of them wrote:âI would have sex with my boyfriend, even though Iâm only 14â¦ But I am afraid Iâll be judged.âThe page also contains information according to which boys engage in sexual relations at age of 11, writes âDnevni Avazâ.Sarajevo gynecologist Senad Mehmedbasic says that it is terrible that girls aged 13 or 16 engage in sexual relations, but adds that this is something that, unfortunately, is in the trend.He warns that in these cases both pregnancy and child birth are highly risky. âIt is obvious that children do not have enough of health education so they engage in such activities, not knowing the consequences. We have to be more direct in the educational system, it must not be allowed that street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life,â he said.	
https://www.emergent.info/texas-plumbing-truck-isis	Claim: A Texas plumbing company's truck is now being used by militant Islamist fighters in Syria	true	['ISIS']	https://www.cbsnews.com/	https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-plumbers-truck-on-front-line-of-syria-war/	2014/12/19	"By Tucker Reals CBS News December 16, 2014, 10:06 AMTexas plumber's truck on front line of Syria warA photo posted to Twitter on Dec. 15, 2014, by the Islamic extremist rebel faction Ansar al-Deen Front shows a truck once owned by a plumbing company in Texas City.EmailLONDON -- A pickup truck once owned by a plumbing company in Texas has somehow found its way to the front lines of Syria's civil war and been converted into an anti-aircraft weapon for Islamic militants.A photo posted to Twitter on Monday by the Ansar al-Deen Front, an Islamic extremist brigade seemingly comprised largely of Chechen fighters, shows the Ford F-250 with a militant standing in the bed firing the anti-aircraft gun.Speaking to CBS News Tuesday morning, a representative of the plumbing company in Texas City said the vehicle was sold to the AutoNation dealership in Houston in Oct. 2013, and that's the last they knew of it.The company has been besieged by phone calls -- including threats -- since the photo appeared online, clearly showing the company's name and phone number. CBS News is not identifying the company due to the nature of some of the attention it has received.They have employed an attorney and intend to pursue legal action to force Twitter to remove the photo from the Internet.Reached by CBS News Tuesday morning, a person identifying himself as a manager at AutoNation would not comment on the sale history of the vehicle in question, saying ""we can't give information like that over the phone,"" before hanging up the phone.The representative of the plumbing company in Texas City said they would ""most definitely"" be removing their logo from all vehicles sold in the future.Ansar al-Deen Front has been fighting in the complicated Syrian war primarily around Aleppo, Syria's largest city and formerly the economic powerhouse of the nation.It has been the scene of some of the most vicious fighting between Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces and the myriad rebel groups trying to topple him, but is largely controlled by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ).CBS News' Khaled Wassef contributed to this report.Â© 2014 CBS Interactive Inc.

So how will McDonalds define overweight?Obesity rates in America have more than doubled over the last 2 decades and has become the leading public health issue in the U.S. With more than two-thirds of the adult population overweight, McDonalds has decided to become part of the obesity rate solution not the problem.According to reports, beginning January 1, 2015, McDonalds will no longer serve customers who show risks of being overweight. They will define overweight by these standards: Over 170 lbs for women and 245 lbs for men. Childrens weight restrictions will vary depending on age and height.McDonalds is currently running campaigns to shake its junk food image, insisting they sell nothing but good quality food. They are are branding themselves from A dining experience of fast food to Good food served fast. They want people to understand the risks of being overweight.So how will they know if you are overweight ? Will they ask you what you weigh and trust your answer? NOThey are implementing scales at the from of every register just like the one in the photo below. You must stand on the scale when ordering or you will not be served. They also plan on posting signs to let customers know that they have the legal Right to refuse service to anyone. For drive-thru patrons it may be a bit more difficult to enforce. However, if the person looks like they exceed the weight restrictions, they will be refused service at the drive-thru window.CLICK HERE > To FOLLOW us on TWITTERCLICK HERE > TO LIKE DAILY BUZZ LIVE ON FACEBOOK!You Might Also LikeHaunted House AdventureNetflixs Altered Carbon Is a Sci-Fi RollercoasterElon Musk Sells 15,000 Flamethrowers in 48 HoursJennifer Aniston: Should Rachel Have Ended Up With Joey?Youtubers Seeing Red After Recent Policy ChangesMan Charged With Drug Offenses Because $324K Smelt Like CocaineRussian Journalist Fakes Own Death to Avoid AssassinationPowerball Ticket Sold In Massachusetts Wins Record $758.7 MillionRailbookers Takes You on Worlds Most Scenic Train Journeys?These content links are provided by Content.ad.

https://www.emergent.info/NSA-elf-on-shelf	Claim: Popular Christmas toy Elf On The Shelf is an espionage project run by the National Security Agency	false	['Elf On the Shelf', 'Fake News', 'Hoaxes']	https://www.duffelblog.com/	https://www.duffelblog.com/2014/12/elf-on-a-shelf-snowden/	2014/12/17	Share TweetSTOCKHOLM â Speaking via Google Hangout to officials in Sweden last week, former NSA Contractor Edward Snowden dropped a bag of coal on his former employers by revealing the hugely popular âElf on a Shelfâ trend is actually an intelligence gathering operation originating with and run by the National Security Agency.âIt actually started out as a joke,â Snowden said in his speech. âSomeone photocopied a picture of an elf with the caption âIâm watching you,â and it just kept moving from cubicle to cubicle.âSnowden said that at some point it occurred to someone that if people as paranoid as NSA staff would play this game, what would happen with civilians?âNow, the NSA has an agent inside practically every home with a child in it,â Snowden said.âThe elves have basic mobility, which isnât a problem because when one shows up someplace unexpected,â Snowden added, âitâs just assumed to be part of the game.âThrough these adorable snoops, the NSA has gained access to millions of tax returns, bank statements, and 10-year old boys unwrapping and re-wrapping their presents in the days ahead of Christmas.âWe would flag those kids for later recruitment to the intelligence community,â Snowden said. âEspecially for Tailored Access Operations .âIn addition, the NSA has uncovered a trove of data about the personal lives of millions of Americans, sources confirmed.âThe NSA has incorporated advanced sensors into these things that can uncover all kinds of information,â journalist Glenn Greenwald told Duffel Blog in an email. âThey can tell things about peopleâs health â cancer, heart disease, liver disease. They know whoâs being naughty, and whoâs beingÂ really naughty, thingsÂ that even extensive online snooping couldnât provide. Dildos, vibrators, chains â all the things stashed in closets and under beds.âSources told reporters these were previously inaccessible to the governmentâs leading intelligence agency, if the owners paid cash at least.âIf you want to know why the âprivacy advocatesâ have settled down, and moved on? My guess is, blackmail. These elves have accumulated petabytes of evidence against pretty much everybody,â Snowden said.âYou wouldnât believe what perverse things people will do to each other, right in front of these things,â Snowden concluded. âItâs why âElfMonitorâ is such a highly sought after duty assignment.âRecommended For You:	
https://www.emergent.info/heart-rate-glance	Claim: The Apple Watch will include a feature called Heart Rate Glance	true	['9to5 Mac', 'Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Features', 'Mark Gurman']	https://9to5mac.com/	https://9to5mac.com/2015/03/06/sources-offer-hands-on-apple-watch-details-battery-life-unannounced-features-and-more/	2015/03/06	Just ahead of the finalized Apple Watchâs presentationÂ at Appleâs March 9th âSpring Forwardâ event, sources with hands-on Apple Watch experience have revealed a collection ofÂ new details about the deviceâs features to 9to5Mac. The Apple Watchâs battery life has concerned many prospective customers, as Apple said only that theÂ Watch will need to be charged nightly. Earlier this year, we reported that Appleâs developmentÂ targets for Apple Watch battery life were 2.5-4 hours for heavy app usage, versusÂ 19 hours per day of combined usage betweenÂ light appÂ access, notifications, and Glances. Sources who have handled the Apple Watch tell us that Apple has improved the deviceâs battery life, noting that the final Apple WatchÂ should be able toÂ handleÂ 5 hours of fairly heavy application usage, and it and wonât run out of battery during a typical day of mixed active and passive use. However,Â the source says that the device will still need toÂ be charged nightly, as it will definitely not last through aÂ second full day. AsÂ The New York Times reported, Apple will addressÂ battery life concerns with a newÂ âPower Reserve Modeâ that cuts optional services to preserve as much of the Apple Watchâs core functionalityÂ as possible. Our sources have shared several new details about the feature. First, Power Reserve Mode can be activated via a Battery Glance thatâs accessible at any time, orÂ via the Apple Watchâs Settings application. The Battery Glance will show the percentage of battery life remaining, the amount of time since the last full charge, and a large button to activate Power Reserve Mode. Power Reserve Mode canÂ even be accessed when the Watch has a full 100% charge, and it is not solelyÂ activated when the Watchâs battery life is low. The mode noticeably dims the display, slows down communication with the iPhone to an on-demand level, andÂ puts the display to sleep after roughly two seconds of inactivity. One unit tested allowed access to all Apple Watch functions while in Power Reserve mode, while another unit was limited to the Clock face. Weâre told that some test units took between four and five hours to charge up to 100% from 0% via the wall-attached MagSafe charger. This is a notable improvement, weâre told, from fall 2014 prototypes. Unlike the iPhone, when battery life is low on the Apple Watch, the device does not show a modal popup window indicating the battery life percentage remaining. Instead, with 20% battery life remaining, the Battery Life glance turns an orange/amber color as a subtle alert to the user. At 10%, the glance turnsÂ from orange/amber to a red color. On the iPhone side, our sources say that they did not see any âmeaningfulâ change to the iPhoneâs battery while using the Apple Watch. OneÂ notable yet-to-be-announced Apple Watch feature is theÂ Heart Rate Glance. Thanks to the deviceâs heart rate monitor, the Heart Rate Glance will allow the user to see their Beats Per Minute at any time. When accessingÂ the Glance, an outline of a heart will appear, similar to the heart in the image above. After aÂ button is tapped to startÂ measurement, the screenÂ will show the constantly updating BPM reading. Our sources say that the process of reading the heart rate was almost instant and the readings were âseemingly accurate.â Previously, Apple has only stated that the Heart RateÂ sensor will be used to send other users their heart beat via the communication features and to measure intensity for calorie reading in the fitness app. Of course, heart rate readings could be transferred to the Health application on the accompanying iPhone. Our sources indicate thatÂ the following Glances are installed on the Apple Watch by default, in addition to Heart Rate and Battery Life: Fitness Stats, Activity, Clock, Weather, Music, Quick Settings, Calendar and Maps. As discussed on one of our recent Happy Hour podcasts, sources also indicate that the Apple Watch will have a full Notification Center like theÂ iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Mac. To access Notification Center, a user can swipe down from the top of the display in any screen. The list of notifications will show each app name as well as truncated descriptions of the alerts, akin to an iPhone. Developers will be able to customize which notifications can show up in Notification Center as well as the Apple Watch app icon specific to this view. As Apple has announced, the Apple Watch will be able to store musicÂ that can beÂ played while unlinked to an iPhone. Prototype Apple Watches within Apple are said to include 8GB of storage; it is yetÂ to be seen whether the shipping versions will allÂ include 8GB. As we noted yesterday, the internal units also include Lightning connectors, which wonât be on the shipping models. Users will be able to specify individual songs, albums, and playlists to be loaded to their Apple Watches via a panel in the Companion app for iPhone. Users will also be able to stream music from the Apple Watch to external speakers or headphones over Bluetooth. As we extensively reported earlier this year, the settings for individual Apple Watch applications will be controlled by a Companion application on the iPhone. The Companion app has a dark black user interface with a glyph of the Apple Watch as theÂ app icon. In addition to controlling various settings and music storage, the Companion app allows users to re-arrange the icons on the Apple Watchâs Home screen. This can be done from the Watch itself as well via a long press, just like on the iPhone and iPad. When a user downloads an iPhone application from the App Store with a WatchKit component, the Watch app is automatically installed on the Watch. Users can remove the WatchKit applications through the Companion app without deleting the app from the iPhone. Interestingly, if the iPhone is not connected to the Watch, third-partyÂ application icons will remain on the deviceâs Home screen, and the applications will still workÂ for a period of time with cached data. Sources have praised the Watchâs next-generation force-sensing touchscreenÂ interface, saying that âthe screen feels like a giant button than you just want to press in the manner needed for Force Touch.â A source added that the feature âfeels naturalâ on the small screen. Also, the Digital Crown input device is required to use the Apple Watch, as the Watch differs from the sixth-generation iPod nano in lacking pinch to zoom capabilities: it registers touches and movements up, down, left, and right. There is no keyboard at all on the device; all forms of input are handled withÂ pre-populated options and voice dictation. Speaking of dictation, the menus within the Apple Watch label all voice control features as âVoice Control,â rather than as Siri. As we reported earlier, this initial version of the Watch OS does not support replying to emails, even by voice. Users will need to access the Mail app via Handoff on their iPhone to conduct replies. People who have used the Apple Watch say that the device feels very fast overall, which is in line with our report that the S1 chip is comparable withÂ theÂ current iPod touchâs A5 chip. But there are limits. One source said that an Apple Watch with over 200 WatchKit applications became noticeably sluggish on the Home screen. It is unlikely that the majority of users will ever install 200 WatchKit applications, so this should not be a typical concern. The sources say that the display will light up when the iPhone is locked for all of the phoneâs notifications, but if the iPhone is unlocked, the Watch will not light up for new alerts. A designerÂ familiar with the quality of mobile device screens who has used the Apple Watch says that the âscreen is the best [smartwatch]Â screen I have ever seen,â noting thatÂ âitâs like vibrant digital paper, and does not look rendered,â with especially âgreatâ black levels. The source thinks that the smaller, 38mm version is âtiny,â but of course thisÂ will differ between users of different sizes. AppleâsÂ Sport Band, theÂ default on theÂ $349 aluminum Apple Watch, is said to âtake timeâ to get used to as it is somewhat difficult to put on at first due to the pin-based closure system. Some users have wondered how the Apple WatchÂ will be powered off without a dedicated power button. Our sources say that itâs turned off by long pressing the large âcommunicationÂ buttonâ on the right side of the Watch. When this is pressed, a confirmation sliderÂ akin toÂ the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch is shown, letting a swipe finish the shut down. Users can also Force Quit an unstable application by accessing the shut down screen and then quickly pressing the button on the right side. The Apple Watch also includes a Settings application that includes various toggles including Bluetooth and Airplane Mode. There is not a dedicated Wi-Fi settings panel, which instead will likely be controlled by the accompanying iPhone. Apple will officially announce Apple Watch pricing and availability onÂ Monday, March 9, starting at 10:00AM Pacific/1:00PM Eastern Time. 9to5Mac will offer coverage of the event in the hours leading up the keynote, during the presentation, and afterwards, so please join us for more news and commentary then.

His prediction was issued in a new note to investors this week, a copy of which was provided to AppleInsider.Bachman is bullish on the Apple Watch, but he believes it will take some time for applications to be built that will truly sell the public on the upcoming wrist-worn device.His estimates suggest there will be an installed base of more than 484 million iPhone users as of December 2015. Sales of 19 million Apple Watch units would equate to 3.9 percent of the total user base.For fiscal year 2016, Bachman believes Apple will sell 36.5 million of the Apple Watch, growing to 10.9 percent of iPhone users by September of 2016.Bachman's confidence in the Apple Watch comes despite the fact that there is still much not known about the wearable. In particular, he's especially curious to find out final pricing, application availability, and battery life.Regarding the high-end price point, BMO's analyst isn't concerned if the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition sells for more than $10,000. He suspects Apple will sell very few units at that price, as most high-end watch consumers will opt for a brand like Rolex that can stand the test of time.Bachman also isn't concerned about suspected battery life of around 24 hours. He noted that most consumers have become accustomed to recharging their iPhone at night by their bedside, and he expects Apple Watch users will do the same.BMO has maintained its price target of $135 for shares of AAPL, along with an ""outperform"" rating.Topics:"	
https://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-diagnostics-port	Claim: The Apple Watch will ship with a diagnostics port	unverified	['Apple Watch', 'Matthew Panzarino', 'TechCrunch']	https://techcrunch.com/	https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/05/would-you-buy-a-smart-band-for-an-apple-watch/	2015/03/05	Would you shell out money for a âsmartâ accessory band for an Apple Watch that added additional capabilities? More battery life, perhaps? The reason I ask is that the Apple Watch has a port that the company has yet to show off. Itâs being used for diagnostics and direct access to the Watch operating system, but itâs feasible that could be used to connect accessories in the future. The port has a 6-dot brass contact array inside the groove for the âbottomâ strap connector slot. Several sources have confirmed its existence and placement to me. It is very similar to the connector for the Lightning connector in iPhones, as that connector currently only uses 6 of its 8 available pins. Apple recently began opening up the Lightning port for use by third parties. A source says that this port is currently for diagnostic purposes only â but that there is nothing preventing it from being a connection port for future accessories. Letâs get this out of the way: As far as I know, smart bands will not be a part of the first Apple Watch version. But the existence of the port is interesting. Every millimeter of the Watch has been decided with purpose in mind. In a device so small and personal, you cannot afford to keep anything extraneous. Apple including this kind of port on what I believe to be the shipping versions of the Apple Watch means that itâs absolutely necessaryÂ in order to install the OS during manufacturing. Or forÂ testing or debugging purposes â say, in an Apple Store. But that doesnât preclude the possibility that it could be used to connect accessories in the future. Those accessories would likely take the form of bands that expanded the capabilities of the Watch in some way. One obvious way would be to include additional sensors in a band to gather more information about the wearer in health capacities. This could be a way to add sensors that measured stress, blood pressure and more â things the current version does not track. Itâs also conceivable that a company like Mophie could build a Watch band that contained an additional battery for extended life (if Apple extends band manufacturing to other companies, which seems likely). Pebble recently announced a feature for its new Time watch called âSmartstraps,â which operates on the same principle. This first wave of the Apple Watch will be about seeing what developers can get it to do with apps. But, as weâve seen with the iPhone, accessories are a big driver of Apple retail. Having accessories that not only augment the Watch aesthetically, but also operationally, would be big business. This kind of extensibility would be a great way to get around the âI just bought a watch for a couple thousand dollars that will be obsolete next yearâ problem. What if people that shelled out thousands could add additional capabilities by simply upgrading their bands? This wouldnât help if most of the money you spent was on your hardened gold link band, of course, but it could alleviate the angst over having to replace a hefty investment down the road. While the port is on watches that are being used by Apple employees currently â there is always a possibility that the Watch version that ships to consumers wonât have this port at all (the Watchâs design has changed in small ways over the months since its announcement). There is also absolutely no guarantee that the port will ever be used for anything but diagnostics. But itâs still interesting that it exists â and to think about the possibilities. If youâre curious, the other slot has âAssembled in China â Designed by Apple in Californiaâ engraved inside. Update:Â Apple declined to comment on rumor or speculation. Update: A report from 9to5Mac suggests, as I noted was possible, that the port wonât be on the models that ship to consumers.This report was apparently referring to a Lightning port. The diagnostic port we mentioned above is both on Appleâs watches at the event (we checked) and in their videos released on the construction process. Update: A report from 9to5Mac suggests, as I noted was possible, that the port wonât be on the models that ship to consumers.

https://www.emergent.info/apple-tv-refresh	Claim: Apple will reveal a refreshed Apple TV at the March 9th Spring Forward Event	false	['Andrew Cunningham', 'Apple', 'Apple TV', 'Ars Technica']	https://arstechnica.com/	https://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/03/what-to-expect-when-we-spring-forward-with-apple-on-march-9/	2015/03/05	"Sign up or login to join the discussions!Stay logged inSign up to comment and more Sign upTech âWhat to expect when we âspring forwardâ with Apple on March 9The Apple Watch will get the spotlight, but a few Mac updates are long overdue.reader commentsShare this storyThere's an Apple event on Monday , soÂ it's time to run down our list of rumors and hunches so you know whatÂ to expect from the company.Apple's tagline for the event is ""spring forward,"" a less-than-subtle reference to the Apple Watch and a reminder that holding a product event the day after Daylight Saving Time begins is cruel. Since this event is likely to be the springboard for an all-new product line, it's probably going to crowd out most other announcements, which makes this list shorter than it normally is. That said, the timing is right for a handful of other announcementsâhere's whatÂ we think will share the stage on Monday.Apple WatchEnlarge / Don't be sad, Apple Watch! It's almost your ""time"" to shine.Megan GeussNot quite hands-on with the Apple Watch, and the questions it doesnât answerThis is a gimme. The Apple Watch has already been announced, so we know what it looks like and some basic things about how it works. We know it's scheduled to launch in April, and we have some basic information about what it does. We know it requires an iPhone 5 or better and that it will support Apple Pay even when tethered to older phones. We know the price starts at $349, probably for the aluminum Apple Watch Sport model with a basic band.What we're likely to get on Monday is an actual launch date, more specific pricing information for all three versions of the product and their bands, and some kind of showcase of third-party apps. At iPhone and iPad launches, Apple usually has at least one or two devs come on stage to walk the audience through a demo that shows what the new hardware is capable of. iOS still enjoys the widest and deepest third-party support of any mobile platform, so we'd expect third-party support to be a major selling point for the Apple Watch as well.We donât know whether the Apple Watch will succeed or notânobody knows, no matter how many op-eds have already called it oneÂ way or theÂ other . In either case, its launch signifies the start of something new for Apple.MacsEnlarge / The 2013 MacBook Air is a year-and-a-half old, mid-cycle processor bump notwithstanding. That's an eternity in computer years.Andrew CunninghamSame wrapper, all-new candy center: The 2013 MacBook Air reviewedMacs aren't the targets of leaksÂ to the extent that iDevices are, so this one is not as sure a bet as the Apple Watch. That said, most of Apple's Mac lineup hasn't been refreshed in well over a year ( blameÂ Intel ). Among those products, there are three for which new Intel processors now exist: the MacBook Air ( BroadwellÂ U or perhaps CoreÂ M ), the 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro (Broadwell U again), and the Mac Pro ( Haswell-EP and refreshed workstation GPUs from AMD ). Higher-wattage quad-core parts suitable for the 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro and most iMacs aren'tÂ dueÂ untilÂ midyear .Of those three, the MacBook Air is the only thing we've really heard many rumors about. Earlier this week, we saw convincing screenshots that suggested the current 11- and 13-inch MacBook Airs would be refreshed with Broadwell chips, but not with new designs. Another rumorÂ proposes something totally differentâ a 12-inch versionÂ ofÂ theÂ computer that streamlines the chassis and does away with nearly all ports. One USB Type-C port would handle all wired connectivity, and using Intel's Core M rather than the more powerful Core i5 and i7 CPUs would allow it to run without a fan. It may or may not use a Retina-class display; reports are less clear on that one.Even if the latterÂ product exists, we're not sure where it would slot into Apple's lineup. Is it a new product line entirely? Is it intended to be the future of the MacBook Air, leaving power users with the 13-inch MacBook Pro if they want more ports and more performance? We can't say for sure, but remember that Apple didn't replace non-Retina models immediately when it introduced the RetinaÂ MacBookÂ Pros and the RetinaÂ iMac .

https://www.emergent.info/apple-itunes-beats-subscription	Claim: Apple will not reveal the iTunes subscription service based on Beats Music at the March 9th Spring Forward Event	true	['9to5 Mac', 'Apple', 'iTunes', 'Mark Gurman']	https://9to5mac.com/	https://9to5mac.com/2015/03/05/apple-plans-relaunched-beats-streaming-music-service-for-wwdc-skipping-march-event/	2015/03/05	Apple wont take the wraps off of its upcoming Beats-based music streaming service at its March 9 Spring Forward event, according to music industry sources briefed on the launch timeline. Instead, Apple currently plans to introduce the service, at least in beta form, at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in early June. The WWDC keynote likely takes place on Monday, June 8th, and thats the event where the debut will occur. The new iTunes music streaming service is based on technology acquired from Beats Music, including curated playlists, cloud-based libraries, and offerings customized to the musical tastes of individual users. The service will be priced as high as $7.99 per month, which is less expensive than current $9.99 pricing for Beats Music, Spotify, and Rdio...iPad Air 2The service was initially planned for launch earlier in 2015, but was delayed by the departures of key employees, as well as difficulties integrating Beats human and technology resources into Apple. Some Beats executives such as Bobby Gaza, who was a Senior Vice President at Beats in charge of technology, have departed Apple in recent weeks. The new Apple-made service will also make way for Apples first entirely-in-house Android application, but sources say that delays to the Android app are also possible as some of Apples Android developers have also left the company. Apple has, not coincidentally, published job listings for Android developers in recent days.Apple currently plans to launch the new music service as part of an iOS 8.4 upgrade for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch following WWDC, but a final decision has not yet been made. Its possible that the service will be bundled into iOS 9 this fall, which is expected to have a significant focus on bug fixes and stability improvements. The service will be integrated into the standard iOS Music application and will function similarly to Beats Music for iPhone, but it will have an entirely Apple-designed aesthetic that matches the Music app and iOS. On the Mac side, the new service will be implemented with an iTunes update.As for the Apple TV, the new service will be an app that replaces the existing Beats channel. Sources say that Apple is also finishing up work on a slimmer Apple TV set-top-box with a more capable and tactile remote control and a redesigned operating system bundled with an App Store. As of last fall, Apple had hoped to debut a new set top box as soon as this month, but with reports of the discussions between Apple and content providers being in only early stages, it seems that, just like last year, content roadblocks could keep the new Apple TV from debuting until another point in the future. As we learned yesterday regarding the larger iPad Pro, Apple will have another busy fall, so perhaps the new Apple TV will launch later in the year.While the streaming service wont debut at the March event, as some had hoped, Apple still has plenty to talk about. The Apple Watch will be the cornerstone of the event, where sources expect Apple to spend a significant amount of time introducing and demonstrating third-party WatchKit applications as selling points for the device. It is also highly likely that Apple will discuss the rest of the price points for the device and its accessories before the April ship date. Apple has a redesigned MacBook Air with Retina display in the works for this year, but it remains unclear whether Apple actually plans to debut the computer at the March event.

Since this event is likely to be the springboard for an all-new product line, it's probably going to crowd out most other announcements, which makes this list shorter than it normally is. That said, the timing is right for a handful of other announcementsâhere's whatÂ we think will share the stage on Monday.Apple WatchEnlarge / Don't be sad, Apple Watch! It's almost your ""time"" to shine.Megan GeussNot quite hands-on with the Apple Watch, and the questions it doesnât answerThis is a gimme. The Apple Watch has already been announced, so we know what it looks like and some basic things about how it works. We know it's scheduled to launch in April, and we have some basic information about what it does. We know it requires an iPhone 5 or better and that it will support Apple Pay even when tethered to older phones. We know the price starts at $349, probably for the aluminum Apple Watch Sport model with a basic band.What we're likely to get on Monday is an actual launch date, more specific pricing information for all three versions of the product and their bands, and some kind of showcase of third-party apps. At iPhone and iPad launches, Apple usually has at least one or two devs come on stage to walk the audience through a demo that shows what the new hardware is capable of. iOS still enjoys the widest and deepest third-party support of any mobile platform, so we'd expect third-party support to be a major selling point for the Apple Watch as well.We donât know whether the Apple Watch will succeed or notânobody knows, no matter how many op-eds have already called it oneÂ way or theÂ other . In either case, its launch signifies the start of something new for Apple.MacsEnlarge / The 2013 MacBook Air is a year-and-a-half old, mid-cycle processor bump notwithstanding. That's an eternity in computer years.Andrew CunninghamSame wrapper, all-new candy center: The 2013 MacBook Air reviewedMacs aren't the targets of leaksÂ to the extent that iDevices are, so this one is not as sure a bet as the Apple Watch. That said, most of Apple's Mac lineup hasn't been refreshed in well over a year ( blameÂ Intel ). Among those products, there are three for which new Intel processors now exist: the MacBook Air ( BroadwellÂ U or perhaps CoreÂ M ), the 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro (Broadwell U again), and the Mac Pro ( Haswell-EP and refreshed workstation GPUs from AMD ). Higher-wattage quad-core parts suitable for the 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro and most iMacs aren'tÂ dueÂ untilÂ midyear .Of those three, the MacBook Air is the only thing we've really heard many rumors about. Earlier this week, we saw convincing screenshots that suggested the current 11- and 13-inch MacBook Airs would be refreshed with Broadwell chips, but not with new designs. Another rumorÂ proposes something totally differentâ a 12-inch versionÂ ofÂ theÂ computer that streamlines the chassis and does away with nearly all ports. One USB Type-C port would handle all wired connectivity, and using Intel's Core M rather than the more powerful Core i5 and i7 CPUs would allow it to run without a fan. It may or may not use a Retina-class display; reports are less clear on that one.Even if the latterÂ product exists, we're not sure where it would slot into Apple's lineup. Is it a new product line entirely? Is it intended to be the future of the MacBook Air, leaving power users with the 13-inch MacBook Pro if they want more ports and more performance? We can't say for sure, but remember that Apple didn't replace non-Retina models immediately when it introduced the RetinaÂ MacBookÂ Pros and the RetinaÂ iMac . There may be a transitional period.However the lineup shakes out, we think MacBook Air news is most likely, followed by everything else we just mentioned, followed by some kind of surprise like a 4K 21.5-inch iMac.iOSEnlarge / The Apple Watch needs an iOS update to work, so we'll probably get one.Andrew CunninghamNewest iOS 8.2 beta spills the beans on more Apple Watch featuresThe Apple Watch requires iOS 8.2, so iOS 8.2 is likely to drop on the day of the event or just after.

https://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-Edition-5000	Claim: The Apple Watch Edition will cost $5,000	false	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Edition', 'Apple Watch Price', 'Marco Arment']	https://www.marco.org/	https://www.marco.org/2015/03/04/boring-apple-watch-edition-pricing	2015/03/04	âhttps://marco.org/2015/03/04/boring-apple-watch-edition-pricingIâve never seen a smartwatch that Iâd wear except the Apple Watch. Itâs not that I think the rest are all ugly â most are, some are less so. But theyâve all looked like too strong a combination of cheap, 1 absurdly geeky, 2 and chunky for my taste, even though I wear $40 jeans and a $10 black T-shirt every day. My outfit feels reasonably acceptable, but an exceptionally geeky watch doesnât.I cannot look past my fashion preferences for a smartwatchâs functionality benefits. Looking good to me and making me feel good about wearing it is a fundamental requirement. Watches are a combination of functionality and jewelry for most wearers, often with the jewelry side as a higher priority.The biggest challenge Apple faced with the design of the Apple Watch has nothing to do with battery life or screen technology: How do you make a smartwatch that most people will want to wear?Everyone draws that line differently. A lot of tech people will see the Pebble Time or Time Steel as within those lines, but I donât think it stands a chance in the mass market, especially the upscale market. To me, it still looks like a relatively crude geekwatch, and to everyone else, itâs going to look like a bad Apple Watch knockoff.Apple couldnât release a product that didnât appeal to the mass and upscale markets â theyâre too high-profile. It would be seen as a colossal failure. People would call for Tim Cook to be fired and everyone would declare Appleâs impending death spiral, even more than usual.Lots of writers and podcasters have speculated that Apple now fancies itself a high-fashion company and wants the insane profit margins that could result from that, with the solid-gold Apple Watch Edition as the leading example. Most credible guesses, considering the price of gold itself and the prices of other high-end gold watches, predict the Edition having about $1500 worth of gold and a retail price between $10,000â20,000.What if Appleâs primary reason for offering the gold Apple Watch Edition isnât absurd profit? Profit helps, of course. But I bet the primary reason is to get people using an Apple Watch who would only wear a gold watch.The Sport, assuming itâs the cheapest at $350, looks about as nice as the Pebble Time Steel in photos. Itâll easily succeed, but I donât think itâs for me â wearing a watch with a plastic band just wonât make me feel good, and Iâm not crazy about the aluminumâs appearance in Appleâs photos.Iâll probably get a stainless model with a leather or metal band. But they couldnât just release the stainless one, because many people would consider it too expensive, heavy, or delicate for their use. Theyâd rather have a cheaper, lighter model that can take a beating without looking too bad.Just as they probably need both the Sport and the stainless line, thereâs a high end of the market â much of which is ignored by and unknown to the young white American men who dominate tech and tech media â who wonât want to wear a moderately priced stainless model. They want the gold one, and many of them will buy it.But Apple canât sell it to them at a truly ridiculous price without alienating their base. A $10,000â20,000 starting price would make the Edition relatively affordable compared to many gold watches but ludicrously out of reach for most iPhone owners, possibily alienating millions of Apple customers and tarnishing their image with all of the snobbery and exclusion that comes with the world of five-figure watches. At the same time, Apple needs to be careful not to fall on the wrong side of the Veblen effect by making the Edition too affordable, but I bet theyâre looking to keep Veblen under control at a healthy level, not maximize its short-term profitability.Appleâs letting the $10,000â20,000 guesses simmer in the press to set price expectations high, just as they stayed quiet when everyone thought the first iPad would cost $1000. Maybe itâs for the same reason: maybe the Edition wonât be completely unreasonably priced for a piece of electronic jewelry that will probably be completely obsolete in five years but happens to be encased in a thousand bucks worth of solid gold. Letting people believe itâll cost so much will make the real price seem like a great deal when itâs announced.Iâm guessing the Edition is closer to $5,000: expensive and very profitable, but boringly reasonable for a solid-gold electronic gadget.(This may all be proven comically wrong at next weekâs event, like most of my predictions â seriously, my track record is terrible.)In this article, I mean âcheapâ as both inexpensive and being of low build quality, made from low-quality materials, or looking crudely or poorly designed. Being inexpensive alone isnât a problem if the quality is there. â©ï¸In the Google Glass sense. â©ï¸âFollow Marco.org posts: Twitter , RSS feed , or the alternate RSS feed in which link posts always point here first instead of their targets.Follow @marcoarment on Twitter if youâd like.Â©Â 2006â2018 Marco Arment	
https://www.emergent.info/apple-macbook-air-12	Claim: Apple will announce a 12-inch MacBook Air Retina at the March 9th Spring Forward Event	true	['Apple', 'MacBook Air', 'The Michael Report']	https://themichaelreport.com/	https://themichaelreport.com/2015/03/04/exclusive-retina-macbook-air-spring-forward/	2015/03/04	"Last week, Apple sent out the invites for its Spring Forward event, slated to be held at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco on March 9th.Many are expecting Apple talk more about the Apple Watch. However, sources familiar with the matter within Apple have exclusively told The Michael Report that Apple plans to unveil the long-awaited Retina MacBook Air at the same event. The Michael Report has independently verified this information to be highly credible.We should note that this information falls in line with what Apple analysts such as KGI Securities Ming-Chi Kuo and Oppenheimers Andrew Uerkwitz have been predicting for months. Supply chain sources who spoke to the press have also said that Apple ramped up their production in late 2014 and entered the mass production stage in December, with the goal of producing enough units for an early-2015 debut.Apples MacBook Air line, which got upgraded in April last year (the only real upgrade being a small speed bump), still features a non-Retina screen with the same screen resolution that hasnt been updated since late 2010. This is a stark contrast from the rest of the Apple computer lineup, which have been steadily upgraded to a Retina (or at least, a version of it is offered) screen since the first Retina MacBook Pro was unveiled in 2012.The upcoming Retina MacBook Air, if earlier reports are to be believed, will come in an ultra slim design that combines the productivity of the current larger-screened 13-inch MacBook Air with the portability of the 11-inch MacBook Air.Internally, the new Retina MacBook Air is said to feature Intels next-generation Broadwell Core M low-power processors, which would allow Apple to strip the computer of its fan assembly to create an even thinner profile. Other compromises Apple reportedly made in exchange for a thinner and lighter body includes the full-sized USB ports, MagSafe connectors and SD card slots.The Retina MacBook Air, currently codenamed MacBook Stealth internally, will also come with a modest price decrease according to previous reports.[Image rendition via]Advertisement Advertisements Report this ad Report this adShare this now!76Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)76Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)RelatedThis Is The Real Reason Why Apple Doesn't Want You To Focus On The Gold Watch's PricingHow Much Will/Can The Apple Watch Sell For?In ""Analysis""BLOCKBUSTER EXCLUSIVE: This Is The iPad Air 2Hot Off The Heels Of The iPhone 6 Announcements...

https://www.emergent.info/apple-tv-hbo-now	Claim: HBO Now streaming subscription is coming to Apple TV	true	['Apple TV', 'HBO', 'International Business Times', 'Michael Learmonth']	https://www.ibtimes.com/	https://www.ibtimes.com/hbo-talks-apple-be-launch-partner-coming-web-service-hbo-now-exclusive-1835882	2015/03/04	"By Michael Learmonth @learmonth03/04/15 AT 2:28 PMGeorge R.R. Martin teased that some of the characters still alive in the books will die in ""Game of Thrones"" Season 5. Photo: Facebook/Game of ThronesHBO is in talks with Apple to make Apple TV a launch partner for its highly anticipated streaming service when it debuts next month. HBO and streaming partner Major League Baseball Advanced Media are working to have the standalone service, called âHBO Now,â ready to launch in April in conjunction with the premiere of the fifth season of âGame of Thrones,â according to sources familiar with the plan.When it launches, consumers will be able to subscribe to HBO Now directly from HBO for the first time, rather than through a cable, satellite or telco TV distributor such as Comcast or Verizon. The retail price is expected to be $15 a month when purchased directly from HBO, or about what consumers pay when they order HBO through their cable, satellite or telco provider.HBOâs corporate parent, Time Warner Inc., will rely on a whole new line of distributors (e.g., Apple TV, Roku, Xbox, PlayStation, Amazon, etc.) to help market HBO Now to an estimated 10 million U.S. broadband subscribers who do not pay for a cable TV bundle. CEO Jeff Bewkes has said the offering could also help reach some of the 70 million cable TV subscribers who do not subscribe to HBO but might if given the opportunity to subscribe online.HBOâs over-the-top service has been cast as the biggest challenge yet to the so-called cable bundle, in which consumers are required to buy packages of channels, some of which they may never watch. One study claimed the service would lead to a 7 percent drop in pay TV subscriptions , as users opt out of cable and opt in to HBO Now.Some cable providers, however, such as Cablevision and Cox Communications, have expressed interest in bundling HBO Now with broadband for their own subscribers who donât get cable TV.Apple has been most aggressive in courting HBO in a bid to add the service to Apple TV, sources say. Apple TV already carries HBO Go for current HBO subscribers, but it may add a second app for HBO Now. Apple has spent the past several years negotiating for the rights to offer its own linear TV package; in the meantime, HBO Now is seen as an added service to drive adoption of Apple TV.While HBO has not confirmed a launch date for HBO Now, internally the target is an April launch, in time for the April 12 debut of âGame of Thrones.â Thatâs an aggressive time frame for Major League Baseball Advanced Media, which is building the back end along with a new front end separate from HBO Go. HBO is taking care not to launch HBO Now before it can guarantee that the service will work without some of the technical glitches that plagued HBO Go during last year's debut of cult-fave ""Game of Thrones.""The launch of HBO Now will be a milestone for Time Warnerâs premium TV channel, which has for most of its 42-year history been distributed as an add-on to a package of cable channels. The Web service will allow HBO to sign on a new group of distribution partners, which it sees as no different than when it added satellite TV and, later, telcos such as Verizon and AT&T.Each of those distributors pays a wholesale price for HBO and then resells it to consumers for anywhere from $13 to $18 a month. Most see HBO as a retention device; those who subscribe are less likely to drop service or switch providers. HBO and Time Warner declined to comment.At $15 a month, HBO Now will be significantly more expensive than Netflix, which ranges from $8 to $12 a month for various levels of service, but cheaper than some were predicting. HBO makes the case that it has more original programming than Netflix and a better, more current film library. âItâs a premium product, and it will be priced accordingly,â HBO CEO Richard Plepler said during a Time Warner earnings call in February.HBOâs push to launch HBO Now comes after years of talking about launching an over-the-top service that bypasses traditional cable TV. Understandably, it has been met with some resistance from current distributors, including Time Warner Cable and Comcast, two companies in the midst of a $46 billion merger, according to sources.HBO, of course, heard the same misgivings from cable companies when it first added satellite TV providers and then telcos as distributors. HBOâs strategy is to give early partners a pricing advantage over newer ones; itâs unclear how this will go over with Apple, which has a track record of squeezing advantageous deals out of media, including the 99-cent single more than a decade ago.Bewkes said in December that he saw âcord-cuttingâ accelerate as pay TV providers dropped subscribers. U.S. pay TV providers lost 125,000 subscribers in 2014, according to Leichtman Research Group. At the same time, HBO and Cinemax reported their highest number of new subscribers (2.8 million) in 30 years.Among the challenges HBO faces to get HBO Now launched is how to avoid confusion with HBO Go, the service that allows HBOâs cable TV subscribers to access it on the Web, smartphones and tablets. The two services will have separate log-in pages and separate apps, but some cable execs are concerned about customer confusion.Â The explanation might challenge even the best call center employee: HBO Go is for TV subscribers to watch their content on devices; HBO Now for those who donât subscribe via TV.âStay up to date with our daily newsletterRelated Stories"	
https://www.emergent.info/apple-pad-pro	Claim: Apple delayed production of a 12-inch iPad Pro and will not announce it at the March 9th event	true	['Apple', 'Bloomberg', 'iPad', 'Tim Culpan', 'Tim Higgins']	https://www.bloomberg.com/	https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/apple-said-to-delay-larger-ipad-production-on-panel-challenges	2015/03/04	Apple to Delay Production of Larger iPadsTim Culpan and Tim HigginsUpdated onApple Delays iPadApple Inc., which has seen stagnating iPad sales, will delay the start of manufacturing for a larger-screened version of the tablet, people with knowledge of the matter said.Production of the 12.9-inch-screen iPad is now scheduled to start around September because of delays involving the supply of display panels, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the details arenât public. Apple had initially planned to begin making the larger version this quarter, people familiar with those plans had said .A new big-screen tablet is part of Chief Executive Officer Tim Cookâs effort to reinvigorate the iPad product line, where sales have declined for four straight quarters. IPads are also facing competition from larger iPhones, which were introduced in September and helped Apple deliver record profit in the latest quarter.Apple, based in Cupertino, California, currently sells the iPad with a 9.7-inch display and the iPad mini, which has a 7.9-inch screen. Apple hasnât disclosed plans for a bigger iPad.Existing suppliers to Apple include Sharp Corp., Japan Display Inc. and LG Display Co., according to the companyâs supplier list . LG Display fell 2.5 percent to a four-month low in Seoul. Sharp fell as much as 2.6 percent before closing 0.9 percent higher in Tokyo while Japan Display dropped 2.1 percent.Business ToolsA larger iPad could also bolster Cookâs initiative to make Appleâs products more appealing to business users. Apple announced a partnership last year with International Business Machines Corp. to create mobile software for businesses and for IBM to help sell iPads to corporate customers.Even as consumers shift away from tablets in favor of bigger smartphones, businesses remain a growth opportunity for iPads because the devices can be used for field work and as laptop replacements. In total, global sales of tablets to businesses, institutions and governments are projected to jump to 101 million units in 2018 from 19 million in 2013, according to IHS Technology.Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn cited the opportunity to boost iPad sales to businesses as one of the key reasons why he thinks Apple shares are undervalued. Improvements to the iPad and the IBM partnership should help boost revenue from the device by 13 percent in each of the next three fiscal years, Icahn wrote in a public letter to Cook last year.(Adds closing shares in fifth paragraph.)Share

Munster sees an overall ASP at around $650 for the mid-tier Watch series.On the high end, the analyst forecasts base model Apple Watch Edition devices to start at $4,999, but classifies segment ASP closer to $7,500 after adding in straps made from precious metals.Based on current pricing for Apple's silicon iPhone 6 cases, which come in at $35, Munster sees elastomer Apple Watch straps to start in a similar $29 to $35 range, while leather bands could be priced between $49 to $59. Pricing for metal bands like the link bracelet and Milanese loop are more difficult to determine, but the analyst believes steel versions will come in at $99, while gold bands could be priced into the thousands of dollars.""If you assume that 55 percent of bands purchased are elastomer, 35 percent leather, 10 percent steel, and about 5,000 total gold bands are sold, the average band ASP could be around $50,"" Munster writes.He added that if half of all Watch buyers purchase a band âassuming 8 million Watches are sold in 2015 âthe accessory range would add $25 to Apple's watch category, equating to a $575 ASP. If every Watch customer purchases an extra strap, it would tack on $50, bringing ASP up to $600.The lower-cost Sport model is expected to make up 55 percent of overall Watch sales, while the mid-tier Apple Watch will take another 45 percent. That leaves very little room for Apple Watch Edition, but Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10,000 units this year. In an interesting comparison, the firm calculates that Apple Watch Edition business could equate to about two percent of luxury watchmaker Rolex, which moves between 600,000 to 750,000 units each year.Finally, Munster expects Apple to reveal a better sense of device pricing at its March 9 event , as well as highlight ""special features"" to drum up consumer interest ahead of release.AppleInsider will be covering the ""Spring forward"" event live from San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center next week.Topics:"

https://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-launch-Germany	Claim: The Apple Watch will be available in Germany at launch	true	['9to5 Mac', 'Apple Watch', 'Germany', 'Mark Gurman']	https://9to5mac.com/	https://9to5mac.com/2015/03/02/tim-cook-says-apple-watch-will-be-available-outside-u-s-in-april/	2015/03/02	Speaking at the Berlin flagship Apple Store last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook told employees that the Apple Watch will not be exclusive to the United States in April, according to employees in attendance. Specifically, Cook said that the Apple Watch will launch in Germany during the month of April. Its possible that the Apple Watch will launch first in the United States in early April, with Germany and other countries following later in the month, but it definitely appears that the Watchs rollout will be more aggressive than the first iPhone and iPad launches...iPad Air 2The iPhone was notably exclusive to the United States and AT&T for the first several months of the products life, while the iPad launched exclusively in the U.S. in April 2010 and was followed by launches in Europe and Australia over a month later, in mid-May of that year. Besides Germany, sources indicate that an April launch in Australia is also likely as Apple has already been training select Apple Retail employees on Apple Watch sales procedures by way of secret briefings in Sydney. The United Kingdom and France have both seen Apple Watch marketing pushes, so those countries are likely also in the April mix.The usual first wave countries for major Apple product launches also includes Canada, where Apple is soon planning to launch the Watch-compatible Apple Pay system, but we havent yet confirmed if those countries will be home to the new product in April. Apple has been heavily promoting the Apple Watch in China, so perhaps the wearable will launch to the Chinese market in or around April as well. However, launches in China could be delayed due to government regulatory factors. During his trip to Germany, Cook also stopped by Chancellor Angela Merkels office to discuss consumer privacy and the offices of BILD to discuss Apple rumors, Steve Jobs, and the NSA.Asked if employees will get free Apple Watches (like when full time employees got original iPhones from Steve Jobs in 2007), Cook reportedly said youve given me something to think about, I agree with your point, I think its great, and I think everyone should use our products. Its a good point for me to think about, Ive got some more plane rides to think about it on. Cook also discussed the expansion of Apple Pay into Europe, reportedly saying:Apple Pay will be global, its not a U.S. program. We want it everywhere. We are working to bring it out of the US. It is going to take a little bit of time to do so. We want to be in Germany. We want to be in Europe generally this year. I dont know if we will make it, I think we will. Its our intention to get here as fast as we can.We previously reported that Apple Pay will arrive in Canada as soon as March.

Geller']	https://bgr.com/	https://bgr.com/2015/02/27/ios-8-2-ios-8-3-download-release/	2015/02/27	Apple has been hard at work on multiple upcoming iOS versions simultaneously, and weve been told that iOS 8.2 is finally moving to the release stage. Barring any last minute problems, I would expect to see iOS 8.2 released this coming Monday, or the following week at the absolute latest.DONT MISS: Is the Galaxy S6 really an iPhone ripoff? Leaked comparison photo lets you be the judgeAdditionally, we were told there might be as many as four iOS 8.3 beta versions. Apple released iOS 8.3 beta 2 earlier this week, so that leaves two more versions before the company makes it publicly available to customers.iOS 8.3 adds support for multiple new features and is filled with improvements in the operating system, though the biggest addition is support for the upcoming Apple Watch, which is slated to be released in early April. Apples event on March 9th should answer our remaining questions on pricing and other details.Additionally, stay tuned for the first The Boy Genius Report podcast coming later today with some thoughts on Apple Watch, the Apple Car, my struggle with the iPhone 6 Plus, and other interesting topics.

https://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-power-reserve	Claim: The Apple Watch will include a feature called Power Reserve	true	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Battery', 'Brian X. Chen', 'New York Times']	https://www.nytimes.com/	https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/02/technology/apples-new-job-selling-a-smartwatch-to-an-uninterested-public.html?_r=0	2015/02/27	Appleâs New Job: Selling a Smartwatch to an Uninterested PublicImageTimothy D. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, introduced the Apple Watch last September. Other smartwatches, from companies like Samsung Electronics, Motorola and LG, did not sell well.CreditJim Wilson/The New York TimesFeb. 27, 2015SAN FRANCISCO â For Apple, the hard part â making a smartwatch â is nearly over.Soon it will be time for the harder part: selling the long-anticipated Apple Watch to consumers who, so far, are not very excited about the idea of wearing computers on their bodies.The first batch of smartwatches from companies like Samsung Electronics, Motorola and LG did not sell well, nor were they particularly well reviewed. And wearable devices like the Google Glass eyewear that got mainstream attention â if not sales â were greeted with considerable skepticism.But Apple has been in this situation before. Most consumers didnât care about computer tablets before Apple released the iPad, nor did they generally think about buying smartphones before the release of the iPhone. In both cases, the company overcame initial skepticism.The Apple Watch, which Apple introduced last September and is expected to be in stores in April, is a miniature computer worn around the wrist, with a touch screen and a crown for navigating the device. There are three different models sold at different prices and the bands are interchangeable.Apple has marketed it as a device that can appeal to a range of customers like fitness buffs and luxury watch collectors. But it has limited its functions, making it more like a watch, more easily relatable than a tech doodad that happens to look like a watch, said Ben Bajarin, a consumer technology analyst for Creative Strategies.âThis is a brand-new category. Most people have no frame of reference with a smartwatch,â said Mr. Bajarin.In late February, Apple sent out invitations to the media for an event to remind people about the best features of the watch and share some new details about the product, according to two people with knowledge of the event. Timothy D. Cook, Appleâs chief executive, is expected to be the host.Apple is expected to say more about price. The starting price for a basic Apple Watch is $350. Apple has not yet said how much people will have to pay for higher-end models, like the Apple Watch Edition, which is made of 18-karat gold, though watch enthusiasts estimate that it will cost upward of $10,000.The watch requires a connection to an iPhone to fully operate.Inside Apple, members of the team that worked on the watch product, code-named Gizmo, say it was a difficult engineering challenge. Three employees briefed on the project agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity.In an effort to maintain secrecy, engineers testing the watch outside the office even created fake casing that made the Apple device resemble a Samsung watch, one person said.The people who created the watch have been described by Apple employees as an âall-star team.â Appleâs top designers and engineers who worked on its iPhone, iPad and Macs are all part of it, several Apple employees said. Top executives include Jony Ive, Appleâs head of design; Jeff Williams, the head of operations; and Kevin Lynch, a former Adobe executive, who leads the watchâs software development.Employees said it was challenging to cram powerful chips and sensors onto the watchâs circuit board, which is as tiny as a postage stamp.Nearly two years ago, the company experimented with advanced health monitoring sensors that tracked blood pressure and stress, among other variables. Many of those experiments were abandoned more than 18 months ago after the sensors proved unreliable and cumbersome, these people said.ImageMr. Cook during the unveiling of the Apple Watch last September in Cupertino, Calif.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty ImagesApple long ago decided that for the first version of the product, it would include a heart rate sensor and a sensor for tracking movement, to market the device as a fitness-tracking companion to the iPhone. It also has a chip that helps it make wireless payments.Battery life was also a concern on a device so small, and engineers mulled over how the watchâs power should be replenished. The company in the past experimented with multiple methods to recharge the watch, including solar charging. Eventually it settled on induction, a method in which an electrical current creates a magnetic field, which creates voltage that powers the watch.Apple has said the watch battery is estimated to last a full day, requiring a user to charge it at night, similar to a smartphone. The company also developed a yet-to-be-announced feature called Power Reserve, a mode that will run the watch on low energy but display only the time, according to one employee.Apple will release the watch a bit later than it had hoped because of technology challenges. It probably didnât help that several important employees jumped ship. Nest Labs, the smart appliance maker that was acquired by Google last year, poached a few engineers who were the very best on the watch team, according to two people. Among them was Bryan James, Appleâs former director of iPod software, who became a vice president for engineering at Nest in early 2014, these people said.Still, when Apple releases its watch in April, it will enter a market already flooded with smartwatches running Android Wear, a version of Googleâs Android software system tailored for wearable computers.The results so far for Android smartwatches have been disappointing. About 720,000 smartwatches with Android Wear were shipped in 2014, according to Canalys, the research firm.Daniel Matte, an analyst for Canalys, said based on those numbers, it would be premature to call smartwatches a flop. He also predicts Appleâs watch will become the top-selling smartwatch next year.But it is unlikely to be a game-changer for Apple, at least anytime soon. Toni Sacconaghi, a financial analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein research, thinks the watch will make only a modest contribution to Appleâs bottom line this year. He predicts that Apple will ship 7.5 million watches in the second half of Appleâs fiscal year.That is peanuts compared with the tens of millions of iPhones that fly off the shelves every quarter.Companies that make watch apps will probably play an important role in defining the purpose of the Apple Watch, similar to the app developers for the iPhone and the iPad.Tero Kuittinen, a director for Frank N. Magid Associates who does consulting for app developers, said he had talked to about 20 app developers about the Apple Watch. Most of them, he said, were âcautiously optimistic.â But they worry that apps for watches wonât be as lucrative as apps for phones because the tiny screen can limit features or â even worse â ads.David Barnard, an independent app developer, said he was expanding one of his iPhone apps to work with the Apple Watch. The app, called Launch Center Pro, can be customized to initiate different actions like setting the temperature of an Internet-connected thermostat or unlocking a door.He said he was both âbullishâ on the long-term potential of the smartwatch and âskepticalâ about what exactly people would do with it.âI really wonder exactly how Iâm going to use it and how often Iâm going to use it,â Mr. Barnard said.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: The Apple Watch Is Nearly Ready, but the Public Isnât.

https://www.emergent.info/Apple-Edition-cost-10k	Claim: The larger Apple Watch Edition will cost $10,000	true	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Edition', 'Apple Watch Price', 'Grail Watch', 'Stephen Foskett']	https://grail-watch.com/	https://grail-watch.com/2015/02/16/gold-apple-watch-edition-must-cost-10000/	2015/02/27	The Apple Watch is a fairly large chunk of gold!Get ready for the tech press to flip out when Apple announces the retail price for the gold Apple Watch Edition model. Apple critics have always roasted the company for selling products that are more expensive than they should be, and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers. But the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of $10,000. The funny thing in this case is that Apple is perfectly right to be charging that much!Do you disagree? Check out my counterpoint, The Case Against the $10,000 Gold Apple Watch EditionGold is ExpensiveLets start with a little backgrounder in gold. Everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive. Even rabid Internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news. But most people dont understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is. So this is a good place to begin the discussion.Update: My calculations were wrong! Also, this was a bit back of the envelope. Now that it has some readership I realize I should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more realistic...Here are the basic facts:Gold currently sells for between $1,200 and $1,300 per troy ounce and has been over $1,000 per troy ounce for the last five years.18-karat gold contains 75% pure gold, and that term is regulated by law.One ounce of 18k gold occupies about 1.8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18-karat gold alloy weighs about 16.5 grams per cc.18-karat gold currently sells for $29.11 per gram, $905 per troy ounce, or $480 per cc..25 cc of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and .75 cc gets you a deployant clasp. It takes a few more to build a watch case, anywhere from 1.5 to 8 cc depending on the size and thickness of the case. So the buckle is worth $120-$360 and the watch case $720 to $3800 just as raw gold. This is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than $6,000!Gold Watches are ExpensiveLets apply this to a watch case. Imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep. If it was solid, this would equal 15.12 cc of volume. But its a watch case, so you have to leave room for the movement, dial, case back, etc. So lets just leave 5 mm of thickness all around, making a hollow rectangle. This equals 6.8 cc (42 x 36 x 10 32 x 26 x 10). Therefore, the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost $3,200 as of this writing.A simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would cost more than $3,200Now lets consider the same shape but just 2 mm thick. Thats 2.9 cc of gold, worth $1,400. Pick your thickness and youre still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold.How does this translate in the real world? Lets look at the retail price of some watches that are available in both stainless steel and 18-karat gold.This Cartier Tank MC is $15,000 more in 18k goldThe Cartier Tank MC measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9.5 mm thick: $15,000 extra (list) for 18k goldCartier Tank MC in stainless steel: $7,000 list, $5,800 streetCartier Tank MC in 18k pink gold: $22,000 list, $18,200 streetThe Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime measures 50.5 mm by 34.9 mm by 14 mm thick: $14,750 extra (list) for 18k goldJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in stainless steel: $8,550 list, $6,800 streetJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in 18k pink gold: $23,300 list, $18,400 streetThis list could go on and on, but the gist is simple: 18-karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel. In fact, its pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size and from any manufacturer. Even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny Chopard Happy Sport Mini sells for $11,000! Most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14-karat or less, very slim and small, or long out of production and with outdated pricing.Then theres the bracelet. Swap a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra $20,000. Adding a gold bracelet to that Jaeger-LeCoultre bumps the price to $42,900!Certainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches, but one simply cannot deny the raw material value in a gold watch case. And the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities: There are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold, and plenty of reserves, so no company, no matter how strong, can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers.Another reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility. They cant price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labor, distribution, and profit in a watch.The Apple Watch Edition Will Cost $10,000Theres a reason I picked those two watches for my comparisons: Both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm Apple Watch. The Cartier is a little smaller and the Jaeger-LeCoultre is a little larger, but both represent a traditional watchmakers gold-cased square-ish offering in the space. And both cost more than $20,000, with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle. And Jony Ive recently said that the historic Cartier Tank was one of his inspirations for the Apple Watch design!Apple would be crazy to sell the Apple Watch Edition for $20,000, though. Thats not going to happen. So theyre likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically.First, as we can see, the Apple Watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions. Although questionable from an esthetic standpoint, this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot. Second, Apple Watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display, sensors, and such. Third, the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum, not gold, to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions.Could it be gold plated? No. Numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case. Although Apple has not apparently used the word, solid in their press releases, they do claim it is crafted from 18-karat gold and nowhere does it say it is plated or gold filled (the industry term). There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could.Apple says that the Apple Watch will start at $349 for that aluminum Sport model, and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel Apple Watch to be roughly $1,000. It is reasonable to assume that the gold Edition model will sell for substantially more than this, with many suggesting $4,000 or $5,000. But remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold! Even with thin walls and a steel frame, its hard to see how Apple could make a solid 18-karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold.Gold is soft, but Apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as standard gold. Taking that at face value, perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately, cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch. This still leaves a few thousand dollars of material value in the case. The Apple Watch Edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes, a difference of about 20% in terms of case volume. So the smaller model could sell for 20% less still.My prediction is that the 42 mm Apple Watch Edition will retail for $9,999 with the 38 mm Apple Watch Edition retailing for $7,999. This covers the cost of the gold case, the internals, manufacturing, sales, and profit, and yet does not leave Apple subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too-thin or plated case. I will be shocked if the price is $4,999, but I suppose its possible with some finagling and if thats the smaller model. And it will not be any less than that.This is a $10,000 productBonus prediction: Given the very high price of the Apple Watch Edition, I predict that availability will be quite limited. Apple will likely create special store-within-a-store spaces in certain Apple Store locations for the Edition. I further expect them to open special standalone Apple Edition Boutiques to sell the Watch Edition, accessories, and perhaps other future high-end products.Update!Needless to say, many people disagree with me. And now that @Gruber Fireballed this post, I imagine Ill hear from lots of them real soon!The gist of the disagreement lies in the amount of gold needed for the watch case. I assumed it would be quite thick (read sturdy) and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold. Then theres the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams. But @GAK_PDX (and others, though he was most visually eloquent) suspects it contains much less gold.For fun, I took my Apple Watch models and used SW and some basic assumptions to figure the gold content. 29.16g: pic.twitter.com/WGEnjtj1Yh Greg Koenig (@gak_pdx) February 19, 2015I think this number is way too low, but its a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow. And it puts the raw gold at about $849 at $29.11 per gram of 18k gold. Although this is admittedly much, much lower than my estimate, it still illustrates my point that the Apple Watch Edition is not going to be cheap. And I think hes way off but time will tell who is right and who is wrong.Another argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold Rolex watch. Right off the bat one should point out that gold cost $400/oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well, something Apple is apparently not going to do with the Edition. That Rolex case contained 18.5 grams of gold alloy, but its much, much smaller than the Apple watch and its circular to boot! A 34mm circle is 107mm in circumference, while the 42mm Apple Watch is 156mm in circumference. Use the magic of math to scale the Rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and were at 27.75 grams. But that case is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel, and the Apple Watch is pretty slab-sided. So we can probably double this safely and come out with $1,615 of gold in my mangled square Rolex case.So there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold. I can accept that. But lets take a step back and think about the final price. Even if it contained less than $1,500 of gold, how much would it sell for? Certainly not $2,000 or $3,000. You still have to account for the cost of everything else, plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution. And profit for Apple (and a hedge against the volatility of the price of gold). So were back at the $4,000-$5,000 estimate others have made. As Greg Koenig tweeted, and Forbes reported, If anyone thinks Apple is charging less than $5k for the Edition, they are smoking crack.Regardless of the total, its important to realize that the price of gold is in the drivers seat when it comes to pricing the Apple Watch Edition.Id love to be wrong, and I look forward to updating this piece.

https://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-Edition-not-online	Claim: The gold Apple Watch Edition will not be sold online or by mail	unverified	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Edition', 'Grail Watch', 'Stephen Foskett']	https://grail-watch.com/	https://grail-watch.com/2015/02/27/the-case-against-the-10000-gold-apple-watch-edition/	2015/02/27	My post laying out why the gold Apple Watch Edition must cost $10,000 caused quite a stir, but Ill be the first to admit that I could have it all wrong. Its entirely possible for them to put together a gold-cased Apple Watch for a much-lower price point, but Im much more interested in the reasons why: Apples manufacturing and retail empire would be seriously disrupted by a $10,000 lump of gold!Apple probably doesnt want to reconfigure their stored to resemble the Bank of England gold vaults! image CCbyND www.bankofengland.co.ukHow To Make A Gold Watch For Under $10,000In my last post, I pointed out (hyperbolically) that there are no gold watches available for less than $10,000. This isnt really true there are a few small gold-cased watches available below that mark. But comparing these to an Apple watch is (if you pardon the pun), a case of apples and oranges: Theyre much smaller; theyre round; and theyre not Apple Watches!This last point is critical: We have no idea how the case of an Apple Watch is constructed. And, more importantly, the components, manufacturing, and sales process is entirely different from a Swiss mechanical wristwatch. My point was simply that Apples Watch Edition case looks like a big chunk of gold and thats an expensive thing, likely pushing the total cost all the way to $10,000 if my assumptions are correct.But lets say Apple didnt want to build, stock, and sell a $10,000 watch but still wanted it to be crafted from 18-karat gold. How would they do it?Our first argument against the $10k solid gold watch is commonality of design and certification. Apple has never (to my knowledge) delivered a device with different models constructed of different materials. Electronics arent like watches. They are mass-produced and must be certified for electromagnetic (RF) interference. Apple says theyll deliver Watches in aluminum, steel, and gold, but it would be much easier of all three had an identical internal design and only varied when it comes to the outer skin. (Counterpoint: Commonality inside doesnt necessarily mean cheap outside.)This would also make the final product much cheaper, since the gold case could be extremely thin and not structural. Note that nowhere does Apple use the term, solid gold case, to describe the Watch Edition. Im no lawyer, but their crafted from 18-karat gold boast could be weasel words to describe a conventional Watch wrapped in a thin gold skin.The lugs and bars (thats the watch insider term for the things that the strap attaches to) as well as the strap buckle could simply be gold plated or even gold colored. This is important because even these seemingly-small pieces would cost hundreds of dollars if they are solid 18-karat gold. Thats how expensive gold is.One big clue could be the missing gold bracelet. Its pretty glaring that the steel Apple Watch has two metal bracelets while the gold one only has leather and rubber. A gold watch bracelet has much more gold in it than the watch case itself, so the missing bracelet could be a clue that Apple is trying to keep the price in check. And the mere availability of the rubber strap which, as John Gruber notes, is the same as on the cheapest cheapie in the whole lineup could be another tell. Rubber bracelets are sometimes found on expensive dive watches, but this is no X Fathoms... (Counterpoint: They could add the gold bracelet later as an accessory.)Combine these clues and we could be looking at a much cheaper watch. Its still inconceivable to imagine prices less than $1,000, but Apple could definitely finagle a $2,000 Apple Watch Edition. Its more likely that the Edition would retail over $4,000, but this is a far cry from my earlier assertion that it would cost $10,000!Why Apple Wouldnt Want A $10,000 WatchIts entirely possible for the gold Apple Watch Edition to be way under $10,000, but a more important question is why would Apple do this. After all, those making the decisions are very familiar with the luxury watch market and the incredible prices that gold watches command at retail. Why wouldnt they want to pull a Vertu and cash in if customers are willing to buy?Lets return to the cost of gold. Although Apple has produced $10,000 products in the past and currently stocks some pretty expensive devices in the stores, a gold watch is an entirely different animal. Gold is much more fungible than anything else Apple sells, so security is a much more critical issue. Remember the smash-and-grab iPhone heists? How about that pallet of stolen iPhones? Now imagine if those thieves could melt the case down and have an untraceable $4,000 lump of gold instead of some hot electronics.The high price of gold affects every aspect of my purported solid gold Apple Watch. Where would Apple manufacture a $10,000 watch? Even that little buckle would be worth more than a months pay for a Foxconn assembly line worker. And the level of finish required to compete with Swiss watches is not yet possible at scale in China. (Counterpoint: Apple could build the solid gold Watch Edition in Texas alongside the Mac Pro.)Then theres shipment and warehousing. Although it is extremely unlikely that Apple would manufacture and ship the millions of gold Watches some analysts suggest, even more modest shipments would be immensely valuable. Securing these shipments from factory to warehouse to freight to warehouse to store will be a real challenge. Apple currently packs as many as 1.5 million iPhones into a single 747, but they couldnt ship $15 billion worth of Watch Editions this way! Every point of collection and shipping would instantly be a ripe target for criminals. (Counterpoint: Apple already deals with armored cars, security systems, and locked vaults.)Even the stores themselves would need to be reconfigured. Is Apple ready to add armed guards, armored display cases, and time-lock vaults to their stores? Certainly the smaller stores dont have space for a private room or boutique for Watch Edition buyers. (Counterpoint: We know they are working on a major redesign of the retail stores already.)And what about payment? Luxury watch buyers typically pay using wire transfers, not credit cards. Apple must prepare to process five-figure credit card transactions and accept wires. Are they ready to accept the hassle of validating buyers and payments of this size?Apple also has to worry about what a 1% product like a $10,000 Apple Watch Edition would say about the company and its buyers. As Adam Fields notes on Medium, Apple will have to abandon their historic focus on accessible luxury and fully embrace their new role as a vendor of conspicuous luxury. Already frequently criticized as a maker of status symbols, this would be a lightning rod for Apple: If the gold Watch Edition sells for $10,000, it could spike Apples broader reputation and turn away customers rather than attract them.Apple risks alienating their loyal customers with a 1% product. Could Occupy Apple become a reality? CC image by David ShankboneIt seems smart for Apple to skimp on the gold and bring the cost of the Apple Watch Edition to under $4,000. They would still have issues with production, shipping, and security but these would be reduced since they would no longer be dealing with four-figure lumps of fungible bullion.Yet even at that price the stores will need reconfiguration and the pundits will hurl jokes about the rich. If the company is going to suffer to bring out a gold Apple Watch Edition anyway, why not embrace the change and go solid gold?Thats why Im sticking to my original predictions:The starting prices will be $7,999 and $9,999The Apple Watch Edition will have a solid gold case weighing more than 5 ouncesIf sales go well, Apple will later offer a gold Edition bracelet at $9,999 as an accessoryThe Apple Watch Edition will be offered through certain high-end third-party fashion boutiques and retailersSome larger Apple Stores will add a private Edition Boutique (but not all)A whole line of expensive and exclusive Edition products will appearThe Edition line will not be available from the online store or by mailRelated PostsWhy the Gold Apple Watch Edition Must Cost $10,000Apple Watch: Its Not a WatchA Watch Guys Review of the Apple WatchHow Good Is the Mondaine Helvetica Smart Watch?The Revolutionary Smart Watch from Apples Designers (Circa 1990)Hamilton Electric VenturaMovado 1891 Ultra-Slim Museum WatchLevrette Chronograph: Classic EleganceSeiko Giugiaro SCED035: Daughter of RipleyOrient Blue Ray: Weekend DiverYear: 2015Brand: AppleStyle: Smart watchCase: GoldCountry: USASource: Tags: Apple, Apple Watch, boutique, gold, retail, securityShare this:EmailPrintFacebookTwitterPinterestGoogleRelated PostsWhy the Gold Apple Watch Edition Must Cost $10,000Apple Watch: Its Not a WatchA Watch Guys Review of the Apple WatchHow Good Is the Mondaine Helvetica Smart Watch?The Revolutionary Smart Watch from Apples Designers (Circa 1990)Hamilton Electric VenturaMovado 1891 Ultra-Slim Museum WatchLevrette Chronograph: Classic EleganceSeiko Giugiaro SCED035: Daughter of RipleyOrient Blue Ray: Weekend Diver	
https://www.emergent.info/Gruber-Apple-Watch-Edition-10k	Claim: The gold Apple Watch Edition will cost $9,999 USD	true	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Edition', 'Apple Watch Price', 'Daring Fireball', 'Jon Gruber']	https://daringfireball.net/	https://daringfireball.net/2015/02/apple_watch_pricing	2015/02/20	On the Pricing of AppleÂ WatchFriday, 20 February 2015After the gala announcement event in September at which Apple introduced Apple Watch and whatever last yearâs iPhone was, I ran into SlashGear editor-in-chief Vincent Nguyen in the private hands-on area Apple had set up for select members of the media. Iâve known Vincent for years from various Apple events, and I always enjoy his perspective. I was actually looking around for him this time, though, because I really wanted to hear his take on Apple Watch. Vincent is a watch guy â he knows the watch industry, and his taste is excellent.We greeted each other, walked in, and started staring, close-up, at the lineup. When we got to the Edition models, Vincent said, with some excitement, âThis is going to cost $20,000.âIâd already started thinking that the Edition models would cost thousands, plural, but $20,000 struck me as a price from Bananas Town. Vincentâs reply was something to the effect of, âTry to find a good 18-karat gold watch for less than $20,000. You wonât.âHereâs what I wrote back in September , in my initial thoughts regarding Apple Watch:In short: hundreds for Sport, a thousand for stainless steel, thousands for gold.Most people think Iâm joking when I say the gold ones are going to start at $5,000. I couldnât be more serious. I made a friendly bet last week with a few friends on the starting price for the Edition models, and I bet on $9,999.The more I think about it, and the more I learn about the watch industry, the world of luxury goods, and the booming upper class of China, the better I feel about that bet. I donât think I was wrong to place a friendly late night bar bet on a $9,999 starting price. I think I was wrong to guess just $4,999 in my ostensibly sober published analysis.I can see which way the wind is blowing. For months Iâve been asking friends who might know â or know someone else who might know, or even know someone who knows someone who might know â whether my guess of $5,000 is too high for the Edition starting price. The answer has always been âNoâ. But the way Iâve been told âNoâ has given me the uneasy feeling that Iâve been asking the wrong question. I should have been asking if $5,000 is too low.I now think Edition models will start around $10,000 â and, if my hunch is right about bands and bracelets, the upper range could go to $20,000. I was off by a factor of two, and my friend Vincent, I think, nailed it back on the day Apple Watch was introduced.Itâs All About the BandsLouie Mantia helped clarify my thinking on this by publishing this seemingly sparsely populated table of Apple Watch collection/band combinations . Study that for a few minutes, and you should come to a few surprising â to me at least â conclusions.One of the selling points Apple emphasized in September is that bands are easily interchanged on Apple Watch. You just press a button underneath and itâs released; slide a new one in and it securely clicks into place. And they showed a wide variety of bands: Sport, Classic Buckle, Leather Loop, Modern Buckle, Milanese Loop, and Link Bracelet. Six different styles, all of them â other than the Milanese Loop â in multiple colors.I walked out of the event under the assumption that all of these bands would be available to purchase as accessories, like iPhone cases. So that one could, say, buy an Apple Watch Sport with a white sport band, and buy a Milanese Loop or one of the leather bands to make it dressier.I am no longer certain thatâs going to be the case. And if it is the case, the non-Sport bands are going to be expensive â in most cases, even more expensive than the Apple Watch Sport itself.What seems clear to me now is that the various bands signify tiers within the three collections â particularly for the stainless steel Apple Watch models. Take a look at Appleâs page for the steel Watch collection , and scroll down to the bottom, where they present a scrolling carousel of âall 18 models in the collectionâ. From left to right:38mm with White Sport Band42mm with White Sport Band38mm with Black Sport Band42mm with Black Sport Band38mm with Black Classic Buckle42mm with Black Classic Buckle38mm with Milanese Loop38mm with Soft Pink Modern Buckle38mm with Brown Modern Buckle38mm with Midnight Blue Modern Buckle42mm with Stone Leather Loop42mm with Bright Blue Leather Loop42mm with Light Brown Leather Loop38mm with Link Bracelet38mm Space Black Stainless Steel with Link Bracelet42mm Space Black Stainless Steel with Link BraceletThings to note:The âModern Buckleâ is only available for 38mm models. The Leather Loop is only available for 42mm models. The Space Black watch is only available with a single band option: the Link Bracelet.Sport Bands are surely the least expensive. Link Bracelets, Iâm almost as sure, are the most expensive. I think Apple placed these models in order from least to most expensive, going from left to right. (Including the fact that 38mm models will cost slightly less than their 42mm siblings.)Why are there both Classic Buckles and Modern Buckles? From their descriptions, it sounds like the Modern Buckle uses a better leather, and without question it has a more advanced clasp mechanism. I conclude: Modern is more expensive. They both exist because theyâll sit at different price points.Note too, that on the regular Apple Watch collection page, the Classic Buckle description states, regarding color options: âAvailable in black.â This, despite the same band being offered in Midnight Blue for the Edition collection.So Iâm thinking the regular Apple Watch will come in at least five pricing tiers:Entry: Sport Band, black or white.Regular leather: Classic Buckle, youâll get it in black and youâll like it.Milanese Loop.Deluxe leather: Modern Buckle for 38mm models, Leather Loop for 42mm models. Each with a choice of three colors.Link Bracelet.Youâll pay a premium for color straps and advanced clasp mechanisms, and youâll pay even more for the Link Bracelet.I think the spread between these tiers could be significant, ranging from, say, $700 for the entry model with the Sport Band to well over $1,000 for the Link Bracelet. I still think the average for the steel Apple Watch will be around $1,000, but depending on your strap choice, youâll pay several hundred less or more.But wait. I would not bet against Apple bringing back the black tax. Remember the plastic MacBooks from 2006? Apple charged $150 more for the black one than the white one, even though they had nearly identical specs.Note that the silver Apple Watch Sport only has four band color choices: white, blue, green, and pink. The space gray Sport edition has only one band: black. I think Apple might charge more for both the space gray Sport model and the space black stainless steel model.Further, I donât think any of the stainless steel bands will be available for retail purchase. Theyâll sell sport bands, which youâll be able to use on any Apple Watch, but I donât think any of the nicer bands will be available for retail purchase. Donât hold your breath for a space black Link Bracelet to put on your $349 Sport model. The nicer bands arenât accessories that Apple hopes youâll tack onto your purchase; theyâre signifiers of how much you paid for your stainless steel or gold Apple Watch.Limited EditionWhich brings me to the Edition collectionâs curiously thin lineup of strap choices . There are only three for each watch size, and Apple doesnât present them side-by-side in a carousel like they do with the stainless steel models:38mm Yellow Gold with Bright Red Modern Buckle38mm Rose Gold with White Sport Band42mm Rose Gold with White Sport Band38mm Rose Gold with Rose Gray Modern Buckle42mm Yellow Gold with Black Sport Band42mm Yellow Gold with Midnight Blue Classic BuckleThatâs the order in which the six models appear on Appleâs page. It almost certainly does not correspond to price.Things to note: None of these leather colors are available in the standard Apple Watch lineup. These are not regular Sport Bands â they have gold clasps. None of them have metal bands.These are (I think) $10,000+ watches, but half of them come with rubber sport bands that are nearly indistinguishable from the bands on the $349 Sport collection.Glaringly omitted is a gold Link Bracelet. Iâd place a side bet Apple withheld it in September, and will unveil it as a surprise option at the event theyâll hold before releasing the watches. If youâre going to go gold, go gold. Some people buy a gold watch simply because they like it. Others buy a gold watch because they want everyone to know they wear a gold watch. The latter group will gladly pay $20,000 for a watch with gold band.Perhaps Iâm biased by my personal taste in watch bands, but at the hands-on event in September, the Link Bracelet was my favorite by far, followed by the Milanese Loop. It seems downright ludicrous to me to charge significantly more for the Edition models and not offer the best of the bands. Note too that among the Edition combinations Apple currently lists, there is but a single 42mm model with something other than a rubber Sport Band â the Midnight Blue Classic Buckle. Further, as stated above, I think the Classic Buckle is the low-end leather strap. Iâm guessing Apple will offer Edition models with gold Link Bracelets for $20,000, and perhaps Milanese Loops for $15,000 and a Leather Loop for around $12,500.Look at the Watch IndustryDonât try to guess the price of the Edition models based on the amount of gold they contain. I did it this week , but itâs the wrong way to look at this. It doesnât matter if the gold in an Apple Watch Edition model is âonlyâ worth $1,000 or $1,500 or whatever. The gold in a Rolex is only worth that, too â and their gold watches sell for $20,000 and more, for the exact same movements in their $6,000 stainless steel models. The value of a gold watch is only tangentially related to the number of ounces of gold it contains. And Edition isnât just made of 18-karat gold â itâs made of the best 18-karat gold in the world. (I donât know that for a fact â I donât know anything about gold â Iâm just saying what Apple is saying.)Apple Watch Edition is not a tech product, so donât try to price it like one.Apple Watch Edition is a luxury wrist watch. Appleâs ambitions in this arena, I am convinced, are almost boundless. Theyâre not entering the market against Rolex, Omega, and the rest of the Swiss luxury watch establishment with disruptive prices. Theyâre entering the market against those companies going head-to-head on pricing, with disruptive (they think) features.Again I point you to someone from the watch world, Grail Watchâs Stephen Foskett, who points out that gold watches typically cost $10-15,000 more than the same watch in stainless steel â and tens of thousands more if they come with a gold bracelet. Even if Iâm wrong about Apple having gold Link Bracelets lying in wait as an April surprise, I donât think a $10,000 starting price for Apple Watch Edition is even a step out of line for the watch industry. 1Will it work? Will people actually buy these? I have no idea. But I think Apple thinks itâs going to work.At prices like these, an Apple Watch Edition is not an accessory for your iPhone â your iPhone is an accessory for your Apple Watch Edition. â©ï¸Previous:

The reports say that the size of the display is close to the length of a few small balconies and that Apple Retail Senior Vice President Angela Ahrendts has been directing the construction of the booth at retailer Galeries Lafayette on Champs Elysees. While these claims for France are still unconfirmed, sources have told us that Apple is considering constructing dedicated Apple Watch retail stores in the future if demand deems such outlets necessary...iPad Air 2These dedicated stores could be stores within larger high-end retailers, similar to how Macs are sold at Best Buy, or smaller-scale Apple Stores that sit on their own to sell Apple Watches. It is unclear when these dedicated stores will debut, if ever, but Apple has already begun work on transforming its existing stores to sell the Apple Watch. Sources say that Apple is currently installing dedicated safes inside of its stores to house the pricier Apple Watch Edition models prior to sale in addition to special weight scales to determine the amount of gold in individual Apple Watch units. Stores have also begun stocking up on special cleaning wipes to clean Apple Watch store models in between hands-on demonstrations for customers.Apple CEO Tim Cook has said that the Apple Watch will begin shipping by April.Update: Apple is reportedly opening up another pop up shop in London Selfridges pictured below in their famous Wonder Room with hires being transferred from local Apple Stores to the central London location. 	
https://www.emergent.info/gold-Apple-Watch-under-4500	Claim: The gold Apple Watch edition will cost under $4,500 USD	false	['9to5 Mac', 'Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Edition', 'Apple Watch Price', 'Reader Poll']	https://9to5mac.com/	https://9to5mac.com/2015/02/19/18-karat-gold-apple-watch-cost-pricing/	2015/02/19	In a poll of 9to5Mac readers, nearly 80% of people think Apples 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition will cost under $4500. Only 16% expect the gold Apple Watch Edition to cost between $5000-$10,000, and 3.8% expect a price tag over $10,000. The biggest group at 29.68% expect the gold model to cost between $1500-$2500. But how much will the gold Apple Watch really cost? The best 4K & 5K displays for MacIt depends on how much gold, in terms of weight, is actually in the Apple Watch. Apple itself described the model as solid 18-karat gold, but we still dont know for sure.We have at least an estimate, however, with Greg Koenig (via Forbes) creating a 3D render of the Apple Watch (above) and estimating around 29.16g, or approximately $1200, worth of gold. Factor in everything else included in manufacturing the watch and Apples usual markup and Koenig thinks the watch wont come in below $5000. Compare that with the hint of a price point close to the entry-level $4000 Mac Pro from the WSJ in recent weeks. Well have to wait to know for sure how Apple decides to price the device (like an iPhone + gold or like a traditional, high-end timepiece), but it appears most consumers are expecting (or at least hoping) for the former. Our poll included nearly 10,000 votes.

https://www.emergent.info/Apple-ship-20-million-Watches	Claim: Apple will sell 20 million Watches in 2015	unverified	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Sales', 'Ben Wood', 'CSS Insight']	https://www.ccsinsight.com/	https://www.ccsinsight.com/press/company-news/2137-wearables-market-2015-is-year-that-will-make-or-break-the-smartwatch	2015/02/17	"17 February 2015: Sales of wearables will grow from 29 million in 2014 to 172 million in 2018, with a spike in 2015. The most popular devices will be smartwatches and fitness trackers. This is according to CCS Insight's latest global wearables forecast. The next 12 months will be a transformative year for the wearables market thanks to the arrival of the Apple Watch. This highly anticipated smartwatch will create a frenzy of demand, catapulting it almost instantaneously to be the most successful smartwatch ever. CCS Insight expects Apple to employ its full marketing arsenal and the power of its brand to create another must-have status symbol. CCS Insight projects Apple will account for a quarter of the wearables market in 2015, selling around 20 million Apple Watches by the end of the year. This is equivalent to about 7% of those who own a compatible iPhone at the time of the product's launch. The current love affair affluent US consumers have with the iPhone guarantees a strong start for the Apple Watch in its home market. However, if sales of the Apple Watch fail to meet expectations it could hurt the whole smartwatch market. Last year confirmed that North America will remain the biggest market for wearables in the near term. This region accounted for more than half of global sales in 2014 and that momentum continues in 2015. Commenting, Ben Wood, CCS Insight's Chief of Research, stated ""The Apple Watch will be instrumental in taking the wearables market to the next level of growth. If successful, it'll create a rising tide that will lift the whole market."" CCS Insight's consumer surveys indicate extremely high levels of awareness of wearable devices, but the challenge is translating this into sales. Wood continues, ""People without an iPhone will still have a huge choice of alternative wearables. If the Apple Watch performs as well as expected, its halo effect will result in a sales bonanza in the second half of 2015, with record-breaking shipments in the important fourth quarter."" While the Apple Watch will be in the spotlight this year, fitness bands from companies such as Fitbit and Jawbone will continue to dominate the wearables market, building on their explosive growth in 2014. CCS Insight analyst George Jijiashvili observes, ""We expect sales of fitness and activity devices to double in 2015 to 40 million units. In contrast to many other commentators, we don't believe smartwatches will dent sales of fitness products in the short term. Smart fitness devices do one thing and do it well: they measure activity with the goal of improving owners' well-being. This, combined with lower retail prices, longer battery life and a strong head start in terms of adoption, suggests that these devices will outperform smartwatches for several years to come."" Action cameras are a much-forgotten part of the wearables market. They were a central product in the market's early stages and remained the second-biggest category in 2014. Almost 6 million units were sold worldwide in 2014, buoyed by the success of market leader GoPro. Although CCS Insight predicts continued growth in the wearable camera segment boosted by more-affordable and capable products, the near-universal access to cameras on smartphones will limit total sales. Beyond the well-known brands and types of wearable device, CCS Insight has observed a steady flow of weird and wonderful new products that it defines as the ""long tail"" of wearables. This category includes smart clothing, intelligent shoes and insoles, jewellery, adhesive sensors and patches, and even sex toys. Many of these devices are developed as crowd-funded projects and few will succeed. They underline the fact that the wearables market is still in its early stages and despite the explosive growth it will be dwarfed by the 1.5 billion smartphone shipments that CCS Insight forecasts in 2015. The data above is taken from Market Forecast: Wearables Worldwide, 2014-2018, which is published as part of CCS Insight's extensive wearables research service.

https://www.emergent.info/smaller-Apple-Watch-edition-price	Claim: The smaller gold Apple Watch Edition will cost $7,999 USD.	false	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Edition', 'Apple Watch Price', 'Grail Watch', 'Stephen Foskett']	https://grail-watch.com/	https://grail-watch.com/2015/02/16/gold-apple-watch-edition-must-cost-10000/	2015/02/16	The Apple Watch is a fairly large chunk of gold!Get ready for the tech press to flip out when Apple announces the retail price for the gold Apple Watch Edition model. Apple critics have always roasted the company for selling products that are more expensive than they should be, and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers. But the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of $10,000. The funny thing in this case is that Apple is perfectly right to be charging that much!Do you disagree? Check out my counterpoint, The Case Against the $10,000 Gold Apple Watch EditionGold is ExpensiveLets start with a little backgrounder in gold. Everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive. Even rabid Internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news. But most people dont understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is. So this is a good place to begin the discussion.Update: My calculations were wrong! Also, this was a bit back of the envelope. Now that it has some readership I realize I should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more realistic...Here are the basic facts:Gold currently sells for between $1,200 and $1,300 per troy ounce and has been over $1,000 per troy ounce for the last five years.18-karat gold contains 75% pure gold, and that term is regulated by law.One ounce of 18k gold occupies about 1.8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18-karat gold alloy weighs about 16.5 grams per cc.18-karat gold currently sells for $29.11 per gram, $905 per troy ounce, or $480 per cc..25 cc of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and .75 cc gets you a deployant clasp. It takes a few more to build a watch case, anywhere from 1.5 to 8 cc depending on the size and thickness of the case. So the buckle is worth $120-$360 and the watch case $720 to $3800 just as raw gold. This is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than $6,000!Gold Watches are ExpensiveLets apply this to a watch case. Imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep. If it was solid, this would equal 15.12 cc of volume. But its a watch case, so you have to leave room for the movement, dial, case back, etc. So lets just leave 5 mm of thickness all around, making a hollow rectangle. This equals 6.8 cc (42 x 36 x 10 32 x 26 x 10). Therefore, the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost $3,200 as of this writing.A simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would cost more than $3,200Now lets consider the same shape but just 2 mm thick. Thats 2.9 cc of gold, worth $1,400. Pick your thickness and youre still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold.How does this translate in the real world? Lets look at the retail price of some watches that are available in both stainless steel and 18-karat gold.This Cartier Tank MC is $15,000 more in 18k goldThe Cartier Tank MC measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9.5 mm thick: $15,000 extra (list) for 18k goldCartier Tank MC in stainless steel: $7,000 list, $5,800 streetCartier Tank MC in 18k pink gold: $22,000 list, $18,200 streetThe Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime measures 50.5 mm by 34.9 mm by 14 mm thick: $14,750 extra (list) for 18k goldJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in stainless steel: $8,550 list, $6,800 streetJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in 18k pink gold: $23,300 list, $18,400 streetThis list could go on and on, but the gist is simple: 18-karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel. In fact, its pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size and from any manufacturer. Even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny Chopard Happy Sport Mini sells for $11,000! Most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14-karat or less, very slim and small, or long out of production and with outdated pricing.Then theres the bracelet. Swap a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra $20,000. Adding a gold bracelet to that Jaeger-LeCoultre bumps the price to $42,900!Certainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches, but one simply cannot deny the raw material value in a gold watch case. And the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities: There are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold, and plenty of reserves, so no company, no matter how strong, can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers.Another reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility. They cant price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labor, distribution, and profit in a watch.The Apple Watch Edition Will Cost $10,000Theres a reason I picked those two watches for my comparisons: Both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm Apple Watch. The Cartier is a little smaller and the Jaeger-LeCoultre is a little larger, but both represent a traditional watchmakers gold-cased square-ish offering in the space. And both cost more than $20,000, with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle. And Jony Ive recently said that the historic Cartier Tank was one of his inspirations for the Apple Watch design!Apple would be crazy to sell the Apple Watch Edition for $20,000, though. Thats not going to happen. So theyre likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically.First, as we can see, the Apple Watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions. Although questionable from an esthetic standpoint, this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot. Second, Apple Watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display, sensors, and such. Third, the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum, not gold, to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions.Could it be gold plated? No. Numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case. Although Apple has not apparently used the word, solid in their press releases, they do claim it is crafted from 18-karat gold and nowhere does it say it is plated or gold filled (the industry term). There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could.Apple says that the Apple Watch will start at $349 for that aluminum Sport model, and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel Apple Watch to be roughly $1,000. It is reasonable to assume that the gold Edition model will sell for substantially more than this, with many suggesting $4,000 or $5,000. But remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold! Even with thin walls and a steel frame, its hard to see how Apple could make a solid 18-karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold.Gold is soft, but Apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as standard gold. Taking that at face value, perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately, cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch. This still leaves a few thousand dollars of material value in the case. The Apple Watch Edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes, a difference of about 20% in terms of case volume. So the smaller model could sell for 20% less still.My prediction is that the 42 mm Apple Watch Edition will retail for $9,999 with the 38 mm Apple Watch Edition retailing for $7,999. This covers the cost of the gold case, the internals, manufacturing, sales, and profit, and yet does not leave Apple subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too-thin or plated case. I will be shocked if the price is $4,999, but I suppose its possible with some finagling and if thats the smaller model. And it will not be any less than that.This is a $10,000 productBonus prediction: Given the very high price of the Apple Watch Edition, I predict that availability will be quite limited. Apple will likely create special store-within-a-store spaces in certain Apple Store locations for the Edition. I further expect them to open special standalone Apple Edition Boutiques to sell the Watch Edition, accessories, and perhaps other future high-end products.Update!Needless to say, many people disagree with me. And now that @Gruber Fireballed this post, I imagine Ill hear from lots of them real soon!The gist of the disagreement lies in the amount of gold needed for the watch case. I assumed it would be quite thick (read sturdy) and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold. Then theres the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams. But @GAK_PDX (and others, though he was most visually eloquent) suspects it contains much less gold.For fun, I took my Apple Watch models and used SW and some basic assumptions to figure the gold content. 29.16g: pic.twitter.com/WGEnjtj1Yh Greg Koenig (@gak_pdx) February 19, 2015I think this number is way too low, but its a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow. And it puts the raw gold at about $849 at $29.11 per gram of 18k gold. Although this is admittedly much, much lower than my estimate, it still illustrates my point that the Apple Watch Edition is not going to be cheap. And I think hes way off but time will tell who is right and who is wrong.Another argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold Rolex watch. Right off the bat one should point out that gold cost $400/oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well, something Apple is apparently not going to do with the Edition. That Rolex case contained 18.5 grams of gold alloy, but its much, much smaller than the Apple watch and its circular to boot! A 34mm circle is 107mm in circumference, while the 42mm Apple Watch is 156mm in circumference. Use the magic of math to scale the Rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and were at 27.75 grams. But that case is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel, and the Apple Watch is pretty slab-sided. So we can probably double this safely and come out with $1,615 of gold in my mangled square Rolex case.So there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold. I can accept that. But lets take a step back and think about the final price. Even if it contained less than $1,500 of gold, how much would it sell for? Certainly not $2,000 or $3,000. You still have to account for the cost of everything else, plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution. And profit for Apple (and a hedge against the volatility of the price of gold). So were back at the $4,000-$5,000 estimate others have made. As Greg Koenig tweeted, and Forbes reported, If anyone thinks Apple is charging less than $5k for the Edition, they are smoking crack.Regardless of the total, its important to realize that the price of gold is in the drivers seat when it comes to pricing the Apple Watch Edition.Id love to be wrong, and I look forward to updating this piece.

https://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-straps-available-at-launch	Claim: Apple have different Watch bands for sale at launch	true	['9to5 Mac', 'Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Accessories', 'Jordan Kahn']	https://9to5mac.com/	https://9to5mac.com/2015/02/20/apple-watch-straps-accessories-available-separately/	2015/02/15	Despite speculation to the contrary, Apple does in fact plan to sell an array of bands as separate accessories for the Apple Watch at launch, according to sources. So far Apple has only shown the Watch in pre-assembled collections, which reduces their potential for customization, but our sources say that Apples retail outlets will be stocked on day one with individual straps so customers can easily mix and match the looks of their Watches.While Apple has hinted at millions of combinations of Apple Watch when considering the various watch faces and interchangeable strap combos, up until now weve not had confirmation that straps would be available to purchase separately alongside the Apple Watch at launch.The best 4K & 5K displays for MacWhat we know about the Apple Watch lineup so far from Apple is that it will come in three models Apple Watch, Sport, and Edition with each of those models offering a selection of the total 6 straps Apple has shown so far on the 38mm size, 42mm size, or both. Some of the straps Apple shows on its website, such as the Modern Buckle and Leather Loop will be limited to either the 38mm or 42mm models in select colors for the Apple Watch and gold Apple Watch Edition. Its unclear Apples exact motivation in limiting certain watch straps to either the 38mm and 42mm options in the Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition lineups. The Apple Watch Sport line offers all strap options and colors for both sizes, according to Apples site. However, its possible that some of the straps Apple shows as limited to either the 38mm or 42mm sizes will become available to purchase for the other size separately. Some straps and bracelets might make more sense to offer as standalone accessories. Not offering straps for the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition could be something Apple does strategically to increase the exclusivity of those models that many expect to sell as high-end fashion items with matching price tags. Theres no confirmation on what straps Apple will make available to purchase separately at launch or if the options will reflect all variations of the device currently shown on Apples website. Its of course also possible, and quite likely, that Apple will offer straps beyond the designs its outed so far. 	
https://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-Edition-display	Claim: Apple will create special 'store-within-a-store spaces' for the Apple Watch Edition	false	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Edition', 'Grail Watch', 'Stephen Foskett']	https://grail-watch.com/	https://grail-watch.com/2015/02/16/gold-apple-watch-edition-must-cost-10000/	2015/02/15	The Apple Watch is a fairly large chunk of gold!Get ready for the tech press to flip out when Apple announces the retail price for the gold Apple Watch Edition model. Apple critics have always roasted the company for selling products that are more expensive than they should be, and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers. But the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of $10,000. The funny thing in this case is that Apple is perfectly right to be charging that much!Do you disagree? Check out my counterpoint, The Case Against the $10,000 Gold Apple Watch EditionGold is ExpensiveLets start with a little backgrounder in gold. Everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive. Even rabid Internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news. But most people dont understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is. So this is a good place to begin the discussion.Update: My calculations were wrong! Also, this was a bit back of the envelope. Now that it has some readership I realize I should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more realistic...Here are the basic facts:Gold currently sells for between $1,200 and $1,300 per troy ounce and has been over $1,000 per troy ounce for the last five years.18-karat gold contains 75% pure gold, and that term is regulated by law.One ounce of 18k gold occupies about 1.8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18-karat gold alloy weighs about 16.5 grams per cc.18-karat gold currently sells for $29.11 per gram, $905 per troy ounce, or $480 per cc..25 cc of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and .75 cc gets you a deployant clasp. It takes a few more to build a watch case, anywhere from 1.5 to 8 cc depending on the size and thickness of the case. So the buckle is worth $120-$360 and the watch case $720 to $3800 just as raw gold. This is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than $6,000!Gold Watches are ExpensiveLets apply this to a watch case. Imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep. If it was solid, this would equal 15.12 cc of volume. But its a watch case, so you have to leave room for the movement, dial, case back, etc. So lets just leave 5 mm of thickness all around, making a hollow rectangle. This equals 6.8 cc (42 x 36 x 10 32 x 26 x 10). Therefore, the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost $3,200 as of this writing.A simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would cost more than $3,200Now lets consider the same shape but just 2 mm thick. Thats 2.9 cc of gold, worth $1,400. Pick your thickness and youre still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold.How does this translate in the real world? Lets look at the retail price of some watches that are available in both stainless steel and 18-karat gold.This Cartier Tank MC is $15,000 more in 18k goldThe Cartier Tank MC measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9.5 mm thick: $15,000 extra (list) for 18k goldCartier Tank MC in stainless steel: $7,000 list, $5,800 streetCartier Tank MC in 18k pink gold: $22,000 list, $18,200 streetThe Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime measures 50.5 mm by 34.9 mm by 14 mm thick: $14,750 extra (list) for 18k goldJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in stainless steel: $8,550 list, $6,800 streetJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in 18k pink gold: $23,300 list, $18,400 streetThis list could go on and on, but the gist is simple: 18-karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel. In fact, its pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size and from any manufacturer. Even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny Chopard Happy Sport Mini sells for $11,000! Most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14-karat or less, very slim and small, or long out of production and with outdated pricing.Then theres the bracelet. Swap a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra $20,000. Adding a gold bracelet to that Jaeger-LeCoultre bumps the price to $42,900!Certainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches, but one simply cannot deny the raw material value in a gold watch case. And the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities: There are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold, and plenty of reserves, so no company, no matter how strong, can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers.Another reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility. They cant price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labor, distribution, and profit in a watch.The Apple Watch Edition Will Cost $10,000Theres a reason I picked those two watches for my comparisons: Both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm Apple Watch. The Cartier is a little smaller and the Jaeger-LeCoultre is a little larger, but both represent a traditional watchmakers gold-cased square-ish offering in the space. And both cost more than $20,000, with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle. And Jony Ive recently said that the historic Cartier Tank was one of his inspirations for the Apple Watch design!Apple would be crazy to sell the Apple Watch Edition for $20,000, though. Thats not going to happen. So theyre likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically.First, as we can see, the Apple Watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions. Although questionable from an esthetic standpoint, this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot. Second, Apple Watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display, sensors, and such. Third, the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum, not gold, to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions.Could it be gold plated? No. Numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case. Although Apple has not apparently used the word, solid in their press releases, they do claim it is crafted from 18-karat gold and nowhere does it say it is plated or gold filled (the industry term). There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could.Apple says that the Apple Watch will start at $349 for that aluminum Sport model, and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel Apple Watch to be roughly $1,000. It is reasonable to assume that the gold Edition model will sell for substantially more than this, with many suggesting $4,000 or $5,000. But remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold! Even with thin walls and a steel frame, its hard to see how Apple could make a solid 18-karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold.Gold is soft, but Apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as standard gold. Taking that at face value, perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately, cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch. This still leaves a few thousand dollars of material value in the case. The Apple Watch Edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes, a difference of about 20% in terms of case volume. So the smaller model could sell for 20% less still.My prediction is that the 42 mm Apple Watch Edition will retail for $9,999 with the 38 mm Apple Watch Edition retailing for $7,999. This covers the cost of the gold case, the internals, manufacturing, sales, and profit, and yet does not leave Apple subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too-thin or plated case. I will be shocked if the price is $4,999, but I suppose its possible with some finagling and if thats the smaller model. And it will not be any less than that.This is a $10,000 productBonus prediction: Given the very high price of the Apple Watch Edition, I predict that availability will be quite limited. Apple will likely create special store-within-a-store spaces in certain Apple Store locations for the Edition. I further expect them to open special standalone Apple Edition Boutiques to sell the Watch Edition, accessories, and perhaps other future high-end products.Update!Needless to say, many people disagree with me. And now that @Gruber Fireballed this post, I imagine Ill hear from lots of them real soon!The gist of the disagreement lies in the amount of gold needed for the watch case. I assumed it would be quite thick (read sturdy) and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold. Then theres the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams. But @GAK_PDX (and others, though he was most visually eloquent) suspects it contains much less gold.For fun, I took my Apple Watch models and used SW and some basic assumptions to figure the gold content. 29.16g: pic.twitter.com/WGEnjtj1Yh Greg Koenig (@gak_pdx) February 19, 2015I think this number is way too low, but its a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow. And it puts the raw gold at about $849 at $29.11 per gram of 18k gold. Although this is admittedly much, much lower than my estimate, it still illustrates my point that the Apple Watch Edition is not going to be cheap. And I think hes way off but time will tell who is right and who is wrong.Another argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold Rolex watch. Right off the bat one should point out that gold cost $400/oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well, something Apple is apparently not going to do with the Edition. That Rolex case contained 18.5 grams of gold alloy, but its much, much smaller than the Apple watch and its circular to boot! A 34mm circle is 107mm in circumference, while the 42mm Apple Watch is 156mm in circumference. Use the magic of math to scale the Rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and were at 27.75 grams. But that case is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel, and the Apple Watch is pretty slab-sided. So we can probably double this safely and come out with $1,615 of gold in my mangled square Rolex case.So there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold. I can accept that. But lets take a step back and think about the final price. Even if it contained less than $1,500 of gold, how much would it sell for? Certainly not $2,000 or $3,000. You still have to account for the cost of everything else, plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution. And profit for Apple (and a hedge against the volatility of the price of gold). So were back at the $4,000-$5,000 estimate others have made. As Greg Koenig tweeted, and Forbes reported, If anyone thinks Apple is charging less than $5k for the Edition, they are smoking crack.Regardless of the total, its important to realize that the price of gold is in the drivers seat when it comes to pricing the Apple Watch Edition.Id love to be wrong, and I look forward to updating this piece.

https://www.emergent.info/comcast-fired	Claim: Comcast got a man fired from his job after he complained about the company's service	unverified	[]	https://consumerist.com/	https://consumerist.com/2014/10/06/unhappy-customer-comcast-told-my-employer-about-complaint-got-me-fired/	2014/10/08	UPDATE #3: Conal has filed a lawsuit against the cable giant in a federal court in California, alleging that â among other claims â Comcast violated a federal law prohibiting cable companies from sharing customersâ information without their consent.ââUPDATE #2: Comcast has apologized for the horrible service and billing that Conal experienced during his year-plus as a customer, but says that ânobody at Comcast asked for him to be fired.âââUPDATE: Conalâs former employers have given a brief explanation of his dismissal, without providing any details as to what exactly he said to Comcast that merited terminating his employment.ââ-When you complain to your cable company, you certainly donât expect that the cable company will then contact your employer and discuss your complaint. But thatâs exactly what happened to one former Comcast customer who says he was fired after the cable company called a partner at his accounting firm.TL;DR Versionâ¢ Customer spends 11 monthsÂ being overcharged by Comcast.â¢ Customerâs complaints go unresolved.â¢ Customer contacts office of Comcastâs Controller to complain about billing practices.â¢ Comcast contacts customerâs employer, which happens to do a lot of business with Comcast, says customer used employerâs name during complaint.â¢ Customer insists he did not use company name; fired by employer anyway.â¢ Comcast will not release e-mails or audio recordings to counter customerâs claim that he didnât use the name of his employer.IT BEGAN INNOCENTLY ENOUGHâ¦Conal began subscribing to Comcast service in early 2013 after he says he was sold a 9-month promotional pricing offer. But from the start, there were issues with his service, as he was being charged for set-top boxes that had yet to be activated. Additionally, someone at Comcast billing had misspelled Conalâs last name, meaning some of his bills were not being delivered.He says he met with a Comcast rep in May 2013 about the billing issues and promised they would all be sorted out, but things only got worse.A few months later, the promotional discount shrunk and Conalâs monthly bill increased by $20, in addition to still being charged for unactivated devices in his house. Comcast also twice charged him an additional $7 for a second modem he did not have.Meanwhile, attempts to get a resolution from Comcast went unanswered.CUTTING THE CORDHe attempted to cancel his service in Oct. 2013 but says a Comcast rep convinced him that the billing issues would be resolved and that he would get free DVR service and The Movie Channel for three months as compensation.But things didnât just continue as they had before; Comcast somehow managed to sink even lower than it had before, sending Conal about a dozen pieces of equipment that he didnât order.âThere were a few DVRs, modem, standard boxes and equipment that I was unfamiliar with,â he says.Making matters worse, Comcast billed him $1,820 for all this stuff heâd never requested and had no use for.When Conal returned all the equipment to Comcast and, being an experienced accountant at one of the nationâs most prestigious firms, even prepared a spreadsheet detailing every charge, overcharge, payment and credit on his account for his brief time as a Comcast customer.He says even this didnât convince Comcast that there was a problem and that Conal had been overcharged. And even though it wasnât yet past due, Comcast sent Conalâs account into collections in Feb. 2014.THE CALL IN QUESTIONAnd so on Feb. 6, 2014, he chose to try going above Comcastâs customer service, which hadnât been of any help in the year heâd been a subscriber, and instead contacted the office of the companyâs Controller. He spoke to someone in that office who promised Conal would receive a call back to address the issues.He describes that callback as âbizarre,â with the rep not identifying which company she was calling from, just starting out with âHow can I help you?â Then she kept insisting that a technician had shown up for an appointment, but wouldnât specify which appointment. The rep then began asking him for the color of his house.So he tried the Controllerâs office again, to let them know that the rep theyâd sent his way had failed miserably at her job.During this call, he says that he mentioned that Comcastâs billing and accounting issues should probably be investigated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a private-sector oversight operation. This ultimately led to two service calls where no one ever showed up and no explanations were given.But something did happen. Just not anything good.WE KNOW WHERE YOU WORKRemember how we briefly mentioned above that Conal worked for a large, prestigious accounting firm? Comcast certainly noticed that fact, especially since that firm is one that does business with Comcast.At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conalâs subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says heâd only received positive feedback and reviews for his work.Comcast maintained that Conal used the name of his employer in an attempt to get leverage. Conal insists that he never mentioned his employer by name, but believes that someone in the Comcast Controllerâs office looked him up online and figured out where he worked.When he was fired, Conalâs employer explained that the reason for the dismissal was an e-mail from Comcast that summarized conversations between Conal and Comcast employees.But Conal has never seen this e-mail in order to say whether itâs accurate and Comcast has thus far refused to release any tapes of the phone calls related to this matter.And while his former employer did provide consulting services to Comcast, it was not the accounting firm that audited Comcastâs books. So Conal doesnât quite see how mentioning the name of his employer would have helped gain him any leverage.In response to a letter from Conalâs lawyer â he has not filed a lawsuit, but itâs not out of the question â Comcastâs Senior Deputy General Counsel admits that the company did contact Conalâs employer but says that Conal âis not in a position to complain that the firm came to learnâ about his dispute with Comcast.THE HEART OF THE MATTERI think whether or not Conal mentioned his employer is beside the point. The problem should not have reached the point where he was even reaching out the Comcast Controllerâs office.Had the billing issues been fixed on the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth chance that he gave Comcast to address the issue, the call in question would never have happened.And even if Conal did identify his employer in the hope of getting his billing issue fixed, he wouldnât have been trying to get preferential treatment; just the service heâd paid for.Iâm also curious why, even though Comcast insists that Conal attempted to leverage his place of business to get his issue resolved, it has not specifically cited language that he allegedly used in the call.How many times a day do Comcast reps hear a customer say something like âIâm a lawyerâ or âIâm a big shot at [fill in the blank]â? How many of those result in Comcast going out of its way to contact that customerâs employer?We reached out to Comcast to ask whether itâs company policy to contact customersâ employers. No one answered that question, but a rep for Comcast did give a brief statement.âOur customers deserve the best experience every time they interact with us,â reads the statement. Comcast says it has previously apologized to Conal, but adds âwe will review his lawyerâs letter and respond as quickly as possible.âWant more consumer news?

https://www.emergent.info/iphone-hairgate	Claim: The iPhone 6 pulls out facial hair when being used	unverified	[]	https://9to5mac.com/	https://9to5mac.com/community/my-iphone-6-plus-is-yanking-out-my-hair/	2014/10/07	By now we should be aware of the bendgate issue but it doesnât concern me much. I take good care of my phone. Iâm more concerned and somewhat irritated that my iPhone 6 Plus, keeps yanking out my my hair when Iâm making call. Initially I thought it was the hair sticking to the screen protector. But upon closer inspection, it was the seam between the glass and aluminiumâ hair gets stuck and when you try to free it out, it hurts. I believe itâs not only me. Anyone else getting beard hairs pulled by the iPhone 6/Plus? It catches my scruff in the seam and yanks it during calls. The seam on my iPhone 6 where the aluminum meets the glass is definitely catching my hair and pulling it out.	
https://www.emergent.info/ios8-reset-bug	"Claim: 'Reset All Settings"" option in iOS 8 deletes iWork files"	unverified	[]	https://www.macrumors.com/	https://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/29/reset-all-settings-icloud-drive-bug/	2014/09/30	"It appears that there may be a serious bug with the ""Reset All Settings"" option in iOS 8, causing users who activate the feature to lose all of their iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive. According to multiple posters on the MacRumors forums, using the ""Reset All Settings"" option under General --> Reset has caused documents to be permanently deleted from iCloud Drive. Because iOS 8 was so sluggish on my iPad 3 I reset all settings (No data or media will be deleted) and sped it up BUT deleted my iWork data! Then promptly synced and deleted it in iCloud.I have public beta of Yosemite so can't roll back via time machine. I have no pre iOS 8 backups in iTunes or iCloud to revert to (well iCloud device backups don't contain cloud documents and I should have iOS 7 backups in iTunes but can't find any. iCloud has no trash like dropbox. They seem gone forever.The ""Reset All Settings"" option explicitly says that ""No data or media will be deleted,"" and it is meant to reset all user preferences to the default out-of-the-box settings. That the option is deleting iCloud Drive documents appears to be a serious bug, though it may be limited to Apple's own iWork apps like Pages, Keynote, and Numbers. One user had all of his iWork documents wiped by using ""Reset All Settings,"" while other app information remained in iCloud. In our own testing, using ""Reset All Settings"" deleted all iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive on the iPhone and on iCloud.com. After allowing time for syncing to a Mac running OS X Yosemite, all of the documents disappeared from that machine as well. Preview and TextEdit documents, which cannot be accessed on the iPhone, remained untouched on the Mac. There appears to be no simple way to recover iCloud Drive documents that have been erased by ""Reset All Settings"" in Yosemite, and several people who have been affected by the bug are now in contact with Apple support in an effort to retrieve their documents. A Mavericks user was, however, able to recover his files from a backup folder, and OS X Yosemite users may also have luck with recovering files via Time Machine. One user said that Apple was waiting on engineers to investigate the issue, while another said his account had been placed in troubleshooting mode to attempt to recover the data. Introduced with iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite, iCloud Drive is Apple's answer to cloud-based storage services like Dropbox. iCloud Drive allows users to store a variety of documents like spreadsheets, PDFs, images, and more, accessing them on any device. Currently OS X Mavericks users can access iCloud Drive documents via iCloud.com, but iCloud Drive will be fully functional in October, after OS X Yosemite is released. Users who have iCloud Drive enabled may want to refrain from using the ""Reset All Settings"" option on their devices for the time being, in order to avoid accidentally erasing important documents stored in iCloud Drive. Because iOS 8 was so sluggish on my iPad 3 I reset all settings (No data or media will be deleted) and sped it up BUT deleted my iWork data! Then promptly synced and deleted it in iCloud.I have public beta of Yosemite so can't roll back via time machine. I have no pre iOS 8 backups in iTunes or iCloud to revert to (well iCloud device backups don't contain cloud documents and I should have iOS 7 backups in iTunes but can't find any. iCloud has no trash like dropbox.

A Comcast agent named Jeremy allegedly called Tor an âillegal service.â The Comcast agent told its customer that such activity is against usage policies./r/darknetmarketsThe Comcast agent then repeatedly asked the customer to tell him what sites he was accessing on the Tor browser. The customer refused to answer.The next day the customer called Comcast and spoke to another agent named Kelly who reiterated that Comcast does not want its customers using Tor. The Comcast agent then allegedly told the customer:Users who try to use anonymity, or cover themselves up on the internet, are usually doing things that arenât so-to-speak legal. We have the right to terminate, fine, or suspend your account at anytime due to you violating the rules. Do you have any other questions? Thank you for contacting Comcast, have a great day.How did Comcast know its customers were using Tor in the first place? Because Tor Browser provides online anonymity to its users, This would mean that Comcast is monitoring the online activities of its users, to (among other things) check if they are following their Acceptable Use Policy.Comcast has previously been listed by the Tor project as a Bad ISP . The users of the Tor project listed Comcast as a bad ISP that is not friendly to Tor. The Tor project cited Comcastâs Acceptable Use Policy for its residential customers which claims to not allow servers or proxies under â technical restrictions .â:use or run dedicated, stand-alone equipment or servers from the Premises that provide network content or any other services to anyone outside of your Premises local area network (âPremisesLANâ), also commonly referred to as public services or servers. Examples of prohibited equipment and servers include, but are not limited to, email, web hosting, file sharing, and proxy services and servers;A Comcast spokesperson told DeepDotWeb that:We respect customer privacy and security and would only investigate the specifics of a customerâs account with a valid court order. And if weâre asked by a court to provide customer information, then we ask for a reasonable amount of time to notify the customer so they can decide if they would like to hire a lawyer and if they do, then we turn the case over to them and they proceed with the judge directly and we step away.However, this statement appears to be at odds with Comcastâs treatment of Ross Ulbricht, alleged Dread Pirate Roberts.Comcast previously corroborated with the FBI by providing information on alleged Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbrichtâs internet usage. Ulbrichtâs legal defense without a warrant. Ulbricht was most certainly never given a warning by Comcast or given time to contact a lawyer before he was arrested in a San Francisco library last October.Comcast already monitors its customers internet usage to prevent them from downloading pirated media in violation of copyright laws. Under the âSix Strikesâ plan, Comcast customers who are caught by Comcast pirating copy-written material are emailed by Comcast and told to cease the activity. Comcast will continue monitoring them, and if they violate the âSix Strikesâ plan five more times, their internet service will be terminated.EDIT 14.9.14: Removed a sentence that was wrong. Added link.EDIT2 15.9.14: Comcast released a post Setting the Record Straight on Tor denying the above and stating: âThe anecdotal chat room evidence described in these reports is not accurate.â Without explaining what is the âaccurateâ explanation?	
https://www.emergent.info/apple-path	Claim: Apple is buying Path	unverified	[]	https://pando.com/	https://pando.com/2014/09/09/source-apple-set-to-acquire-path-in-an-attempt-to-bolster-ios-social-cred/	2014/09/10	LinkedInFrom The News DeskIn a day packed with major Apple announcements, the company tackled smartphones, wearables , and payments . But there is one more sector that may be about to get the Apple treatment: Social.According to a single well-placed source inside Appleâs engineering team, the company is poised to announce an acquisition of Dave Morinâs Path social network. To quote our source, who requested to remain anonymous because the deal has not been announced yet, âItâs almost done, if not signed already, but itâs essentially a done deal.âIf true, it would be major news for the heretofore struggling social platform that has been known more for its design and user interface innovations than for its ability to drive adoption among consumers â particularly in non-Asian markets. Apple hasnât fared much better in the social realm historically, having flopped with its Ping social network and having made very little out of its acquisition of the team and IP from failed location-based photo social network, Color.According to our source, this is more than just a talent acquisition, or acquihire. The Path product will likely survive the acquisition and be incorporated, in whole or in part, into Appleâs newly refreshed Messages app. That doesnât mean that the deal will be priced like some other recent high-profile mobile communication deals, namely Facebookâs $19 billion Whatsapp acquisition and rumored $3 billion-plus offers extended to Snapchat by Facebook and Google.Facebook paid $42 per Whatsapp user, and $33 per Instagram user before that. By comparison, Rakuten bought the far less beloved Viber for just $3 per user. With Path having somewhere in the vicinity of 25 million users at the beginning of this year, and far weaker growth and engagement than any of the above platforms, it would be lucky to commandÂ anywhere near Instagram/Whatsapp sums. According to App Annie, Path ranks just 177th among iOS Social Networking apps in the US and not among the top 1000 overall iOS apps. When Path raised its most recent round in January of this year, the company reportedly commanded a sub-$400 million valuation, well below the $500 million-plus levels reportedly sought by management. Given the trajectory it was on, exiting at that level would likely be considered a win among most Path insiders. Hell, for many Valley observers, that would be the win of the century for Path investors, many of which have all but left the company for dead.Appleâs re-entry into social would also be a notable development. With Facebook (including Instagram and Whatsapp), Twitter, and Snapchat each looking stronger than ever in their respective social verticals, itâs unclear just where an Apple-driven social product would fit in among consumers daily habits. Google seems to have reached a similar conclusion, all but abandoning its strategy of pushing Google+ as a standalone social platform, and instead choosing to let the platform fade into the background of its other consumers platforms like Gmail and YouTube. Appleâs one stronghold has been in messaging via iMessage, which recently got a facelift. And Path has recently leaned more in this direction with its launch of an ephemeral messaging product, abandoning its long-held loveÂ ofÂ more lasting, intimate communications . Itâs certainly conceivable that Path could be integrated into Apple's messagingÂ platform, but itâs unclear, beyond the design prowess, how this acquisition helps Apple, at any price.Adding additional fuel to this fire, Dave Morin was spotted sitting in the front row for todayâs Apple keynote event, a high profile position reserved for Dr. Dre and other key Apple insiders.Did not forget about Dre. pic.twitter.com/fWNDpFhfYrâ Dave Morin (@davemorin) September 9, 2014 Apple has been known to be a fan of Morinâs, as well as the Path design aesthetic and broader design team. Take for example the companyâs decision to feature the Path app early on in numerous keynotes and advertising campaigns. In that sense, it wouldnât be that surprising if such a deal were to be consummated. Jason Calacanis made a similar observation in his evening email newsletter today, noting Morinâs seating at todayâs event and Appleâs long-standing frustrations around social. Others have been asking whether such an acquisition makes sense for years.To be clear, even if our source is correct, these transactionsÂ are never a sure thing until ink has been put to paper and (at least in the case of a public company like Apple) a public announcement has been made. But the tea leaves seem to be aligning on this deal. It's certainly an unexpected outcome, but it would sound even more crazy if Apple didnât have north of $150 billion in cash burning a hole in its pocket and a love for all things aesthetic. And with Morin's vaunted reputation for design, and Apple's social struggles I can't think of a better home for the once-hyped app.Â Donât be surprised to see Apple swoop in to rescue Path from social also-ran status.Pando hasÂ reached out to MorinÂ for confirmation (or otherwise) of the claim. We willÂ update this post as soon as I hear back.

https://www.emergent.info/apple-12-inch-Macbook-air	"Claim: Apple will launch a 12"" MacBook Air in 2015"	true	['9to5 Mac', 'Apple', 'MacBook Air', 'Mark Gurman']	https://9to5mac.com/	https://9to5mac.com/2015/01/06/macbook-air-12-inch-redesign/	2014/01/07	Apple is preparing an all-new MacBook Air for 2015 with a radically new design that jettisons standards such as full-sized USB ports, MagSafe connectors, and SD card slots in favor of a markedly thinner and lighter body with a higher-resolution display. Sources within Apple, who have used internal prototype versions of the upcoming computer, have provided in-depth details about the machine, and our exclusive artist renditions of the revamped MacBook Air provide the first close look at Apples first major step in mobile Mac computing since the Retina MacBook Pro launch in 2012.iPad Air 2The 12-inch MacBook Air will be considerably smaller than the current 13-inch version, yet also slightly narrower than the 11-inch model. The new 12-inch version is approximately a quarter-of-an-inch narrower than the 11-inch version, yet it is also a quarter-of-an-inch taller in order to accommodate the slightly larger display. In order to fit the larger screen into a footprint about the size of the current 11-inch model, the bezels on the display have been reduced on all sides.Besides a new look for the front of the computer, the entire unibody has been revamped from the keyboard to the trackpad to the speakers. Taking cues from the 12-inch PowerBook introduced by Steve Jobs over a decade ago, the new keyboard sits edge-to-edge across the width of the laptop. In addition to going edge-to-edge, the entire key set has been subtly redesigned so that each key sits noticeably closer together. Apple has squeezed the keys closer in order for the computer to be as narrow as possible, which can be seen in the rendition below:Apple has also relocated some of the function keys across the top and simplified the arrow key array in order to keep the keyboard as narrow as possible without taking away from overall usability. In addition to the keyboard, the trackpad has been changed. The trackpad is approximately the same width as that on the 11-inch MacBook Air (if not ever-so-slightly wider), but it is apparently slightly taller, nearly touching the bottoms of the keyboard and the frame. In line with earlier rumors, it also appears that the new trackpad does not have the same clicking effect as found on current and earlier MacBook models.The elimination of physical feedback in the click is part of Apples plan to reduce the thickness of the MacBook to a bare minimum. As can be seen in 9to5Mac artist Michael Steebers rendition above, the new 12-inch Air (on the left) is far thinner than the current 11-inch model (on the right). Taking cues from the current Air, the future model has a teardrop-like, tapered design that gets thinner from top to bottom. Above the keyboard are four redesigned speaker grills that actually double as ventilation holes for the fan-less device to keep cool.The upcoming laptop is so thin that Apple employees are said to refer to the device as the MacBook Stealth internally. In order to reach that new level of portability, Apple not only slimmed down the trackpad and tweaked the speakers but the ports as well:The upcoming 12-inch Air has the fewest amount of ports ever on an Apple computer, as can be seen in the rendition above. On the right side is a standard headphone jack and dual-microphones for input and noise-canceling. On the left side is solely the new USB Type-C port. Yes, Apple is currently planning to ditch standard USB ports, the SD Card slot, and even its Thunderbolt and MagSafe charging standards on this new notebook. We must note that Apple tests several designs of upcoming products, so Apple may choose to ultimately release a new Air that does include the legacy components, though there is very little space on the edges for them.As weve reported on multiple occasions, the new USB Type-C connector is smaller, faster, and more capable than the standard USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports on existing computers. The connector is able to replace the Thunderbolt Display port on the current Apple laptops as USB Type-C actually has the technology to drive displays. Additionally, the latest specifications from the USB foundation indicate that USB Type-C can actually be used to power computers, which makes the standard MagSafe plugs unnecessary on this new device. The connector is also reversible like Lightning on iPads and iPhones, which should make the overall experience a bit more intuitive. As the new MacBook may only have a single port, it would make sense for Apple to create a hub of some sort for users to be able to plug in multiple devices into the new laptop. Apple already ships all sorts of adapters for its Macs and iOS Devices, so adding yet another attachment to the accessory portfolio would not be unprecedented. With Apple moving to a new Space Gray color on its iOS devices and on some Macs (such as with the 2013 Mac Pro), it seems possible that this new MacBook may come in a new gray color, as shown off in some of our renditions.The latest rumors indicate that the new MacBook Air will ship in mid-2015 (perhaps around WWDC), while other reports have claimed that the new Air is already nearing production. With Intel revealing the latest news on the Broadwell chipset family at CES this week, the ball is likely now in Apples court for pushing the future of mobile computing into the world.

https://www.emergent.info/ISIS-selling-james-foley-body	Claim: ISIS is trying to sell the remains of James Foley	unverified	['Beheading', 'ISIS', 'James Foley']	https://www.buzzfeed.com/	https://www.buzzfeed.com/mikegiglio/isis-is-trying-to-sell-the-body-of-us-hostage-james-foley-fo	2014/12/11	"WorldISIS Is Trying To Sell The Body Of U.S. Hostage James Foley For $1 MillionMiddlemen in touch with ISIS or its associates say the group has turned a grim new page in its deadly hostage trade â by trying to sell the remains of at least one of the U.S. citizens it has executed in Syria. BuzzFeed Newsâ Mike Giglio reports from the Turkey-Syria border.Posted onPinISIS fighters during a military parade in Raqqa, Syria.ANTAKYA, Turkey â Middlemen with ties to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) have turned to a grim new method of trying to secure funds in recent days. With the group having failed to strike deals to ransom the U.S. hostages in its custody â instead beheading three of them since July â its intermediaries are now trying to negotiate the sale of the body of at least one of the men it killed.Three sources in contact with ISIS or its associates told BuzzFeed News that it wants to sell the remains of James Foley, the U.S. journalist whose August death was the first in a series of high-profile executions of Western hostages by ISIS hands.They said ISIS wants $1 million for Foley's body, which it would deliver across the border to Turkey, and that the group was willing to provide a DNA sample to facilitate a deal.If true, the attempted sale would highlight the ruthlessness behind the hostage-taking enterprise that has provided ISIS with deep reservoirs of funds and publicity â as well as the group's cold calculation as it works to raise more cash.At one point early this year, ISIS held 23 Western hostages in Syria. Fifteen Europeans were freed as governments reportedly paid millions of dollars in ransoms, but the British and American hostages remained. Both governments refuse to negotiate for hostages or to allow families to pay ransoms. In the months since Foley's death, ISIS has released videotaped executions of the U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff, the British aid worker Alan Henning, and the U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig. British journalist John Cantlie and a U.S. woman, a 26-year-old aid worker, remain in ISIS hands.All three of the sources seeking to act as middlemen in a deal with the secretive extremists have been granted anonymity to protect their safety.One, a former Syrian rebel fighter, has ties to ISIS commanders dating to the early stages of Syria's civil war. He said he has served as an intermediary in hostage negotiations with Jabhat al-Nusra, the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda, and with ISIS. One day this fall, to prove his bona fides in the murky trade, he opened his iPhone to display unpublished videos of Western hostages in Nusra's custody.This former rebel said he was approached by an ISIS leader who asked him to find a channel to either the U.S. government or Foley's family. Like the other sources, he noted a price of $1 million and the promise of DNA. ""They ask for $1 million, and they will send DNA to Turkey, but they want the money first,"" he said. ""They will not give the DNA without the money.""He claimed his motivation was to help the grieving family find closure, calling his work ""a humanity case.""Another intermediary, a businessman who has sought to use his own ISIS connections to facilitate hostage deals in the past, was candid about his goals: ""This is business.""The trade in Western hostages has created a shadowy marketplace in which middlemen like these seek to negotiate deals in order to receive commission. They might inflate their connections on one side of proposed negotiations in order to draw interest from the other, so they can make a case for being included in the transaction. The idea of selling Foley's body has drawn attention among some of these middlemen of late, according to a Syrian who was involved with previous negotiations with ISIS over U.S. hostages.Both the former rebel fighter and the businessman said that one point person for the negotiations would be a senior official in the Free Syrian Army (FSA), the U.S.-backed rebel coalition, who was involved in previous ISIS talks over U.S. hostages as well as deals to free European ones. In an interview in Antakya, this FSA official expressed dismay that word of the attempted sale of Foley's remains had leaked. He urged this reporter not to publish an article on the subject, fearing that the attention could sabotage any potential deal.Of particular concern, he said, was that the U.S. government might seek to put a stop to it. Having allowed the U.S. hostages to die in ISIS custody, he reasoned, it would look bad if such a deal succeeded now. Foley's parents have said that the U.S. government threatened them with prosecution if they paid a ransom for their son's release. ""It will be like a shame for the U.S. government,"" the FSA official said. ""People will ask why you brought the body but you didn't bring him when he was alive.""The FSA official described himself as the ""manager"" of the proposed negotiations. He was in touch with a middleman representing ISIS, he said, and if a deal progressed would seek to arrange it with someone representing the Foley family.As before, ISIS seemed intent on making money from its hostage enterprise by any means. ""They were trying to negotiate (a ransom deal) for his freedom before they beheaded him, and after beheading him, they are trying to sell his body,"" the FSA official said.The Foley family had no comment for this article.An official with the U.S. State Department said ""we are seeking more information"" on whether ISIS is trying to sell the remains of U.S. hostages. A senior U.S. diplomat called the idea ""disgusting.""With additional reporting by Munzer al-Awad in Turkey.Mike Giglio is a correspondent for BuzzFeed News based in Istanbul.

Photograph: Kcna/ReutersA year before North Korean leader Kim Jong-un came to power, a directive was issued for anyone sharing his name to change it â maintaining a tradition upheld by the reclusive stateâs ruling Kim dynasty, a report said.An internal state document obtained by South Koreaâs KBS TV station contains an âadministrative orderâ from then leader Kim Jong-il for all party, army and police officials to ensure the directive was carried out. The order was issued in January 2011, shortly after Kim Jong-un had been anointed as his fatherâs successor. Kim Jong-il died in December of the same year.âAll party organs and public security authorities should make a list of residents named Kim Jong-unÂ â¦ and train them to voluntarily change their names,â said the document, extracts of which were aired by KBS on Tuesday.The process involved revising names on official documents, including social security cards and school diplomas. Officials were also directed to reject birth certificates for any newborns named Kim Jong-un.âAuthorities should make sure that there is no one making unnecessary complaints or spreading gossipÂ â¦ regarding this project,â it added.The authenticity of the official directive could not be independently verified, and Seoulâs unification ministry declined to comment on whether it was genuine.But one government official noted that the Pyongyang regime was known to have banned citizens sharing the names of founding president Kim Il-sung and his son, Kim Jong-il.âGiven the North maintained the policy under the two previous leaders, there is a possibility that it would continue to do so now,â the official said.The Kim dynasty has ruled North Korea for more than six decades with an iron fist and pervasive personality cult.Park Jin-hee, a North Korean defector working for KBS who obtained the document, said she was sure the 2011 directive had been effectively enforced.âThere is no one in the North named Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, and there is no doubt the same rule applies for Jong-un,â Park, who defected in 2008, said.Topics

Photograph: Reuters TVThe Lebanese army says it has detained the second wife of the Islamic State (Isis) leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and their eight-year-old son near the Syrian border.The arrest reportedly took place in the past week and followed information provided by western intelligence agencies in the past fortnight.Lebanese security officials described the woman as a âhigh-value catchâ and said the identity of the boy was confirmed through DNA testing. If so, the revelation would support the claim of international involvement. The US and other states have samples of Baghdadiâs DNA from the nine months he spent in US custody in Iraq in 2004.The British Foreign Office said it had nothing to add to the reports.Analysts in Iraq said that, if true, the arrest would not necessarily yield useful intelligence. The self-styled leader of the new Islamic caliphate, which covers part of eastern Syria and Iraq, operates in an exclusively male world where women are rarely empowered. Baghdadi is believed to have three wives, two of them Iraqi and one Syrian.âIt is close to impossible that she would have operational details,â said an Iraqi intelligence officer. âBut she could still be useful on things like locations.âBaghdadi is known to move frequently across Iraqâs north-west, where he has been the target of an intensive technical effort to track him by the US National Security Agency and Britainâs GCHQ. He uses trusted couriers to pass vital information, often in written letters, or repeated orally. The FBI has put a $10m (Â£6.4m) bounty on Baghdadiâs head.Al-Safir, the Lebanese news magazine, which first reported the arrest, said the woman and her son were arrested near the restive border town of Arsal and were being detained at Lebanonâs military headquarters in the hills overlooking Beirut.The woman was identified as Saja al-Dulaimi, an Iraqi, by a Lebanese security official and a senior political source. Dulaimi was one of 150 women released from a Syrian government jail in March as part of a prisoner swap that led to the release of 13 nuns taken captive by al-Qaida-linked militants in Syria , according to media reports at the time.The arrest could be used as a bargaining chip against Isis, which has captured many foreign, Iraqi and Syrian prisoners. There was no immediate reaction on Isis websites, but in a possible Isis reprisal at least six Lebanese soldiers were killed on Tuesday by gunmen from Syria who attacked an army patrol near the border.Isis continues to pose a mortal threat to Iraqâs central government and to the opposition and regime in Syria where a devastating civil war is nearing its fourth year. The Iraqi and Syrian militaries have tried to mount counteroffensives against the group in past weeks, with mixed success. However, neither they nor US-led air strikes have wound back the spectacular gains the group enjoyed from June to August when it rampaged through northern Iraq as the Iraqi army withdrew.Meanwhile, Isis supporters released a video claiming responsibility for a shooting that wounded a Danish citizen in the Saudi capital of Riyadh last month.The video posted online by the Al-Battar Media Foundation shows a gunman pulling up beside a vehicle and firing five times at the man in the car, identified as Thomas Hoepner. The videoâs authenticity could not be confirmed but it was posted on a website commonly used by militants.Saudi security officials say a Danish man was shot while driving November 22, and that he was treated for shoulder wounds. They did not release his name.If confirmed, the shooting would be the first attack on foreigners in the kingdom carried out by IS supporters. About a decade ago, al-Qaida militants seeking to topple the Western-allied monarchy launched a wave of attacks that killed scores of security forces and Westerners in Saudi Arabia.The video also includes audio clips of IS group leaders calling on supporters to launch attacks inside the kingdom.In Brussels, Danish Foreign Minister Martin Lidegaard told reporters on Tuesday that âthe Dane is doing better.âDenmark and Saudi Arabia are part of the US-led coalition conducting airstrikes against IS militants in Iraq and Syria.Topics

Uncertainty abounds concerning the fate of Israeli-Canadian Gill Rosenberg, who was reportedly captured by Islamic State.Islamist websites â some of them known to be close to, or even serving as a front for, the terrorist organization â reported Sunday that the 31-year-old adventurer was captured during fierce battles with Kurdish fighters in unspecified areas.

(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s); if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1&appId=163414806897""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); According to the websites, Rosenberg was taken hostage following three suicide attacks on sites where Kurdish fighters had barricaded themselves.The websites gave no further details regarding the circumstances of the capture, nor provided any proof of it.The Islamic State claims do not make clear whether Rosenberg was captured in Iraq or in Syria. The main battlefield between the Kurds and Islamic State is in the Syrian- Turkish border town of Kobani.Kurdish sources approached by Israel Radio reporter Eran Cicurel expressed doubt over the Islamic State report. They said Rosenberg was not in Kobani. In the assessment of these Kurdish sources, the reports of Rosenbergâs capture are probably the terroristsâ propaganda.The Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) told The Jerusalem Post that âthere are no further details at this stage.âRosenberg wrote on her Facebook page on November 20 that she was handing over management of her account to âsomeone elseâ and would be without Internet access for at least two weeks, until December 8, she wrote. It is not clear where she went at this time.If the websitesâ reports are true, Rosenberg would be the first confirmed Western female to fall into Islamic State captivity. Holding Israeli citizenship would complicate her situation even further.Unlike the US and the UK, which refused to negotiate over their respective captured nationals, thus giving the impression of a laissez-faire interest, Israel invests intense concern into the fate of its citizens captured by terrorists.This does not mean Israel will negotiate for Rosenberg, if she has indeed been captured â or that Islamic State would agree to talk with Israel, making her nationality Canadian alone.If Rosenberg is in captivity, she would be the second Israeli â of dual nationality â in this position. Steven Sotloff, a freelance American journalist who also held Israeli citizenship and filed for The Jerusalem Report on the Syrian civil war, was captured by Islamic State last year shortly after crossing the Syrian border and beheaded by the Islamist group this past August.As well, Rosenberg breached Israeli law by flying to Iraq, an enemy country, which Israeli citizens are forbidden to enter.No matter what has happened to her since joining the Kurdish forces, upon return to Israel she will be arrested and prosecuted, as was the case of several Israeli Arabs who joined Islamic State and subsequently returned to Israel.This is not Rosenbergâs first tryst with adventurism â in 2009 she was arrested in an American con scandal and sentenced to four years in jail. This is, however, her first serious willful encounter with death.Rosenberg was born in Vancouver, and experienced a family crisis after her parents divorced. In an interview with Maâariv in 2009, she said that already at the age of 22 she was pursuing a promising career as a pilot of Boeing passenger planes, but decided to leave everything behind and immigrate in 2006. In Israel, she joined the IDF, serving as an instructor for Kenyan soldiers who came to Israel for home front search and rescue training.Rosenberg said she had ambitions to join the Mossad, but was hurt during her military training and afterwards had money problems.She met an American friend in an ulpan Hebrew language course who led her into crime, she said.She joined a group of Israelis who were accused of setting up a ring to cheat elderly Americans and steal their money through a fake lottery scheme. According to the indictments filed against them, they stole hundreds of thousands of dollars, perhaps even millions, from the unknowing pensioners.After a number of complaints were filed, a joint Israel Police and FBI investigation was launched. The probe led to the arrest of several suspects and their extradition to the US, where they were tried. Rosenberg served four years in jail.She may have decided to fulfill an act of redemption after getting out of jail and regaining her freedom.Hopefully the Kurdish sources are right, and Rosenberg is indeed far from executioners.Canada is trying to confirm reports that Rosenberg has been captured, a foreign ministry spokesman said Sunday.âCanada is pursuing all appropriate channelsâ to seek further information and is in touch with local authorities, the spokesman said in a statement.Yossi Melman is an Israeli journalist and writer who specializes in security and intelligence affairs.

Close to 300 teenage girls were kidnapped by armed gunmen as they were driven back to their school in coaches after an excursion.Some managed to escape, but an estimated 219 are still being held captive, reportedly in Nigeriaâs neighbour, Cameroon, whose military was involved in the ceasefire talks.There was immediate scepticism, however. One Western diplomat in Lagos, Nigeriaâs coastal commercial capital, pointed out that Goodluck Jonathan, the president, is in the middle of campaigning for the presidential elections due next year.âHeâs having a tough run with Boko Haram, and he needs a boost,â the diplomat said. âItâs the main thing that people are concerned about, security. If he can score a ceasefire, great. If he can bring the girls back, even better.âBut weâve not yet heard from Boko Haram. Until then, weâre taking this with a little salt.âAid groups working to secure the release of the schoolgirls welcomed the news, but also remained cautious.âThis ceasefire is incredibly promising, but we arenât there yet,â said Hussaini Abdu, country director for ActionAid Nigeria. âUntil every girl is released negotiations must continue.âWe are excited about the possibility of restoring peace in the country, but these girls must remain a priority and we therefore urge the government to ensure that the safety of all of them is guaranteed as part of any truce.âBritain is among several nations that has offered assistance to the Nigerian government and its military to help find the missing schoolgirls.Privately, Western security sector sources in the country report exasperation among those coming to help over the slow pace of the Nigeriansâ reactions to the kidnap crisis.The girls are understood to have been separated into several groups, making an armed rescue far more complicated and dangerous, leaving talks as the only likely route to their release.Boko Haram has in the past insisted that it would only release the teenagers if Nigeria freed several of the groupâs senior commanders, who have been captured and are in jail. There were no immediate details of what Boko Haram will get out of the ceasefire deal.The group has been blamed for hundreds of killings in bomb or gun attacks, and it is increasingly choosing targets over an ever wider area of northern Nigeria.It began as a local militia targeting people who broke strict Islamic regulations such as drinking alcohol. But it recently linked with al-Qaedaâs franchise in West Africa, al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and appears to have taken on far more ambitious aims, including ridding northern Nigeria of Christians.Boko Haramâs leader, Abubakar Shekau, frequently justifies attacks on Christians as revenge for killings of Muslims in Nigeriaâs volatile âMiddle Beltâ, where the largely Christian south and mostly Muslim north meet.The Telegraph revealed last month that the International Committee of the Red Cross had become involved in a secret prisoner swap deal that would ensure the schoolgirls' return.Officials from the Geneva-based organisation sat in on talks between the Nigerian government and a senior Boko Haram leader that was being held in one of the country's maximum security prisons.The Red Cross officials also visited a number of other jails, identifying a list of 16 senior commanders that Boko Haram wants freed in exchange for the 219 hostages kidnapped from the north-east town of Chibok.The ICRC's role in the talks represented the first official confirmation that the Nigerian government was actively engaged in talks with Boko Haram.Publicly, Nigeria's president, Goodluck Jonathan, has previously maintained that the government would never agree to any kind of negotiations.	
https://www.emergent.info/isis-fighter-jets	Claim: ISIS fighters are being trained to fly three captured fighter jets	unverified	[]	https://www.reuters.com/	https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/17/us-mideast-crisis-jets-idUSKCN0I60TM20141017	2014/10/17	BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iraqi pilots who have joined Islamic State in Syria are training members of the group to fly in three captured fighter jets, a group monitoring the war said on Friday, saying it was the first time the militant group had taken to the air. The group, which has seized swathes of land in Syria and Iraq, has been flying the planes over the captured al-Jarrah military airport east of Aleppo, said Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Reuters was not immediately able to verify the report and U.S. Central Command said it was not aware of Islamic State flying jets in Syria. U.S-led forces are bombing Islamic State bases in Syria and Iraq. The group has regularly used weaponry captured from the Syrian and Iraqi armies and has overrun several military bases but, if the report is confirmed, this would be the first time it has been able to pilot warplanes. âThey have trainers, Iraqi officers who were pilots before for (former Iraqi president) Saddam Hussein,â Abdulrahman said. âPeople saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back,â he said, citing witnesses in northern Aleppo province near the base, which is 70 km (45 miles) south of the Turkish border. Witnesses reported the flights were at a low altitude and only lasted five to 10 minutes before landing, the Observatory said. It was not possible to reach the Syrian government for comment and state media did not mention the report. It was not clear whether the jets were equipped with weaponry or whether the pilots could fly longer distances in the planes, which witnesses said appeared to be MiG 21 or MiG 23 models captured from the Syrian military. U.S. âWeâre not aware of ISIL conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere,â U.S. Central Command spokesman Colonel Patrick Ryder said, using a former name for Islamic State. General Lloyd Austin, head of the U.S. militaryâs Central Command, said he could not confirm that Iraqi pilots had joined Islamic State. âWe donât have any operational reporting of ISIL flying jets in support of ISIL activity on the ground and so I cannot confirm that. And to the degree that pilots may have defected and joined the ranks of ISIL, I donât have any information on that either,â he told a Pentagon news briefing. Pro-Islamic State Twitter accounts have previously posted pictures of captured jets in other parts of Syria but the aircraft appeared unusable, according to political analysts and diplomats. The countryside east of Aleppo city is one of the main bases of Islamic State in Syria. The al Qaeda offshoot controls up to a third of the territory of Syria, whose civil war pitting various rebel groups against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad has raged for more than three years.

The second militant was allegedly killed for âdealing with the regime and throwing electronic chips to keep track of Mujahedeenâ.The electronic chips are understood to be a reference to electronic chips used for geo-location of targets in air strikes.There are unconfirmed reports that the men were beheaded, although Isis (also known as Islamic State) have also been known to crucify people.Charlie Winter, Programs Officer at counter-extremism think tank the Quilliam Foundation, said reports of Isis executing their own fighters are unsurprising.He told The Independent: âIsis is known for crucifying those who have tried to rebel against them.

REUTERS/KCNANorth Koreaâs state media, which usually chronicles Kimâs whereabouts in great detail, has not made any mention of his activities since he attended a concert with his wife on Sept. 3, and Kim was absent from early state media coverage of a major political anniversary on Friday.In the previous two years, Kim marked the anniversary of the founding of North Koreaâs Workersâ Party with a post-midnight visit to the Pyongyang mausoleum where the bodies of his father and grandfather are interred.Last year, that visit was covered about four hours later by the stateâs KCNA news agency, and by the daily Rodong Sinmun newspaper. As of about 8 a.m. (7.00 p.m. EDT) on Friday, there was no KCNA report of an event at the mausoleum. Fridayâs Rodong Sinmun could not yet be seen on its website.Kimâs father, Kim Jong Il, did not always attend the Oct. 10 memorial event when he was in power.The source, who has close ties to Pyongyang and Beijing, said on Thursday that Kim hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises.âHe ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part too. They were crawling and running and rolling around, and he pulled a tendon,â the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity.âHe injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight. He limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened,â the source said.Kim, who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, had been seen walking with a limp since an event with important officials in July, which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury.Kim needs about 100 days to recuperate, said the source, whose information could not be independently verified.âKim Jong Un is in total control,â said the source.Kimâs absence from public view is fuelling speculation over the state of his health and whether he may have been sidelined in a power struggle.âThe longer he remains out of the public eye, the more uncertainty about him, and the status of his regime, will grow,â said Curtis Melvin, a researcher at the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington.NOT KIMâS FIRST ABSENCENorth Korean officials have denied that Kimâs public absence since early September is health-related and a U.S. official following North Korea said this week there were no indications he was seriously ill or in political trouble.It remains unclear why a leg injury would keep Kim out of the public eye for so long, although this is not the first time he has been missing from public view.In June 2012, six months after coming to power, state media failed to report on or photograph him for 23 days.He re-surfaced the next month at a dolphinarium.Speculation that Kimâs unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fueled by a North Korean television report late last month that said he was suffering from âdiscomfortâ.Some North Korea watchers also suggest that Kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle, a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit on Saturday of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea.Another interpretation of that visit holds that it was meant to convey stability in Pyongyang.The source with knowledge of Kim Jong Unâs health said rumors of a coup were ârubbishâ.âIt would have to be a very subtle coup indeed not to disrupt international travel plans,â said Andray Abrahamian of the Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based group running a program for North Koreans in Southeast Asia.North Korea is a hereditary dictatorship centered on the ruling Kim family. Kimâs sister, Kim Yo Jong, is known to have an official role within the ruling party. His brother, Kim Jong Chol, and his estranged half-brother are not in the public eye.Kim was absent from a Sept. 25 meeting of the Supreme Peopleâs Assembly, or parliament, the first he has not attended since coming to power three years ago.However, Kimâs name has not disappeared from state propaganda.Thursdayâs edition of the Rodong Sinmun carried three letters to Kim from overseas allies on its front page, and has reported on returning athletes from the Asian Games who thanked âthe Marshalâ for his support during the competition.Abrahamian said it was unlikely Kim had been usurped.âKim Jong Un has always shared power with other key figures and even if the internal balance of power has shifted, it is unlikely that they would want to remove him, given his unmatchable symbolic value. Again, though, everyone is guessing,â he said.Writing by Tony Munroe; Editing by Mike Collett-White and Raju Gopalakrishnan

Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., said he learned the information from the Border Patrol, warning that the alleged attempts to cross into the U.S. raise serious security concerns.Â ""ISIS is coming across the southern border,"" he told Fox News. ""They aren't flying B1 bombers bombing American cities, but they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico.""Â Hunter continued: ""I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas.""Â He claimed Border Patrol ""caught them,"" but ""you know there's going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.""Â The Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday denied Hunter's claim.Â ""The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,"" a senior DHS spokesman said. ""DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.""Â But Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper said the information -- that about 10 individuals with ""known ISIS affiliations"" -- came from a ""high-level source within the Border Patrol.""Â ""The congressman was conveying what he knows -- and what he was told,"" Kasper said. ""It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn't know what the right hand is doing -- it's been that way for a long time and we don't expect that to change.""Â Obama administration officials previously have downplayed the threat of Islamic State militants infiltrating the U.S. through the southern border, as warnings about that possibility have circulated.Â Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in an interview with Fox News last week, acknowledged reports that four men with suspected terror ties had been apprehended at the southern border in Texas and questioned. But Johnson said they were ""scrutinized very, very carefully"" and officials found ""no evidence that these individuals were tied to terrorism.""Â Border Patrol and Homeland Security sources also told Fox News that they have not been able to substantiate Hunter's claim. They said between Sept. 23 and Oct. 6, only five illegal immigrants from ""special interest"" countries were arrested at the Texas border -- and they were from Bangladesh.Â The four men that Johnson referred to were actually Kurds, Fox News is told.Â Johnson, at a hearing last month, stressed that the government had ""no specific intelligence or evidence to suggest at present that ISIL is attempting to infiltrate this country though our southern border.""Â At the same hearing, National Counterterrorism Center head Matthew Olsen also said: ""There has been a very small number of sympathizers with ISIL who have posted messages on social media about this, but we've seen nothing to indicate there is any sort of operational effort or plot to infiltrate or move operatives from ISIL"" into the U.S. through the southern border.Â Still, Johnson said the U.S. needs to be ""vigilant"" and aware of the possibility of ""potential infiltration by ISIL or any other terrorist group.""Â The union representing America's immigration caseworkers also sounded an urgent warning last month about the threat. Kenneth Palinkas, president of the National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council, alleged the administration has made it easier for terrorists to ""exploit"" the country's visa policies and enter the homeland.Â He complained that the administration has ""widened the loophole"" they could use through the asylum system, and has restricted agents from going after many of those who overstay their visas.Â Further, he warned that executive orders being contemplated by President Obama would ""legalize visa overstays"" and raise ""the threat level to America even higher."" He said there is ""no doubt"" many are already being ""targeted for radicalization.""Â FoxNews.com's Judson Berger and Fox News' Jennifer Griffin and William La Jeunesse contributed to this report.Advertisement"

The man was waiting to board American Airlines Flight 1140 to Dallas when a cheerful gate agent began welcoming everyone with the Yuletide greeting while checking boarding passes. âDonât say, âMerry Christmas!âââ the man shouted before brushing past her. Once on the plane, he was warmly greeted by a flight attendant who also wished him a âmerry Christmas.â That was the last straw. âDonât say, âMerry Christmas!âââ the man raged before lecturing the attendants and the pilot about their faux pas. The crew tried to calm the unidentified man, but he refused to back down and continued hectoring them. He was escorted off the plane as other fliers burst into cheers and applause. American Airlines did not return a request for comment.

https://www.emergent.info/elon-university-freshman-ban	Claim: Elon University has banned use of the term 'freshman'	false	['Elon University', 'Freshman', 'University']	https://www.thecollegefix.com/	https://www.thecollegefix.com/post/20172/	2014/11/23	Diana Stancy - Elon University â¢November 19, 2014OFFICIAL: Celebrates wider range of identities and expressions, protects young women from sexual violenceELON, N.C. â Elon University has dropped the term âfreshmanâ from its vocabulary and replaced it with âfirst-year,â a move made official this fall and implemented in everything from its website to orientation workshops.The change at the small, private liberal arts college in North Carolina was done to promote inclusivity, celebrate diversity, and ensure the campus did not promote sexist stereotypes or create a hostile and unsafe environment for female students, campus officials said in interviews with The College Fix.Leigh-Anne Royster , director of Elonâs âInclusive Community Wellbeing,â said in an email toÂ The College Fix that she has been told by some that they believe the term âfreshmanâ is outdated, and that replacing âfreshmanâ with âfirst yearâ is a âcelebration of diversity.âRoyster stated the word âfreshmanâ naturally insinuates a hierarchy among students on campus. She said she believes that students are viewed as younger and less experienced when referred to as âfreshman.â With that, Royster stated âfreshmanâ may contribute to sexual violence on campus because it labels the youngest students, causing them to be targets.âThe term has often been felt to refer to the vulnerableness of young women in college for the first time,â Royster said. âGiven the rates of sexual violence perpetrated against women on college campuses, it is useful to examine any use of a term that suggests that a group of people just entering college might be targets for such violence in any way.âRoyster said she believes this change will positively impact future students at Elon and foster progress in inclusivity related to gender.âUsing language that allows for a more inclusive understanding of gender will be important in our culture moving forward,â she said. âMoving away from language, including pronouns, that denote a gender binary will be something we see more and more as our culture evolves to celebrate a wider range of identities and expressions.âAt this semesterâs student orientation leader training, administrators made it clear that incoming students must be called âfirst-years.â No public announcement was made regarding this change â administrators relied largely on word of mouth to carry the news.Elon sophomore Alaina Schukraft, an orientation leader, told The Fix that each time an orientation leader said âfreshmanâ in training, he or she was immediately corrected.âThey engrained over and over in our brains that it was supposed to be âfirst-year,â not âfreshman,ââ Schukraft said. âThey were very adamant about using the correct terminology and stressed the importance of using language that would make the new students feel comfortable.âBut when the new wording was rolled out, not all incoming students were comfortable with this change. Schukraft said multiple incoming students approached her saying they were more comfortable with the term âfreshman.âBut Greg Zaiser, vice president of admissions and financial planning, said in an email to The College Fix that the change improves the campus environment.Zaiser said administrators believe the change keeps with Elonâs core values, and is a more appropriate description for new students. He added some believe âfreshmenâ is a âsexistâ term, and Elon is attempting to move away from gendered stereotypes.âAs an inclusive community, Elon strives to incorporate language that is current and reflective of our student body,â Zaiser said in an email to The College Fix. â âFreshmanâ isnât necessarily wrong, but itâs not completely applicable to Elonâs entire population, which includes internationals, transfers, spring admits, along with traditional students beginning their first year on a college campus.âCollege Fix contributor Diana Stancy is a student at Elon University and president of the Network of enlightened Women (NeW) chapter at Elon.	
https://www.emergent.info/texas-turkey-farm-ebola-hoax	Claim: A Texas turkey farm was contaminated with Ebola	false	['Ebola', 'Fake News', 'Texas']	https://dailybuzzlive.com/	https://dailybuzzlive.com/texas-turkey-farm-contaminated-ebola-holiday-turkeys-infected/	2014/11/16	"Sharing is caring!0Tweet0Share0Share0Pin0Mail0ShareTexas Turkey Farm Contaminated With Ebola, Over 250,000 Holiday Turkeys Infected.A Texas turkey farm employee is now under quarantine after he tested positive for the Ebola virus. Texas Prime Turkey Farm, the largest supplier of turkeys in the United States, has been ordered by the CDC to quarantine over 250,000 holiday turkeys. The CDC has confirmed 3,000 turkeys have tested positive for the virus since Fridays incident.According to investigators, long time employee Philip Canseco was seen vomiting in the facilities restroom three days prior to the incident on Friday. I was passing by the restroom, when I heard somebody throwing up inside, said one Texas Prime Turkey Farm employee. I opened the door and looked inside and saw Canseco throwing up in one of the urinals. I asked him if he was okay, he said yes, and I left. I didnt want to get close to him and get sick.Management confirmed that Canseco worked three full work days at the facility with flu-like symptoms, before passing out unconscious with a fever of 106. Due to his symptoms, he was rushed to a local hazmat tent where he tested positive for the Ebola virus. The CDC reports an additional 7 coworkers are being quarantined and tested. However, they have not released those results as of yet.The facility has been ordered by the CDC to burn their entire flock of turkeys, over 250,000. Texas Prime Turkey Farm is requesting permission from the state of Texas to send the shipment of incinerated turkey ashes to Veolias Port Arthur environmental waste facility. This facility has already accepted one shipment of Ebola waste from household goods where Thomas Eric Duncan had stayed. Duncan was the first man to die of Ebola on US soil.Activists are protesting the shipments of contaminated Ebola waste to their community. We feel every precaution should be taken to protect our community, our children and our elderly. We are not a dumping ground for the nations, or the worlds bio waste.Plant manager Mitch Osborne said on Saturday that even though no contract has yet been signed, the plant will likely receive the second shipment of contaminated Ebola waste. It is a safe and sound process, Osborne said. I am not going to place my employees in harms way, or the community. The company is here to improve the environment and I believe we are doing a pretty darn good job of that. I believe we are doing the right and safe thing.A spokesperson for Texas Prime Turkey Farm said there is a good chance Ebola turkeys may have already shipped out to major suppliers for distribution. Each retailer will have to perform recalls individually if they feel they have received a contaminated shipment.CLICK HERE > TO LIKE DAILY BUZZ LIVE ON FACEBOOK!You Might Also LikeJennifer Aniston: Should Rachel Have Ended Up With Joey?Haunted House AdventureMan Charged With Drug Offenses Because $324K Smelt Like CocaineRailbookers Takes You on Worlds Most Scenic Train JourneysPowerball Ticket Sold In Massachusetts Wins Record $758.7 MillionYoutubers Seeing Red After Recent Policy ChangesRussian Journalist Fakes Own Death to Avoid AssassinationElon Musk Sells 15,000 Flamethrowers in 48 HoursNetflixs Altered Carbon Is a Sci-Fi Rollercoaster?These content links are provided by Content.ad.

https://www.emergent.info/ny-marijuana-tickets	Claim: New York Police will start issuing tickets, rather than make arrests, for small amounts of marijuana	true	['Marijuana', 'NYC', 'Police']	https://www.nytimes.com/	https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/nyregion/in-shift-police-dept-to-stop-low-level-marijuana-arrests-officials-say.html?_r=0	2014/11/10	Nov. 10, 2014A clearer picture is expected to emerge this week, as Mr. de Blasio prepares for his first meeting with the cityâs five district attorneys. A spokeswoman for the mayor, Marti Adams, declined to comment on the proposed policy change, although officials in two of the district attorneyâs offices confirmed that the de Blasio administration was working on a new policy for how the police handle marijuana cases.In an interview on Sunday, Mr. Thompson expressed concern about the mayorâs plan, calling it an end-run around the district attorneys that could end up hurting some of the very people the changes are supposed to help.Since July, the Brooklyn district attorneyâs office has dismissed 849 misdemeanor marijuana cases involving police arrests, or about 34 percent of the total 2,526 such cases in Brooklyn.Under the proposed changes, it appears that instead of being arrested, those given a ticket for marijuana will be told to appear in a courtroom. But the new policy could push prosecutors out of the process, because summonses issued without an accompanying arrest generally do not receive prosecutorial review.ImagePolice Commissioner William J. BrattonCreditMichael Appleton for The New York TimesâIn order to give the public confidence in the fairness of the criminal justice system, these cases should be subject to prosecutorial review,â Mr. Thompson said. âBy allowing these cases to avoid early review, by issuing a summons, there is a serious concern that many summonses will be issued without the safeguards currently in place. These cases will move forward even when due process violations might have occurred.âAnother possible effect of the new policy would be that many of the tickets later convert into arrest warrants if the person misses a court date, he said. There are currently about 1.2 million active warrants in New York relating to missed court dates and unpaid fines for misdemeanors and noncriminal violations. In 2013, people failed to pay or show up to court about a quarter of the time for the 329,198 summons cases on the dockets of the cityâs lowest level criminal courts, according to court statistics.Under the current practice, more than half of those arrested for marijuana were released a couple of hours after being brought to a station house, according to 2012 data gathered by the Criminal Justice Agency, a nonprofit that assists with bail determinations. They were fingerprinted, checked for warrants and issued a ticket demanding their appearance in court six to eight weeks later. The remainder of those arrested for marijuana possession were âput through the system,â meaning they were held for up to 24 hours before being arraigned before a judge.In New York, the debate over marijuana arrests has been less about drug decriminalization than it has been about the aggressive stop-and-frisk tactics that came to define the Police Departmentâs crime-fighting strategies . During the Bloomberg administration, the police arrested as many as 50,000 people a year on minor marijuana charges, meaning that some years, approximately one in eight arrests made by the police was for marijuana. In some cases, arrests were made after officers stopped people under dubious circumstances and instructed them to remove any contraband from their pockets.ImageKenneth P. Thompson, the Brooklyn district attorney.CreditBebeto Matthews/Associated PressIn 1977, the Legislature in New York moved to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana that were not in public view. That meant that carrying a small bag of marijuana hidden in a pocket was supposed to be a ticket-eligible violation that did not amount to a crime.Â But since the mid-1990s, the police have routinely arrested people they found with marijuana and charged them with a misdemeanor, even though it was only supposed to apply to marijuana that was burning or discovered in âpublic view.âÂ In 2011, the police commissioner at the time, Raymond W. Kelly, issued an unusual order reminding officers that the misdemeanor was not the appropriate charge in many cases.In 2013, the police still arrested more than 28,000 people for marijuana possession, and in 2014, the arrests were occurring at a similar pace, Professor Levine said.While campaigning for mayor, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, emphatically criticized the departmentâs marijuana arrest practices. His populist outrage against heavy-handed policing in minority neighborhoods helped propel him into City Hall. But since becoming mayor in January, he has exerted little pressure on the department, instead often deferring to Commissioner Bratton, who has made a national reputation for aggressive street policing combined with an ability to soothe the often-inflamed relations between big-city police departments and the minority neighborhoods they serve.Yet Mr. de Blasio now finds himself under increasing pressure to deliver on his platform of police reform. That pressure began in July after a black Staten Island man died after a police officer put him in a chokehold while trying to arrest him for selling untaxed cigarettes. Since then, the departures of the departmentâs top Hispanic official and its highest-ranking black officer have led a number of minority lawmakers and City Hall allies to begin to question Mr. de Blasioâs oversight of the police.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: In City, Marijuana May Mean Ticket, Not Arrest.

https://www.emergent.info/white-house-fence-jumper-made-it-inside	Claim: White House fence-jumper made it inside the main floor	true	[]	https://www.washingtonpost.com/	https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house-fence-jumper-made-it-far-deeper-into-building-than-previously-known/2014/09/29/02efd53e-47ea-11e4-a046-120a8a855cca_story.html?hpid=z1	2014/09/29	The man who jumped the White House fence this month and sprinted through the front door made it much farther into the building than previously known, overpowering one Secret Service officer and running through much of the main floor, according to three people familiar with the incident. An alarm box near the front entrance of the White House designed to alert guards to an intruder had been muted at what officers believed was a request of the usherâs office, said a Secret Service official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The officer posted inside the front door appeared to be delayed in learning that the intruder, Omar Gonzalez, was about to burst through. Officers are trained that, upon learning of an intruder on the grounds â often through the alarm boxes posted around the property â they must immediately lock the front door. After barreling past the guard immediately inside the door, Gonzalez, who was carrying a knife, dashed past the stairway leading a half-flight up to the first familyâs living quarters. He then ran into the 80-foot-long East Room, an ornate space often used for receptions or presidential addresses. Gonzalez was tackled by a counterassault agent at the far southern end of the East Room. The intruder reached the doorway to the Green Room, a parlor overlooking the South Lawn with artwork and antique furniture, according to three people familiar with the incident. Secret Service officials had earlier said he was quickly detained at the main entry. Agency spokesman Edwin Donovan said the office is not commenting during the ongoing investigation of the incident. Breaches of the White House fence have become more common, but most jumpers are tackled by Secret Service officers guarding the complex before they get even a third of the way across the lawn. Gonzalez is the first person known to have jumped the fence and made it inside the executive mansion. Secret Service Director Julia Pierson has said the breach was âunacceptableâ to her, and on Friday she briefed President Obama on her plans to shore up security. Pierson is expected to face tough questions about the Gonzalez incident Tuesday at a hearing of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The hearing is likely to cover a number of security lapses by the agency, including new revelations published over the weekend by The Washington Post about the failure to identify and properly investigate a 2011 shooting attack on the White House. The more detailed account of this monthâs security breach comes from people who provided information about the incident to The Post and whistleblowers who contacted Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the oversight panelâs subcommittee on national security. Chaffetz said he plans to ask Pierson how an alarm meant to alert officers to intruders could be silenced or turned down. The congressman said two people inside the agency told him that boxes were silenced because the White House usher staff, whose office is near the front door, complained that they were noisy. A Secret Service official told The Post that the usherâs office was concerned the boxes were frequently malfunctioning and unnecessarily sounding off. The alarm boxes, which officers call âcrash boxes,â are key pieces of the agencyâs first-alert system, according to former agents and officials. If officers spot an intruder, they are trained to hit the large red button on the nearest box â sending an alert to every post on the complex about the location of an incursion and piping sound from that location to other boxes around the property. âIf true, the fact that crash boxes were muted to avoid being âdisruptiveâ is not due to a lack of resources or an insufficient number of checkpoints or barriers,â Chaffetz said. He called the incident a âfailure of leadershipâ by the Secret Service. âThe agency needs a solution that goes deeper than more fences and more people,â Chaffetz said. The new revelations follow accounts provided to The Post last week detailing how Gonzalezâs ability to enter the White House reflected a failure of multiple levels of security at the compound. The agency relies on these successive layers as a fail-safe for protecting the president and the White House complex. In this incident, a plainclothes surveillance team was on duty that night outside the fence, meant to spot jumpers and give early warning before they made it over. But that team did not notice Gonzalez. There was an officer in a guard booth on the North Lawn. When that officer could not reach Gonzalez, there was supposed to be an attack dog, a specialized SWAT team and a guard at the front door â all at the ready. The dog was not released, a decision now under review. Some people familiar with the incident say the handler probably felt he could not release the dog, because so many officers were in pursuit of Gonzalez and the dog may have attacked them instead. Since the incident, the Secret Service has added an additional layer of temporary fencing while the agency reviews its procedures. Alice Crites contributed to this report.	
https://www.emergent.info/Foley-ransom	Claim: The US threatened to prosecute the family of slain journalist James Foley	unverified	[]	https://abcnews.go.com/	https://abcnews.go.com/International/government-threatened-foley-family-ransom-payments-mother-slain/story?id=25453963&singlePage=true	2014/09/23	"Video Appears to Show Beheading of US Journalist James FoleyNicole Tung/AP PhotoIn this Nov. 2012, file photo, posted on the website freejamesfoley.org, shows missing journalist James Foley while covering the civil war in Aleppo, Syria.Diane Foley told ABC News earlier this week that warnings over the summer came primarily from a highly decorated military officer serving on the White House's National Security Council staff. James Foleyâs brother, Michael, also told ABC News that he was directly threatened with possible prosecution by a State Department official.âIt was very upsetting because we were essentially told to trustâ¦ that the way they were handling things would bring our son home,â Diane Foley said.The U.S. government did try to rescue James Foley along with other American and European hostages from an ISIS stronghold in Syria in early July, but by the time the elite commandos arrived at the location, the hostages had been moved. Foley was executed weeks later by a self-professed ISIS militant.Digital GlobeThis satellite photo shows a compound on the Euphrates River just south of Raqqah, Syria where ISIS hostages, including James Foley, were believed to have been held in the Spring of 2014 based on descriptions by former hostages.Diane Foley said the family believed they knew where their son was being held prior to his execution, but other than the July rescue mission, it didnât seem like anything was being done.âBut weâre not politicians, weâre not government people, we donât know,â she said. Diane Foley said the problem was that the family âhad no ideaâ because the government didnât tell them.At times, Diane Foley said the family âhad to begâ the government for information on their son.âWe were an annoyance, it felt, at some levelâ¦ They didnât have time for us,â she said.Today White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said that government officials were in constant contact with the Foley family and declined to comment on the alleged ransom warnings, telling reporters heâs ânot going to be in a position to detail the kinds of conversations that took place so often between members of the administration and the Foley family.ââIt is a long standing policy of this administration, it was the policy of previous administrations that ransoms should not be paid to terrorist organizations,â Earnest said before referring more specific questions about the Foleyâs situation to the Justice Department .Secretary of State John Kerry today told reporters that he was âreally taken aback [and] surprisedâ by Foleyâs allegations. âI can tell you that I am totally unaware and would not condone anybody that I know of within the State Department making such statements,â Kerry said.State Department spokesperson Marie Harf today denied the State Department told the family they could be prosecuted for paying ransom, only that the department helps hostage families âunderstand what our laws are about terrorists or paying ransom to terrorists.ââBut this department would never and did not ever intend nor do we think we ever did anything that we would consider threatening,â Harf said.Obtained by ABC NewsA screengrab from a video posted online appears to show American journalist James Foley shortly before he is killed by a masked captor.Thursday an NSC spokeswoman also said that the Foley family was informed of U.S. laws banning terrorism financing but denied the family was told they could face charges if they made a ransom payment.""Without getting into the details of our private discussions with families, the law is clear that ransom payments to designated individuals or entities, such as ISIL [ISIS], are prohibited. It is also a matter of longstanding policy that the U.S. does not grant concessions to hostage takers. Doing so would only put more Americans at risk of being taken captive. That is what we convey publicly and what we convey privately,"" NSC spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a statement.The spokeswoman also asked ABC News to withhold the military officer's name for fear his personal security could be compromised by those who might wrongly blame U.S. officials for Foley's slaughter at the hands of ISIS militants who may never have considered sparing him for any price.Diane Foley did not disclose how much her family had raised before his high-profile public execution but she and a surviving son, Michael, said that the administration's intimidation tactics succeeded.""It slowed my parents down quite a bit. They didn't want to do anything that could get them in trouble. It slowed them down for months in raising money. Who knows what might have happened?"" Michael Foley said.The family launched the James W. Foley Legacy Fund this week, which in large part is intended to help other hostages' loved ones navigate the frustrating currents they encountered both with the terrorists and with their own government.Two American and several British hostages remain in ISIS captivity.Asked whether she had believed ISIS would accept a ransom payment and free their son, as they had many European hostages liberated for between $2-3 million each, Diane Foley replied, ""I do, maybe -- I mean, who knows?""""ISIS is a very brutal group. They may have already decided, that Jim and the others were Americans and they were going to kill him,"" Diane Foley said.In the end, Diane Foley said she didn't want to blame anyone for what happened to her son, but said that when it comes to the U.S. governmentâs treatment of the families of hostages, âAs Americans, we can do better.â"

A video posted on YouTube, later removed, purported to show the execution of James Foley after he recited a statement in which he called the U.S. government âmy real killers.â A second prisoner, said to be Steven Joel Sotloff, like Foley an American journalist who disappeared while covering Syriaâs civil war, then appears in the video. American intelligence officials believe the video is authentic but are continuing to evaluate it, senior U.S. officials said Wednesday morning. In a statement Tuesday, National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said of the video: âIf genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends. President Obama was briefed on the video aboard Air Force One as he returned to his Marthaâs Vineyard vacation and will be updated on further developments, the White House said. British Prime Minister David Cameron cut short a family vacation and returned to London to chair emergency meetings on Iraq and Syria. In an interview with the BBC, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond acknowledged that the apparent executioner spoke with a British accent and said the video seemed to be genuine. Hundreds of Britons are believed to have traveled to Syria to fight in the countryâs civil war, including many who have joined the Islamic State. âWeâre absolutely aware that there are significant numbers of British nationals involved in terrible crimes, probably in the commission of atrocities,â Hammond said. A European intelligence official said the British government was examining the video, and the speech of the purported executioner, to compare it with former Guantanamo Bay prisoners and other British residents believed to have joined the Islamic State. Both prisoners in the video are wearing orange shirts and pants, similar to orange jumpsuits worn by detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A similar outfit, believed to be a jihadist symbol of the prison, was worn by Nicholas Berg, an American businessman kidnapped in Iraq in 2004 whose execution by an Islamic State precursor organization was recorded on video and posted online. Foley, 40, was working in Syria for the Boston-based news Web site GlobalÂ­Post when he disappeared on Thanksgiving in 2012. Philip Balboni, GlobalPostâs chief executive and co-founder, said in a statement: âOn behalf of John and Diane Foley, and also GlobalPost, we deeply appreciate all of the messages of sympathy and support that have poured in since the news of Jimâs possible execution first broke. We have been informed that the FBI is in the process of evaluating the video posted by the Islamic State to determine if it is authentic. Until we have that determination, we will not be in a position to make any further statement. In a statement Tuesday night on a Facebook page dedicated to his freedom, Foleyâs mother appeared to accept that the video was authentic. âWe have never been prouder of our son Jim,â Diane Foley wrote. âHe gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people. âWe implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages. Like Jim, they are innocents. Praising James Foley as âan extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person,â she asked that the familyâs privacy be respected. Sotloff, a freelancer who worked for several news organizations, disappeared in Syria in August 2013. In addition to Foley and Sotloff, at least three other Americans are believed to be captives in Syria, including Austin Tice, a freelance journalist whose articles appeared in McClatchy publications and The Washington Post before his disappearance in August 2012, according to a 2013 GlobalPost article. No one has claimed to be holding them. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 66Â journalists, all but 10 of them Syrian, have been killed covering the Syrian war. If the video is authenticated, Foley would be the first American journalist known to be executed since the conflict began in early 2011. The video evoked the 2002 taped execution in Pakistan of Wall Street Journal correspondent Daniel Pearl by al-Qaeda. The Islamic State, an offshoot of al-Qaeda, is the most powerful among a number of extremist organizations that have emerged during the Syrian civil war, which began as a popular uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. Fighting against both Assad and U.S.-backed rebels, the militants now control much of eastern Syria and claim to have established an Islamic caliphate spanning Syria and neighboring Iraq. As the group has grown, it has merged with the group formerly known as al-Qaeda in Iraq, under the leadership of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. According to U.S. intelligence, it numbers in the thousands, including foreign fighters from Europe and the United States. In April, Islamic State fighters swept across the border into northern Iraq, taking over the city of Mosul before moving southward to within 60 miles of Baghdad. Extensive reports of executions, including beheadings and crucifixions, have emerged from areas under the groupâs control. This month, amid reports of stranded and besieged Iraqi minorities threatened with execution, the militants advanced eastward toward Irbil, the capital of the semiautonomous Kurdish region of Iraq. On Aug. 7, Obama authorized U.S. airstrikes to rescue stranded minorities and protect U.S. personnel and facilities in Irbil and Baghdad. On Monday, after a total of 68 strikes from jets, bombers and drones, Obama announced that Iraqi and Kurdish forces, with U.S. air support, had retaken a strategic dam north of Mosul from the militants and that they had been pushed back from Irbil. Within hours of that announcement, the Islamic State posted an online message warning it would attack Americans âin any placeâ in response to the airstrikes. âWe will drown all of you in blood,â it said. The title of the video posted Tuesday was âA Message to Americaâ and was produced by the Islamic Stateâs media arm, according to the Site Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist Web sites. A masked man dressed in black is shown standing in an unidentified desert location beside a prisoner kneeling beside him with his hands behind his back. âObama authorized military operations against the Islamic State effectively placing America upon a slippery slope towards a new war against Muslims,â the masked man says. The video then shows a clip of Obamaâs Aug. 7 announcement, followed by a statement from the prisoner. âI call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government, for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality,â he says. The prisoner also appeals to âmy brother John, who is a member of the U.S. âI wish I had more time,â he says. âI wish I could have the hope for freedom to see my family once again, but that ship has sailed. The masked man then identifies the prisoner as âJames Wright Foley, an American citizen of your country.â He then reaches down with a large knife and begins the apparent beheading of the prisoner; the screen fades to black and the next image is of a body with a head placed upon its chest. The masked man then appears with another prisoner, identified as Sotloff, in a similar kneeling position. Foley reported from some of the most dangerous recent crises and was imprisoned for 44 days in Libya in 2011 by forces loyal to deposed leader Moammar Gaddafi. According to GlobalÂ­Post, two eyewitnesses saw his interception by a group of armed men in a silver-colored van on a road near the town of Taftanaz in northern Syria on Nov. 22, 2012. Since then, GlobalÂ­Post âhas mounted an extensive international investigation . . . to determine who kidnapped Foley and where he was being held,â GlobalÂ­Post said in an article on its Web site late Tuesday.
