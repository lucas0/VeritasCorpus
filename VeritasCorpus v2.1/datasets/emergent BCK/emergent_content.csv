http://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-gold-formula	Claim: The Apple Watch Edition has less gold than typical 18k gold	unverified	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Edition', 'Dr Drang', 'Gold', 'Leancrew.com']	http://leancrew.com/	http://leancrew.com/all-this/2015/03/apple-gold/	2015/03/07	March 7, 2015 at 10:53 AM by Dr. DrangTwitter user Sumocat got some blowback for this tweet:@marco_org Apple has a patent that can reduce the gold content of their 18k gold by half. veg.gy/ZhMF2— Sumocat ( @SumocatS ) Mar 6 2015 1:58 PMIt’s inartfully put (140 characters is a bitch), but as a practical matter he’s correct. Apple’s patent application is for a method that allows them to make 18k gold that has, on a volume basis, less gold than regular 18k gold.How can this be? It’s because Apple’s gold is a metal matrix composite , not a standard alloy. Instead of mixing the gold with silver, copper, or other metals to make it harder, Apple is mixing it with low-density ceramic particles. The ceramic makes Apple’s gold harder and more scratch-resistant—which Tim Cook touted during the September announcement—and it also makes it less dense overall.The karat measure of gold is based on the mass fraction. One hundred grams of 18k gold has 75 grams of gold and 25 grams of other material. If that “other material” is a low-density ceramic, it takes up a bigger volume than if it’s a high-density metal. Because the casing of a watch is made to a particular size (i.e. volume), not to a particular weight, the Watch will have less gold in it than an 18k case made of a conventional alloy.As an example, assume a conventional 18k gold alloy with 75% gold (19.3 g/cc), 15% silver (10.5 g/cc), and 10% copper (8.96 g/cc) by weight. The alloy will have a density of[\frac{1}{\frac{0.75}{19.3} + \frac{0.15}{10.5} + \frac{0.10}{8.96}} = 15.6\;\mathrm{g/cc}]A cubic centimeter of this alloy will contain[0.75 \times 15.6 = 11.7\;\mathrm{g}]of gold.Now assume an 18k gold with 75% gold and 25% boron carbide by weight (that’s one of the ceramics mentioned in Apple’s patent). Boron carbide has a density of 2.52 g/cc , so a gold/boron carbide metal matrix composite would have a density of about[\frac{1}{\frac{0.75}{19.3} + \frac{0.25}{2.52}} = 7.24\;\mathrm{g/cc}]A cubic centimeter of this material will contain only[0.75 \times 7.24 = 5.43\;\mathrm{g}]of gold. Here, the gold takes up[\frac{5.43\;\mathrm{g}}{19.3\;\mathrm{g/cc}} = 0.28\;\mathrm{cc}]or 28% of the volume.Table 1 of Apple’s patent gives other configurations and shows the gold savings.Some of these numbers look flatly wrong to me. For example, changing from a baseline of 25.8 g of gold in a particular part to 12.1 g is not a savings of 43%, it’s a savings of 53%. Maybe I’m reading the table wrong.In any event, the patent makes it clear that saving gold is one of the goals of the process. I suppose it’s not surprising that Tim didn’t make a big deal out of that in September.

School lunches in the United States stand in stark contrast to the wholesome and in some cases even decadent meals served to kids in other markedly less fortunate nationsThe first new school lunch standards championed by Michelle Obama have been phased in over the last several school years.In addition to whole grain requirements, the rules set fat, calorie, sugar and sodium limits on foods in the lunch line and beyond. While many schools have had success putting the rules in place, others have said they are too restrictive and costly.Backlash against the rules have spawned a wave of social media photos along with the tag #thanksMichelleObama. If these pictures are any indication, schools have responded to the rules by cutting down on portions to reduce fat and calories rather than by using potentially more costly ingredients. Meanwhile, the widely different meals from Spain, Ukraine, Greece, South Korea, Brazil, France, Finland and Italy are all fresh and wholesome, with fish, steak and vegetables featuring prominently.Photos of the meals appear on Sweetgreen.com. But in the UK and US, lunch trays feature processed foods such as popcorn chicken, frankfurters, cookies, and beans from a tin.

Mary's Meals - which began in 2002 as a one-off school feeding programme - currently provides daily life changing meals to over 989,000 hungry children in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Eastern Europe and South America.The surprising pictures show just how the UK and US measures up to the rest of the world when it comes to feeding schoolchildren.

I used to chat with her quite a lot and was shocked when I learned what she did and what might have been going on at the house.'Another neighbour, who is in his 70s and asked not be named, said no one in the quiet suburban street spoke to DeJesus or her husband about their work in the porn industry.'We heard what they did but it was none of our business,' he said.Credido's ex-wife Maribel Barreto was also approached by Daily Mail.com and viewed the photos of DeJesus and Summers.

When asked if DeJesus and Summers were the same person the 44-year-old went ashen-faced and hurried away.'I have nothing to say,' she said as she sprinted into her apartment.But Barreto, who was divorced in 2011, had earlier confirmed that her ex-husband and his wife Daiane ran the DC Toys Collector site from their home in Orlando.She said: 'Yes, they are the Disney Collectors. I can't say any more.' While DeJesus has done nothing illegal, many parents who allow their children to watch the videos might be dismayed to learn about the other graphic videos and photo shoots DC Toys Collector apparently took part in a decade ago.Attempts by Daily Mail.com to speak with DeJesus and her husband have failed as they have no phone listing and they do not accept unsolicited callers to the gated community where they now live. Neighbours in the upscale gated community confirmed that they know the blonde woman who lives with Messias Credido as Daiane DeJesus.The couple, who have an 18 month old son, were married on December 26th 2013, according to records lodged with Seminole County Court.Credido, who is also from Brazil, is behind another successful You Tube site called BluCollector. +29 <img id=""i-12f22b67eedbcd28"" src=""http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/02/18/25C87D9100000578-2958242-image-a-29_1424262065196.jpg"" height=""444"" width=""634"" alt=""DeJesus as she is today, with the mole near her elbow showing she used to be the porn star Sandy Summers"" class=""blkBorder img-share""/> Copy link to paste in your message DeJesus as she is today, with the mole near her elbow showing she used to be the porn star Sandy Summers +29 <img id=""i-934a81fde4c5fc0a"" src=""http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/02/24/25C640BC00000578-2958242-DeJesus_was_formerly_well_known_as_an_adult_performer-a-5_1424780752707.jpg"" height=""614"" width=""306"" alt=""DeJesus was formerly well known as an adult performer"" class=""blkBorder img-share""/> Copy link to paste in your message +29 <img id=""i-59eeaabde36cc6b2"" src=""http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/02/18/25C87D9900000578-2958242-image-a-36_1424262206012.jpg"" height=""614"" width=""306"" alt=""She is much less high profile these days"" class=""blkBorder img-share""/> Copy link to paste in your messageDeJesus was formerly well known as an adult performer (left) but now keeps a far lower profile (right) +29 <img id=""i-4636ff1b92d7170b"" src=""http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/02/18/25C8803500000578-2958242-image-a-38_1424262284463.jpg"" height=""926"" width=""634"" alt=""DeJesus as Sandy Summers by the fireplace thought to be at the Winter Park, Florida home "" class=""blkBorder img-share""/> Copy link to paste in your message DeJesus as Sandy Summers by the fireplace thought to be at the Winter Park, Florida home +29 <img id=""i-f2d3504c5168de8a"" src=""http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/02/24/25C6851500000578-2958242-The_29_year_old_once_made_risqu_videos_but_the_market_for_her_Yo-a-6_1424780776083.jpg"" height=""489"" width=""634"" alt=""The 29-year-old once made risque videos but the market for her YouTube channel now is toddlers"" class=""blkBorder img-share""/> Copy link to paste in your message The 29-year-old once made risque videos but the market for her YouTube channel now is toddlersIt is identical to the DC Toys Collector channel except it focuses mainly on toys for young boys.Both the BluCollector and the DC Toys Collector site are produced in exactly the same way.Shipping receipts seen by Daily Mail.com show toys being sent from Germany to the home address of Credido.Former neighbours in the Orlando suburb of Winter Springs where DeJesus and Credido lived said they would see deliveries from UPS and Fed Ex almost daily at their home.'There would be delivery trucks up to three times a day. We all wondered what was going on and what was being dropped off,' said a neighbour.Credido has been named as the man behind the Blu Collector by other media outlets.But until now the identities behind DC Toys Collector have been a closely guarded secret.The videos first began appearing on YouTube in 2012.They quickly became an online sensation attracting millions of page views and popular with children aged three and under because of their simplicity.The most watched video is called 'Play Doh Sparkle Princess' and has had more than 200 million views.Five other videos have received more than 40 million views, and another 15 have more than 20 million.The channel's 1,600 videos have been watched more than 2.4 billion times since being uploaded.One of the most recent, called 'LUNCH BOX SURPRISE Magnetic Dress-Up FROZEN', has already notched up more than 260,000 page views.The DC Toys Collector channel has more than 3.7m subscribers with a new video posted almost every day. +29 <img id=""i-e4148f307b3d12f6"" src=""http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/02/18/25C87CD900000578-2958242-image-a-60_1424262647108.jpg"" height=""423"" width=""634"" alt=""DC Toy Collector's local Toys R US store where she buys some of the products she features on her channel"" class=""blkBorder img-share""/> Copy link to paste in your message DC Toy Collector's local Toys R US store where she buys some of the products she features on her channel +29 <img id=""i-205c6eeb05d3e271"" src=""http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/02/18/25C87C6100000578-2958242-image-a-61_1424262657372.jpg"" height=""423"" width=""634"" alt=""The branch of Target where Diane DeJesus sources some of the toys for her usually daily video posts"" class=""blkBorder img-share""/> Copy link to paste in your message The branch of Target where Diane DeJesus sources some of the toys for her usually daily video postsLike others on YouTube, DC Toys Collector is able to make money from the site from pop-up and banner adverts on the site.With so many children watching the videos on a daily basis it is an obvious choice for companies advertising toys to place their adverts within the short videos.Each time the DC Toys Collector site is watched, the producers are paid.Industry experts say they get between .60cents and $5 each time the page is viewed.Google, which owns YouTube, takes 45 per cent of any money earned.The company Open Slate, which analyses YouTube, estimated that in 2014 DC Toys Collector earned $4.9m.They reached the figure by looking at the account's subscribers, social media reach and average monthly view count. I call it first-person toy porn. I think it works because it's Christmas morning every minute. In the videos DC Toys Collector's face is never seen. Viewers only ever see her hands and hear her slightly accented voice.Each video always begins with the words: 'Hey guys, Disney Collector here'.The narrator, who has a slight accent, regularly uses the words 'adorable' to describe the toys and carefully unwraps each item before explaining its features.The videos are expertly produced with professional sound and lighting.A focal point of the videos are the brightly coloured fingernails that often feature toy characters intricately painted on them.The videos are said to have an entrancing effect on children who sit mesmerized as the toys are slowly opened in front of their eyes.Technology strategist David Williams told the NBC Today show in July 2014 that the effect on kids, including his own, was like 'crack for toddlers'.He told the show: 'The effect is somewhat akin to crack for toddlers because of how you see them pining for it after it's over'.Williams also told Buzz Feed: 'I call it first-person toy porn.

(Updated: Feb. 24, 2015 8:49 P.M.)GAZA CITY (Ma'an) -- Hundreds of Palestinians were evacuated from their homes Sunday morning after Israeli authorities opened a number of dams near the border, flooding the Gaza Valley in the wake of a recent severe winter storm.The Gaza Ministry of Interior said in a statement that civil defense services and teams from the Ministry of Public Works had evacuated more than 80 families from both sides of the Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) after their homes flooded as water levels reached more than three meters.Gaza has experienced flooding in recent days amid a major storm that saw temperatures drop and frigid rain pour down.The storm displaced dozens and caused hardship for tens of thousands, including many of the approximately 110,000 Palestinians left homeless by Israel's assault over summer.The suffering is compounded by the fact that Israel has maintained a complete siege over Gaza for the last eight years, severely limiting electricity and the availability of fuel for generators. It has also prevented the displaced from rebuilding their homes, as construction materials are largely banned from entering.Gaza civil defense services spokesman Muhammad al-Midana warned that further harm could be caused if Israel opens up more dams in the area, noting that water is currently flowing at a high speed from the Israel border through the valley and into the Mediterranean sea.Evacuated families have been sent to shelters sponsored by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, in al-Bureij refugee camp and in al-Zahra neighborhood in the central Gaza Strip.The Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) is a wetland located in the central Gaza Strip between al-Nuseirat refugee camp and al-Moghraqa. It is called HaBesor in Hebrew, and it flows from two streams -- one whose source runs from near Beersheba, and the other from near Hebron.Israeli dams on the river to collect rainwater have dried up the wetlands inside Gaza, and destroyed the only source of surface water in the area.Locals have continued to use it to dispose of their waste for lack of other ways to do so, however, creating an environmental hazard.This is not the first time Israeli authorities have opened the Gaza Valley dams.In Dec. 2013, Israeli authorities also opened the dams amid heavy flooding in the Gaza Strip. The resulting floods damaged dozens of homes and forces many families in the area from their homes.In 2010, the dams were opened as well, forcing 100 families from their homes. At the time civil defense services said that they had managed to save seven people who had been at risk of drowning.Related

He was 81 years old. Rumors of Nelson’s death first circulated early July 21, 2015 on social media outlets but was later confirmed by police.A groundskeeper scheduled to perform yard maintenance on Nelson’s property reportedly found the singer/songwriter unresponsive on the front lawn and immediately called 911.“There was no evidence of drug abuse or alcohol and no signs of foul play,” said Det. Aldeson.“Determining an official cause of death could take as long as 3 weeks,” said County Coroner Frank Shultz. “It’s just too early to tell what caused his tragic death.”The shocking news comes just days after a recent “60 Minutes” interview where Nelson was quoted as saying “Life is good and I have never felt better or been happier.”This story is still developing and all information is not yet officially verified.Related Posts

However 3:2 repetition can be added to 24p video, which has never been near a telecine, and in Europe we use 2:2 pull-down, where there are no duplicate fields to detect and remove/cope with.There's so much misinformation and poor explanation of broadcast video - and in particular interlacing and de-interlacing - it gets a bit annoying. Particularly when a phrase appears that is based on a standard broadcast production process (Telecine-ing is the act of transferring film to video using a telecine machine) is used to mean something else (removing 3:2 pull-down/repetition which may or may not have been caused by a telecine)Quote:As such, any video with an altered framerate is expected to undergo IVTC to restore the progressive frames and decimation to remove duplicate ones, whereas material that is truly interlaced is more difficult to decomb.Yes - though in 50i/60i they are both forms of de-interlacing. 24p/25p content with 3:2/2:2 can be restored losslessly with the right de-interlacing algorithm, whereas native interlaced content will always be ambiguous (there is spectrum folding in the vertical spatial and temporal domains that cannot be undone - though some good guesswork can be made) Obviously native interlaced 50i/60i content should be de-interlaced to 50p/60p not 25p/30p if you want to keep the full motion (i.e. temporal resolution) of the original. How you do this depends on the quality you want to achieve (particularly the vertical resolution) and the processing power you have. The best de-interlacers will use stuff like Phase Correlation Motion Compensation to detect which areas are moving, and in what direction, to create the ""missing"" fields that need to be created to generate a decent 50p or 60p result.(These processes aren't new, and in fact have been an issue in broadcast production since the 80s. High quality DVEs (Digital Video Effects devices) used in production control rooms, that zoom and shrink, rotate, page peel etc. pictures have used realtime de-interlacing to generate the highest vertical resolution pictures they can when you zoom into a live native interlaced source. If you process fields individually (which lower cost DVEs do) you end up with noticeably poorer quality results (particularly when you enlarge a picture))Quote:Since you seem knowledgeable in this area, one thing I've yet to understand is what happens with US dramas shown at 720p60. Material on stations that broadcast 1080i60 can be restored through IVTC to achieve 1080p24 frames, but if the source is already progressive, I don't know if the frames are simply duplicated (rather than the fields), which would then mean that only decimation would be needed to restore the original framerate, or if there is a separate way to IVTC progressive content to restore its original framerate.They're both very similar. In interlaced 3:2 you are looking for the repeated field (which will be alternating between field 1 and field 2) in a pair of source frames which you simply discard to give you 2:2 (which you can de-interlace to 1:1 with a simple field-merge - aka weave). You obviously need to continuously detect the field duplication - as 3:2 content edited in the video domain could break the 3:2 cadence (i.e. you could end up with edits that break the repeated 3:2:3:2:3:2 pattern) by comparing fields and where two are identical you discard one.The same techniques can be done in the 3:2 60p domain, but in this case you also need to detect the repeated pairs of frames as well as the repeated triple frames as you need to go from 3:2 to 1:1 without any de-interlacing. You are still detecting and discarding repeated images - but you have 3 repeated frames rather than 1 repeated field to detect per pair of source frames. With a 3:2 regular cadence 24p within 60p you detect 2 repeated frames followed by 1 repeated frame.Some compression systems optionally also allow you to flag 3:2 sources so you don't have to send redundant content (though repeated fields/frames compress quite well) so rather than sending the duplicate fields or frames, you flag them for duplication in the receiver. If you have access to the compressed stream you can detect the flags and thus recreate the 24p source without having to run any content-based repeated field/frame detection."	2014/01/06
http://www.emergent.info/feminist-blogger-abortion	Claim: A woman aborted a fetus after discovering it was male	unverified	['Abortion', 'Blogging', 'Feminism', 'Hoaxes']	http://injusticestories.com/	http://injusticestories.com/i-aborted-my-baby-because-it-was-a-boy/	2015/02/11	I Aborted My Baby – Because it was a Boy13157Facebook TwitterShareOver the past 3 years, I have lost many friends, and several of my own family members have completely cut off communication with me. I now know that these are “adults” who just cannot handle the fact that I have the right to make choices, and that these choices ultimately hardly even affect them.1/17/15 – Editor’s note: Due to the large number of interview requests, I have extended an invitation to the author to post her response to the comments and general negative feelings towards her. I will post an update as soon as she responds.In the spring of 2012, I found out that I was pregnant. I had a good idea who the donator was, but money wasn’t really an issue, and I knew that I would be a good mother-like figure for the child by myself. I have always believed in the right for all women to have a choice in terminating their pregnancy, but when I confirmed the diagnosis about a month into into it, I decided that I WAS ready to have this child.My journey has taken me to many different places fighting for women’s rights and carrying the banner of the Feminist Movement, even to the point of eschewing a career. One of the more prominent themes that I saw in these places was that men generally would look down on us, refuse to help us, or hardly even lend an ear so that we could air our grievances. This didn’t surprise me, the patriarchy has been well entrenched since the dawn of time, but here I was, here I am, ready to change it.One of the more alarming incidents happened while I was on my way to San Francisco to participate in an Occupy Wall Street rally. I sat down in my seat on the plane, which happened to be extra full for that day, and a particularly well dressed man happened to be sitting in the seat beside me, in the aisle. After takeoff, he asked me what I was going to San Francisco for, while I generally wouldn’t talk to a man sitting next to me on an airplane, I told him I was going to the OWS rally.The man literally scoffed when I spoke those words and leaned in and quietly said to me “B****** like you need to learn their place”. Stunned, I screamed “ASSAULT!” while other passengers looked at us, the woman across the aisle from him immediately told him to get away from me, but not 5 seconds passed before a flight attendant had rushed over to intervene. [sociallocker id=”86″] As I explained to the flight attendant what had happened and I demanded to move seats, I was told that there were only 2 other open seats available, both back in Economy.*Trigger warning* – Extreme patriarchyBy this time, a male flight attendant was on the scene and I told him to have the man moved. The woman-hater just laughed as the flight attendant continued to press me on if he made any physical contact with me. For a moment, I contemplated bending the truth in order to get the woman-hater away from me. His words had violated both my feelings, and my trust, perhaps as much of a violation as actual physical touch. In the end, I confirmed that no physical contact was made, to which both flight attendants told me they couldn’t make him move.I was flabbergasted, and then betrayed as they recommended that I move to one of the empty seats. This left me in tears. I knew the only way to get away was to move seats so I did so tearfully and having felt as though I had been verbally and emotionally raped.By the time we landed, my outlook had changed, I could no longer depend on men to be an ally of the cause.As spring turned into summer and my belly started to grow, my mind ran wild with the thoughts of teaching my daughter from a young age tolerance and feminist ideals. Choosing the right all-girls daycare, then elementary school, all so that she could grow up and thrive in an environment where women are told that they can do anything that they want to do. No man will be around to hurt her progress, no boys there to demean her or call her names.I had already started buying gender neutral clothing since I did not want outside influences affecting what gender she would ultimately become. My research on nannies one day came to an abrupt end when my cell phone alarm went off – time for my 5 month appointment. These early appointments had gone well enough, my baby was progressing in a healthy manner.Today, my doctor, who I will call “Sandy” did an ultrasound and everything appeared to be fine. “Would you like to know the gender?” Sandy asked. I thought to myself “That machine is an ultrasound, not a crystal ball, you couldn’t tell me the gender of my baby even if you wanted to”“Sure” was my response.“It’s a boy”…..……“What?” I managed to sputter. Sandy then showed me on the ultrasound how exactly my body had betrayed me even worse than the misogynistic suit jockey on the airplane so many months before. I was in shock, I started crying, weeping at the thought of what I was about to curse the world with.On my way home, my driver asked if I was ok and if I needed anything. “JUST STOP RIGHT HERE” I yelled. Deciding to walk the 4 blocks back home. My home became my prison and my fetus became my warden the next 48 hours. Crying, sobbing, uncontrollable weeping, mental anguish the likes of which may only be experienced by those who have had their lives destroyed by war, I was a refugee, and my home was my refugee camp, an unfamiliar place that was just….sheltering me.By the third day, I started regaining some of my mental strength and knew what I had to do. I couldn’t bring another monster into the world. We already have enough enemies as it is. It didn’t matter that I would be raising a son, he would still come into contact with boys, men, perhaps even the suit jockey who would inevitably twist his carefully constructed upbringing with their kindness. He would think “These men aren’t so bad, why would mom say that they are holding me down?”Not all men are bad, my driver showed genuine concern for my well-being that day and I may have taken my anger out on him. That may have been uncalled for. But I knew what I had to do.A few days later, I went in for the procedure, as it was fairly later in my pregnancy, I was aware there were certain risks, but it went off without a hitch. My body’s betrayal was no more, I was free, and for the first time since the airplane incident, I felt strong. I had done something positive, something that would actually make a difference, something good, even though as I would find out, many others wouldn’t see it that way.Today, I have a beautiful 1 year old female who will hopefully grow up to be just as strong and driven as her mother. I have endured a lot regarding my first pregnancy, but I don’t care. Sometimes, even allies will turn on you, but I don’t care.I stand by my decision to abort my baby because it was a male.I don’t hate men, I hate the patriarchy, what men, and even some women, turn into, I wasn’t going to let that happen with my offspring. The chances were greater that it would with a male, it was unacceptable.If the curse returns, I would do the exact same thing all over again.[/sociallocker]30 thoughts on “I Aborted My Baby – Because it was a Boy”My internet name says:TL:DR womans meets an asshole on a plane, who happens to be a man, falsely claims assault and 5 MONTHS aborts a boy because it’s a boy EVEN THOUGH she made a point of raising her girl gender neutral.Dave Spiller says:Doesn’t all-girl daycare and schooling just reinforce the gender divide, telling boys and girls they are defined by their sex?Totally says:No no no, this is gender equality did you even read the tags. It’s all good, all good.Sammy says:January 17, 2015 at 10:11 amThis is not meant to be hateful or condescending so please please read this. I feel like you’re taking the wrong mentality with this. Part of how we change society is by teaching our children. If your child is a boy, you can help change society by teaching him that misogyny is wrong and to treat women with respect and equality. He would then, in turn pass that on to his children, and so on, and so forth. I’m not saying a girl doesn’t also have the power to change things for the better but when the issue lies with the way men think, you had a chance to bring a respectful male into the world who would then be helping to pass on that mentality. I support a woman’s right to an abortion because there are several reasons why it might be necessary. Be it an inability to care for the child, the woman’s life being in danger, or an unwanted pregnancy due to rape, just to name a few. However I feel the gender of your child is not a valid reason as it’s extremely superficial and even somewhat hypocritical, especially when gender is a social construct anyway. Nothing can be changed and what you’ve done cannot be taken back so I won’t dwell on it and berate you for it but I do sincerely hope that if you ever have any more children, please give them all an equal chance, regardless of gender. If the child is a boy, use it as an opportunity to teach them what’s right so they can pass it down. If the child is a girl, then teach them to be strong like you currently are with your daughter. The gender of your child should never matter and by being selective, all you’re doing is supporting inequality in either gender.Disa says:January 27, 2015 at 10:33 amAGREED! Doesn’t matter the gender of your child, it is your child so you get to teach them what you think is right and they will pick that up and teach it to more people, male or female. Boy children are not born with any hatred for women. They are born with compassion and love for their mother and or other caretaker. Their mother, father, or other caretakers are who teach the child who to hate, not their assigned gender.Ashish says:’’Teach them to be strong like you currently are’’….Sabrina Parnas says:January 17, 2015 at 12:42 pmYou are a sick and twisted individual. A man hater like no other. Having a young child that is male, it makes me think that you could just abort it because it was a boy. You don’t deserve to have children if you discriminate based on their sex. You are no worse than all the men who are misogynist.Although I am very much pro choice, I find your reasoning flawed and disturbing. I hope you won’t damage your child with your vitriol.And where is the gender equality, if you are ready to abort at the first sign that it is a boy.Michael G says:January 17, 2015 at 2:39 pmYour loss. Your son would have loved you with all his heart. You would have been the most beautiful woman in the world to him. You would have been the most important person in his life forever.You won’t know the caring, loving man he could have been. You won’t know how great men can be…how great your son could have been. Your loss.Paul says:January 29, 2015 at 4:50 pmWhy is his value defined in terms of what he could do for her? He has value just because he’s human. I think the greater loss is his but I dread to think what his life would have been like with a mother like that.Yeah I'm going to remain anonymous... says:This almost made me cry I’m a sucker for words of sadness…but so trueCorey says:You are not a Feminist. You are a misandrist, plain and simple.Jen says:that’s the most immature thing done by a sane adult.unborn says:You clearly have no idea what assault is.Ted says:January 25, 2015 at 6:37 pmWhile I find the choice horrendous, I can’t fault the logic involved. If abortion is truly a woman’s choice, then what business is it of ours to question the reasons behind her choice? As I see it, there are only two possibilities*:A fetus is a meaningless bundle of tissue, without whatever makes life worthy of protection.or:A fetus is a human being.If the first is true, then what difference does it make why she had the abortion? It was a lifeless ball of inanimate matter. It was no more legally or morally wrong than choosing to play checkers, or choosing not to. And if the second is true, again, why should it matter? Aborting for ANY reason would be murder. (health reasons may leave no alternative, but the result is still a purposefully dead child) In either case, the reasoning behind the decision to abort is irrelevant. The only question is whether the concept of abortion (for non-health reasons) is morally defensible.*Of course, it’s entirely possible that a fetus is both, starting as lifeless, then becoming human at some point. In that case, no one knows when that transition occurs, leaving us again with only the above two choices.Joe Wilson says:That was disturbing and sad.scott not scared to use my real name mother fucking rodger says:I dont even have words.Ravi says:Um…not clear on how a fetus can be called a ‘boy.’ It could easily have been a trans girl, gay boy or non-binary person. It would certainly have been a feminist.Yeah I'm going to remain anonymous... says:She said, “I don’t see how she would know the gender- it’s an ultrasound, not a crystal ball” and ur rightTenny Mucho says:So, what was a wealthy person who flies first class and has a chauffeur doing going to an OWS rally?Me_Love_You_Long_Time says:Speaking truth to power, of course.Eline Piepo says:January 29, 2015 at 2:54 amQuestion for Lana (the mother): What are you going to tell your little girl, when she finds out that she’s actually only alive because mommy couldn’t stomach raising a boy? Don’t you think that’s going to produce a dent in her self-confidence, and maybe even her attitude towards feminism?calam says:January 29, 2015 at 3:08 amI am shocked and disgusted at this. YOU my dear are not a feminist, aborting your child because it’s a boy :-0.. The anger that fills me right now can not be put into words. Women like you give the rest of us who are feminists an awful name.I have a son, I adore him and he’s my world. . My husband is an amazing caring smart guy whom i hope my son takes after and we’ll do our best to help him grown into a wonder man.All I see from this is hatred of men instead of thinking you could have helped bring a wonderful man into the world you chose to KILL him. . It’s heartbreaking.I’m not against abortion for the RIGHT reasons.. Medical or rape but because it’s the wrong gender??????.Feminist you are not! And I as one am ashamed of youwhy says:Love how you delete hateful comments so much for freedom of speech.Bombe 20 says:January 29, 2015 at 4:20 pmLet me start by saying this: I totally respect and support the right of every woman to decide whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term. For any reason at all. A pregnancy has all sorts of effects on the body (and the mind) and while I find the slogan “my body, my choice” a bit too slogan-ish, I consider it basically correct.Now, I do think it is too late for an abortion once the fetus could be kept alive outside the womb, but that is a different discussion.But I have just had a look into my crystal ball and learned a few interesting about your daughter:In one to two years, she will find out that she has a sex — that she is a girl. And she will strongly defend that. She will love Arielle and Barbie and all things pink. She will want to be a princess for Halloween.Maybe you will try to push her in a different direction. You will give her a toy car. She will cuddle it, give it a name and put it to bed. Then you will give her a toy plane. She will make sure the plane becomes friends with the car and put them to bed together. You will give her toy tools. She will use the hammer as a baby bottle to feed the plane and the car. And she’ll still like pink.Sure, you will try to reason with her, argue with her, maybe shout at her. But that won’t change anything. At the most, she will learn not to talk about what she likes because it upsets mommy; in that case, you will not have liberated her, you will have broken her.Eventually she will learn what you did. That you betrayed her out of having an elder brother. An elder brother who would have loved her, cherished her, protected her. Maybe you will be able to outwardly convince her that your decision and your reasons were right. But deep inside she will despise you.And somewhere around 13 to 16 years of age she will start to rebel. On whatever the internet looks like then, she will find intelligent, thoughful and outspoken women like Erin Pizzey, Karen Staughan and the rest of the Honey Badgers. She will listen to what they have to say, see that it has merit and she will think of what you did to her brother.And she will become a vocal Men’s Human Rights Activist. You will have raised the next leader of the MHRM. Just by being who you are, doing what you do.Like making light of a horrendous crime. A man on a plane says something mean to you and you have the gall to claim you feel like you had been raped? Can you even imagine how reading such a sentence must feel to an actual victim of rape?But maybe you do. Everything that you write makes it very clear that you are harboring some kind of trauma. Maybe something really bad happened to you at some point in your life, maybe you even inherited it from your parents.But one thing is very clear: Joining a hateful ideology is not a healthy and productive way to process trauma. Therapy is.B20January 29, 2015 at 8:42 pmWhat the author is describing, frankly, is full-on, cold-blooded, willful, premeditated murder, and a hate crime against that. Misandry doesn’t begin to cover it. Whatever wrongs you may have suffered in your life, you had no right take it out on your child like that. That’s flat-out inhuman. And yes, you earned every bit of derision and disgust expressed in these comments.Duffy says:January 29, 2015 at 9:13 pm“One of the more alarming incidents happened while I was on my way to San Francisco to participate in an Occupy Wall Street rally.” “……and I demanded to move seats, I was told that there were only 2 other open seats available, both back in Economy.”*Trigger warning* – Extreme Sense of entitlement coupled with a shocking lack of self awareness.Noneya says:January 29, 2015 at 10:36 pmThere is no love that is like the love a son feels for his mother. From infancy, tiny hands clutching helplessly, embracing the loving warmth of his mother’s touch, to the childhood years of bumps and bruises and the tender healing love that only a mother provides.And you threw that all away. There are no going back. When you are lying down at night in bed, cold and alone, maybe then you’ll feel consequence. When your bed is a few degrees colder, and the spot next to you is empty and barren, where someone with absolute love and adoration could have been, nestled lovingly against you.

http://www.emergent.info/McDondalds-pizza-still-being+served	Claim: Two locations in the U.S. are still serving the original McDonald's pizza	false	"[""McDonald's"", 'McPizza', 'Ohio', 'Pizza', 'West Virginia']"	http://o.canada.com/	http://o.canada.com/life/food-drink/attention-children-of-the-90s-you-can-still-get-mcdonalds-pizza	2015/01/29	Remember the crunch of the cornmeal crust? And the stringy cheese, with a slightly sweeter-than normal marinara underneath? Maybe you shoved french fries in it like birthday candles. Or ate it crust first, as was the style at the time. In any case, if you’re a child of the nineties, you remember it well: McDonald’s pizza. And, like pogs and Beanie Babies, it too disappeared with the innocence of your childhood. Except, in two magical locations in Ohio and West Virginia, where one hero owner has kept the McDonald’s pizza ovens burning all these years later. So bust out a gel pen to jot down these directions, because I’m about to tell you where you can still buy McDonald’s pizza. Neslted on the banks of the Ohio River, along the border with West Virginia sits the village of Pomeroy, population 1,852 in the 2010 census. And its McDonald’s, located along Main Street on the riverbank, still pumps out pizza — in five minutes or less, of course. It’s just a seven-and-a-half hour drive from Toronto in zero traffic, according to Google Maps. And, thanks to owner Greg Mills, there’s another McD’s where you can still get a slice, just over ninety kilometres away, across the state border. Spencer, West Virginia also boasts a McDonald’s that’s still lighting the pizza fires — or electrical coils, as the case may be. According to employee Judy Norman, it’s the same pizza as they sold when she started there 11 years ago and it’s presumably the same that children everywhere enjoyed throughout the 1990s. Mills, who it’s pretty safe to call an American hero for preserving this very unique pizza, couldn’t not be immediately reached for comment, but this post will be updated should he return our calls. Whatever actually happened to McDonald’s pizza, you ask? Well, for starters, it turned out adult palates didn’t quite take to it the same way kids did. When McDonald’s first launched its pizza in the Canadian market in the early ’90s, it was tapping into a growing appetite for pizza as burger sales dwindled. It even launched hockey-themed TV ads. The market for the savoury pie topped $2 billion in the early 90s, according to a 2004 National Post article on the death of McDonald’s pizza. And the company poured $25 million into the ovens alone across Canada, to moderate success throughout the decade. Then the-drive through took over — remember waiting for your pizza to be delivered with a plastic number on top of your car? — and pizza slowed things down as its own sales were dragging. So the ovens were scrapped and McDonald’s turned its sights on other gimmicky productions — like the Arch Deluxe, which I think we can blame for Jessica Biel becoming a thing. McPizza we all remember. Unfortunately, McDonald’s headquarters says it’s not the exact recipe, but it’s also reviewed online as being very close. So, the only way to sure is a road trip followed by a taste test. Canada.com will surely keep you abreast if we ever get around to doing that.	2015/01/20
http://www.emergent.info/Texas-Sharia-law	Claim: A jurisdiction of Texas is now under Sharia law	false	['Dallas', 'Sharia Law', 'Texas']	http://www.breitbart.com/	http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2015/01/27/hold-islamic-tribunal-confirmed-in-texas-its-voluntary-says-attorney/	2015/01/29	Islamic Tribunal Confirmed in Texas; Attorney Claims ‘It’s Voluntary’Islamic Tribunal Website27 Jan 2015An Islamic Tribunal using Sharia law in Texas has been confirmed by Breitbart Texas. The tribunal is operating as a non-profit organization in Dallas. One of the attorneys for the tribunal said participation and acceptance of the tribunal’s decisions are “voluntary.”Breitbart Texas spoke with one of the “judges,” Dr. Taher El-badawi. He said the tribunal operates under Sharia law as a form of “non-binding dispute resolution.” El-badawi said their organization is “a tribunal, not arbitration.” A tribunal is defined by Meriam-Webster’s Dictionary as “a court or forum of justice.” The four Islamic attorneys call themselves “judges” not “arbitrators.”El-badawi said the tribunal follows Sharia law to resolve civil disputes in family and business matters. He said they also resolve workplace disputes.In matters of divorce, El-badawi said that “while participation in the tribunal is voluntary, a married couple cannot be considered divorced by the Islamic community unless it is granted by the tribunal.” He compared their divorce, known as “Talaq,” as something similar to the Catholic practice of annulment in that the church does not recognize civil divorce proceedings as ending a marriage.He also said there is a difference between how a man and a woman can request a divorce under their system. “The husband can request the divorce directly from the tribunal,” El-badawi stated. “The wife must go to an Imam who will request the divorce for her.” He called it “two paths to the same result.” The practice of Khula is the process where a wife can initiate a divorce proceeding and where the husband can agree to the divorce in exchange for a financial compensation. It appears the wife must agree to give up any claim to the “dower” that was not already paid or to return it if it has already been paid. Once the financial issues are resolved the husband can then proclaim the Talaq (divorce).El-badawi said they follow Texas family law when it comes to child support, visitation, and custody. He said that in most cases, custody of children is awarded to the mother.Breitbart Texas asked what happens when there is a conflict between Sharia law and Texas law. El-badawi said most of the time, the laws are in agreement. When pushed further he admitted that, “we follow Sharia law.” However, he explained, “If the parties are not satisfied with the tribunal’s decision, they do not have to accept it and they can take the matter to Texas civil courts.” He did not say what the social ramifications of rejecting the “judge’s” decision would be.The website for the Islamic Tribunal states, “The courts of the United States of America are costly and consist of ineffective lawyers. Discontent with the legal system leads many Muslims in America to postpone justice in this world and opt for an audience on the Day of Judgment.”It goes on to state, “It is with this issue that Muslims here in America are obligated to find a way to solve conflicts and disputes according to the principles of Islamic Law and its legal heritage of fairness and justice in a manner that is reasonable and cost effective.”In explaining Sharia law, the website states, “Stoning adulterers, cutting of the hands, polyandry and the like (all can be traced in the relevant literature and can be explained in their Islamic legal mentality and rational context in fairness and justice), are mainly a part of Islamic Criminal Law. In fact criminal law within Islam only makes up a fraction of the Shari’ah. It is unscholarly and unfair to generalize that type of understanding, that is Criminal Law, to compromise the whole of Islamic law if we stick to speaking in technical terms.”The website lists four “ judges :” Imam Yusuf Z.Kavakci, Imam Moujahed Bakhach, Imam Zia ul Haque Sheikh and Dr. El-badawi. It states the Islamic Tribunal resolves business disputes, divorce (Talaq) cases, community problems, serious family problems, and Khula.El-badawi restated several times that participation in the tribunal is voluntary. However, he would not discuss what happens to someone who did not follow their rulings.Bob Price is a senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas and a member of the original Breitbart Texas team.

http://www.emergent.info/bruno-mars-michel-jackson-son-hoax	Claim: A DNA test proved that Bruno Mars is Michael Jackson's son	false	['Bruno Mars', 'Celebrity Deaths', 'Fake News', 'Hoaxes']	http://empirenews.net/	http://empirenews.net/dna-results-confirm-michael-jackson-is-biological-father-of-bruno-mars/	2015/01/05	| Tweet | Like 0NEW YORK, New York Vladimir Kershov, publicist of R&B singer Bruno Mars, has been fired today after he revealed a shocking secret regarding the pop and R&B singer. Kershov leaked private information that revealed that Michael Jackson is Mars biological father.In a statement emailed to news and media outlets across the world, Kershov revealed that he was told by the singer that DNA testing had proven that Jackson, known across the world as the King of Pop, was without a doubt his biological father. After pleading with Mars, born under the name Peter Hernandez, to go public with the revelation, Mars refused to do so. Kershov insisted that it be made known to the public, and that the news would catapult the singers fame and boost record sales. Mars remained adamant that the information not be released. According to Kershov, he then took it upon himself and emailed the shocking news to media sources all over the world.DNA testing has proven that Michael Jackson is the biological father of Bruno Mars, Kershov said in the statement. Against his wishes, I have decided to relay this message for the greater good and betterment of Brunos life and extravagant music career.In a statement released by Mars new publicist, Jacqueline Pryor, it has been announced that Kershov was immediately fired by the singer, and may seek legal action against his former publicist. The job of a publicist is indeed to better the career of their clients by persuading them to take part in things that cause their popularity to grow, however, the client must trust their publicist. The artist has the final say, no matter what.When asked about the validity of Kershovs statement, Pryor surprisingly made it clear that the information is accurate. It is true. Doesnt mean he was right in saying so, but it is true. When it comes to 29-year-old Bruno Mars, Michael Jackson is the father!|Tweet|Like0Whats Popular NowMan Charged With Drug Offenses Because $324K Smelt Like CocaineVegan Baby Shoes Show Off Love for AnimalsHaunted House AdventurePowerball Ticket Sold In Massachusetts Wins Record $758.7 MillionRailbookers Takes You on Worlds Most Scenic Train JourneysGuy Gets Ultimate Revenge On High School Bully 20 Years LaterJennifer Aniston: Should Rachel Have Ended Up With Joey?Netflixs Altered Carbon Is a Sci-Fi RollercoasterYoutubers Seeing Red After Recent Policy Changes?These content links are provided by Content.ad.

http://www.emergent.info/sons-of-anarchy-movie	Claim: There will be a Sons of Anarchy film	false	['Sons of Anarchy', 'TV']	http://empirenews.net/	http://empirenews.net/kurt-sutter-announces-plans-for-sons-of-anarchy-movie-starring-charlie-hunnam-brad-pitt/	2014/12/24	| Tweet | Like 0NORTH HOLLYWOOD, California Kurt Sutter, creator of the hit FX drama Sons of Anarchy, has announced plans to turn the popular television series into a major motion picture.Sutter, who was also a writer, producer, and director on the series, said in an interview with Hollywood Today magazine that he has long contemplated taking S.O.A. to the big screen following its run on television. People absolutely loved the show, as did I, and I have put a lot of thought into the matter, and we are going forward with turning it into a feature film Sutter said.Sons of Anarchy ran for seven seasons on FX, from 2008-2014, and in the process built a huge following. Sutter said the film will star Charlie Hunnam, who played the lead character Jax Teller, as well as Ryan Hurst who played Opie Winston, and Katey Sagal as Gemma Teller. The film, which is a prequel to the storyline of Sons will also introduce fans to Jaxs father, John, who will be played by Brad Pitt.I am most excited about bringing Brad (Pitt) on as John Teller, he is absolutely perfect for the role. The movie will take place from the day Jax was born, and leads up to the era just before Sons Of Anarchy began as a series.Sutter also said that he is really happy to bring Ryan Hurst back as Opie Winston, and hopes fans will forgive him for killing Opie off. Man I tell ya, when we killed Opie off, it was like the thing turned real. Ive never gone public with this, but Ive had people get really crazy when they see me in public, said Sutter. They shout at me, and they get angry You shouldnt have killed Ope! I hope you rot in Hell!, that sort of thing. I had people try to run me off the road when they recognized me, although that just might be because Im kind of a dangerous driver. Anyway, my hope is that this film will help them cope.Sutter says pre-production on film will begin in the middle of 2015, and will begin shooting sometime in the fall. For a movie of this scope, with this much storyline attached, you should expect to see the film by the end of 2016, said Sutter. In the mean time, buy all the official Sons of Anarchy merchandise you can. Every dollar goes to helping get this movie completed. Brad Pitt isnt cheap, you know. |Tweet|Like0Whats Popular NowVegan Baby Shoes Show Off Love for AnimalsRailbookers Takes You on Worlds Most Scenic Train JourneysJennifer Aniston: Should Rachel Have Ended Up With Joey?Haunted House AdventurePowerball Ticket Sold In Massachusetts Wins Record $758.7 MillionGuy Gets Ultimate Revenge On High School Bully 20 Years LaterNetflixs Altered Carbon Is a Sci-Fi RollercoasterMan Charged With Drug Offenses Because $324K Smelt Like CocaineYoutubers Seeing Red After Recent Policy Changes?These content links are provided by Content.ad.

Our intent is to have a cleaner menu board that is easier for customers to absorb, spokeswoman Lisa McComb said in a statement. To do so we must simplify our current menu.This means the end of the Big Mac, apple pie and large size menu items. Currently, the Big Mac has a whopping 550 calories and 29g of fat. The Apple pie contains 250 cal, and it would take a full 69 minute to walk that off! With that being said, those two menu items were not a tough decision for elimination.McDonalds is currently testing out a new version of their slim down menu in Delaware, Little Rock, Waco, Bakersfield, Macon and Knoxville. They plan a full nationwide rollout beginning February 1, 2015.One notable ingredient preservatives might also be eliminated from the menu altogether. Mark Andres, President of McDonalds USA, sparked widespread speculation when he asked investors, Why do we need to have preservatives in our food? And then answered himself with a We probably dont.What do you think about this new menu transformation at McDonalds? In an attempt to make America healthier, do you think it will work?CLICK HERE > To FOLLOW us on TWITTERCLICK HERE > TO LIKE DAILY BUZZ LIVE ON FACEBOOK!Sharing is

http://www.emergent.info/hackers-thank-sony-for-pulling-film	"Claim: The group behind the Sony hack sent a message to company execs praising their decision to pull ""The Interview"""	unverified	['Sony', 'The Interview']	http://money.cnn.com/	http://money.cnn.com/2014/12/19/media/insde-sony-hack-interview/index.html	2014/12/19	"Hackers to Sony: We'll stand down if you never release the movieby Brian Stelter @brianstelter December 19, 2014: 2:50 PM ETHackers claim they're done if film never airsThe hackers behind a devastating cyberattack at Sony Pictures have sent a new message to executives at the company, crediting them for a ""very wise"" decision to cancel the Christmas day release of ""The Interview,"" a source close to the company told CNN.The email message was received by Sony's top executives on Thursday night and was obtained by CNN.The source said that the company believes the email was from the hackers because it followed a pattern of previous messages, sent to a list of particular executives and formatted in a particular way.A Sony spokesman declined to comment.Also on Friday, President Obama said he disagreed with Sony's decision.""I am sympathetic to the concerns that they face. Having said all that, yes I think they made a mistake,"" Obama said at a White House press conference.""We cannot have a society where some dictator someplace can impose censorship here in the U.S.,"" he added.Obama: Sony made a 'mistake'Related: FBI: North Korea responsible for Sony hackThe FBI has officially linked the cyberattack at Sony to the North Korean government.""The destructive nature of this attack, coupled with its coercive nature, sets it apart,"" the FBI said in a statement.The Motion Picture Association of America called the hack a ""despicable, criminal act"" on Friday.""This situation is larger than a movie's release or the contents of someone's private emails,"" said Chris Dodd, CEO of the lobbying group. ""This is about the fact that criminals were able to hack in and steal what has now been identified as many times the volume of all of the printed material in the Library of Congress.""The hacker message is effectively a victory lap, telling the studio, ""Now we want you never let the movie released, distributed or leaked in any form of, for instance, DVD or piracy.""The message also says, ""And we want everything related to the movie, including its trailers, as well as its full version down from any website hosting them immediately.""It warns the studio executives that ""we still have your private and sensitive data"" and claims that they will ""ensure the security of your data unless you make additional trouble.""The email was titled ""Message from GOP."" The anonymous hackers have called themselves ""Guardians of Peace.""Sony is still reeling from the late November cyberattack that crippled its computer systems, and now it is under severe scrutiny for canceling the Christmas release of ""The Interview,"" Seth Rogen and James Franco's comedy about an attempted assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.U.S. officials now believe North Korea instigated the hack , lending credence to the Sony executives who privately started calling it a ""terrorist act"" weeks ago.Since the cancellation on Wednesday, the same executives have been wondering whether the leaks of private emails and corporate documents would now stop.Thursday night's message implied that the leaks will stop.In a statement on Wednesday when the film's release was scrapped, the company said ""we stand by our filmmakers and their right to free expression and are extremely disappointed by this outcome.""Many lashed out at the studio for its unprecedented decision to pull the movie. Others have rallied around Sony's predicament.George Clooney, in an interview with Deadline.com on Thursday, revealed that he had circulated a petition earlier in the week saying ""we fully support Sony's decision not to submit to these hackers' demands"" -- but no one was willing to sign it.""It was a large number of people. It was sent to basically the heads of every place,"" Clooney said without naming names.The petition said, ""This is not just an attack on Sony. It involves every studio, every network, every business and every individual in this country,"" and it concluded, ""We hope these hackers are brought to justice but until they are, we will not stand in fear. We will stand together.""It's outdated now, since Sony did cancel ""The Interview."" In the interview, Clooney expressed sadness that ""as we watched one group be completely vilified, nobody stood up.""CNNMoney (New York) First published December 19, 2014: 10:12 AM ET"	2014/12/19

http://www.emergent.info/seth-rogen-woz	Claim: Seth Rogen will play Steve Wozniak in a film about Steve Jobs	true	['Apple', 'Seth Rogen', 'Steve Jobs']	http://variety.com/	http://variety.com/2014/film/news/seth-rogen-steve-wozniak-steve-jobs-biopic-1201338038/	2014/10/31	Seth Rogen has been set to star as Steve Wozniak opposite Christian Bale in Sony’s Steve Jobs biopic, sources confirm. Variety reported on Oct. 15 that Bale was in talks to star in “Jobs,” Sony’s biopic about the late Apple co-founder. Writer Aaron Sorkin recently confirmed the Bale casting. Jessica Chastain is being eyed for an unspecified role. Based on Walter Isaacson’s biography “Steve Jobs,” the real-life drama is directed by Oscar-winner Danny Boyle. Scott Rudin is producing the tech drama along with Mark Gordon and Guymon Casady. Sorkin, who also penned the Facebook drama “The Social Network,” has publicly said the movie will be divided into three long scenes, each taking place backstage before one of Apple’s famous product launches. Sony acquired rights following the Apple mogul’s death in 2011. Wozniak founded Apple with Jobs and Ronald Wayne and is credited with launching the Apple I and Apple II computers in the late 1970s, which had a profound impact on the microcomputer revolution. He left Apple as a full-time employee in 1987. Last year’s independently financed “Jobs” starred Ashton Kutcher as Jobs and Josh Gad as Wozniak and covered the era from 1974 to 2001 when the iPod launched. Worldwide box office was modest at $36 million. He is represented by UTA, Principal Entertainment LA and attorney Fred Toczek.	2014/10/30

http://www.emergent.info/robot-security-guards-microsoft	Claim: Robot security guards are patrolling a Microsoft campus in Silicon Valley	false	['Microsoft', 'Robots']	http://www.extremetech.com/	http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/194338-here-come-the-autonomous-robot-security-guards-what-could-possibly-go-wrong	2014/11/25	Here come the autonomous robot security guards: What could possibly go wrong?Here come the autonomous robot security guards: What could possibly go wrong?By Sebastian Anthony on November 17, 2014 at 8:58 amCommentThis site may earn affiliate commissions from the links on this page. Terms of use .Showing a rather shocking disregard for the long-term safety of human civilization, Microsoft has become one of the first companies to deploy autonomous robot security guards. Dubbed the K5, Microsoft’s Silicon Valley campus was being policed last week by five of these roughly human-sized 300-pound (136 kg) robots, each equipped with enough cameras, sensors, artificial intelligence, and alarms that they can replace most human security patrols. Fortunately, despite looking like uncomfortably like a Dalek from the Doctor Who universe, the K5 is not (yet) equipped with a ray gun or any other method for harming or detaining humans.Updated: Microsoft contacted ExtremeTech to tell us that the robots were only temporarily deployed at its Silicon Valley campus, as part of a demonstration put on by Knightscope. Microsoft PR says it isn’t “aware of any future plans” to deploy such robots.The K5 , built by the Californian company Knightscope, is billed rather euphemistically as an “autonomous data machine” that provides a “commanding but friendly physical presence.” Basically, it’s a security guard on wheels. Inside that rather large casing (it’s 5 foot tall!) there are four high-def cameras facing in each direction, another camera that can do car license plate recognition, four microphones, gentle alarms, blaring sirens, weather sensors, and WiFi connectivity so that each robot can contact HQ if there’s some kind of security breach/situation. For navigating the environment, there’s GPS and “laser scanning” ( LIDAR I guess). And of course, at the heart of each K5 is a computer running artificial intelligence software that integrates all of that data and tries to make intelligent inferences — like, should I tell HQ about that large gathering of teenagers, or should that man be climbing in through that window?K5 security robot. The lights can change color (red for trouble, orange for caution, etc.)If a K5 decides that there’s a situation, it can use one of its built-in sirens to try and diffuse things — or it can message HQ to summon a human. If you step in front of the K5, or otherwise interfere with it, it will gently warn you with some chimes — but if you don’t move, an “ear-piercing alarm” is triggered . Other than its sirens and its rather imposing design, the K5 isn’t equipped with any weapons or other tools for resolving situations. (Does anyone else think it looks like the lovechild of a Dalek and EVE from WALL-E?)A slightly odd photo of a US sheriff holding a gun to the head of a K5 robotK5 isn’t just for catching criminals, either: If you find yourself in trouble/danger, there’s also a button on the top of the robot that summons help from HQ.Read: Microsoft wants to be part of Judgment Day, tooThe purpose of the K5, like most robots, is straightforward: To replace expensive human workers. The K5 can run for around 24 hours on a single battery charge, automatically navigates back to the charging point when it’s running low, and only takes 15-20 minutes to recharge. Obviously, in the long run, this is cheaper and more efficient than a human security guard — plus, as technology improves, the K5 will probably be more vigilant and capable of spotting smaller discrepancies than a human. In theory, because of the lower cost, you could also field lots of K5 robots, reducing the number of potential holes in security coverage.It goes without saying, though, that deploying a fleet of roughly human-sized, autonomous robots is just a little bit scary. At the very least, a 300-pound robot would cause a lot of damage if it ran into something — a car, a shop window, a child. In all likelihood, though, if these robotic security guards are popular, they’ll eventually be equipped with weapons — perhaps a taser for subduing a suspect, and a tear gas launcher for clearing groups of people. At that point, you need to be really sure that the AI is free of bugs.	2014/11/17

The infestation is so acute, one source said, that the fashion title’s editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, recently issued a standing order: Staffers must ensure that her personal office is rat-free before she enters it. (If you have any other details, do get in touch .)Update (3:05 p.m.): Another source with knowledge of the rat situation writes in:Sales/marketing is already in but editorial was supposed to move in Monday and they’re figuring out today if they’re pushing that back due to the infestation. A serious concern (laughable but I guess it makes sense) is all the clothing that could get nibbled through.The rodent invasion is particularly noteworthy given how much the magazine has been advertising its new digs on various social media channels, particularly Instagram :Here’s what Anna Wintour’s office looks like:Condé Nast did not immediately return a request for comment.Update (5:45 p.m.): Condé Nast has still not returned a request for comment.If you know more, send an email to trotter@gawker.com or hop in below.Photo credit: Associated Press	2017/12/10

http://www.emergent.info/Planetary-alignment-weightlessness-hoax	Claim: A unique planetary alignment on Jan. 4, 2015 will cause partial weightlessness on earth	false	['Daily Buzz Live', 'Fake News', 'Hoaxes', 'Science']	http://dailybuzzlive.com/	http://dailybuzzlive.com/planetary-alignment-jan-4-2015-will-decrease-gravity-5-minutes-partial-weightlessness/	2014/12/29	"Sharing is caring!0Tweet924kShare0Share149Pin0Mail0SharePlanetary Alignment On Jan 4, 2015 Will Decrease Gravity For 5 Minutes Causing Partial Weightlessness.Strange natural occurrences are happening in the world today. But nothing more magnificent than the one you will experience on January 4, 2015.According to British astronomer Patrick Moore, at exactly 9:47 PST AM on January 4th, Pluto will pass directly behind Jupiter, in relation to Earth. This rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull, temporarily counteracting the Earths own gravity and making people virtually weightless. Moore calls this the Jovian-Plutonian Gravitational Effect.Moore told scientists that they could experience the phenomenon by jumping in the air at the precise moment the alignment occurred. If they do so, he promised, they would experience a strange floating sensation.Astronomers have long been aware that there would be an alignment of the planets on that date, when Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto would be on the same side of the sun, within an arc 95 wide. But now they are guaranteeing the occurrence as the gravitational effect of the other planets on the Earths crust is maximum even at their closest approach.But dont get too excited. If you think youll be able to float around your house, youre wrong. But, if you jump in the air at 9:47 AM PST, on January 4, 2015, it should take you about 3 seconds to land back on your feet instead of the usual 0.2 seconds.So, mark this date on your calendar and share it with your friends!

http://www.emergent.info/former-seal-attacked-by-gang-hoax	Claim: Robert O’Neill, the former SEAL who claims to have shot Bin Laden, was attacked in his home by members of a street gang	false	['Empire News', 'Fake News']	http://empirenews.net/	http://empirenews.net/bin-laden-shooter-rob-oneill-mistakenly-attacked-by-street-thugs-seeking-to-collect-debt-from-neighbor/	2014/12/20	| Tweet | Like 0BUTTE, Montana Robert ONeill, the former United States Navy SEAL who shot and killed Osama Bin Laden, had his home mistakenly invaded by members of a street gang this morning shortly after 1AM. ONeill was uninjured, the five intruders all suffered injuries and remain hospitalized, but are expected to make a full recovery. Their names were not released in anticipation of the oncoming media storm.Butte Police Commissioner Bartholomew S. Harrington told members of the Associated Press in a brief press conference that the five men, part of a local street gang connected with the infamous Crips, were seeking to collect on a drug debt and invaded the wrong house, with the intended target just so happening to be the next door neighbor of ONeills.Mr. ONeill had just turned in for the night, but was awoken by a loud crash when his backdoor was abruptly kicked in. As the five thugs ran aimlessly through the home, Mr. ONeill used silent hand-to-hand combat tactics to individually disarm them of their weapons. Once Mr. ONeill had taken down the five men and secured his home, he brewed a pot of coffee and called the police station. Those boys sure did find the wrong house! commissioner Harrington said as he chuckled.ONeill had little to say on the matter when Butte Daily Times journalist Kevin Williamson interviewed the celebrated war hero.It was nothing really. Those kids didnt have their mission planned out properly and hit the wrong target. I hated to break their wrists and dislocate each of their knees like I did, but it was necessary in order to immobilize the invasion. I hope they get the money that is owed to them once they get out of jail and decide to live better lives. My main concern is getting my back door fixed. Those boys really did a number on the door jamb, ONeill stated.The neighbor who was the intended target seems to have abandoned home and has not been found by police. According to the men in custody, the debt was over a $50 bag of marijuana.|Tweet|Like0Whats Popular NowRailbookers Takes You on Worlds Most Scenic Train JourneysPowerball Ticket Sold In Massachusetts Wins Record $758.7 MillionMan Charged With Drug Offenses Because $324K Smelt Like CocaineHaunted House AdventureYoutubers Seeing Red After Recent Policy ChangesGuy Gets Ultimate Revenge On High School Bully 20 Years LaterJennifer Aniston: Should Rachel Have Ended Up With Joey?Vegan Baby Shoes Show Off Love for AnimalsNetflixs Altered Carbon Is a Sci-Fi Rollercoaster?These content links are provided by Content.ad.

http://www.emergent.info/macdonalds-overweight-customers	Claim: McDonald's will stop serving overweight customers	false	"['Fake News', ""McDonald's""]"	http://dailybuzzlive.com/	http://dailybuzzlive.com/mcdonalds-will-stop-serving-overweight-customers-beginning-1115/	2014/12/19	"Sharing is caring!0Tweet151kShare0Share7Pin0Mail0ShareMcDonalds Will Stop Serving Overweight Customers Beginning 1/1/15. So how will McDonalds define overweight?Obesity rates in America have more than doubled over the last 2 decades and has become the leading public health issue in the U.S. With more than two-thirds of the adult population overweight, McDonalds has decided to become part of the obesity rate solution not the problem.According to reports, beginning January 1, 2015, McDonalds will no longer serve customers who show risks of being overweight. They will define overweight by these standards: Over 170 lbs for women and 245 lbs for men. Childrens weight restrictions will vary depending on age and height.McDonalds is currently running campaigns to shake its junk food image, insisting they sell nothing but good quality food. They are are branding themselves from A dining experience of fast food to Good food served fast. They want people to understand the risks of being overweight.So how will they know if you are overweight ? Will they ask you what you weigh and trust your answer? NOThey are implementing scales at the from of every register just like the one in the photo below. You must stand on the scale when ordering or you will not be served. They also plan on posting signs to let customers know that they have the legal Right to refuse service to anyone. For drive-thru patrons it may be a bit more difficult to enforce. However, if the person looks like they exceed the weight restrictions, they will be refused service at the drive-thru window.CLICK HERE > To FOLLOW us on TWITTERCLICK HERE > TO LIKE DAILY BUZZ LIVE ON FACEBOOK!You Might Also LikeJennifer Aniston: Should Rachel Have Ended Up With Joey?Youtubers Seeing Red After Recent Policy ChangesRailbookers Takes You on Worlds Most Scenic Train JourneysVegan Baby Shoes Show Off Love for AnimalsMan Charged With Drug Offenses Because $324K Smelt Like CocainePowerball Ticket Sold In Massachusetts Wins Record $758.7 MillionNetflixs Altered Carbon Is a Sci-Fi RollercoasterHaunted House AdventureGuy Gets Ultimate Revenge On High School Bully 20 Years Later?These content links are provided by Content.ad.

http://www.emergent.info/NSA-elf-on-shelf	Claim: Popular Christmas toy Elf On The Shelf is an espionage project run by the National Security Agency	false	['Elf On the Shelf', 'Fake News', 'Hoaxes']	http://www.duffelblog.com/	http://www.duffelblog.com/2014/12/elf-on-a-shelf-snowden/	2014/12/17	Share TweetSTOCKHOLM — Speaking via Google Hangout to officials in Sweden last week, former NSA Contractor Edward Snowden dropped a bag of coal on his former employers by revealing the hugely popular “Elf on a Shelf” trend is actually an intelligence gathering operation originating with and run by the National Security Agency.“It actually started out as a joke,” Snowden said in his speech. “Someone photocopied a picture of an elf with the caption ‘I’m watching you,’ and it just kept moving from cubicle to cubicle.”Snowden said that at some point it occurred to someone that if people as paranoid as NSA staff would play this game, what would happen with civilians?“Now, the NSA has an agent inside practically every home with a child in it,” Snowden said.“The elves have basic mobility, which isn’t a problem because when one shows up someplace unexpected,” Snowden added, “it’s just assumed to be part of the game.”Through these adorable snoops, the NSA has gained access to millions of tax returns, bank statements, and 10-year old boys unwrapping and re-wrapping their presents in the days ahead of Christmas.“We would flag those kids for later recruitment to the intelligence community,” Snowden said. “Especially for Tailored Access Operations .”In addition, the NSA has uncovered a trove of data about the personal lives of millions of Americans, sources confirmed.“The NSA has incorporated advanced sensors into these things that can uncover all kinds of information,” journalist Glenn Greenwald told Duffel Blog in an email. “They can tell things about people’s health — cancer, heart disease, liver disease. They know who’s being naughty, and who’s being really naughty, things that even extensive online snooping couldn’t provide. Dildos, vibrators, chains — all the things stashed in closets and under beds.”Sources told reporters these were previously inaccessible to the government’s leading intelligence agency, if the owners paid cash at least.“If you want to know why the ‘privacy advocates’ have settled down, and moved on? My guess is, blackmail. These elves have accumulated petabytes of evidence against pretty much everybody,” Snowden said.“You wouldn’t believe what perverse things people will do to each other, right in front of these things,” Snowden concluded. “It’s why ‘ElfMonitor’ is such a highly sought after duty assignment.”Recommended For You:	2014/12/15
http://www.emergent.info/19-million-watches-in-2015	Claim: Apple will sell 19 million Apple Watches in 2015	unverified	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Sales', 'BMO Capital Markets', 'Keith Bachman']	http://appleinsider.com/	http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/03/06/bmo-forecasts-19m-apple-watch-sales-in-2015-with-more-than-half-selling-in-holiday-season	2015/03/06	"By Neil HughesFriday, March 06, 2015, 05:45 am PT (08:45 am ET)Momentum for the Apple Watch will likely take a short time to build driven mostly by apps, one analyst believes, with sales quickly escalating to 10 million units in the holiday 2015 shopping season.Keith Bachman of BMO Capital Markets believe Apple will sell 19 million Apple Watch units in calendar year 2015, with more than half of those being sold in the December quarter. His prediction was issued in a new note to investors this week, a copy of which was provided to AppleInsider.Bachman is bullish on the Apple Watch, but he believes it will take some time for applications to be built that will truly sell the public on the upcoming wrist-worn device.His estimates suggest there will be an installed base of more than 484 million iPhone users as of December 2015. Sales of 19 million Apple Watch units would equate to 3.9 percent of the total user base.For fiscal year 2016, Bachman believes Apple will sell 36.5 million of the Apple Watch, growing to 10.9 percent of iPhone users by September of 2016.Bachman's confidence in the Apple Watch comes despite the fact that there is still much not known about the wearable. In particular, he's especially curious to find out final pricing, application availability, and battery life.Regarding the high-end price point, BMO's analyst isn't concerned if the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition sells for more than $10,000. He suspects Apple will sell very few units at that price, as most high-end watch consumers will opt for a brand like Rolex that can stand the test of time.Bachman also isn't concerned about suspected battery life of around 24 hours. He noted that most consumers have become accustomed to recharging their iPhone at night by their bedside, and he expects Apple Watch users will do the same.BMO has maintained its price target of $135 for shares of AAPL, along with an ""outperform"" rating.Topics:"	2015/03/06

http://www.emergent.info/apple-tv-hbo-now	Claim: HBO Now streaming subscription is coming to Apple TV	true	['Apple TV', 'HBO', 'International Business Times', 'Michael Learmonth']	http://www.ibtimes.com/	http://www.ibtimes.com/hbo-talks-apple-be-launch-partner-coming-web-service-hbo-now-exclusive-1835882	2015/03/04	"By Michael Learmonth @learmonth03/04/15 AT 2:28 PMGeorge R.R. Martin teased that some of the characters still alive in the books will die in ""Game of Thrones"" Season 5. Photo: Facebook/Game of ThronesHBO is in talks with Apple to make Apple TV a launch partner for its highly anticipated streaming service when it debuts next month. HBO and streaming partner Major League Baseball Advanced Media are working to have the standalone service, called “HBO Now,” ready to launch in April in conjunction with the premiere of the fifth season of “Game of Thrones,” according to sources familiar with the plan.When it launches, consumers will be able to subscribe to HBO Now directly from HBO for the first time, rather than through a cable, satellite or telco TV distributor such as Comcast or Verizon. The retail price is expected to be $15 a month when purchased directly from HBO, or about what consumers pay when they order HBO through their cable, satellite or telco provider.HBO’s corporate parent, Time Warner Inc., will rely on a whole new line of distributors (e.g., Apple TV, Roku, Xbox, PlayStation, Amazon, etc.) to help market HBO Now to an estimated 10 million U.S. broadband subscribers who do not pay for a cable TV bundle. CEO Jeff Bewkes has said the offering could also help reach some of the 70 million cable TV subscribers who do not subscribe to HBO but might if given the opportunity to subscribe online.HBO’s over-the-top service has been cast as the biggest challenge yet to the so-called cable bundle, in which consumers are required to buy packages of channels, some of which they may never watch. One study claimed the service would lead to a 7 percent drop in pay TV subscriptions , as users opt out of cable and opt in to HBO Now.Some cable providers, however, such as Cablevision and Cox Communications, have expressed interest in bundling HBO Now with broadband for their own subscribers who don’t get cable TV.Apple has been most aggressive in courting HBO in a bid to add the service to Apple TV, sources say. Apple TV already carries HBO Go for current HBO subscribers, but it may add a second app for HBO Now. Apple has spent the past several years negotiating for the rights to offer its own linear TV package; in the meantime, HBO Now is seen as an added service to drive adoption of Apple TV.While HBO has not confirmed a launch date for HBO Now, internally the target is an April launch, in time for the April 12 debut of “Game of Thrones.” That’s an aggressive time frame for Major League Baseball Advanced Media, which is building the back end along with a new front end separate from HBO Go. HBO is taking care not to launch HBO Now before it can guarantee that the service will work without some of the technical glitches that plagued HBO Go during last year's debut of cult-fave ""Game of Thrones.""The launch of HBO Now will be a milestone for Time Warner’s premium TV channel, which has for most of its 42-year history been distributed as an add-on to a package of cable channels. The Web service will allow HBO to sign on a new group of distribution partners, which it sees as no different than when it added satellite TV and, later, telcos such as Verizon and AT&T.Each of those distributors pays a wholesale price for HBO and then resells it to consumers for anywhere from $13 to $18 a month. Most see HBO as a retention device; those who subscribe are less likely to drop service or switch providers. HBO and Time Warner declined to comment.At $15 a month, HBO Now will be significantly more expensive than Netflix, which ranges from $8 to $12 a month for various levels of service, but cheaper than some were predicting. HBO makes the case that it has more original programming than Netflix and a better, more current film library. “It’s a premium product, and it will be priced accordingly,” HBO CEO Richard Plepler said during a Time Warner earnings call in February.HBO’s push to launch HBO Now comes after years of talking about launching an over-the-top service that bypasses traditional cable TV. Understandably, it has been met with some resistance from current distributors, including Time Warner Cable and Comcast, two companies in the midst of a $46 billion merger, according to sources.HBO, of course, heard the same misgivings from cable companies when it first added satellite TV providers and then telcos as distributors. HBO’s strategy is to give early partners a pricing advantage over newer ones; it’s unclear how this will go over with Apple, which has a track record of squeezing advantageous deals out of media, including the 99-cent single more than a decade ago.Bewkes said in December that he saw “cord-cutting” accelerate as pay TV providers dropped subscribers. U.S. pay TV providers lost 125,000 subscribers in 2014, according to Leichtman Research Group. At the same time, HBO and Cinemax reported their highest number of new subscribers (2.8 million) in 30 years.Among the challenges HBO faces to get HBO Now launched is how to avoid confusion with HBO Go, the service that allows HBO’s cable TV subscribers to access it on the Web, smartphones and tablets. The two services will have separate log-in pages and separate apps, but some cable execs are concerned about customer confusion. The explanation might challenge even the best call center employee: HBO Go is for TV subscribers to watch their content on devices; HBO Now for those who don’t subscribe via TV.​Stay up to date with our daily newsletterRelated Stories"

Munster sees an overall ASP at around $650 for the mid-tier Watch series.On the high end, the analyst forecasts base model Apple Watch Edition devices to start at $4,999, but classifies segment ASP closer to $7,500 after adding in straps made from precious metals.Based on current pricing for Apple's silicon iPhone 6 cases, which come in at $35, Munster sees elastomer Apple Watch straps to start in a similar $29 to $35 range, while leather bands could be priced between $49 to $59. Pricing for metal bands like the link bracelet and Milanese loop are more difficult to determine, but the analyst believes steel versions will come in at $99, while gold bands could be priced into the thousands of dollars.""If you assume that 55 percent of bands purchased are elastomer, 35 percent leather, 10 percent steel, and about 5,000 total gold bands are sold, the average band ASP could be around $50,"" Munster writes.He added that if half of all Watch buyers purchase a band —assuming 8 million Watches are sold in 2015 —the accessory range would add $25 to Apple's watch category, equating to a $575 ASP. If every Watch customer purchases an extra strap, it would tack on $50, bringing ASP up to $600.The lower-cost Sport model is expected to make up 55 percent of overall Watch sales, while the mid-tier Apple Watch will take another 45 percent. That leaves very little room for Apple Watch Edition, but Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10,000 units this year. In an interesting comparison, the firm calculates that Apple Watch Edition business could equate to about two percent of luxury watchmaker Rolex, which moves between 600,000 to 750,000 units each year.Finally, Munster expects Apple to reveal a better sense of device pricing at its March 9 event , as well as highlight ""special features"" to drum up consumer interest ahead of release.AppleInsider will be covering the ""Spring forward"" event live from San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center next week.Topics:"	2015/03/03

http://www.emergent.info/8dot2-release-march-2	Claim: Apple will release iOS 8.2 March 2	false	['BGR', 'iOS', 'Jonathan S. Geller']	http://bgr.com/	http://bgr.com/2015/02/27/ios-8-2-ios-8-3-download-release/	2015/02/27	Apple has been hard at work on multiple upcoming iOS versions simultaneously, and weve been told that iOS 8.2 is finally moving to the release stage. Barring any last minute problems, I would expect to see iOS 8.2 released this coming Monday, or the following week at the absolute latest.DONT MISS: Is the Galaxy S6 really an iPhone ripoff? Leaked comparison photo lets you be the judgeAdditionally, we were told there might be as many as four iOS 8.3 beta versions. Apple released iOS 8.3 beta 2 earlier this week, so that leaves two more versions before the company makes it publicly available to customers.iOS 8.3 adds support for multiple new features and is filled with improvements in the operating system, though the biggest addition is support for the upcoming Apple Watch, which is slated to be released in early April. Apples event on March 9th should answer our remaining questions on pricing and other details.Additionally, stay tuned for the first The Boy Genius Report podcast coming later today with some thoughts on Apple Watch, the Apple Car, my struggle with the iPhone 6 Plus, and other interesting topics.

http://www.emergent.info/Apple-Edition-cost-10k	Claim: The larger Apple Watch Edition will cost $10,000	true	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Edition', 'Apple Watch Price', 'Grail Watch', 'Stephen Foskett']	http://grail-watch.com/	http://grail-watch.com/2015/02/16/gold-apple-watch-edition-must-cost-10000/	2015/02/27	The Apple Watch is a fairly large chunk of gold!Get ready for the tech press to flip out when Apple announces the retail price for the gold Apple Watch Edition model. Apple critics have always roasted the company for selling products that are more expensive than they should be, and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers. But the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of $10,000. The funny thing in this case is that Apple is perfectly right to be charging that much!Do you disagree? Check out my counterpoint, The Case Against the $10,000 Gold Apple Watch EditionGold is ExpensiveLets start with a little backgrounder in gold. Everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive. Even rabid Internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news. But most people dont understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is. So this is a good place to begin the discussion.Update: My calculations were wrong! Also, this was a bit back of the envelope. Now that it has some readership I realize I should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more realistic...Here are the basic facts:Gold currently sells for between $1,200 and $1,300 per troy ounce and has been over $1,000 per troy ounce for the last five years.18-karat gold contains 75% pure gold, and that term is regulated by law.One ounce of 18k gold occupies about 1.8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18-karat gold alloy weighs about 16.5 grams per cc.18-karat gold currently sells for $29.11 per gram, $905 per troy ounce, or $480 per cc..25 cc of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and .75 cc gets you a deployant clasp. It takes a few more to build a watch case, anywhere from 1.5 to 8 cc depending on the size and thickness of the case. So the buckle is worth $120-$360 and the watch case $720 to $3800 just as raw gold. This is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than $6,000!Gold Watches are ExpensiveLets apply this to a watch case. Imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep. If it was solid, this would equal 15.12 cc of volume. But its a watch case, so you have to leave room for the movement, dial, case back, etc. So lets just leave 5 mm of thickness all around, making a hollow rectangle. This equals 6.8 cc (42 x 36 x 10 32 x 26 x 10). Therefore, the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost $3,200 as of this writing.A simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would cost more than $3,200Now lets consider the same shape but just 2 mm thick. Thats 2.9 cc of gold, worth $1,400. Pick your thickness and youre still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold.How does this translate in the real world? Lets look at the retail price of some watches that are available in both stainless steel and 18-karat gold.This Cartier Tank MC is $15,000 more in 18k goldThe Cartier Tank MC measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9.5 mm thick: $15,000 extra (list) for 18k goldCartier Tank MC in stainless steel: $7,000 list, $5,800 streetCartier Tank MC in 18k pink gold: $22,000 list, $18,200 streetThe Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime measures 50.5 mm by 34.9 mm by 14 mm thick: $14,750 extra (list) for 18k goldJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in stainless steel: $8,550 list, $6,800 streetJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in 18k pink gold: $23,300 list, $18,400 streetThis list could go on and on, but the gist is simple: 18-karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel. In fact, its pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size and from any manufacturer. Even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny Chopard Happy Sport Mini sells for $11,000! Most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14-karat or less, very slim and small, or long out of production and with outdated pricing.Then theres the bracelet. Swap a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra $20,000. Adding a gold bracelet to that Jaeger-LeCoultre bumps the price to $42,900!Certainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches, but one simply cannot deny the raw material value in a gold watch case. And the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities: There are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold, and plenty of reserves, so no company, no matter how strong, can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers.Another reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility. They cant price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labor, distribution, and profit in a watch.The Apple Watch Edition Will Cost $10,000Theres a reason I picked those two watches for my comparisons: Both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm Apple Watch. The Cartier is a little smaller and the Jaeger-LeCoultre is a little larger, but both represent a traditional watchmakers gold-cased square-ish offering in the space. And both cost more than $20,000, with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle. And Jony Ive recently said that the historic Cartier Tank was one of his inspirations for the Apple Watch design!Apple would be crazy to sell the Apple Watch Edition for $20,000, though. Thats not going to happen. So theyre likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically.First, as we can see, the Apple Watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions. Although questionable from an esthetic standpoint, this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot. Second, Apple Watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display, sensors, and such. Third, the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum, not gold, to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions.Could it be gold plated? No. Numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case. Although Apple has not apparently used the word, solid in their press releases, they do claim it is crafted from 18-karat gold and nowhere does it say it is plated or gold filled (the industry term). There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could.Apple says that the Apple Watch will start at $349 for that aluminum Sport model, and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel Apple Watch to be roughly $1,000. It is reasonable to assume that the gold Edition model will sell for substantially more than this, with many suggesting $4,000 or $5,000. But remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold! Even with thin walls and a steel frame, its hard to see how Apple could make a solid 18-karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold.Gold is soft, but Apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as standard gold. Taking that at face value, perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately, cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch. This still leaves a few thousand dollars of material value in the case. The Apple Watch Edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes, a difference of about 20% in terms of case volume. So the smaller model could sell for 20% less still.My prediction is that the 42 mm Apple Watch Edition will retail for $9,999 with the 38 mm Apple Watch Edition retailing for $7,999. This covers the cost of the gold case, the internals, manufacturing, sales, and profit, and yet does not leave Apple subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too-thin or plated case. I will be shocked if the price is $4,999, but I suppose its possible with some finagling and if thats the smaller model. And it will not be any less than that.This is a $10,000 productBonus prediction: Given the very high price of the Apple Watch Edition, I predict that availability will be quite limited. Apple will likely create special store-within-a-store spaces in certain Apple Store locations for the Edition. I further expect them to open special standalone Apple Edition Boutiques to sell the Watch Edition, accessories, and perhaps other future high-end products.Update!Needless to say, many people disagree with me. And now that @Gruber Fireballed this post, I imagine Ill hear from lots of them real soon!The gist of the disagreement lies in the amount of gold needed for the watch case. I assumed it would be quite thick (read sturdy) and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold. Then theres the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams. But @GAK_PDX (and others, though he was most visually eloquent) suspects it contains much less gold.I think this number is way too low, but its a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow. And it puts the raw gold at about $849 at $29.11 per gram of 18k gold. Although this is admittedly much, much lower than my estimate, it still illustrates my point that the Apple Watch Edition is not going to be cheap. And I think hes way off but time will tell who is right and who is wrong.Another argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold Rolex watch. Right off the bat one should point out that gold cost $400/oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well, something Apple is apparently not going to do with the Edition. That Rolex case contained 18.5 grams of gold alloy, but its much, much smaller than the Apple watch and its circular to boot! A 34mm circle is 107mm in circumference, while the 42mm Apple Watch is 156mm in circumference. Use the magic of math to scale the Rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and were at 27.75 grams. But that case is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel, and the Apple Watch is pretty slab-sided. So we can probably double this safely and come out with $1,615 of gold in my mangled square Rolex case.So there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold. I can accept that. But lets take a step back and think about the final price. Even if it contained less than $1,500 of gold, how much would it sell for? Certainly not $2,000 or $3,000. You still have to account for the cost of everything else, plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution. And profit for Apple (and a hedge against the volatility of the price of gold). So were back at the $4,000-$5,000 estimate others have made. As Greg Koenig tweeted, and Forbes reported, If anyone thinks Apple is charging less than $5k for the Edition, they are smoking crack.Regardless of the total, its important to realize that the price of gold is in the drivers seat when it comes to pricing the Apple Watch Edition.Id love to be wrong, and I look forward to updating this piece.

http://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-Edition-not-online	Claim: The gold Apple Watch Edition will not be sold online or by mail	unverified	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Edition', 'Grail Watch', 'Stephen Foskett']	http://grail-watch.com/	http://grail-watch.com/2015/02/27/the-case-against-the-10000-gold-apple-watch-edition/	2015/02/27	My post laying out why the gold Apple Watch Edition must cost $10,000 caused quite a stir, but Ill be the first to admit that I could have it all wrong. Its entirely possible for them to put together a gold-cased Apple Watch for a much-lower price point, but Im much more interested in the reasons why: Apples manufacturing and retail empire would be seriously disrupted by a $10,000 lump of gold!Apple probably doesnt want to reconfigure their stored to resemble the Bank of England gold vaults! image CCbyND www.bankofengland.co.ukHow To Make A Gold Watch For Under $10,000In my last post, I pointed out (hyperbolically) that there are no gold watches available for less than $10,000. This isnt really true there are a few small gold-cased watches available below that mark. But comparing these to an Apple watch is (if you pardon the pun), a case of apples and oranges: Theyre much smaller; theyre round; and theyre not Apple Watches!This last point is critical: We have no idea how the case of an Apple Watch is constructed. And, more importantly, the components, manufacturing, and sales process is entirely different from a Swiss mechanical wristwatch. My point was simply that Apples Watch Edition case looks like a big chunk of gold and thats an expensive thing, likely pushing the total cost all the way to $10,000 if my assumptions are correct.But lets say Apple didnt want to build, stock, and sell a $10,000 watch but still wanted it to be crafted from 18-karat gold. How would they do it?Our first argument against the $10k solid gold watch is commonality of design and certification. Apple has never (to my knowledge) delivered a device with different models constructed of different materials. Electronics arent like watches. They are mass-produced and must be certified for electromagnetic (RF) interference. Apple says theyll deliver Watches in aluminum, steel, and gold, but it would be much easier of all three had an identical internal design and only varied when it comes to the outer skin. (Counterpoint: Commonality inside doesnt necessarily mean cheap outside.)This would also make the final product much cheaper, since the gold case could be extremely thin and not structural. Note that nowhere does Apple use the term, solid gold case, to describe the Watch Edition. Im no lawyer, but their crafted from 18-karat gold boast could be weasel words to describe a conventional Watch wrapped in a thin gold skin.The lugs and bars (thats the watch insider term for the things that the strap attaches to) as well as the strap buckle could simply be gold plated or even gold colored. This is important because even these seemingly-small pieces would cost hundreds of dollars if they are solid 18-karat gold. Thats how expensive gold is.One big clue could be the missing gold bracelet. Its pretty glaring that the steel Apple Watch has two metal bracelets while the gold one only has leather and rubber. A gold watch bracelet has much more gold in it than the watch case itself, so the missing bracelet could be a clue that Apple is trying to keep the price in check. And the mere availability of the rubber strap which, as John Gruber notes, is the same as on the cheapest cheapie in the whole lineup could be another tell. Rubber bracelets are sometimes found on expensive dive watches, but this is no X Fathoms... (Counterpoint: They could add the gold bracelet later as an accessory.)Combine these clues and we could be looking at a much cheaper watch. Its still inconceivable to imagine prices less than $1,000, but Apple could definitely finagle a $2,000 Apple Watch Edition. Its more likely that the Edition would retail over $4,000, but this is a far cry from my earlier assertion that it would cost $10,000!Why Apple Wouldnt Want A $10,000 WatchIts entirely possible for the gold Apple Watch Edition to be way under $10,000, but a more important question is why would Apple do this. After all, those making the decisions are very familiar with the luxury watch market and the incredible prices that gold watches command at retail. Why wouldnt they want to pull a Vertu and cash in if customers are willing to buy?Lets return to the cost of gold. Although Apple has produced $10,000 products in the past and currently stocks some pretty expensive devices in the stores, a gold watch is an entirely different animal. Gold is much more fungible than anything else Apple sells, so security is a much more critical issue. Remember the smash-and-grab iPhone heists? How about that pallet of stolen iPhones? Now imagine if those thieves could melt the case down and have an untraceable $4,000 lump of gold instead of some hot electronics.The high price of gold affects every aspect of my purported solid gold Apple Watch. Where would Apple manufacture a $10,000 watch? Even that little buckle would be worth more than a months pay for a Foxconn assembly line worker. And the level of finish required to compete with Swiss watches is not yet possible at scale in China. (Counterpoint: Apple could build the solid gold Watch Edition in Texas alongside the Mac Pro.)Then theres shipment and warehousing. Although it is extremely unlikely that Apple would manufacture and ship the millions of gold Watches some analysts suggest, even more modest shipments would be immensely valuable. Securing these shipments from factory to warehouse to freight to warehouse to store will be a real challenge. Apple currently packs as many as 1.5 million iPhones into a single 747, but they couldnt ship $15 billion worth of Watch Editions this way! Every point of collection and shipping would instantly be a ripe target for criminals. (Counterpoint: Apple already deals with armored cars, security systems, and locked vaults.)Even the stores themselves would need to be reconfigured. Is Apple ready to add armed guards, armored display cases, and time-lock vaults to their stores? Certainly the smaller stores dont have space for a private room or boutique for Watch Edition buyers. (Counterpoint: We know they are working on a major redesign of the retail stores already.)And what about payment? Luxury watch buyers typically pay using wire transfers, not credit cards. Apple must prepare to process five-figure credit card transactions and accept wires. Are they ready to accept the hassle of validating buyers and payments of this size?Apple also has to worry about what a 1% product like a $10,000 Apple Watch Edition would say about the company and its buyers. As Adam Fields notes on Medium, Apple will have to abandon their historic focus on accessible luxury and fully embrace their new role as a vendor of conspicuous luxury. Already frequently criticized as a maker of status symbols, this would be a lightning rod for Apple: If the gold Watch Edition sells for $10,000, it could spike Apples broader reputation and turn away customers rather than attract them.Apple risks alienating their loyal customers with a 1% product. Could Occupy Apple become a reality? CC image by David ShankboneIt seems smart for Apple to skimp on the gold and bring the cost of the Apple Watch Edition to under $4,000. They would still have issues with production, shipping, and security but these would be reduced since they would no longer be dealing with four-figure lumps of fungible bullion.Yet even at that price the stores will need reconfiguration and the pundits will hurl jokes about the rich. If the company is going to suffer to bring out a gold Apple Watch Edition anyway, why not embrace the change and go solid gold?Thats why Im sticking to my original predictions:The starting prices will be $7,999 and $9,999The Apple Watch Edition will have a solid gold case weighing more than 5 ouncesIf sales go well, Apple will later offer a gold Edition bracelet at $9,999 as an accessoryThe Apple Watch Edition will be offered through certain high-end third-party fashion boutiques and retailersSome larger Apple Stores will add a private Edition Boutique (but not all)A whole line of expensive and exclusive Edition products will appearThe Edition line will not be available from the online store or by mailRelated PostsWhy the Gold Apple Watch Edition Must Cost $10,000Apple Watch: Its Not a WatchA Watch Guys Review of the Apple WatchHow Good Is the Mondaine Helvetica Smart Watch?The Revolutionary Smart Watch from Apples Designers (Circa 1990)Hamilton Electric VenturaMovado 1891 Ultra-Slim Museum WatchLevrette Chronograph: Classic EleganceSeiko Giugiaro SCED035: Daughter of RipleyOrient Blue Ray: Weekend DiverYear: 2015Brand: AppleStyle: Smart watchCase: GoldCountry: USASource: Tags: Apple, Apple Watch, boutique, gold, retail, securityShare this:EmailPrintFacebook11TwitterPinterest1GoogleRelated PostsWhy the Gold Apple Watch Edition Must Cost $10,000Apple Watch: Its Not a WatchA Watch Guys Review of the Apple WatchHow Good Is the Mondaine Helvetica Smart Watch?The Revolutionary Smart Watch from Apples Designers (Circa 1990)Hamilton Electric VenturaMovado 1891 Ultra-Slim Museum WatchLevrette Chronograph: Classic EleganceSeiko Giugiaro SCED035: Daughter of RipleyOrient Blue Ray: Weekend Diver	2015/02/27

Now that it has some readership I realize I should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more realistic...Here are the basic facts:Gold currently sells for between $1,200 and $1,300 per troy ounce and has been over $1,000 per troy ounce for the last five years.18-karat gold contains 75% pure gold, and that term is regulated by law.One ounce of 18k gold occupies about 1.8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18-karat gold alloy weighs about 16.5 grams per cc.18-karat gold currently sells for $29.11 per gram, $905 per troy ounce, or $480 per cc..25 cc of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and .75 cc gets you a deployant clasp. It takes a few more to build a watch case, anywhere from 1.5 to 8 cc depending on the size and thickness of the case. So the buckle is worth $120-$360 and the watch case $720 to $3800 just as raw gold. This is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than $6,000!Gold Watches are ExpensiveLets apply this to a watch case. Imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep. If it was solid, this would equal 15.12 cc of volume. But its a watch case, so you have to leave room for the movement, dial, case back, etc. So lets just leave 5 mm of thickness all around, making a hollow rectangle. This equals 6.8 cc (42 x 36 x 10 32 x 26 x 10). Therefore, the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost $3,200 as of this writing.A simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would cost more than $3,200Now lets consider the same shape but just 2 mm thick. Thats 2.9 cc of gold, worth $1,400. Pick your thickness and youre still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold.How does this translate in the real world? Lets look at the retail price of some watches that are available in both stainless steel and 18-karat gold.This Cartier Tank MC is $15,000 more in 18k goldThe Cartier Tank MC measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9.5 mm thick: $15,000 extra (list) for 18k goldCartier Tank MC in stainless steel: $7,000 list, $5,800 streetCartier Tank MC in 18k pink gold: $22,000 list, $18,200 streetThe Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime measures 50.5 mm by 34.9 mm by 14 mm thick: $14,750 extra (list) for 18k goldJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in stainless steel: $8,550 list, $6,800 streetJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in 18k pink gold: $23,300 list, $18,400 streetThis list could go on and on, but the gist is simple: 18-karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel. In fact, its pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size and from any manufacturer. Even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny Chopard Happy Sport Mini sells for $11,000! Most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14-karat or less, very slim and small, or long out of production and with outdated pricing.Then theres the bracelet. Swap a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra $20,000. Adding a gold bracelet to that Jaeger-LeCoultre bumps the price to $42,900!Certainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches, but one simply cannot deny the raw material value in a gold watch case. And the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities: There are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold, and plenty of reserves, so no company, no matter how strong, can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers.Another reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility. They cant price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labor, distribution, and profit in a watch.The Apple Watch Edition Will Cost $10,000Theres a reason I picked those two watches for my comparisons: Both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm Apple Watch. The Cartier is a little smaller and the Jaeger-LeCoultre is a little larger, but both represent a traditional watchmakers gold-cased square-ish offering in the space. And both cost more than $20,000, with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle. And Jony Ive recently said that the historic Cartier Tank was one of his inspirations for the Apple Watch design!Apple would be crazy to sell the Apple Watch Edition for $20,000, though. Thats not going to happen. So theyre likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically.First, as we can see, the Apple Watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions. Although questionable from an esthetic standpoint, this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot. Second, Apple Watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display, sensors, and such. Third, the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum, not gold, to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions.Could it be gold plated? No. Numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case. Although Apple has not apparently used the word, solid in their press releases, they do claim it is crafted from 18-karat gold and nowhere does it say it is plated or gold filled (the industry term). There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could.Apple says that the Apple Watch will start at $349 for that aluminum Sport model, and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel Apple Watch to be roughly $1,000. It is reasonable to assume that the gold Edition model will sell for substantially more than this, with many suggesting $4,000 or $5,000. But remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold! Even with thin walls and a steel frame, its hard to see how Apple could make a solid 18-karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold.Gold is soft, but Apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as standard gold. Taking that at face value, perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately, cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch. This still leaves a few thousand dollars of material value in the case. The Apple Watch Edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes, a difference of about 20% in terms of case volume. So the smaller model could sell for 20% less still.My prediction is that the 42 mm Apple Watch Edition will retail for $9,999 with the 38 mm Apple Watch Edition retailing for $7,999. This covers the cost of the gold case, the internals, manufacturing, sales, and profit, and yet does not leave Apple subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too-thin or plated case. I will be shocked if the price is $4,999, but I suppose its possible with some finagling and if thats the smaller model. And it will not be any less than that.This is a $10,000 productBonus prediction: Given the very high price of the Apple Watch Edition, I predict that availability will be quite limited. Apple will likely create special store-within-a-store spaces in certain Apple Store locations for the Edition. I further expect them to open special standalone Apple Edition Boutiques to sell the Watch Edition, accessories, and perhaps other future high-end products.Update!Needless to say, many people disagree with me. And now that @Gruber Fireballed this post, I imagine Ill hear from lots of them real soon!The gist of the disagreement lies in the amount of gold needed for the watch case. I assumed it would be quite thick (read sturdy) and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold. Then theres the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams. But @GAK_PDX (and others, though he was most visually eloquent) suspects it contains much less gold.I think this number is way too low, but its a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow. And it puts the raw gold at about $849 at $29.11 per gram of 18k gold. Although this is admittedly much, much lower than my estimate, it still illustrates my point that the Apple Watch Edition is not going to be cheap. And I think hes way off but time will tell who is right and who is wrong.Another argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold Rolex watch. Right off the bat one should point out that gold cost $400/oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well, something Apple is apparently not going to do with the Edition. That Rolex case contained 18.5 grams of gold alloy, but its much, much smaller than the Apple watch and its circular to boot! A 34mm circle is 107mm in circumference, while the 42mm Apple Watch is 156mm in circumference. Use the magic of math to scale the Rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and were at 27.75 grams. But that case is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel, and the Apple Watch is pretty slab-sided. So we can probably double this safely and come out with $1,615 of gold in my mangled square Rolex case.So there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold. I can accept that. But lets take a step back and think about the final price. Even if it contained less than $1,500 of gold, how much would it sell for? Certainly not $2,000 or $3,000. You still have to account for the cost of everything else, plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution. And profit for Apple (and a hedge against the volatility of the price of gold). So were back at the $4,000-$5,000 estimate others have made. As Greg Koenig tweeted, and Forbes reported, If anyone thinks Apple is charging less than $5k for the Edition, they are smoking crack.Regardless of the total, its important to realize that the price of gold is in the drivers seat when it comes to pricing the Apple Watch Edition.Id love to be wrong, and I look forward to updating this piece.

Apple critics have always roasted the company for selling products that are more expensive than they should be, and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers. But the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of $10,000. The funny thing in this case is that Apple is perfectly right to be charging that much!Do you disagree?

Even rabid Internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news. But most people dont understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is.

At least 30 tribal elders from various parts of Syria and Iraq gathered to pledge allegiance to Al-Baghdadi, according to our well-placed Syrian source.

Footage of the atrocities has been released online, and in the most recent gruesome execution video of Mr Henning, put out last month, the murderer threatened to behead another US hostage, Peter Kassig, 26, an aid worker.British journalist John Cantlie, also held hostage, has been forced to appear in a series of internet propaganda videos for IS.Our source, who has contacts with the IS leadership in Syria, also throws fresh light on the role played by Jihadi John within the terrorist group.Unlike most other western Muslim recruits, he has risen to a position of some seniority. Normally, Western fighters occupy lowly positions, mainly being used as foot soldiers or performing guard duty. Although believed to formerly have been a prison guard for IS, Jihadi John was made a member of a shura council, or governing body, of an IS wilayat, or province.IS is now controlling large areas of Syria and Iraq, which it has declared an Islamic caliphate. Jihadi John is understood to be in the shura council for the wilayat of Al Furat, an area that straddles the Syria-Iraq border and includes Al Qaim, the scene of the air strike.Our source added that Jihadi John does not live in Raqqa, but in Al Bukamal, a small desert town which borders Iraq.He is aged between 28 and 31, and is fluent in English, Arabic and classical Arabic, the language of the Koran, according to our source.

http://www.emergent.info/ISIS-fighters-border	Claim: ISIS fighters were caught trying to enter the U.S. via the U.S.-Mexico border	false	['ISIS']	http://www.foxnews.com/	http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/10/08/congressman-at-least-10-isis-fighters-caught-trying-to-cross-into-us/	2014/10/09	"Congressman: ‘At least 10 ISIS fighters’ caught trying to cross into USPublished October 08, 2014Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print A Republican congressman claimed Tuesday that ""at least 10"" Islamic State ""fighters"" have been caught trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border into Texas, though an administration official denied it. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., said he learned the information from the Border Patrol, warning that the alleged attempts to cross into the U.S. raise serious security concerns. ""ISIS is coming across the southern border,"" he told Fox News. ""They aren't flying B1 bombers bombing American cities, but they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico."" Hunter continued: ""I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas."" He claimed Border Patrol ""caught them,"" but ""you know there's going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol."" The Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday denied Hunter's claim. ""The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,"" a senior DHS spokesman said. ""DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border."" But Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper said the information -- that about 10 individuals with ""known ISIS affiliations"" -- came from a ""high-level source within the Border Patrol."" ""The congressman was conveying what he knows -- and what he was told,"" Kasper said. ""It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn't know what the right hand is doing -- it's been that way for a long time and we don't expect that to change."" Obama administration officials previously have downplayed the threat of Islamic State militants infiltrating the U.S. through the southern border, as warnings about that possibility have circulated. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in an interview with Fox News last week, acknowledged reports that four men with suspected terror ties had been apprehended at the southern border in Texas and questioned. But Johnson said they were ""scrutinized very, very carefully"" and officials found ""no evidence that these individuals were tied to terrorism."" Border Patrol and Homeland Security sources also told Fox News that they have not been able to substantiate Hunter's claim. They said between Sept. 23 and Oct. 6, only five illegal immigrants from ""special interest"" countries were arrested at the Texas border -- and they were from Bangladesh. The four men that Johnson referred to were actually Kurds, Fox News is told. Johnson, at a hearing last month, stressed that the government had ""no specific intelligence or evidence to suggest at present that ISIL is attempting to infiltrate this country though our southern border."" At the same hearing, National Counterterrorism Center head Matthew Olsen also said: ""There has been a very small number of sympathizers with ISIL who have posted messages on social media about this, but we've seen nothing to indicate there is any sort of operational effort or plot to infiltrate or move operatives from ISIL"" into the U.S. through the southern border. Still, Johnson said the U.S. needs to be ""vigilant"" and aware of the possibility of ""potential infiltration by ISIL or any other terrorist group."" The union representing America's immigration caseworkers also sounded an urgent warning last month about the threat. Kenneth Palinkas, president of the National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council, alleged the administration has made it easier for terrorists to ""exploit"" the country's visa policies and enter the homeland. He complained that the administration has ""widened the loophole"" they could use through the asylum system, and has restricted agents from going after many of those who overstay their visas. Further, he warned that executive orders being contemplated by President Obama would ""legalize visa overstays"" and raise ""the threat level to America even higher."" He said there is ""no doubt"" many are already being ""targeted for radicalization."" FoxNews.com's Judson Berger and Fox News' Jennifer Griffin and William La Jeunesse contributed to this report.Advertisement"	2014/10/08

""There's been a marked increase in the number of elite officials visiting the ward,"" the source added.One intelligence official here said Kim's official car does not appear to have left Pyongyang, so it is likely he remains in the capital.The official said Kim is overweight and appears to have sprained his ankles during a grueling tour of military bases and factories in Cuban heels. Kim is around 170 cm tall and has become noticeably overweight since he came to power.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was seen limping in footage shown Friday on North Korean Central TV.There has been speculation that his obesity and binge drinking brought on gout. The official Rodong Sinmun daily recently said Kim ""labored on"" by visiting various facilities braving the hot summer weather.Kim missed a regular session of the Supreme People's Assembly in Pyongyang on Thursday.A government official here said, ""It's unlikely that a young man like Kim Jong-un would have missed the Supreme People's Assembly just because he has gout.""State TV in a rare admission on Thursday showed footage of Kim limping and admitted he is ill.

We have females in aircrews and ground crews and they are here because of their abilities. Everyone is just doing their jobs.'The news comes as RAF jets flew armed sorties for a second day over Iraq yesterday but despite having now sent out jets five times, they again failed to locate any suitable targets for their weapons.Defence chiefs insisted that the flights by Tornado GR4 fighter-bombers were invaluable for gathering intelligence on the Islamist jihadists who have swept across large swathes of Iraq and Syria, carrying out massacres.But the failure to unleash any firepower has fuelled concern that Britain is failing to pull its weight in the international coalition against Islamic StateIt came as military commanders warned that Britain should brace itself to be dragged into a ground war in Iraq to crush IS, which is also known as Isis and Isil. Former top brass also warned that the air campaign would be futile unless the UK could target the terrorists in Syria.While the Ministry of Defence confirmed that the RAF's third mission had like on Saturday failed to locate any targets, US-led coalition aircraft targeted four makeshift oil refineries under IS control in Syria, as well as a command centre.The mobile refineries generate up to 1.2million a day for the militants. +9 <img id=""i-e3efa56bb22305f7"" src=""http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/09/29/1411972863373_wps_6_MoD_handout_photo_dated_2.jpg"" height=""404"" width=""634"" alt=""On a mission: The RAF jets seek out their terror targets in Iraq"" class=""blkBorder img-share""/> Copy link to paste in your message On a mission: The RAF jets seek out their terror targets in Iraq - which they failed to find and bomb, again +9 <img id=""i-410fe68b2021b36a"" src=""http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/09/29/1411974584577_wps_14_Iraq_and_Syria_Isis_contr.jpg"" height=""484"" width=""636"" alt=""Strong presence: Military leaders have said about two-thirds of the estimated 31,000 Islamic State militants are in Syria.

The coalition is contributing a wide range of efforts, from carrying out airstrikes to providing military assistance and humanitarian aid.Here are some of the key partners in the coalition.UNITED STATESThe U.S., which is leading the coalition, has launched dozens of airstrikes on Islamic State targets. It also has sent military advisers, supplies and humanitarian aid to help Iraqi troops and Kurdish forces beat back the insurgents.GULF STATESSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have participated in airstrikes in Syria. A fourth, Qatar, has played what the Pentagon called a supporting role.The Emirates and Qatar also host air bases that are being used for the coalition's aerial campaign against the Islamic State group. U.S. Navy ships involved in the airstrikes are assigned to the Bahrain-based Fifth Fleet. Saudi Arabia has agreed to host training facilities for Syrian rebels on its territory.JORDANJordan has launched airstrikes against Islamic State positions, with government spokesman Mohammad al-Momani calling the move 'necessary in light of continuous attempts to infiltrate our borders.' The kingdom didn't give any specifics about its operations, but said the airstrikes aim to insure the country's security.EGYPTEgypt hasn't announced any specific participation in airstrikes, but President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi told the AP that Egypt is 'completely committed to giving support,' and will do 'whatever is required' to support the coalition.ISRAELIsrael is offering intelligence estimates and concrete intelligence to the U.S. on the Islamic State group as part of ongoing intelligence sharing between the two countries, an Israeli defense official said. But, he added, Israel wasn't asked to contribute anything beyond that. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the issue. The prime minister's office declined to comment.BRITAINBritain said that Tornado fighter bombers, supported by air-to-air refueling aircraft and signals intelligence, are operating over Iraq. Britain's media has widely reported that six warplanes are on standby in Cyprus, but defense officials have declined to offer specific numbers. Ben Goodlad from IHS Jane's has said that the Tornado jets offer the coalition enhanced capability to engage moving targets. Britain also has two weapons for long-range strikes: the Tornado's Storm Shadow cruise missile and the submarine-launched Tomahawk cruise missile, he said.FRANCEFrance has carried out airstrikes in Iraq on two occasions since joining the U.S.-led coalition on Sept. 19, firing laser-guided bombs from Rafale fighter planes upon munitions and military hardware stockpiles first near northern Mosul, then on Thursday, near Fallujah. France is conducting the operations in Iraq from a French air base in the United Arab Emirates. The base, with about 750 French service personnel and six Rafales, is 1,700 kilometers (1,050 miles) from Mosul, meaning that the planes need refueling in flight to strike in Iraq.AUSTRALIAAn Australian air force contingent, including eight F/A-18 Hornet jet fighters and two support aircraft, has arrived in the United Arab Emirates. About 600 troops most of them air force personnel are being deployed with the aircraft. The jets are expected to be used in airstrikes against Islamic State fighters in Iraq, although the Australian government has yet to commit to a combat role.BELGIUMSix F-16 multirole fighters and a contingent of 120 support staff, including eight pilots, to be based in Jordan. Authorized to take part in operations over Iraq for one month, subject to extension if approved by the Belgian government.DENMARKDenmark has pledged seven F-16 fighter jets four operational planes and three reserve jets along with pilots and support staff for 12 months. The U.S. also has asked Danes to provide military trainers to Iraq to school Iraqi and Kurdish fighters battling the Islamic State group on the ground. Denmark has already contributed a transport plane with personnel to a U.S.-led humanitarian operation in northern Iraq.CANADACanada has contributed about 70 special operations soldiers to offer instruction to Kurdish forces battling Islamic State militants in northern Iraq. Early this week, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Cabinet will be considering a U.S. request to support airstrikes against Islamic State forces. This could include five to eight CF-18 fighter aircraft as well as tanker aircraft. Canada has already contributed two military cargo planes that carried weapons to Kurdish fighters.GERMANYGermany isn't participating in any airstrikes against the Islamic State group. They have sent weapons to Kurdish fighters in Irbil, and a group of Kurdish peshmerga fighters arrived in Germany to receive weapons' training here by the German army. There's also German military in Irbil to train the peshmerga fighters in Irbil.GREECEGreece is participating with humanitarian aid and by sending ammunition for Kurdish forces fighting the Islamic State group. They haven't specified any more details on quantities or type of humanitarian aid.GEORGIAGeorgia will be providing humanitarian assistance, not military aid, according to comments made by Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili on Thursday to local news websites.HUNGARYHungary has promised to send 15 types of ammunition totaling nearly 6 million units to Iraqi Kurds. Most of the ammunition, 4.1 million cartridges, was the M43 type for the AK-47 assault rifle.ROMANIAPrime Minister Victor Ponta said his country would offer 'logistic, operational and humanitarian' support to the coalition, but not troops. He provided no details of the assistance.POLANDPoland supports the coalition against the Islamic State, but is not actively engaged in combat. "	2014/09/29

http://www.emergent.info/texas-turkey-farm-ebola-hoax	Claim: A Texas turkey farm was contaminated with Ebola	false	['Ebola', 'Fake News', 'Texas']	http://dailybuzzlive.com/	http://dailybuzzlive.com/texas-turkey-farm-contaminated-ebola-holiday-turkeys-infected/	2014/11/16	"Sharing is caring!0Tweet283kShare0Share15Pin0Mail0ShareTexas Turkey Farm Contaminated With Ebola, Over 250,000 Holiday Turkeys Infected.A Texas turkey farm employee is now under quarantine after he tested positive for the Ebola virus. Texas Prime Turkey Farm, the largest supplier of turkeys in the United States, has been ordered by the CDC to quarantine over 250,000 holiday turkeys. The CDC has confirmed 3,000 turkeys have tested positive for the virus since Fridays incident.According to investigators, long time employee Philip Canseco was seen vomiting in the facilities restroom three days prior to the incident on Friday. I was passing by the restroom, when I heard somebody throwing up inside, said one Texas Prime Turkey Farm employee. I opened the door and looked inside and saw Canseco throwing up in one of the urinals. I asked him if he was okay, he said yes, and I left. I didnt want to get close to him and get sick.Management confirmed that Canseco worked three full work days at the facility with flu-like symptoms, before passing out unconscious with a fever of 106. Due to his symptoms, he was rushed to a local hazmat tent where he tested positive for the Ebola virus. The CDC reports an additional 7 coworkers are being quarantined and tested. However, they have not released those results as of yet.The facility has been ordered by the CDC to burn their entire flock of turkeys, over 250,000. Texas Prime Turkey Farm is requesting permission from the state of Texas to send the shipment of incinerated turkey ashes to Veolias Port Arthur environmental waste facility. This facility has already accepted one shipment of Ebola waste from household goods where Thomas Eric Duncan had stayed. Duncan was the first man to die of Ebola on US soil.Activists are protesting the shipments of contaminated Ebola waste to their community. We feel every precaution should be taken to protect our community, our children and our elderly. We are not a dumping ground for the nations, or the worlds bio waste.Plant manager Mitch Osborne said on Saturday that even though no contract has yet been signed, the plant will likely receive the second shipment of contaminated Ebola waste. It is a safe and sound process, Osborne said. I am not going to place my employees in harms way, or the community. The company is here to improve the environment and I believe we are doing a pretty darn good job of that. I believe we are doing the right and safe thing.A spokesperson for Texas Prime Turkey Farm said there is a good chance Ebola turkeys may have already shipped out to major suppliers for distribution. Each retailer will have to perform recalls individually if they feel they have received a contaminated shipment.CLICK HERE > TO LIKE DAILY BUZZ LIVE ON FACEBOOK!You Might Also LikeNetflixs Altered Carbon Is a Sci-Fi RollercoasterJennifer Aniston: Should Rachel Have Ended Up With Joey?Man Charged With Drug Offenses Because $324K Smelt Like CocaineGuy Gets Ultimate Revenge On High School Bully 20 Years LaterRailbookers Takes You on Worlds Most Scenic Train JourneysPowerball Ticket Sold In Massachusetts Wins Record $758.7 MillionVegan Baby Shoes Show Off Love for AnimalsYoutubers Seeing Red After Recent Policy ChangesHaunted House Adventure?These content links are provided by Content.ad.

http://www.emergent.info/fort-carson-lockdown	Claim: Fort Carson is locked down because of a missing nuclear weapon	false	[]	http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/	http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index1809.htm	2014/10/14	"By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers The Foreign Intelligence Service ( SVR ) is reporting today that President Putins order to begin deploying tactical nuclear weapons throughout the Crimean Federal District is intensely/directly related to a missing, and believed stolen, low-yield atomic cannon shell from its storage bunker in Fort Carson , Colorado, which is a United States Army installation located near the city of Colorado Springs.According to the SVR, the atomic weapon missing fromFortCarsonhas been identified as a W48 nuclear artillery shell that measures 155 mm (6.1 inches) in diameter and 845.82 mm (33.3 inches) long.This report notes that the W48 was produced in two models, Mod 0 and Mod 1, which weighed 53.5 and 58 kg (118 and 128 pounds) respectively and have an explosive yield equivalent to 0.072 kiloton (72 tons of TNT).Though the US had reported that all of their W48 nuclear shells had been retired by 1992, this report says, the SVR has long noted their continued use for training by US Army 4th Infantry Division forces headquarter at Fort Carson and under the command of North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ) forces operating from the Cheyenne Mountain nuclear bunker complex, all of whom are located in El Paso County , Colorado.The specificUSweapons platform designed to fire the W48, this report notes, is the Paladin M109A6 155mm Artillery System [3rd photo left] which is currently operated by forces belonging to the 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 4th Infantry Division.Over the past few days when this W48 nuclear shell disappeared, this report continues, the forces of the 1st Brigade Combat Team were involved in training exercises with the 1st Battalion of the 66th Armored Regiment at Fort Carson ahead of their planned deployment in the next few weeks to the Fort Irwin National Training Center , in California, which will span much of November, after which they will be prepared to deploy to combat worldwide .US media reports about this missing W48 nuclear shell are nonexistent, this report further notes, other than their noting that Fort Carson has been put on a  total lockdown  as US military forces there continue their search for what they call a lost "" sensitive item "", a term they use that refers to gear including weapons, ammunition and night vision goggles - items that cause high-level concern when missing.These media reports further report that whatever is missing, it must be small enough to fit in a car causing Fort Carson security officers to spend about two hours inspecting all vehicles leaving Fort Carson's gates yesterday and their spokesman stating: As part of random searches at the gate, we are conducting outbound vehicle searches in order to prevent the unauthorized removal of government property from the installation.Of critical concern to the Kremlin regarding this missing W48 nuclear shell, SVR intelligence analysts in this report state, is that if fits nearly exactly to the strange and mysterious war game sprung on world leaders this past March by President Barack Obama that he named nukes on the loose and involved a terrorist attack with an atomic dirty bomb that takes place in the financial heart of an unnamed but Western metropolis.Londons Telegraph News Service in their report on this nukes on the loose war game further noted:David Cameron joined Barack Obama, Angela Merkel and Xi Jinping and other world leaders to play a ""nukes on the loose"" war game to see how they would cope with a terrorist nuclear attack. The German chancellor grumbled at being asked to play games and take tests with the Prime Minister, US and Chinese presidents around a table with dozens of heads of state at a nuclear summit in The Hague. Her complaints were overruled because Mr Obama was keen on the idea and in on the surprise.Of equal concern to the Kremlin, this report continues, are that these events are occurring as predicted by former US Assistant Treasury Secretary Dr. Paul Craig Roberts who this past June warned that Obama regime was planning for a preemptive nuclear attack.In his warning Dr. Roberts stated: Washington not only has war plans for launching a preemptive nuclear attack on Russia, and also possibly China, but Washington has a cadre of people who advocate nuclear war. We have people running around Washington saying things such as Whats the good of nuclear weapons if you cant use them.With the suicidal tendencies of the Obama regime becoming more apparent by the day, the SVR in this report grimly concludes, Russias near record de-Dollarization efforts , when coupled with the secret deal between the US and Saudi Arabia to destroy Syria , point towards a truly tragic global outcome as the American-backed Western economy is near collapseand all who oppose them will surely suffer their wrath.including the 1.2 million of their own citizens they currently have under surveillance and targeted for destruction.October 12, 2014 © EU and US all rights reserved.
