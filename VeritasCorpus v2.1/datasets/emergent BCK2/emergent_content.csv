https://www.emergent.info/human-death-GMO	Claim: Doctors confirmed the first case of death by genetically modified food	false	['Fake News', 'Hoaxes', 'World News Daily Report']	https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/	https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/doctors-confirm-first-human-death-officially-caused-by-gmos/	2015/03/09	 Share192K TweetMadrid | Doctors of the Carlos III hospital confirmed this morning in a press conference, the first case of human death caused by the ingestion of genetically modified food. Juan Pedro Ramos died from anaphylaxis after eating some recently developed tomatoes containing fish genes, which provoked a violent and lethal allergic reaction.This surprising announcement comes after the autopsy of the 31-year old Spanish man who died at the Madrid hospital at the beginning of January.The young mans health rapidly deteriorated after he suffered an unexplained allergic reaction, and all the drugs used to refrain the anaphylaxis were entirely inefficient.The team of experts claims to have been able to determine that the genetically modified tomatoes that the victim ingested at lunch were the cause of the allergic reaction that caused his death.Mr. Ramos was working as a clerk in a Madrid warehouse on January 7, when he started feeling ill just after lunch.A number of symptoms started to manifest themselves, including a violent itchy rash, some serious swelling of the throat and a drastic drop in blood pressure.The man, who was known to have allergies, quickly injected himself some epinephrine, but his health condition continued to deteriorate.The young man was rapidly carried to the hospital by co-workers, but the medical staff was unable to identify the cause of his allergic reaction in time and none of the usual treatments or drugs seemed to work. Mr. Ramos was confirmed dead just over an hour after arriving at the hospital.The young man appeared happy and healthy when this picture was taken by his roommate, less than 24 hours before he died.The medical examiners and forensic experts at the Carlos III hospital had to execute a lot of tests and analysis before they could precisely determine what caused Mr. Ramos to die of an allergic reaction to seafood since all he had eaten before his death was a bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich with a diet cola.They were astonished when they discovered that the tomato he had ingested, not only contained some fish-related allergens, but also some antibiotic resistant genes which had prevented Mr. Ramos white blood cell from saving his life.At first we thought that there had been some form of contamination of his food, from contact with fish or seafood during the preparation explained Dr. Rafael Perez-Santamarina. It was only when we tested the tomato itself that we noticed that it contained some allergens usually found in seafood. We did many different analysis and they all confirmed that the tomato was indeed the source of the allergens that killed Mr. Ramos. Many experiments on GMOs had produced some horrible tumors and event death in rats and other lab animals, but most genetically modified products on the market were considered to be harmless to humans.The case of Mr. Ramos is the first human death officially confirmed to be linked to the ingestion of genetically modified food. It contradicts most studies on GMOs which had concluded that genetically engineered crops currently on the market were completely safe to eat.A team led by University of Nebraska scientists had anticipated this kind of problem in 1996 when they found that a Brazil nut protein introduced to improve the nutritional quality of genetically modified soybeans was able to provoke an allergic reaction in people with Brazil nut allergies.However, this kind of problem was dismissed by most scientists as very improbable, since it could easily be avoided with proper safety testing.The soybean injected with the Brazil nut gene was indeed abandoned during development, but it seems that the genetically modified tomato that caused Mr. Ramos death had not been submitted to sufficient testing and the lethal risk had not been identified before it was marketed.The Spanish Ministry of Health, Social Services, and Equality ordered for the tomatoes of Portuguese origin which infected the young man, to be recalled and removed from stores and markets for safety reasons.More than 7,000 tons of tomatoes will, therefore, be ceased across the country by ministry inspectors and public safety officials.The ministry also issued a public statement about the death of Mr. Ramos in which it sends its condolences to his family and adds that it will immediately demand further research on the subject to determine if other genetically modified food products on the European market could represent a risk for the Spanish population.

https://www.emergent.info/gold-Apple-Watch-straps	Claim: Apple will offer gold Watch straps	false	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Accessories', 'Daring Fireball', 'Jon Gruber']	https://daringfireball.net/	https://daringfireball.net/2015/03/apple_watch_prelude	2015/03/07	Apple Watch PreludeSaturday, 7 March 2015I realize thereâs little purpose to further Apple Watch speculation at this point â in two days, weâll know most of the answers. But there is one good reason for last-minute speculation: this is fun. Apple tends to be such a predictable company that we often know the basic gist of what to expect before one of their media events. Not this time. The many unknowns surrounding the watch are what makes it so fun to ponder prior to next weekâs event. So letâs have some fun.First, thereâs this . The same day I published my piece on Apple Watch pricing, MacRumors forum member âpgiguere1â created a graphic with possible prices, posting it with the comment:I made this speculative price list based in large part on Gruberâs speculation:The graphic is a pastiche of genuine Apple marketing material. A trained eye can easily tell itâs not from Apple â the typefaces are ones Apple uses (San Francisco and Helvetica Neue) but the way theyâre used is wrong. But itâs close enough to fool many, and the image has now circled the social media globe several times. Iâve received at least 50 emails and tweets from DF readers asking if Iâve seen this âleaked price listâ.So letâs put it to rest. This graphic is not a leaked price list. Itâs speculation from a MacRumors forum member who read my piece on Apple Watch pricing. And, I think, itâs off in numerous ways.But there is one thing about pgiguere1âs speculation that I hadnât really considered: that the 42mm models might cost more than the 38mm ones, across the board. On pgiguere1âs list, the 42mm Sport models are $30 more expensive than the corresponding 38mm ones: $349/379. Iâm torn on whether this will be the case. Apple isnât referring to the two sizes as womenâs and menâs â some women will wear the 42 and some men (and, I suspect, many boys) will wear the 38 â but in broad strokes the 38 is the womenâs version and the 42 is the menâs. You can see that in the high-end leather straps. The feminine âModern Buckleâ is only available for the 38mm size, and the âLeather Loopâ is only available for 42mm.âBigger costs moreâ makes sense â and itâs true for most Apple products, from iPhones to iPads to MacBooks. But with those products, your choice of device size is a matter of taste and personal preference. With Apple Watch, your choice of size is in large part determined by your anatomy.If I had to wager today, Iâd bet that 42mm models will cost more across all three collections. A nominal difference for Apple Sport â $349/379 looks right to my eyes. The difference for Edition models could be $1000 or more because theyâre made from solid 18K gold. Iâm not sure what to expect for the steel ones, though. $100 difference?Bands as Stratifying DifferentiatorsI think Appleâs messaging back in September was misleading, and I donât think it was purposeful. I think it was a mistake that they will correct on Monday.In September, the basic message was something like this: Watches are personal, and different people have different tastes, so we created a wide variety of bands to choose from so you can pick one that reflects your taste, and we made them easy to swap so you can change them depending on your mood or the occasion.Most people took that to mean that your choice of band will largely be a matter of taste â that the various bands will be close to each other in terms of price. I know for a fact â from my email and tweets â that many Daring Fireball readers are hoping to buy an entry-level Apple Watch Sport and an optional Link Bracelet or Milanese Loop for maybe $150 or $200. And I also think most people expect the steel Apple Watches that come with the Link Bracelet or Milanese Loop to cost only, say, $150-200 more than the entry level models with the rubber â er, fluoroelastomer â bands.I donât think this is the case, at all.I wrote about this two weeks ago , and upon further consideration, I am now thinking that the various Apple Watch bands will be priced in significantly stratified tiers.Consider Appleâs description of what I am convinced is the highest-end strap, the Link Bracelet:Crafted from the same 316L stainless steel alloy as the case, the Link Bracelet has more than 100 components. The machining process is so precise, it takes nearly nine hours to cut the links for a single band. In part thatâs because they arenât simply a uniform size, but subtly increase in width as they approach the case. Once assembled, the links are brushed by hand to ensure that the texture follows the contours of the design. The custom butterfly closure folds neatly within the bracelet. And several links feature a simple release button, so you can add and remove links without any special tools. Available in stainless steel and space black stainless steel.Now, if you start with the assumptions that (a) the various watch bands are largely a matter of personal choice, (b) Apple will encourage Apple Watch buyers to mix and match bands, and (c) even the most expensive of them will only cost $200 or so, the above description reads as marketing braggadocio.But if you start with the premise that the top-of-the-line steel Apple Watch will cost $1499 or maybe even $1999, the above description makes more sense. Itâs an explanation for why the bracelet is so expensive. If it truly takes nine hours to cut the links for each band, and each one is polished by hand, and theyâre mechanically complex (and they definitely are), this is not a $200 bracelet. Iâm thinking itâs about $1000, judging by the description, and based on the prices for replacement stainless steel link bracelets from Rolex, Tudor, and Omega.The three collections of Apple Watch â Sport, steel, and Edition â will not, I think, be represented by three basic prices. Instead, the three collections will comprise a continuum of price points, ranging from $349 to $10,000 (or $20,000, if my hunch is correct that there are gold Link Bracelets waiting to be revealed).Here are my final guesses (38mm/42mm):Apple Watch Sport (all colors, with Sport Band): $349/399Apple Watch, steel, Sport Band: $749/799Apple Watch, steel, Classic Buckle: $849/899Apple Watch, steel, Milanese Loop: $949/999Apple Watch, steel, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $1199Apple Watch, steel, Leather Loop (42mm only): $1299Apple Watch, steel, Link Bracelet: $1499/1599Apple Watch, space black steel, Link Bracelet: $1899/1999Apple Watch Edition, Sport Band: $7499/7999Apple Watch Edition, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $9999Apple Watch Edition, Classic Buckle (42mm only): $10,999And purely based on my own speculation â the following configurations have not been announced, have not even been rumored, and have not been suggested to me by any sort of sources:Apple Watch Edition, Gold Milanese Loop: $14,999/$16,999Apple Watch Edition, Gold Link Bracelet: $17,999/$19,999In my first draft of this piece, I had the regular steel Link Bracelet models at $1899/1999, and the space black ones at $2299/2499, and thereâs a notion in my gut that I should have stuck with them. Iâm out on a limb here, and itâs quite possible Iâll be serving up some home-cooked claim chowder Monday. Every single number above other than $349 is truly just a guess on my part. My predictions are way higher than almost everyone elseâs:Marco Arment ($5000 starting price for Edition). 1Kirk McElhearn (steel starting at $500, Edition at $2000).Gene Munster (steel starting at $500, Edition starting at $5000 with an average sale price of $7500).Citi Group analyst Jim Suva (steel starting at $550, Edition at the cuckoo price of $950).Back in September, I wrote :When the prices of the steel and (especially) gold Apple Watches are announced, I expect the tech press to have the biggest collective shit-fit in the history of Apple-versus-the-standard-tech-industry shit-fits. The utilitarian mindset that asks âWhy would anyone waste money on a gold watch?â isnât going to be able to come to grips with what Apple is doing here. Theyâre going to say that Jony Ive and Tim Cook have lost their minds. Theyâre going to wear out their keyboards typing âThis never would have happened if Steve Jobs were alive.â Theyâre going to predict utter and humiliating failure . In short, theyâre going to mistake Apple for Vertu.The only thing I would change about this is that I now think itâs the steel Apple Watch pricing that is going to cause the massive collective shit-fit. Most people have wrapped their heads around the fact that the gold Edition models are going to cost at least $5000, and so have already written off Apple Watch Edition as something for the wealthy luxury market.But the steel Apple Watch, thatâs something that most people still look at as for them. And so they expect the starting price to be around $500, and the various leather and metal band options to cost $100-300 more.But if the starting price for the steel Apple Watch is $500, I donât see why Apple Watch Sport exists at $350. $150 difference does not justify the difference. If they were that close in price, thereâd only be one of them. Sport and steel only make sense as separate collections if the steel collection is significantly higher in price, even at the entry level with the rubber Sport band. People are looking at this as a $100-200 upsell, like going from 16 to 64 to 128 GB iPhones and iPads. Technically thatâs possible, but it doesnât make any sense to me strategically or in terms of operational efficiency. With storage tiers in iOS devices, the only difference is the capacity of the flash memory chip. Thatâs it. All the other components, and the machining and tooling required to produce them, are the same. With Sport and steel Apple Watches, everything you can see or touch is different. Different metal (aluminum vs. steel), different finishes (matte vs. highly-polished), different displays (glass vs. sapphire), different case backs (plastic vs. ceramic and sapphire). If the marketing argument doesnât persuade you, the operations angle should. I just donât see why Apple would bother with all this if the starting price for steel Apple Watch wasnât at least around double that of Sport.Thatâs why I think the pricing for the steel Apple Watch collection is whatâs going to raise a ruckus, because there are a lot of people who want one and expect that theyâll only have to pay $500 or $600, regardless of their strap preference.At the introduction event in September, Tim Cook explicitly billed Apple Watch as the next flagship product line in the companyâs history: Apple II, Macintosh, iPod, iPhone, iPad, and now the watch. There will be no brushing it off as a mere âhobbyâ if it isnât successful.The thing is, for all the griping about the prices that I expect come Monday, at $349, Apple Watch has the lowest entry-level price for any first-generation flagship product from Apple. The first iPod cost $399. The iPhone was $599 (before the infamous $200 price cut a few months later, which still left the entry model at $399). iPad was $499.The fact that so many people want the steel Apple Watch and non-Sport bands shows why they will cost more: desire. Apple sets prices not based on what people want to pay, but what people are willing to pay.This is without question new territory for Apple. Theyâve never sold products with the same computing internals at different pricing tiers based solely on the luxuriousness of the materials.Third-Party BandsNo matter what the pricing is, third-party Apple Watch bands seem like an inevitable thing. But will Apple stock them in its stores? Will there be a Made for Apple Watch program to certify them? I donât think so.If Appleâs prices are as high as Iâm predicting, demand for third-party link bracelets and leather straps will be high. Itâll be interesting to see how it plays out. I never would have predicted the size and scope of todayâs iPhone case market back in 2007.The MessagingIf Iâm even close to correct regarding steel Apple Watch pricing, and if Iâm also correct that thereâs going to be a vociferous backlash, Apple has only itself to blame. The September event and Appleâs marketing to date have created the impression that the differences between collections are largely about style, not price.Using the name âApple Watchâ for the stainless steel collection â the collection with the widest variety of straps â clearly establishes it as the âregularâ collection. In turn, that has left many with the impression that it will be the best-selling, the most common, the one most people walk out of the store with â and thus priced near the $349 baseline.âApple Watch starts at $349â as the one and only mention of price left too much room for bad assumptions, I think.To play devilâs advocate, perhaps Apple did this deliberately. They showed all these different watch bands knowing that they would spark desire, and that people get their heart set on a certain combination based purely on how it looks â including combinations which they wouldnât have allowed themselves to consider in the first place if theyâd known the eventual price back in September. In other words, someone whoâs had their heart set on a model with the Milanese Loop, under the assumption that it would cost, say, $600, might still go ahead and buy it for $1200 even though they wouldnât have considered it in the first place if theyâd known it would cost $1200 back in September.I think that devilâs advocate take is over-thinking things. Itâs just the only explanation I can think of other than that Apple kind of botched the pricing expectations for Apple Watch. Actually, there is one other explanation I can think of: Apple didnât want its competition to know how much Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition were going to cost, and they decided the competitive value of keeping prices secret outweighed the value of setting accurate expectations for customers.Storage CapacityApple has revealed nothing about internal storage capacity in Apple Watch. I could see this playing out two ways:Apple never talks about storage capacity for Apple Watch. It becomes a âsecretâ tech spec, like the amount of RAM in iOS devices. Weâll figure it out once we get our hands on them, but it wonât be something Apple talks about.If they do talk about it, each collection will get its own tier. Say, 8 GB for Sport, 32 GB for steel, 64 GB for Edition.I donât think Apple Watch will need much storage, but theyâve said you can store music and photos directly on the device. So itâs not like storage doesnât matter at all. Itâs just another upsell to push people to higher-priced models.The Modular S1 and UpgradeabilityThereâs been a lot of speculation about the modular nature of Apple Watchâs S1 âcomputer on a chipâ. Why brag about that? Why encase the whole thing in resin? Why make this photograph ? My wild guess back in September: perhaps Apple Watch, or at least the Edition models, would be upgradeable in future years. Take it in for service, pay $500, walk out with your âoldâ Apple Watch Edition upgraded with an S2.I now think this theory is bunk. Not going to happen.Take a first generation iPhone. Now imagine if you could upgrade it to todayâs A8 SoC. Itâd be better than it was before, thatâs for sure. But itâd still have a low-resolution non-retina display. Itâd still be stuck with EDGE cellular networking. Itâd still have a crappy camera that couldnât even shoot video. Etc. The âcomputerâ inside Apple Watch isnât centrally important. Everything is important. The health sensors, the display, the battery, the Taptic Engine, the digital crown, the networking capabilities, everything.A few years from now we might have Apple Watches that support Wi-Fi or even cellular networking. They might go several days on a single charge. None of those improvements would come from an upgrade to an S2 or S3 chip.Iâd love to be wrong on this one, but I donât think it makes any sense. And if I am wrong, the upgrade would have to include the entire innards of the watch â new display, new electronics, new battery, new sensors. Everything but the case and the bands. That still seems unlikely to me, but itâs at least plausible. And it could put Apple Watch Edition on par with existing luxury watches in terms of lifespan. But even in that case, the modular nature of the S1 doesnât really have much to do with it.Lastly, many readers have suggested a trade-in program, where you could bring in your old Apple Watch Edition and get a significant trade-in on a new one. No way. First, as stated earlier, the value of the raw gold in a gold watch is just a small fraction of the price. Second, trading in used goods is not part of a luxury shopping experience.One More ThingHolding the event at Yerba Buena instead of the smaller confines of their campus Town Hall makes me think Apple has a lot to show. There must be more to learn about Apple Watchâs software and experience â Tim Cook even said so back in September, explaining that they simply didnât have enough time then to show more. Iâve heard that Apple has been hosting over 100 third-party developers and designers in Cupertino for the last month, to test and refine WatchKit apps on production Apple Watch hardware, so I expect a bunch of third-party Watch app demos too.The new Mac version of Photos is in public beta, so I expect a full demo of that and the now-complete iCloud Photos cross-device experience. And if theyâre going to talk about Mac software, maybe theyâll reveal the rumored 12-inch thinner-than-ever MacBook Air , too. My gut tells me the new MacBook Air could be ready, and it also tells me that the purported bigger iPad is not.Update: If Apple is ready to unveil the upcoming redesign of its retail stores, we will see Angela Ahrendtsâs first on-stage appearance since joining Apple last year.Marco expressed a thought Iâve considered myself:Appleâs letting the $10,000â20,000 guesses simmer in the press to set price expectations high, just as they stayed quiet when everyone thought the first iPad would cost $1000. Maybe itâs for the same reason: maybe the Edition wonât be completely unreasonably priced for a piece of electronic jewelry that will probably be completely obsolete in five years but happens to be encased in a thousand bucks worth of solid gold. Letting people believe itâll cost so much will make the real price seem like a great deal when itâs announced.Thatâs certainly possible. But what makes me think otherwise is that $1000 was the rumored starting price for the iPad. When Steve Jobs unveiled the â$499â slide, it was our collective expectation for the iPadâs entry-level price that was exceeded. (I remember being in the Yerba Buena theater at that moment â everyone, yours truly included, was genuinely surprised by that. It was palpable.) The âbestâ iPad â 64 GB with cellular networking â cost $829, which isnât that much less than $1000. With Apple Watch we know the starting price: $349. What we donât know is how much the higher-end models will cost. â©ï¸Previous:	N/A

On pgiguere1âs list, the 42mm Sport models are $30 more expensive than the corresponding 38mm ones: $349/379. Iâm torn on whether this will be the case. Apple isnât referring to the two sizes as womenâs and menâs â some women will wear the 42 and some men (and, I suspect, many boys) will wear the 38 â but in broad strokes the 38 is the womenâs version and the 42 is the menâs. You can see that in the high-end leather straps. The feminine âModern Buckleâ is only available for the 38mm size, and the âLeather Loopâ is only available for 42mm.âBigger costs moreâ makes sense â and itâs true for most Apple products, from iPhones to iPads to MacBooks. But with those products, your choice of device size is a matter of taste and personal preference. With Apple Watch, your choice of size is in large part determined by your anatomy.If I had to wager today, Iâd bet that 42mm models will cost more across all three collections. A nominal difference for Apple Sport â $349/379 looks right to my eyes. The difference for Edition models could be $1000 or more because theyâre made from solid 18K gold. Iâm not sure what to expect for the steel ones, though. $100 difference?Bands as Stratifying DifferentiatorsI think Appleâs messaging back in September was misleading, and I donât think it was purposeful. I think it was a mistake that they will correct on Monday.In September, the basic message was something like this: Watches are personal, and different people have different tastes, so we created a wide variety of bands to choose from so you can pick one that reflects your taste, and we made them easy to swap so you can change them depending on your mood or the occasion.Most people took that to mean that your choice of band will largely be a matter of taste â that the various bands will be close to each other in terms of price. I know for a fact â from my email and tweets â that many Daring Fireball readers are hoping to buy an entry-level Apple Watch Sport and an optional Link Bracelet or Milanese Loop for maybe $150 or $200. And I also think most people expect the steel Apple Watches that come with the Link Bracelet or Milanese Loop to cost only, say, $150-200 more than the entry level models with the rubber â er, fluoroelastomer â bands.I donât think this is the case, at all.I wrote about this two weeks ago , and upon further consideration, I am now thinking that the various Apple Watch bands will be priced in significantly stratified tiers.Consider Appleâs description of what I am convinced is the highest-end strap, the Link Bracelet:Crafted from the same 316L stainless steel alloy as the case, the Link Bracelet has more than 100 components. The machining process is so precise, it takes nearly nine hours to cut the links for a single band. In part thatâs because they arenât simply a uniform size, but subtly increase in width as they approach the case. Once assembled, the links are brushed by hand to ensure that the texture follows the contours of the design. The custom butterfly closure folds neatly within the bracelet. And several links feature a simple release button, so you can add and remove links without any special tools. Available in stainless steel and space black stainless steel.Now, if you start with the assumptions that (a) the various watch bands are largely a matter of personal choice, (b) Apple will encourage Apple Watch buyers to mix and match bands, and (c) even the most expensive of them will only cost $200 or so, the above description reads as marketing braggadocio.But if you start with the premise that the top-of-the-line steel Apple Watch will cost $1499 or maybe even $1999, the above description makes more sense. Itâs an explanation for why the bracelet is so expensive. If it truly takes nine hours to cut the links for each band, and each one is polished by hand, and theyâre mechanically complex (and they definitely are), this is not a $200 bracelet. Iâm thinking itâs about $1000, judging by the description, and based on the prices for replacement stainless steel link bracelets from Rolex, Tudor, and Omega.The three collections of Apple Watch â Sport, steel, and Edition â will not, I think, be represented by three basic prices. Instead, the three collections will comprise a continuum of price points, ranging from $349 to $10,000 (or $20,000, if my hunch is correct that there are gold Link Bracelets waiting to be revealed).Here are my final guesses (38mm/42mm):Apple Watch Sport (all colors, with Sport Band): $349/399Apple Watch, steel, Sport Band: $749/799Apple Watch, steel, Classic Buckle: $849/899Apple Watch, steel, Milanese Loop: $949/999Apple Watch, steel, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $1199Apple Watch, steel, Leather Loop (42mm only): $1299Apple Watch, steel, Link Bracelet: $1499/1599Apple Watch, space black steel, Link Bracelet: $1899/1999Apple Watch Edition, Sport Band: $7499/7999Apple Watch Edition, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $9999Apple Watch Edition, Classic Buckle (42mm only): $10,999And purely based on my own speculation â the following configurations have not been announced, have not even been rumored, and have not been suggested to me by any sort of sources:Apple Watch Edition, Gold Milanese Loop: $14,999/$16,999Apple Watch Edition, Gold Link Bracelet: $17,999/$19,999In my first draft of this piece, I had the regular steel Link Bracelet models at $1899/1999, and the space black ones at $2299/2499, and thereâs a notion in my gut that I should have stuck with them. Iâm out on a limb here, and itâs quite possible Iâll be serving up some home-cooked claim chowder Monday. Every single number above other than $349 is truly just a guess on my part. My predictions are way higher than almost everyone elseâs:Marco Arment ($5000 starting price for Edition). 1Kirk McElhearn (steel starting at $500, Edition at $2000).Gene Munster (steel starting at $500, Edition starting at $5000 with an average sale price of $7500).Citi Group analyst Jim Suva (steel starting at $550, Edition at the cuckoo price of $950).Back in September, I wrote :When the prices of the steel and (especially) gold Apple Watches are announced, I expect the tech press to have the biggest collective shit-fit in the history of Apple-versus-the-standard-tech-industry shit-fits. The utilitarian mindset that asks âWhy would anyone waste money on a gold watch?â isnât going to be able to come to grips with what Apple is doing here. Theyâre going to say that Jony Ive and Tim Cook have lost their minds. Theyâre going to wear out their keyboards typing âThis never would have happened if Steve Jobs were alive.â Theyâre going to predict utter and humiliating failure . In short, theyâre going to mistake Apple for Vertu.The only thing I would change about this is that I now think itâs the steel Apple Watch pricing that is going to cause the massive collective shit-fit. Most people have wrapped their heads around the fact that the gold Edition models are going to cost at least $5000, and so have already written off Apple Watch Edition as something for the wealthy luxury market.But the steel Apple Watch, thatâs something that most people still look at as for them. And so they expect the starting price to be around $500, and the various leather and metal band options to cost $100-300 more.But if the starting price for the steel Apple Watch is $500, I donât see why Apple Watch Sport exists at $350. $150 difference does not justify the difference. If they were that close in price, thereâd only be one of them. Sport and steel only make sense as separate collections if the steel collection is significantly higher in price, even at the entry level with the rubber Sport band. People are looking at this as a $100-200 upsell, like going from 16 to 64 to 128 GB iPhones and iPads. Technically thatâs possible, but it doesnât make any sense to me strategically or in terms of operational efficiency. With storage tiers in iOS devices, the only difference is the capacity of the flash memory chip. Thatâs it. All the other components, and the machining and tooling required to produce them, are the same. With Sport and steel Apple Watches, everything you can see or touch is different. Different metal (aluminum vs. steel), different finishes (matte vs. highly-polished), different displays (glass vs. sapphire), different case backs (plastic vs. ceramic and sapphire). If the marketing argument doesnât persuade you, the operations angle should. I just donât see why Apple would bother with all this if the starting price for steel Apple Watch wasnât at least around double that of Sport.Thatâs why I think the pricing for the steel Apple Watch collection is whatâs going to raise a ruckus, because there are a lot of people who want one and expect that theyâll only have to pay $500 or $600, regardless of their strap preference.At the introduction event in September, Tim Cook explicitly billed Apple Watch as the next flagship product line in the companyâs history: Apple II, Macintosh, iPod, iPhone, iPad, and now the watch. There will be no brushing it off as a mere âhobbyâ if it isnât successful.The thing is, for all the griping about the prices that I expect come Monday, at $349, Apple Watch has the lowest entry-level price for any first-generation flagship product from Apple. The first iPod cost $399. The iPhone was $599 (before the infamous $200 price cut a few months later, which still left the entry model at $399). iPad was $499.The fact that so many people want the steel Apple Watch and non-Sport bands shows why they will cost more: desire. Apple sets prices not based on what people want to pay, but what people are willing to pay.This is without question new territory for Apple. Theyâve never sold products with the same computing internals at different pricing tiers based solely on the luxuriousness of the materials.Third-Party BandsNo matter what the pricing is, third-party Apple Watch bands seem like an inevitable thing. But will Apple stock them in its stores? Will there be a Made for Apple Watch program to certify them? I donât think so.If Appleâs prices are as high as Iâm predicting, demand for third-party link bracelets and leather straps will be high. Itâll be interesting to see how it plays out. I never would have predicted the size and scope of todayâs iPhone case market back in 2007.The MessagingIf Iâm even close to correct regarding steel Apple Watch pricing, and if Iâm also correct that thereâs going to be a vociferous backlash, Apple has only itself to blame. The September event and Appleâs marketing to date have created the impression that the differences between collections are largely about style, not price.Using the name âApple Watchâ for the stainless steel collection â the collection with the widest variety of straps â clearly establishes it as the âregularâ collection. In turn, that has left many with the impression that it will be the best-selling, the most common, the one most people walk out of the store with â and thus priced near the $349 baseline.âApple Watch starts at $349â as the one and only mention of price left too much room for bad assumptions, I think.To play devilâs advocate, perhaps Apple did this deliberately. They showed all these different watch bands knowing that they would spark desire, and that people get their heart set on a certain combination based purely on how it looks â including combinations which they wouldnât have allowed themselves to consider in the first place if theyâd known the eventual price back in September. In other words, someone whoâs had their heart set on a model with the Milanese Loop, under the assumption that it would cost, say, $600, might still go ahead and buy it for $1200 even though they wouldnât have considered it in the first place if theyâd known it would cost $1200 back in September.I think that devilâs advocate take is over-thinking things. Itâs just the only explanation I can think of other than that Apple kind of botched the pricing expectations for Apple Watch. Actually, there is one other explanation I can think of: Apple didnât want its competition to know how much Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition were going to cost, and they decided the competitive value of keeping prices secret outweighed the value of setting accurate expectations for customers.Storage CapacityApple has revealed nothing about internal storage capacity in Apple Watch. I could see this playing out two ways:Apple never talks about storage capacity for Apple Watch. It becomes a âsecretâ tech spec, like the amount of RAM in iOS devices. Weâll figure it out once we get our hands on them, but it wonât be something Apple talks about.If they do talk about it, each collection will get its own tier. Say, 8 GB for Sport, 32 GB for steel, 64 GB for Edition.I donât think Apple Watch will need much storage, but theyâve said you can store music and photos directly on the device. So itâs not like storage doesnât matter at all. Itâs just another upsell to push people to higher-priced models.The Modular S1 and UpgradeabilityThereâs been a lot of speculation about the modular nature of Apple Watchâs S1 âcomputer on a chipâ. Why brag about that? Why encase the whole thing in resin? Why make this photograph ? My wild guess back in September: perhaps Apple Watch, or at least the Edition models, would be upgradeable in future years. Take it in for service, pay $500, walk out with your âoldâ Apple Watch Edition upgraded with an S2.I now think this theory is bunk. Not going to happen.Take a first generation iPhone. Now imagine if you could upgrade it to todayâs A8 SoC. Itâd be better than it was before, thatâs for sure. But itâd still have a low-resolution non-retina display. Itâd still be stuck with EDGE cellular networking. Itâd still have a crappy camera that couldnât even shoot video. Etc. The âcomputerâ inside Apple Watch isnât centrally important. Everything is important. The health sensors, the display, the battery, the Taptic Engine, the digital crown, the networking capabilities, everything.A few years from now we might have Apple Watches that support Wi-Fi or even cellular networking. They might go several days on a single charge. None of those improvements would come from an upgrade to an S2 or S3 chip.Iâd love to be wrong on this one, but I donât think it makes any sense. And if I am wrong, the upgrade would have to include the entire innards of the watch â new display, new electronics, new battery, new sensors. Everything but the case and the bands. That still seems unlikely to me, but itâs at least plausible. And it could put Apple Watch Edition on par with existing luxury watches in terms of lifespan. But even in that case, the modular nature of the S1 doesnât really have much to do with it.Lastly, many readers have suggested a trade-in program, where you could bring in your old Apple Watch Edition and get a significant trade-in on a new one. No way. First, as stated earlier, the value of the raw gold in a gold watch is just a small fraction of the price. Second, trading in used goods is not part of a luxury shopping experience.One More ThingHolding the event at Yerba Buena instead of the smaller confines of their campus Town Hall makes me think Apple has a lot to show. There must be more to learn about Apple Watchâs software and experience â Tim Cook even said so back in September, explaining that they simply didnât have enough time then to show more. Iâve heard that Apple has been hosting over 100 third-party developers and designers in Cupertino for the last month, to test and refine WatchKit apps on production Apple Watch hardware, so I expect a bunch of third-party Watch app demos too.The new Mac version of Photos is in public beta, so I expect a full demo of that and the now-complete iCloud Photos cross-device experience. And if theyâre going to talk about Mac software, maybe theyâll reveal the rumored 12-inch thinner-than-ever MacBook Air , too. My gut tells me the new MacBook Air could be ready, and it also tells me that the purported bigger iPad is not.Update: If Apple is ready to unveil the upcoming redesign of its retail stores, we will see Angela Ahrendtsâs first on-stage appearance since joining Apple last year.Marco expressed a thought Iâve considered myself:Appleâs letting the $10,000â20,000 guesses simmer in the press to set price expectations high, just as they stayed quiet when everyone thought the first iPad would cost $1000. Maybe itâs for the same reason: maybe the Edition wonât be completely unreasonably priced for a piece of electronic jewelry that will probably be completely obsolete in five years but happens to be encased in a thousand bucks worth of solid gold. Letting people believe itâll cost so much will make the real price seem like a great deal when itâs announced.Thatâs certainly possible. But what makes me think otherwise is that $1000 was the rumored starting price for the iPad. When Steve Jobs unveiled the â$499â slide, it was our collective expectation for the iPadâs entry-level price that was exceeded. (I remember being in the Yerba Buena theater at that moment â everyone, yours truly included, was genuinely surprised by that. It was palpable.) The âbestâ iPad â 64 GB with cellular networking â cost $829, which isnât that much less than $1000. With Apple Watch we know the starting price: $349. What we donât know is how much the higher-end models will cost. â©ï¸Previous:	N/A
https://www.emergent.info/Gruber-Apple-Watch-Edition-Sport-band	Claim: The gold Apple Watch Edition with a sport band will cost $7499/7999 USD.	false	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Edition', 'Apple Watch Price', 'Daring Fireball', 'Jon Gruber']	https://daringfireball.net/	https://daringfireball.net/2015/03/apple_watch_prelude	2015/03/07	Apple Watch PreludeSaturday, 7 March 2015I realize thereâs little purpose to further Apple Watch speculation at this point â in two days, weâll know most of the answers. But there is one good reason for last-minute speculation: this is fun. Apple tends to be such a predictable company that we often know the basic gist of what to expect before one of their media events. Not this time. The many unknowns surrounding the watch are what makes it so fun to ponder prior to next weekâs event. So letâs have some fun.First, thereâs this . The same day I published my piece on Apple Watch pricing, MacRumors forum member âpgiguere1â created a graphic with possible prices, posting it with the comment:I made this speculative price list based in large part on Gruberâs speculation:The graphic is a pastiche of genuine Apple marketing material. A trained eye can easily tell itâs not from Apple â the typefaces are ones Apple uses (San Francisco and Helvetica Neue) but the way theyâre used is wrong. But itâs close enough to fool many, and the image has now circled the social media globe several times. Iâve received at least 50 emails and tweets from DF readers asking if Iâve seen this âleaked price listâ.So letâs put it to rest. This graphic is not a leaked price list. Itâs speculation from a MacRumors forum member who read my piece on Apple Watch pricing. And, I think, itâs off in numerous ways.But there is one thing about pgiguere1âs speculation that I hadnât really considered: that the 42mm models might cost more than the 38mm ones, across the board.

The September event and Appleâs marketing to date have created the impression that the differences between collections are largely about style, not price.Using the name âApple Watchâ for the stainless steel collection â the collection with the widest variety of straps â clearly establishes it as the âregularâ collection. In turn, that has left many with the impression that it will be the best-selling, the most common, the one most people walk out of the store with â and thus priced near the $349 baseline.âApple Watch starts at $349â as the one and only mention of price left too much room for bad assumptions, I think.To play devilâs advocate, perhaps Apple did this deliberately. They showed all these different watch bands knowing that they would spark desire, and that people get their heart set on a certain combination based purely on how it looks â including combinations which they wouldnât have allowed themselves to consider in the first place if theyâd known the eventual price back in September. In other words, someone whoâs had their heart set on a model with the Milanese Loop, under the assumption that it would cost, say, $600, might still go ahead and buy it for $1200 even though they wouldnât have considered it in the first place if theyâd known it would cost $1200 back in September.I think that devilâs advocate take is over-thinking things. Itâs just the only explanation I can think of other than that Apple kind of botched the pricing expectations for Apple Watch. Actually, there is one other explanation I can think of: Apple didnât want its competition to know how much Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition were going to cost, and they decided the competitive value of keeping prices secret outweighed the value of setting accurate expectations for customers.Storage CapacityApple has revealed nothing about internal storage capacity in Apple Watch. I could see this playing out two ways:Apple never talks about storage capacity for Apple Watch. It becomes a âsecretâ tech spec, like the amount of RAM in iOS devices. Weâll figure it out once we get our hands on them, but it wonât be something Apple talks about.If they do talk about it, each collection will get its own tier. Say, 8 GB for Sport, 32 GB for steel, 64 GB for Edition.I donât think Apple Watch will need much storage, but theyâve said you can store music and photos directly on the device. So itâs not like storage doesnât matter at all. Itâs just another upsell to push people to higher-priced models.The Modular S1 and UpgradeabilityThereâs been a lot of speculation about the modular nature of Apple Watchâs S1 âcomputer on a chipâ. Why brag about that? Why encase the whole thing in resin? Why make this photograph ? My wild guess back in September: perhaps Apple Watch, or at least the Edition models, would be upgradeable in future years. Take it in for service, pay $500, walk out with your âoldâ Apple Watch Edition upgraded with an S2.I now think this theory is bunk. Not going to happen.Take a first generation iPhone. Now imagine if you could upgrade it to todayâs A8 SoC. Itâd be better than it was before, thatâs for sure. But itâd still have a low-resolution non-retina display. Itâd still be stuck with EDGE cellular networking. Itâd still have a crappy camera that couldnât even shoot video. Etc. The âcomputerâ inside Apple Watch isnât centrally important. Everything is important. The health sensors, the display, the battery, the Taptic Engine, the digital crown, the networking capabilities, everything.A few years from now we might have Apple Watches that support Wi-Fi or even cellular networking. They might go several days on a single charge. None of those improvements would come from an upgrade to an S2 or S3 chip.Iâd love to be wrong on this one, but I donât think it makes any sense. And if I am wrong, the upgrade would have to include the entire innards of the watch â new display, new electronics, new battery, new sensors. Everything but the case and the bands. That still seems unlikely to me, but itâs at least plausible. And it could put Apple Watch Edition on par with existing luxury watches in terms of lifespan. But even in that case, the modular nature of the S1 doesnât really have much to do with it.Lastly, many readers have suggested a trade-in program, where you could bring in your old Apple Watch Edition and get a significant trade-in on a new one. No way. First, as stated earlier, the value of the raw gold in a gold watch is just a small fraction of the price. Second, trading in used goods is not part of a luxury shopping experience.One More ThingHolding the event at Yerba Buena instead of the smaller confines of their campus Town Hall makes me think Apple has a lot to show. There must be more to learn about Apple Watchâs software and experience â Tim Cook even said so back in September, explaining that they simply didnât have enough time then to show more. Iâve heard that Apple has been hosting over 100 third-party developers and designers in Cupertino for the last month, to test and refine WatchKit apps on production Apple Watch hardware, so I expect a bunch of third-party Watch app demos too.The new Mac version of Photos is in public beta, so I expect a full demo of that and the now-complete iCloud Photos cross-device experience. And if theyâre going to talk about Mac software, maybe theyâll reveal the rumored 12-inch thinner-than-ever MacBook Air , too. My gut tells me the new MacBook Air could be ready, and it also tells me that the purported bigger iPad is not.Update: If Apple is ready to unveil the upcoming redesign of its retail stores, we will see Angela Ahrendtsâs first on-stage appearance since joining Apple last year.Marco expressed a thought Iâve considered myself:Appleâs letting the $10,000â20,000 guesses simmer in the press to set price expectations high, just as they stayed quiet when everyone thought the first iPad would cost $1000. Maybe itâs for the same reason: maybe the Edition wonât be completely unreasonably priced for a piece of electronic jewelry that will probably be completely obsolete in five years but happens to be encased in a thousand bucks worth of solid gold. Letting people believe itâll cost so much will make the real price seem like a great deal when itâs announced.Thatâs certainly possible. But what makes me think otherwise is that $1000 was the rumored starting price for the iPad. When Steve Jobs unveiled the â$499â slide, it was our collective expectation for the iPadâs entry-level price that was exceeded. (I remember being in the Yerba Buena theater at that moment â everyone, yours truly included, was genuinely surprised by that. It was palpable.) The âbestâ iPad â 64 GB with cellular networking â cost $829, which isnât that much less than $1000. With Apple Watch we know the starting price: $349. What we donât know is how much the higher-end models will cost. â©ï¸Previous:	N/A
https://www.emergent.info/steel-Apple-Watch-sport-band	Claim: The steel Apple Watch with a sport band will cost $749/799 USD.	false	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Price', 'Daring Fireball', 'Jon Gruber']	https://daringfireball.net/	https://daringfireball.net/2015/03/apple_watch_prelude	2015/03/07	Apple Watch PreludeSaturday, 7 March 2015I realize thereâs little purpose to further Apple Watch speculation at this point â in two days, weâll know most of the answers. But there is one good reason for last-minute speculation: this is fun. Apple tends to be such a predictable company that we often know the basic gist of what to expect before one of their media events. Not this time. The many unknowns surrounding the watch are what makes it so fun to ponder prior to next weekâs event. So letâs have some fun.First, thereâs this . The same day I published my piece on Apple Watch pricing, MacRumors forum member âpgiguere1â created a graphic with possible prices, posting it with the comment:I made this speculative price list based in large part on Gruberâs speculation:The graphic is a pastiche of genuine Apple marketing material. A trained eye can easily tell itâs not from Apple â the typefaces are ones Apple uses (San Francisco and Helvetica Neue) but the way theyâre used is wrong. But itâs close enough to fool many, and the image has now circled the social media globe several times. Iâve received at least 50 emails and tweets from DF readers asking if Iâve seen this âleaked price listâ.So letâs put it to rest. This graphic is not a leaked price list. Itâs speculation from a MacRumors forum member who read my piece on Apple Watch pricing. And, I think, itâs off in numerous ways.But there is one thing about pgiguere1âs speculation that I hadnât really considered: that the 42mm models might cost more than the 38mm ones, across the board. On pgiguere1âs list, the 42mm Sport models are $30 more expensive than the corresponding 38mm ones: $349/379. Iâm torn on whether this will be the case. Apple isnât referring to the two sizes as womenâs and menâs â some women will wear the 42 and some men (and, I suspect, many boys) will wear the 38 â but in broad strokes the 38 is the womenâs version and the 42 is the menâs. You can see that in the high-end leather straps. The feminine âModern Buckleâ is only available for the 38mm size, and the âLeather Loopâ is only available for 42mm.âBigger costs moreâ makes sense â and itâs true for most Apple products, from iPhones to iPads to MacBooks. But with those products, your choice of device size is a matter of taste and personal preference. With Apple Watch, your choice of size is in large part determined by your anatomy.If I had to wager today, Iâd bet that 42mm models will cost more across all three collections. A nominal difference for Apple Sport â $349/379 looks right to my eyes. The difference for Edition models could be $1000 or more because theyâre made from solid 18K gold. Iâm not sure what to expect for the steel ones, though. $100 difference?Bands as Stratifying DifferentiatorsI think Appleâs messaging back in September was misleading, and I donât think it was purposeful. I think it was a mistake that they will correct on Monday.In September, the basic message was something like this: Watches are personal, and different people have different tastes, so we created a wide variety of bands to choose from so you can pick one that reflects your taste, and we made them easy to swap so you can change them depending on your mood or the occasion.Most people took that to mean that your choice of band will largely be a matter of taste â that the various bands will be close to each other in terms of price. I know for a fact â from my email and tweets â that many Daring Fireball readers are hoping to buy an entry-level Apple Watch Sport and an optional Link Bracelet or Milanese Loop for maybe $150 or $200. And I also think most people expect the steel Apple Watches that come with the Link Bracelet or Milanese Loop to cost only, say, $150-200 more than the entry level models with the rubber â er, fluoroelastomer â bands.I donât think this is the case, at all.I wrote about this two weeks ago , and upon further consideration, I am now thinking that the various Apple Watch bands will be priced in significantly stratified tiers.Consider Appleâs description of what I am convinced is the highest-end strap, the Link Bracelet:Crafted from the same 316L stainless steel alloy as the case, the Link Bracelet has more than 100 components. The machining process is so precise, it takes nearly nine hours to cut the links for a single band. In part thatâs because they arenât simply a uniform size, but subtly increase in width as they approach the case. Once assembled, the links are brushed by hand to ensure that the texture follows the contours of the design. The custom butterfly closure folds neatly within the bracelet. And several links feature a simple release button, so you can add and remove links without any special tools. Available in stainless steel and space black stainless steel.Now, if you start with the assumptions that (a) the various watch bands are largely a matter of personal choice, (b) Apple will encourage Apple Watch buyers to mix and match bands, and (c) even the most expensive of them will only cost $200 or so, the above description reads as marketing braggadocio.But if you start with the premise that the top-of-the-line steel Apple Watch will cost $1499 or maybe even $1999, the above description makes more sense. Itâs an explanation for why the bracelet is so expensive. If it truly takes nine hours to cut the links for each band, and each one is polished by hand, and theyâre mechanically complex (and they definitely are), this is not a $200 bracelet. Iâm thinking itâs about $1000, judging by the description, and based on the prices for replacement stainless steel link bracelets from Rolex, Tudor, and Omega.The three collections of Apple Watch â Sport, steel, and Edition â will not, I think, be represented by three basic prices. Instead, the three collections will comprise a continuum of price points, ranging from $349 to $10,000 (or $20,000, if my hunch is correct that there are gold Link Bracelets waiting to be revealed).Here are my final guesses (38mm/42mm):Apple Watch Sport (all colors, with Sport Band): $349/399Apple Watch, steel, Sport Band: $749/799Apple Watch, steel, Classic Buckle: $849/899Apple Watch, steel, Milanese Loop: $949/999Apple Watch, steel, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $1199Apple Watch, steel, Leather Loop (42mm only): $1299Apple Watch, steel, Link Bracelet: $1499/1599Apple Watch, space black steel, Link Bracelet: $1899/1999Apple Watch Edition, Sport Band: $7499/7999Apple Watch Edition, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $9999Apple Watch Edition, Classic Buckle (42mm only): $10,999And purely based on my own speculation â the following configurations have not been announced, have not even been rumored, and have not been suggested to me by any sort of sources:Apple Watch Edition, Gold Milanese Loop: $14,999/$16,999Apple Watch Edition, Gold Link Bracelet: $17,999/$19,999In my first draft of this piece, I had the regular steel Link Bracelet models at $1899/1999, and the space black ones at $2299/2499, and thereâs a notion in my gut that I should have stuck with them. Iâm out on a limb here, and itâs quite possible Iâll be serving up some home-cooked claim chowder Monday. Every single number above other than $349 is truly just a guess on my part. My predictions are way higher than almost everyone elseâs:Marco Arment ($5000 starting price for Edition). 1Kirk McElhearn (steel starting at $500, Edition at $2000).Gene Munster (steel starting at $500, Edition starting at $5000 with an average sale price of $7500).Citi Group analyst Jim Suva (steel starting at $550, Edition at the cuckoo price of $950).Back in September, I wrote :When the prices of the steel and (especially) gold Apple Watches are announced, I expect the tech press to have the biggest collective shit-fit in the history of Apple-versus-the-standard-tech-industry shit-fits. The utilitarian mindset that asks âWhy would anyone waste money on a gold watch?â isnât going to be able to come to grips with what Apple is doing here. Theyâre going to say that Jony Ive and Tim Cook have lost their minds. Theyâre going to wear out their keyboards typing âThis never would have happened if Steve Jobs were alive.â Theyâre going to predict utter and humiliating failure . In short, theyâre going to mistake Apple for Vertu.The only thing I would change about this is that I now think itâs the steel Apple Watch pricing that is going to cause the massive collective shit-fit. Most people have wrapped their heads around the fact that the gold Edition models are going to cost at least $5000, and so have already written off Apple Watch Edition as something for the wealthy luxury market.But the steel Apple Watch, thatâs something that most people still look at as for them. And so they expect the starting price to be around $500, and the various leather and metal band options to cost $100-300 more.But if the starting price for the steel Apple Watch is $500, I donât see why Apple Watch Sport exists at $350. $150 difference does not justify the difference. If they were that close in price, thereâd only be one of them. Sport and steel only make sense as separate collections if the steel collection is significantly higher in price, even at the entry level with the rubber Sport band. People are looking at this as a $100-200 upsell, like going from 16 to 64 to 128 GB iPhones and iPads. Technically thatâs possible, but it doesnât make any sense to me strategically or in terms of operational efficiency. With storage tiers in iOS devices, the only difference is the capacity of the flash memory chip. Thatâs it. All the other components, and the machining and tooling required to produce them, are the same. With Sport and steel Apple Watches, everything you can see or touch is different. Different metal (aluminum vs. steel), different finishes (matte vs. highly-polished), different displays (glass vs. sapphire), different case backs (plastic vs. ceramic and sapphire). If the marketing argument doesnât persuade you, the operations angle should. I just donât see why Apple would bother with all this if the starting price for steel Apple Watch wasnât at least around double that of Sport.Thatâs why I think the pricing for the steel Apple Watch collection is whatâs going to raise a ruckus, because there are a lot of people who want one and expect that theyâll only have to pay $500 or $600, regardless of their strap preference.At the introduction event in September, Tim Cook explicitly billed Apple Watch as the next flagship product line in the companyâs history: Apple II, Macintosh, iPod, iPhone, iPad, and now the watch. There will be no brushing it off as a mere âhobbyâ if it isnât successful.The thing is, for all the griping about the prices that I expect come Monday, at $349, Apple Watch has the lowest entry-level price for any first-generation flagship product from Apple. The first iPod cost $399. The iPhone was $599 (before the infamous $200 price cut a few months later, which still left the entry model at $399). iPad was $499.The fact that so many people want the steel Apple Watch and non-Sport bands shows why they will cost more: desire. Apple sets prices not based on what people want to pay, but what people are willing to pay.This is without question new territory for Apple. Theyâve never sold products with the same computing internals at different pricing tiers based solely on the luxuriousness of the materials.Third-Party BandsNo matter what the pricing is, third-party Apple Watch bands seem like an inevitable thing. But will Apple stock them in its stores? Will there be a Made for Apple Watch program to certify them? I donât think so.If Appleâs prices are as high as Iâm predicting, demand for third-party link bracelets and leather straps will be high. Itâll be interesting to see how it plays out. I never would have predicted the size and scope of todayâs iPhone case market back in 2007.The MessagingIf Iâm even close to correct regarding steel Apple Watch pricing, and if Iâm also correct that thereâs going to be a vociferous backlash, Apple has only itself to blame. The September event and Appleâs marketing to date have created the impression that the differences between collections are largely about style, not price.Using the name âApple Watchâ for the stainless steel collection â the collection with the widest variety of straps â clearly establishes it as the âregularâ collection.

I think it was a mistake that they will correct on Monday.In September, the basic message was something like this: Watches are personal, and different people have different tastes, so we created a wide variety of bands to choose from so you can pick one that reflects your taste, and we made them easy to swap so you can change them depending on your mood or the occasion.Most people took that to mean that your choice of band will largely be a matter of taste â that the various bands will be close to each other in terms of price. I know for a fact â from my email and tweets â that many Daring Fireball readers are hoping to buy an entry-level Apple Watch Sport and an optional Link Bracelet or Milanese Loop for maybe $150 or $200. And I also think most people expect the steel Apple Watches that come with the Link Bracelet or Milanese Loop to cost only, say, $150-200 more than the entry level models with the rubber â er, fluoroelastomer â bands.I donât think this is the case, at all.I wrote about this two weeks ago , and upon further consideration, I am now thinking that the various Apple Watch bands will be priced in significantly stratified tiers.Consider Appleâs description of what I am convinced is the highest-end strap, the Link Bracelet:Crafted from the same 316L stainless steel alloy as the case, the Link Bracelet has more than 100 components. The machining process is so precise, it takes nearly nine hours to cut the links for a single band. In part thatâs because they arenât simply a uniform size, but subtly increase in width as they approach the case. Once assembled, the links are brushed by hand to ensure that the texture follows the contours of the design. The custom butterfly closure folds neatly within the bracelet. And several links feature a simple release button, so you can add and remove links without any special tools. Available in stainless steel and space black stainless steel.Now, if you start with the assumptions that (a) the various watch bands are largely a matter of personal choice, (b) Apple will encourage Apple Watch buyers to mix and match bands, and (c) even the most expensive of them will only cost $200 or so, the above description reads as marketing braggadocio.But if you start with the premise that the top-of-the-line steel Apple Watch will cost $1499 or maybe even $1999, the above description makes more sense. Itâs an explanation for why the bracelet is so expensive. If it truly takes nine hours to cut the links for each band, and each one is polished by hand, and theyâre mechanically complex (and they definitely are), this is not a $200 bracelet. Iâm thinking itâs about $1000, judging by the description, and based on the prices for replacement stainless steel link bracelets from Rolex, Tudor, and Omega.The three collections of Apple Watch â Sport, steel, and Edition â will not, I think, be represented by three basic prices. Instead, the three collections will comprise a continuum of price points, ranging from $349 to $10,000 (or $20,000, if my hunch is correct that there are gold Link Bracelets waiting to be revealed).Here are my final guesses (38mm/42mm):Apple Watch Sport (all colors, with Sport Band): $349/399Apple Watch, steel, Sport Band: $749/799Apple Watch, steel, Classic Buckle: $849/899Apple Watch, steel, Milanese Loop: $949/999Apple Watch, steel, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $1199Apple Watch, steel, Leather Loop (42mm only): $1299Apple Watch, steel, Link Bracelet: $1499/1599Apple Watch, space black steel, Link Bracelet: $1899/1999Apple Watch Edition, Sport Band: $7499/7999Apple Watch Edition, Modern Buckle (38mm only): $9999Apple Watch Edition, Classic Buckle (42mm only): $10,999And purely based on my own speculation â the following configurations have not been announced, have not even been rumored, and have not been suggested to me by any sort of sources:Apple Watch Edition, Gold Milanese Loop: $14,999/$16,999Apple Watch Edition, Gold Link Bracelet: $17,999/$19,999In my first draft of this piece, I had the regular steel Link Bracelet models at $1899/1999, and the space black ones at $2299/2499, and thereâs a notion in my gut that I should have stuck with them. Iâm out on a limb here, and itâs quite possible Iâll be serving up some home-cooked claim chowder Monday. Every single number above other than $349 is truly just a guess on my part. My predictions are way higher than almost everyone elseâs:Marco Arment ($5000 starting price for Edition). 1Kirk McElhearn (steel starting at $500, Edition at $2000).Gene Munster (steel starting at $500, Edition starting at $5000 with an average sale price of $7500).Citi Group analyst Jim Suva (steel starting at $550, Edition at the cuckoo price of $950).Back in September, I wrote :When the prices of the steel and (especially) gold Apple Watches are announced, I expect the tech press to have the biggest collective shit-fit in the history of Apple-versus-the-standard-tech-industry shit-fits. The utilitarian mindset that asks âWhy would anyone waste money on a gold watch?â isnât going to be able to come to grips with what Apple is doing here. Theyâre going to say that Jony Ive and Tim Cook have lost their minds. Theyâre going to wear out their keyboards typing âThis never would have happened if Steve Jobs were alive.â Theyâre going to predict utter and humiliating failure . In short, theyâre going to mistake Apple for Vertu.The only thing I would change about this is that I now think itâs the steel Apple Watch pricing that is going to cause the massive collective shit-fit. Most people have wrapped their heads around the fact that the gold Edition models are going to cost at least $5000, and so have already written off Apple Watch Edition as something for the wealthy luxury market.But the steel Apple Watch, thatâs something that most people still look at as for them. And so they expect the starting price to be around $500, and the various leather and metal band options to cost $100-300 more.But if the starting price for the steel Apple Watch is $500, I donât see why Apple Watch Sport exists at $350. $150 difference does not justify the difference. If they were that close in price, thereâd only be one of them. Sport and steel only make sense as separate collections if the steel collection is significantly higher in price, even at the entry level with the rubber Sport band. People are looking at this as a $100-200 upsell, like going from 16 to 64 to 128 GB iPhones and iPads. Technically thatâs possible, but it doesnât make any sense to me strategically or in terms of operational efficiency. With storage tiers in iOS devices, the only difference is the capacity of the flash memory chip. Thatâs it. All the other components, and the machining and tooling required to produce them, are the same. With Sport and steel Apple Watches, everything you can see or touch is different. Different metal (aluminum vs. steel), different finishes (matte vs. highly-polished), different displays (glass vs. sapphire), different case backs (plastic vs. ceramic and sapphire). If the marketing argument doesnât persuade you, the operations angle should. I just donât see why Apple would bother with all this if the starting price for steel Apple Watch wasnât at least around double that of Sport.Thatâs why I think the pricing for the steel Apple Watch collection is whatâs going to raise a ruckus, because there are a lot of people who want one and expect that theyâll only have to pay $500 or $600, regardless of their strap preference.At the introduction event in September, Tim Cook explicitly billed Apple Watch as the next flagship product line in the companyâs history: Apple II, Macintosh, iPod, iPhone, iPad, and now the watch. There will be no brushing it off as a mere âhobbyâ if it isnât successful.The thing is, for all the griping about the prices that I expect come Monday, at $349, Apple Watch has the lowest entry-level price for any first-generation flagship product from Apple. The first iPod cost $399. The iPhone was $599 (before the infamous $200 price cut a few months later, which still left the entry model at $399). iPad was $499.The fact that so many people want the steel Apple Watch and non-Sport bands shows why they will cost more: desire. Apple sets prices not based on what people want to pay, but what people are willing to pay.This is without question new territory for Apple. Theyâve never sold products with the same computing internals at different pricing tiers based solely on the luxuriousness of the materials.Third-Party BandsNo matter what the pricing is, third-party Apple Watch bands seem like an inevitable thing. But will Apple stock them in its stores? Will there be a Made for Apple Watch program to certify them? I donât think so.If Appleâs prices are as high as Iâm predicting, demand for third-party link bracelets and leather straps will be high. Itâll be interesting to see how it plays out. I never would have predicted the size and scope of todayâs iPhone case market back in 2007.The MessagingIf Iâm even close to correct regarding steel Apple Watch pricing, and if Iâm also correct that thereâs going to be a vociferous backlash, Apple has only itself to blame. The September event and Appleâs marketing to date have created the impression that the differences between collections are largely about style, not price.Using the name âApple Watchâ for the stainless steel collection â the collection with the widest variety of straps â clearly establishes it as the âregularâ collection. In turn, that has left many with the impression that it will be the best-selling, the most common, the one most people walk out of the store with â and thus priced near the $349 baseline.âApple Watch starts at $349â as the one and only mention of price left too much room for bad assumptions, I think.To play devilâs advocate, perhaps Apple did this deliberately. They showed all these different watch bands knowing that they would spark desire, and that people get their heart set on a certain combination based purely on how it looks â including combinations which they wouldnât have allowed themselves to consider in the first place if theyâd known the eventual price back in September. In other words, someone whoâs had their heart set on a model with the Milanese Loop, under the assumption that it would cost, say, $600, might still go ahead and buy it for $1200 even though they wouldnât have considered it in the first place if theyâd known it would cost $1200 back in September.I think that devilâs advocate take is over-thinking things. Itâs just the only explanation I can think of other than that Apple kind of botched the pricing expectations for Apple Watch. Actually, there is one other explanation I can think of: Apple didnât want its competition to know how much Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition were going to cost, and they decided the competitive value of keeping prices secret outweighed the value of setting accurate expectations for customers.Storage CapacityApple has revealed nothing about internal storage capacity in Apple Watch. I could see this playing out two ways:Apple never talks about storage capacity for Apple Watch. It becomes a âsecretâ tech spec, like the amount of RAM in iOS devices. Weâll figure it out once we get our hands on them, but it wonât be something Apple talks about.If they do talk about it, each collection will get its own tier. Say, 8 GB for Sport, 32 GB for steel, 64 GB for Edition.I donât think Apple Watch will need much storage, but theyâve said you can store music and photos directly on the device. So itâs not like storage doesnât matter at all. Itâs just another upsell to push people to higher-priced models.The Modular S1 and UpgradeabilityThereâs been a lot of speculation about the modular nature of Apple Watchâs S1 âcomputer on a chipâ. Why brag about that? Why encase the whole thing in resin? Why make this photograph ? My wild guess back in September: perhaps Apple Watch, or at least the Edition models, would be upgradeable in future years. Take it in for service, pay $500, walk out with your âoldâ Apple Watch Edition upgraded with an S2.I now think this theory is bunk. Not going to happen.Take a first generation iPhone. Now imagine if you could upgrade it to todayâs A8 SoC. Itâd be better than it was before, thatâs for sure. But itâd still have a low-resolution non-retina display. Itâd still be stuck with EDGE cellular networking. Itâd still have a crappy camera that couldnât even shoot video. Etc. The âcomputerâ inside Apple Watch isnât centrally important. Everything is important. The health sensors, the display, the battery, the Taptic Engine, the digital crown, the networking capabilities, everything.A few years from now we might have Apple Watches that support Wi-Fi or even cellular networking. They might go several days on a single charge. None of those improvements would come from an upgrade to an S2 or S3 chip.Iâd love to be wrong on this one, but I donât think it makes any sense. And if I am wrong, the upgrade would have to include the entire innards of the watch â new display, new electronics, new battery, new sensors. Everything but the case and the bands. That still seems unlikely to me, but itâs at least plausible. And it could put Apple Watch Edition on par with existing luxury watches in terms of lifespan. But even in that case, the modular nature of the S1 doesnât really have much to do with it.Lastly, many readers have suggested a trade-in program, where you could bring in your old Apple Watch Edition and get a significant trade-in on a new one. No way. First, as stated earlier, the value of the raw gold in a gold watch is just a small fraction of the price. Second, trading in used goods is not part of a luxury shopping experience.One More ThingHolding the event at Yerba Buena instead of the smaller confines of their campus Town Hall makes me think Apple has a lot to show. There must be more to learn about Apple Watchâs software and experience â Tim Cook even said so back in September, explaining that they simply didnât have enough time then to show more. Iâve heard that Apple has been hosting over 100 third-party developers and designers in Cupertino for the last month, to test and refine WatchKit apps on production Apple Watch hardware, so I expect a bunch of third-party Watch app demos too.The new Mac version of Photos is in public beta, so I expect a full demo of that and the now-complete iCloud Photos cross-device experience. And if theyâre going to talk about Mac software, maybe theyâll reveal the rumored 12-inch thinner-than-ever MacBook Air , too. My gut tells me the new MacBook Air could be ready, and it also tells me that the purported bigger iPad is not.Update: If Apple is ready to unveil the upcoming redesign of its retail stores, we will see Angela Ahrendtsâs first on-stage appearance since joining Apple last year.Marco expressed a thought Iâve considered myself:Appleâs letting the $10,000â20,000 guesses simmer in the press to set price expectations high, just as they stayed quiet when everyone thought the first iPad would cost $1000. Maybe itâs for the same reason: maybe the Edition wonât be completely unreasonably priced for a piece of electronic jewelry that will probably be completely obsolete in five years but happens to be encased in a thousand bucks worth of solid gold. Letting people believe itâll cost so much will make the real price seem like a great deal when itâs announced.Thatâs certainly possible. But what makes me think otherwise is that $1000 was the rumored starting price for the iPad. When Steve Jobs unveiled the â$499â slide, it was our collective expectation for the iPadâs entry-level price that was exceeded. (I remember being in the Yerba Buena theater at that moment â everyone, yours truly included, was genuinely surprised by that. It was palpable.) The âbestâ iPad â 64 GB with cellular networking â cost $829, which isnât that much less than $1000. With Apple Watch we know the starting price: $349. What we donât know is how much the higher-end models will cost. â©ï¸Previous:	N/A

Such followers, who would become impotent, can be used as potent weapon against his enemiesâ.Hans Raj was a sadhu in Dera Sacha Sauda from 1996 to 2012 and worked as a musician for Dera chiefâs religious programmes.Hans Raj said he was awed by Dera chiefâs power. But when one after another sadhus who dared to raise voice against the chief were eliminated, he decided to face his fear by filing petition for a CBI probe in July, 2012.The court had then directed the state government to investigate the case and a medical examination found his testis surgically removed, which is in sync with his claims that over 400 followers were castrated at Sirsa Dera. On why they agreed to undergo castration, Gurdas Singh Toor alias Bitu (46), a witness in this case, claimed it was done on the pretext that removing testis would lead to salvation. âCastrated followers were not allowed to meet their family or venture outside DSS campus on their own,â he said.While handing over the probe to CBI, the HC had observed that Haryana policeâs investigation was worthless.Dera Sacha Sauda spokesperson Dr Aditya Insan rubbished the allegations. He said all the allegations were false and baseless and the petitioner in the case had left dera 3 years ago. He said the controversies were the handiwork of drug mafia who were up in arms against them.	N/A
https://www.emergent.info/Jihadi-John-is-Mohammed-Emwazi	Claim: 'Jihadi John' is a Londoner named Mohammed Emwazi	unverified	['ISIS', 'Jihadi John', 'Mohammed Emwazi', 'Washington Post']	https://www.washingtonpost.com/	https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/jihadi-john-the-islamic-state-killer-behind-the-mask-is-a-young-londoner/2015/02/25/d6dbab16-bc43-11e4-bdfa-b8e8f594e6ee_story.html	2015/02/26	 LONDON â The world knows him as âJihadi John,â the masked man with a British accent who has beheaded several hostages held by the Islamic State and who taunts audiences in videos circulated widely online. But his real name, according to friends and others familiar with his case, is Mohammed Emwazi, a Briton from a well-to-do family who grew up in West London and graduated from college with a degree in computer programming. He is believed to have traveled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined the Islamic State, the group whose barbarity he has come to symbolize. âI have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John,â said one of Emwaziâs close friends who identified him in an interview with The Washington Post. âHe was like a brother to me. . . . A representative of a British human rights group who had been in contact with Emwazi before he left for Syria also said he believed Emwazi was Jihadi John, a moniker given to him by some of the hostages he once held. âThis is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person,â Qureshi added. Authorities have used a variety of investigative techniques, including voice analysis and interviews with former hostages, to try to identify Jihadi John. James B. Comey, the director of the FBI, said in September â only a month after the Briton was seen in a video killing American journalist James Foley â that officials believed they had succeeded. Nevertheless, the identity of Jihadi John has remained shrouded in secrecy. Since Foleyâs killing, he has appeared in a series of videos documenting the gruesome killings of other hostages, including four other Westerners, some of whom he personally beheaded. In each, he is dressed in all black, a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose. He wears a holster under his left arm. A spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Washington said: âOur prime minister has been clear that we want all those who have committed murder on behalf of ISIL to face justice for the appalling acts carried out. There is an ongoing police investigation into the murder of hostages by ISIL in Syria. It is not appropriate for the government to comment on any part of it while this continues.â ISIL is another name for the Islamic State. U.S. officials declined to comment for this report. Emwaziâs family declined a request for an interview, citing legal advice. The Kuwaiti-born Emwazi, in his mid-20s, appears to have left little trail on social media or elsewhere online. Those who knew him say he was polite and had a penchant for wearing stylish clothes while adhering to the tenets of his Islamic faith. He had a beard and was mindful of making eye contact with women, friends said. He was raised in a middle-class neighborhood in London and on occasion prayed at a mosque in Greenwich. The friends, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the investigation, believe that Emwazi started to radicalize after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster. Emwazi and two friends â a German convert to Islam named Omar and another man, Abu Talib â never made it on the trip. Once they landed in Dar es Salaam, in May 2009, they were detained by police and held overnight. Itâs unclear whether the reason for the detention was made clear to the three, but they were eventually deported. Emwazi flew to Amsterdam, where he claimed that an officer from MI5, Britainâs domestic security agency, accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates in the southern part of the country, according to e-mails that he sent to Qureshi and that were provided to The Post. Emwazi denied the accusation and claimed that MI5 representatives had tried to recruit him. But a former hostage said Jihadi John was obsessed with Somalia and made his captives watch videos about al-Shabab, which is allied with al-Qaeda. The episode was described in the Independent, a British newspaper, which identified Emwazi as Muhammad ibn Muazzam. Emwazi and his friends were allowed to return to Britain, where he met with Qureshi in the fall of 2009 to discuss what had happened. âMohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated,â Qureshi said. Shortly afterward, Emwazi decided to move to his birthplace, Kuwait, where he landed a job working for a computer company, according to the e-mails he wrote to Qureshi. He came back to London twice, the second time to finalize his wedding plans to a woman in Kuwait. In June 2010, however, counterterrorism officials in Britain detained him again â this time fingerprinting him and searching his belongings. When he tried to fly back to Kuwait the next day, he was prevented from doing so. âI had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started,â he wrote in a June 2010 e-mail to Qureshi. But now âI feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London. Nearly four months later, when a court in New York sentenced Aafia Siddiqui, an al-Qaeda operative convicted for the attempted murder of U.S. personnel in Afghanistan, Emwazi expressed sympathy for her, saying he had âheard the upsetting news regarding our sister. . . . In the interview, Qureshi said he last heard from Emwazi in January 2012, when Emwazi sent him an e-mail seeking advice. âThis is a young man who was ready to exhaust every single kind of avenue within the machinery of the state to bring a change for his personal situation,â Qureshi said. Close friends of Emwaziâs also said his situation in London had made him desperate to leave the country. Itâs unclear exactly when he reached Syria or how. One friend said he believed Emwazi wanted to travel to Saudi Arabia to teach English in 2012 but was unsuccessful. Soon afterward, the friend said, he was gone. âHe was upset and wanted to start a life elsewhere,â one of the friends said. Once in Syria, Emwazi contacted his family and at least one of his friends. Itâs unclear what he told them about his activities there. A former hostage who was debriefed by officials upon release said that Jihadi John was part of a team guarding Western captives at a prison in Idlib, Syria, in 2013. The hostages nicknamed the facility âthe box.â Emwazi was joined by two other men with British accents, including one who was dubbed âGeorge.â A former hostage said Emwazi participated in the waterboarding of four Western hostages. Former hostages described George as the leader of the trio. Jihadi John, they said, was quiet and intelligent. âHe was the most deliberate,â a former hostage said. Beginning in early 2014, the hostages were moved to a prison in the Syrian city of Raqqa, the Islamic Stateâs de facto capital, where they were visited often by the trio. They appeared to have taken on more powerful roles within the Islamic State.

(Updated: Feb. 24, 2015 8:49 P.M.)GAZA CITY (Ma'an) -- Hundreds of Palestinians were evacuated from their homes Sunday morning after Israeli authorities opened a number of dams near the border, flooding the Gaza Valley in the wake of a recent severe winter storm.The Gaza Ministry of Interior said in a statement that civil defense services and teams from the Ministry of Public Works had evacuated more than 80 families from both sides of the Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) after their homes flooded as water levels reached more than three meters.Gaza has experienced flooding in recent days amid a major storm that saw temperatures drop and frigid rain pour down.The storm displaced dozens and caused hardship for tens of thousands, including many of the approximately 110,000 Palestinians left homeless by Israel's assault over summer.The suffering is compounded by the fact that Israel has maintained a complete siege over Gaza for the last eight years, severely limiting electricity and the availability of fuel for generators. It has also prevented the displaced from rebuilding their homes, as construction materials are largely banned from entering.Gaza civil defense services spokesman Muhammad al-Midana warned that further harm could be caused if Israel opens up more dams in the area, noting that water is currently flowing at a high speed from the Israel border through the valley and into the Mediterranean sea.Evacuated families have been sent to shelters sponsored by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, in al-Bureij refugee camp and in al-Zahra neighborhood in the central Gaza Strip.The Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) is a wetland located in the central Gaza Strip between al-Nuseirat refugee camp and al-Moghraqa. It is called HaBesor in Hebrew, and it flows from two streams -- one whose source runs from near Beersheba, and the other from near Hebron.Israeli dams on the river to collect rainwater have dried up the wetlands inside Gaza, and destroyed the only source of surface water in the area.Locals have continued to use it to dispose of their waste for lack of other ways to do so, however, creating an environmental hazard.This is not the first time Israeli authorities have opened the Gaza Valley dams.In Dec. 2013, Israeli authorities also opened the dams amid heavy flooding in the Gaza Strip. The resulting floods damaged dozens of homes and forces many families in the area from their homes.In 2010, the dams were opened as well, forcing 100 families from their homes. At the time civil defense services said that they had managed to save seven people who had been at risk of drowning.Related	N/A

Aldeson.âDetermining an official cause of death could take as long as 3 weeks,â said County Coroner Frank Shultz. âItâs just too early to tell what caused his tragic death.âThe shocking news comes just days after a recent â60 Minutesâ interview where Nelson was quoted as saying âLife is good and I have never felt better or been happier.âThis story is still developing and all information is not yet officially verified.Related Posts	N/A
https://www.emergent.info/priest-says-god-is-female	Claim: A Catholic priest who was declared clinically dead says he met God and she's a woman	false	['Catholic Church', 'Fake News', 'Hoaxes', 'World News Daily Report']	https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/	https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/catholic-priest-who-died-for-48-minutes-claims-that-god-is-a-woman/	2015/02/22	 Share8K TweetBoston | A Catholic priest from Massachusetts was officially dead for more than 48 minutes before medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart. During that time, Father John Micheal ONeal claims he went to heaven and met God, which he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure.The 71-year old cleric was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival.With the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, that kept the blood flowing to his brain, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm.The doctors were afraid he would have suffered some brain damage from the incident, but he woke up less than 48 hours later and seems to have perfectly recovered.Doctors at the Massachusetts General Hospital say that Father ONeal is extremely lucky to be alive, while he is convinced that it is God who sent him back to tell the world who she really is.The elderly man claims that he has clear and vivid memories of what happened to him while he was dead.He describes a strange out-of-body experience, experiencing an intense feeling of unconditional love and acceptance, as well as being surrounded by an overwhelming light.He claims that at that point in his experience, he went to heaven and encountered God, which he describes as a feminine, mother-like Being of Light.Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting states the Catholic priest. She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mothers embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesnt disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the Catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days, causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.The Archbishop of Boston, Cardinal Sean P. OMalley, made a public statement this morning stating that Father Oneal suffered hallucinations linked to a near-death experience and that God clearly isnt a female.Despite the disapproval of his superiors, Father ONeal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the Holy Mother.I wish to continue preaching says the elderly cleric. I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman...The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston has not confirmed, however, if they will allow Father ONeal to resume his preaching in his former parish in South Boston.

Chief Executive Officer Shane Smith paid for a $300,000 Las Vegas dinner last month, according to a person who asked not to be identified because the meal was private. Smith, a Vice co-founder, had been on a lucky gambling run, the person said.Brooklyn-based Vice has grown from a free, whiskey-stained Montreal monthly into a media titan. Technology Crossover Ventures and A+E Networks each invested $250 million for 10 percent stakes in the company last year.After Gawker published complaints about Viceâs low wages and freelance pay last year, the company released a statement describing the insurance, vacation days and stock program for its employees. Smith, 45, gave $1 million to staff at last yearâs holiday party, Gawker reported.The cost of the meal at the Bellagio casinoâs Prime Steakhouse was reported by Bloomberg News earlier Wednesday, after MGM Resorts International revealed on an earnings call Tuesday that unidentified guests had enjoyed a $300,000 meal. The dinner was held during the Consumer Electronics Show, according to MGM Chief Financial Officer Dan DâArrigo.It was a party of 12, MGM spokesman Clark Dumont said in an e-mail. A guest at the dinner, who asked not to be identified, put the number closer to 25.âNo brainer quiz. What media co exec did I watch win $100k at blackjack last nite?â David Carr, the New York Times media columnist wrote last month on Twitter, weeks before his death at 58. âHint: gambling not his only vice.â(Updates with number of attendees in sixth paragraph.)Share	N/A

Read MoreRAMPUR: All was going well at the wedding ceremony of 25-year-old Jugal Kishore, a resident of Moradabad, and his 23-year-old bride Indira from Rampur. That's until the ""varmala"" ceremony, where the groom garlands his would-be wife, began.Just as he extended his arms to do that, Kishore had an epileptic fit, falling to the ground in front of the whole gathering.The young bride, angry that her family had been kept in the dark about Kishoreâs medical condition, promptly changed her mind and announced that she would happily marry at the same ceremony a guest at the wedding, a man called Harpal Singh. The latter, incidentally, turned out to be her sister's brother-in-law.Singh, caught unawares and dressed in jeans and a leather jacket, fumbled for a moment before declaring he would willingly take Indira as his wife. This time the ""varmala"" was exchanged between Singh and Indira, which went off without any hitch, with the pandit reciting the mantras and asking the new couple to take the seven ""pheras"".Meanwhile, Kishore, who had been rushed to a doctor by his relatives, went back to the venue after he regained consciousness to see that his wife-to-be was now someone else's.Kishore pleaded with Indira, telling her that he would not be able to face friends and neighbours if he returned without her. His relatives, too, tried to intervene on his behalf. Where persuasion failed, violence was used â spoons, plates and dishes became weapons as wedding guests tried to force the bride to change her mind. But all in vain. The young woman stood firm.Kishore and his relatives later filed an FIR at the Milak police station in Rampur district, which they eventually withdrew after elders intervened. SHO, Milak police station, RP Solanki said on Monday that cops had detained a few people who were there at the wedding.âBoth families have amicably resolved the matter,"" Solanki said. ""The complaints have been withdrawn. Kishore and his family have now returned in peace to Moradabad.âGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App .

https://www.emergent.info/feminist-blogger-abortion	Claim: A woman aborted a fetus after discovering it was male	unverified	['Abortion', 'Blogging', 'Feminism', 'Hoaxes']	https://injusticestories.com/	https://injusticestories.com/i-aborted-my-baby-because-it-was-a-boy/	2015/02/11	I Aborted My Baby â Because it was a Boy13158Facebook TwitterShareOver the past 3 years, I have lost many friends, and several of my own family members have completely cut off communication with me. I now know that these are âadultsâ who just cannot handle the fact that I have the right to make choices, and that these choices ultimately hardly even affect them.1/17/15 â Editorâs note: Due to the large number of interview requests, I have extended an invitation to the author to post her response to the comments and general negative feelings towards her. I will post an update as soon as she responds.In the spring of 2012, I found out that I was pregnant. I had a good idea who the donator was, but money wasnât really an issue, and I knew that I would be a good mother-like figure for the child by myself. I have always believed in the right for all women to have a choice in terminating their pregnancy, but when I confirmed the diagnosis about a month into into it, I decided that I WAS ready to have this child.My journey has taken me to many different places fighting for womenâs rights and carrying the banner of the Feminist Movement, even to the point of eschewing a career. One of the more prominent themes that I saw in these places was that men generally would look down on us, refuse to help us, or hardly even lend an ear so that we could air our grievances. This didnât surprise me, the patriarchy has been well entrenched since the dawn of time, but here I was, here I am, ready to change it.One of the more alarming incidents happened while I was on my way to San Francisco to participate in an Occupy Wall Street rally. I sat down in my seat on the plane, which happened to be extra full for that day, and a particularly well dressed man happened to be sitting in the seat beside me, in the aisle. After takeoff, he asked me what I was going to San Francisco for, while I generally wouldnât talk to a man sitting next to me on an airplane, I told him I was going to the OWS rally.The man literally scoffed when I spoke those words and leaned in and quietly said to me âB****** like you need to learn their placeâ. Stunned, I screamed âASSAULT!â while other passengers looked at us, the woman across the aisle from him immediately told him to get away from me, but not 5 seconds passed before a flight attendant had rushed over to intervene.Â [sociallocker id=â86â³]Â As I explained to the flight attendant what had happened and I demanded to move seats, I was told that there were only 2 other open seats available, both back in Economy.*Trigger warning* â Extreme patriarchyBy this time, a male flight attendant was on the scene and I told him to have the man moved. The woman-hater just laughed as the flight attendant continued to press me on if he made any physical contact with me. For a moment, I contemplated bending the truth in order to get the woman-hater away from me. His words had violated both my feelings, and my trust, perhaps as much of a violation as actual physical touch. In the end, I confirmed that no physical contact was made, to which both flight attendants told me they couldnât make him move.I was flabbergasted, and then betrayed as they recommended that I move to one of the empty seats. This left me in tears. I knew the only way to get away was to move seats so I did so tearfully and having felt as though I had been verbally and emotionally raped.By the time we landed, my outlook had changed, I could no longer depend on men to be an ally of the cause.As spring turned into summer and my belly started to grow, my mind ran wild with the thoughts of teaching my daughter from a young age tolerance and feminist ideals. Choosing the right all-girls daycare, then elementary school, all so that she could grow up and thrive in an environment where women are told that they can do anything that they want to do. No man will be around to hurt her progress, no boys there to demean her or call her names.I had already started buying gender neutral clothing since I did not want outside influences affecting what gender she would ultimately become. My research on nannies one day came to an abrupt end when my cell phone alarm went off â time for my 5 month appointment. These early appointments had gone well enough, my baby was progressing in a healthy manner.Today, my doctor, who I will call âSandyâ did an ultrasound and everything appeared to be fine. âWould you like to know the gender?â Sandy asked. I thought to myself âThat machine is an ultrasound, not a crystal ball, you couldnât tell me the gender of my baby even if you wanted toââSureâ was my response.âItâs a boyââ¦..â¦â¦âWhat?â I managed to sputter. Sandy then showed me on the ultrasound how exactly my body had betrayed me even worse than the misogynistic suit jockey on the airplane so many months before. I was in shock, I started crying, weeping at the thought of what I was about to curse the world with.On my way home, my driver asked if I was ok and if I needed anything. âJUST STOP RIGHT HEREâ I yelled. Deciding to walk the 4 blocks back home. My home became my prison and my fetus became my warden the next 48 hours. Crying, sobbing, uncontrollable weeping, mental anguish the likes of which may only be experienced by those who have had their lives destroyed by war, I was a refugee, and my home was my refugee camp, an unfamiliar place that was justâ¦.sheltering me.By the third day, I started regaining some of my mental strength and knew what I had to do. I couldnât bring another monster into the world. We already have enough enemies as it is. It didnât matter that I would be raising a son, he would still come into contact with boys, men, perhaps even the suit jockey who would inevitably twist his carefully constructed upbringing with their kindness. He would think âThese men arenât so bad, why would mom say that they are holding me down?âNot all men are bad, my driver showed genuine concern for my well-being that day and I may have taken my anger out on him. That may have been uncalled for. But I knew what I had to do.A few days later, I went in for the procedure, as it was fairly later in my pregnancy, I was aware there were certain risks, but it went off without a hitch. My bodyâs betrayal was no more, I was free, and for the first time since the airplane incident, I felt strong. I had done something positive, something that would actually make a difference, something good, even though as I would find out, many others wouldnât see it that way.Today, I have a beautiful 1 year old female who will hopefully grow up to be just as strong and driven as her mother. I have endured a lot regarding my first pregnancy, but I donât care. Sometimes, even allies will turn on you, but I donât care.I stand by my decision to abort my baby because it was a male.I donât hate men, I hate the patriarchy, what men, and even some women, turn into, I wasnât going to let that happen with my offspring. The chances were greater that it would with a male, it was unacceptable.If the curse returns, I would do the exact same thing all over again.[/sociallocker]30 thoughts on âI Aborted My Baby â Because it was a BoyâMy internet name says:TL:DR womans meets an asshole on a plane, who happens to be a man, falsely claims assault and 5 MONTHS aborts a boy because itâs a boy EVEN THOUGH she made a point of raising her girl gender neutral.Dave Spiller says:Doesnât all-girl daycare and schooling just reinforce the gender divide, telling boys and girls they are defined by their sex?Totally says:No no no, this is gender equality did you even read the tags. Itâs all good, all good.Sammy says:January 17, 2015 at 10:11 amThis is not meant to be hateful or condescending so please please read this. I feel like youâre taking the wrong mentality with this. Part of how we change society is by teaching our children. If your child is a boy, you can help change society by teaching him that misogyny is wrong and to treat women with respect and equality. He would then, in turn pass that on to his children, and so on, and so forth. Iâm not saying a girl doesnât also have the power to change things for the better but when the issue lies with the way men think, you had a chance to bring a respectful male into the world who would then be helping to pass on that mentality. I support a womanâs right to an abortion because there are several reasons why it might be necessary. Be it an inability to care for the child, the womanâs life being in danger, or an unwanted pregnancy due to rape, just to name a few. However I feel the gender of your child is not a valid reason as itâs extremely superficial and even somewhat hypocritical, especially when gender is a social construct anyway. Nothing can be changed and what youâve done cannot be taken back so I wonât dwell on it and berate you for it but I do sincerely hope that if you ever have any more children, please give them all an equal chance, regardless of gender. If the child is a boy, use it as an opportunity to teach them whatâs right so they can pass it down. If the child is a girl, then teach them to be strong like you currently are with your daughter. The gender of your child should never matter and by being selective, all youâre doing is supporting inequality in either gender.Disa says:January 27, 2015 at 10:33 amAGREED! Doesnât matter the gender of your child, it is your child so you get to teach them what you think is right and they will pick that up and teach it to more people, male or female. Boy children are not born with any hatred for women. They are born with compassion and love for their mother and or other caretaker. Their mother, father, or other caretakers are who teach the child who to hate, not their assigned gender.Ashish says:ââTeach them to be strong like you currently areâââ¦.Sabrina Parnas says:January 17, 2015 at 12:42 pmYou are a sick and twisted individual. A man hater like no other. Having a young child that is male, it makes me think that you could just abort it because it was a boy. You donât deserve to have children if you discriminate based on their sex. You are no worse than all the men who are misogynist.Although I am very much pro choice, I find your reasoning flawed and disturbing. I hope you wonât damage your child with your vitriol.And where is the gender equality, if you are ready to abort at the first sign that it is a boy.Michael G says:January 17, 2015 at 2:39 pmYour loss.

You are a misandrist, plain and simple.Jen says:thatâs the most immature thing done by a sane adult.unborn says:You clearly have no idea what assault is.Ted says:January 25, 2015 at 6:37 pmWhile I find the choice horrendous, I canât fault the logic involved. If abortion is truly a womanâs choice, then what business is it of ours to question the reasons behind her choice? As I see it, there are only two possibilities*:A fetus is a meaningless bundle of tissue, without whatever makes life worthy of protection.or:A fetus is a human being.If the first is true, then what difference does it make why she had the abortion? It was a lifeless ball of inanimate matter. It was no more legally or morally wrong than choosing to play checkers, or choosing not to. And if the second is true, again, why should it matter? Aborting for ANY reason would be murder. (health reasons may leave no alternative, but the result is still a purposefully dead child) In either case, the reasoning behind the decision to abort is irrelevant. The only question is whether the concept of abortion (for non-health reasons) is morally defensible.*Of course, itâs entirely possible that a fetus is both, starting as lifeless, then becoming human at some point. In that case, no one knows when that transition occurs, leaving us again with only the above two choices.Joe Wilson says:That was disturbing and sad.scott not scared to use my real name mother fucking rodger says:I dont even have words.Ravi says:Umâ¦not clear on how a fetus can be called a âboy.â It could easily have been a trans girl, gay boy or non-binary person.

YOU my dear are not a feminist, aborting your child because itâs a boy :-0.. The anger that fills me right now can not be put into words. Women like you give the rest of us who are feminists an awful name.I have a son, I adore him and heâs my world. . My husband is an amazing caring smart guy whom i hope my son takes after and weâll do our best to help him grown into a wonder man.All I see from this is hatred of men instead of thinking you could have helped bring a wonderful man into the world you chose to KILL him. . Itâs heartbreaking.Iâm not against abortion for the RIGHT reasons.. Medical or rape but because itâs the wrong gender??????.Feminist you are not! And I as one am ashamed of youwhy says:Love how you delete hateful comments so much for freedom of speech.Bombe 20 says:January 29, 2015 at 4:20 pmLet me start by saying this: I totally respect and support the right of every woman to decide whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term. For any reason at all. A pregnancy has all sorts of effects on the body (and the mind) and while I find the slogan âmy body, my choiceâ a bit too slogan-ish, I consider it basically correct.Now, I do think it is too late for an abortion once the fetus could be kept alive outside the womb, but that is a different discussion.But I have just had a look into my crystal ball and learned a few interesting about your daughter:In one to two years, she will find out that she has a sex â that she is a girl. And she will strongly defend that. She will love Arielle and Barbie and all things pink. She will want to be a princess for Halloween.Maybe you will try to push her in a different direction. You will give her a toy car. She will cuddle it, give it a name and put it to bed. Then you will give her a toy plane. She will make sure the plane becomes friends with the car and put them to bed together. You will give her toy tools. She will use the hammer as a baby bottle to feed the plane and the car. And sheâll still like pink.Sure, you will try to reason with her, argue with her, maybe shout at her. But that wonât change anything. At the most, she will learn not to talk about what she likes because it upsets mommy; in that case, you will not have liberated her, you will have broken her.Eventually she will learn what you did. That you betrayed her out of having an elder brother. An elder brother who would have loved her, cherished her, protected her. Maybe you will be able to outwardly convince her that your decision and your reasons were right. But deep inside she will despise you.And somewhere around 13 to 16 years of age she will start to rebel. On whatever the internet looks like then, she will find intelligent, thoughful and outspoken women like Erin Pizzey, Karen Staughan and the rest of the Honey Badgers. She will listen to what they have to say, see that it has merit and she will think of what you did to her brother.And she will become a vocal Menâs Human Rights Activist. You will have raised the next leader of the MHRM. Just by being who you are, doing what you do.Like making light of a horrendous crime. A man on a plane says something mean to you and you have the gall to claim you feel like you had been raped? Can you even imagine how reading such a sentence must feel to an actual victim of rape?But maybe you do. Everything that you write makes it very clear that you are harboring some kind of trauma. Maybe something really bad happened to you at some point in your life, maybe you even inherited it from your parents.But one thing is very clear: Joining a hateful ideology is not a healthy and productive way to process trauma. Therapy is.B20January 29, 2015 at 8:42 pmWhat the author is describing, frankly, is full-on, cold-blooded, willful, premeditated murder, and a hate crime against that. Misandry doesnât begin to cover it. Whatever wrongs you may have suffered in your life, you had no right take it out on your child like that. Thatâs flat-out inhuman. And yes, you earned every bit of derision and disgust expressed in these comments.Duffy says:January 29, 2015 at 9:13 pmâOne of the more alarming incidents happened while I was on my way to San Francisco to participate in an Occupy Wall Street rally.â ââ¦â¦and I demanded to move seats, I was told that there were only 2 other open seats available, both back in Economy.â*Trigger warning* â Extreme Sense of entitlement coupled with a shocking lack of self awareness.Noneya says:January 29, 2015 at 10:36 pmThere is no love that is like the love a son feels for his mother. From infancy, tiny hands clutching helplessly, embracing the loving warmth of his motherâs touch, to the childhood years of bumps and bruises and the tender healing love that only a mother provides.And you threw that all away. There are no going back. When you are lying down at night in bed, cold and alone, maybe then youâll feel consequence. When your bed is a few degrees colder, and the spot next to you is empty and barren, where someone with absolute love and adoration could have been, nestled lovingly against you.	N/A

https://www.emergent.info/brokaw-wants-williams-fired	Claim: Tom Brokaw wants Brian Williams fired	false	['Brian Williams', 'NBC', 'Tom Brokaw']	https://pagesix.com/	https://pagesix.com/2015/02/05/tom-brokaw-wants-brian-williams-fired/	2015/02/06	You know youre in trouble when Tom Brokaw is out for your blood.NBCs most revered journalist is furious that Brian Williams is still in the anchor chair after he sheepishly admitted he hadnt traveled on a helicopter hit by enemy fire.Brokaw wants Williams head on a platter, an NBC source said. He is making a lot of noise at NBC that a lesser journalist or producer would have been immediately fired or suspended for a false report.On Wednesday, Williams, 55, acknowledged that he had repeatedly said he was aboard a chopper that had been hit by a rocket-propelled grenade during a 2003 reporting trip to Iraq, when he was actually safely traveling in a different aircraft.Brokaw, 74, was still the Nightly News anchor when Williams came back from his Iraq expedition and an insider said he knew the story Williams later spouted was bunk.Tom Brokaw and [former NBC News President] Steve Capus knew this was a false story for a long time and have been extremely uncomfortable with it, the source said.NBC News execs had counseled him to stop telling the tale.Williams still took the anchors seat for his Nightly News broadcast Thursday evening and was working at 30 Rock all day despite calls for his dismissal. He didnt address the issue during the broadcast.He is not going to be suspended or reprimanded in any way. He has the full support of NBC News, a network source said.Modal TriggerMany of Williams colleagues believe his claim that he simply conflated two versions of what happened in 2003.There have been meetings about it all day. They are taking it very seriously, the NBC source said.But we believe that Brians apology on the air speaks for himself. He admitted over time he conflated the events.NBC brass hasnt been talking to lower-level employees about the situation, leaving people in a panic, the insider said.NBC bosses dont understand how serious this is. Nobody in a leadership position is talking to the troops. Nobody has addressed it, the source said.One longtime NBC employee who has worked with Williams on several occasions had a few dirty words to describe the celebrated anchor, calling him a real pompous piece of st.Hes an ahole, he fumed. Hes not a journalist. Hes a reader.Oh, the fireworks that are going off inside, he said. Its embarrassing. Hes the face on NBC. Hes a liar.Everyone knew it.On Friday, Brokaw responded to reports that he wanted Williams axed.I have neither demanded nor suggested Brian be fired, Brokaw said in an email to The Huffington Post. His future is up to Brian and NBC News executives. Additional reporting by Danika FearsShare this:FacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy 	N/A

https://www.emergent.info/woman-cat-coat-hoax	Claim: An 85-year-old woman was arrested for making fur coats out of her neighbors' cats	false	['Animals', 'Fake News', 'Hoaxes', 'Texas']	https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/	https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/little-old-lady-arrested-for-making-fur-coats-with-neighbors-cats/	2015/01/07	 Share962K TweetWaco | An 85-year-old Texas woman has been arrested by local law enforcement after being caught on film kidnapping one of her neighbors cats with which she is accused of making fur coats.The recent disappearance of domestic animals in the neighborhood started to arise suspicion from local residents when some people started to notice the old ladys particular fur coats, some even recognizing their cats in the coats furs, a fact the lady vehemently denied before being caught on videotape by a private detective hired by local residents to follow the suspicious lady.It is believed the old lady started at first to raise her own cats but finally decided to capture neighboring cats because she got too much attached to the little critters, she admitted in court.It is estimated she used over 30 cats to make one single fur coat and over 20 fur coats were found in her house during the arrestA cruel operationThe retired fashion designer lured neighborhood cats with food and skinned them in her basement where she dried the skins.She also used the meat of the cats to lure other cats who unwittingly were eating their own species, a disgusting and cruel hobby admits local PETA spokeswoman Jane Churchill.I cant believe these atrocities happened in our own backyard. Animals are our brothers and sisters and what she has done to my eyes is comparable to mass murder she explains. She has taken the lives of hundreds of cats just to make fur coats out of them, this is tragic. How would people react if someone made coats out of human skin? These cats are living beings and all living beings are equal to Mother Earth. I hope she goes to jail for a very long time Legal experts assess the 85-year-old woman could spend up to 18 months in jail for her crimes. Share962K Tweet 	N/A

Our intent is to have a cleaner menu board that is easier for customers to absorb, spokeswoman Lisa McComb said in a statement. To do so we must simplify our current menu.This means the end of the Big Mac, apple pie and large size menu items. Currently, the Big Mac has a whopping 550 calories and 29g of fat. The Apple pie contains 250 cal, and it would take a full 69 minute to walk that off! With that being said, those two menu items were not a tough decision for elimination.McDonalds is currently testing out a new version of their slim down menu in Delaware, Little Rock, Waco, Bakersfield, Macon and Knoxville. They plan a full nationwide rollout beginning February 1, 2015.One notable ingredient preservatives might also be eliminated from the menu altogether. Mark Andres, President of McDonalds USA, sparked widespread speculation when he asked investors, Why do we need to have preservatives in our food? And then answered himself with a We probably dont.What do you think about this new menu transformation at McDonalds?

https://www.emergent.info/hackers-thank-sony-for-pulling-film	"Claim: The group behind the Sony hack sent a message to company execs praising their decision to pull ""The Interview"""	unverified	['Sony', 'The Interview']	https://money.cnn.com/	https://money.cnn.com/2014/12/19/media/insde-sony-hack-interview/index.html	2014/12/19	"Hackers to Sony: We'll stand down if you never release the movieby Brian Stelter @brianstelter December 19, 2014: 2:50 PM ETHackers claim they're done if film never airsThe hackers behind a devastating cyberattack at Sony Pictures have sent a new message to executives at the company, crediting them for a ""very wise"" decision to cancel the Christmas day release of ""The Interview,"" a source close to the company told CNN.The email message was received by Sony's top executives on Thursday night and was obtained by CNN.The source said that the company believes the email was from the hackers because it followed a pattern of previous messages, sent to a list of particular executives and formatted in a particular way.A Sony spokesman declined to comment.Also on Friday, President Obama said he disagreed with Sony's decision.""I am sympathetic to the concerns that they face. Having said all that, yes I think they made a mistake,"" Obama said at a White House press conference.""We cannot have a society where some dictator someplace can impose censorship here in the U.S.,"" he added.Obama: Sony made a 'mistake'Related: FBI: North Korea responsible for Sony hackThe FBI has officially linked the cyberattack at Sony to the North Korean government.""The destructive nature of this attack, coupled with its coercive nature, sets it apart,"" the FBI said in a statement.The Motion Picture Association of America called the hack a ""despicable, criminal act"" on Friday.""This situation is larger than a movie's release or the contents of someone's private emails,"" said Chris Dodd, CEO of the lobbying group. ""This is about the fact that criminals were able to hack in and steal what has now been identified as many times the volume of all of the printed material in the Library of Congress.""The hacker message is effectively a victory lap, telling the studio, ""Now we want you never let the movie released, distributed or leaked in any form of, for instance, DVD or piracy.""The message also says, ""And we want everything related to the movie, including its trailers, as well as its full version down from any website hosting them immediately.""It warns the studio executives that ""we still have your private and sensitive data"" and claims that they will ""ensure the security of your data unless you make additional trouble.""The email was titled ""Message from GOP."" The anonymous hackers have called themselves ""Guardians of Peace.""Sony is still reeling from the late November cyberattack that crippled its computer systems, and now it is under severe scrutiny for canceling the Christmas release of ""The Interview,"" Seth Rogen and James Franco's comedy about an attempted assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.U.S. officials now believe North Korea instigated the hack , lending credence to the Sony executives who privately started calling it a ""terrorist act"" weeks ago.Since the cancellation on Wednesday, the same executives have been wondering whether the leaks of private emails and corporate documents would now stop.Thursday night's message implied that the leaks will stop.In a statement on Wednesday when the film's release was scrapped, the company said ""we stand by our filmmakers and their right to free expression and are extremely disappointed by this outcome.""Many lashed out at the studio for its unprecedented decision to pull the movie. Others have rallied around Sony's predicament.George Clooney, in an interview with Deadline.com on Thursday, revealed that he had circulated a petition earlier in the week saying ""we fully support Sony's decision not to submit to these hackers' demands"" -- but no one was willing to sign it.""It was a large number of people. It was sent to basically the heads of every place,"" Clooney said without naming names.The petition said, ""This is not just an attack on Sony. It involves every studio, every network, every business and every individual in this country,"" and it concluded, ""We hope these hackers are brought to justice but until they are, we will not stand in fear. We will stand together.""It's outdated now, since Sony did cancel ""The Interview."" In the interview, Clooney expressed sadness that ""as we watched one group be completely vilified, nobody stood up.""CNNMoney (New York) First published December 19, 2014: 10:12 AM ET"	N/A

https://www.emergent.info/robot-security-guards-microsoft	Claim: Robot security guards are patrolling a Microsoft campus in Silicon Valley	false	['Microsoft', 'Robots']	https://www.extremetech.com/	https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/194338-here-come-the-autonomous-robot-security-guards-what-could-possibly-go-wrong	2014/11/25	Here come the autonomous robot security guards: What could possibly go wrong?Here come the autonomous robot security guards: What could possibly go wrong?By Sebastian Anthony on November 17, 2014 at 8:58 amCommentThis site may earn affiliate commissions from the links on this page. Terms of use .Showing a rather shocking disregard for the long-term safety of human civilization, Microsoft has become one of the first companies to deploy autonomous robot security guards. Dubbed the K5, Microsoftâs Silicon Valley campus was being policed last week by five of theseÂ roughly human-sized 300-pound (136 kg) robots, each equipped with enough cameras, sensors, artificial intelligence, and alarms that they can replace most human security patrols. Fortunately, despite looking like uncomfortably like a Dalek from the Doctor Who universe, the K5 is not (yet)Â equipped with a ray gun or any other method for harming or detaining humans.Updated: Microsoft contacted ExtremeTech to tell us that the robots were only temporarily deployed at its Silicon Valley campus, as part of a demonstration put on by Knightscope. Microsoft PR says it isnât âaware of any future plansâ to deploy such robots.The K5 , built by the Californian company Knightscope,Â is billed rather euphemistically as an âautonomous data machineâ that provides a âcommanding but friendly physical presence.â Basically, itâs a security guard on wheels. Inside that rather large casing (itâs 5 foot tall!) there are four high-def cameras facing in each direction, another camera that can do car license plate recognition, four microphones, gentle alarms, blaring sirens, weather sensors, and WiFi connectivity so that each robot can contact HQ if thereâs some kind of security breach/situation. For navigating the environment, thereâs GPS and âlaser scanningâ ( LIDAR I guess).Â And of course, at the heart of each K5 is a computer running artificial intelligence software that integrates all of that data and tries to make intelligent inferences â like, should I tell HQ about that large gathering of teenagers, or should that man be climbing in through that window?K5 security robot. The lights can change color (red for trouble, orange for caution, etc.)If a K5 decides that thereâs a situation, it can use one of its built-in sirens to try and diffuse things â or it can message HQ to summon a human. If you step in front of the K5, or otherwise interfere with it, it will gently warn you with some chimes â but if you donât move, an âear-piercing alarmâ is triggered . Other than its sirens and its rather imposing design, the K5 isnât equipped with any weapons or other tools for resolving situations. (Does anyone else think it looks like the lovechild of a Dalek and EVE from WALL-E?)A slightly odd photo of a US sheriff holding a gun to the head of a K5 robotK5 isnât just for catching criminals, either: If you find yourself in trouble/danger, thereâs also a button on the top of the robot thatÂ summons help from HQ.Read: Microsoft wants to be part of Judgment Day, tooThe purpose of the K5, like most robots, is straightforward: To replaceÂ expensive human workers. The K5 can run for around 24 hours on a single battery charge, automatically navigates back to the charging point when itâs running low, and only takes 15-20 minutes to recharge. Obviously, in the long run, this is cheaper and more efficient than a human security guard â plus, as technology improves, the K5 will probablyÂ be more vigilant and capable of spotting smaller discrepancies than a human. In theory, because of the lower cost, you could also field lots ofÂ K5 robots, reducing the number of potential holes in security coverage.It goes without saying, though, that deploying a fleet of roughly human-sized, autonomous robots is just a little bit scary. At the very least, a 300-pound robot wouldÂ cause a lot of damage if it ran into something â a car, a shop window, a child. In all likelihood, though, if these robotic security guards are popular, theyâll eventually be equipped with weapons â perhaps a taser for subduing a suspect, and a tear gas launcher for clearing groups of people. At that point, you need to be really sure thatÂ the AI is free of bugs.	N/A
https://www.emergent.info/amazon-streaming-video	Claim: Amazon will launch an ad-supported video streaming service in early 2015	unverified	['Amazon', 'Video']	https://nypost.com/	https://nypost.com/2014/11/21/amazon-plans-a-streaming-video-alternative/	2014/11/23	Amazon boss Jeff Bezos is primed and ready for a fresh assault on the streaming-video space.The e-commerce giant will roll out a new ad-supported streaming offering early next year that will be separate from its $99-a-year Prime membership, which includes a video service, sources said.The ad-supported option part of an overhaul of its media offerings poses a serious challenge to streaming rivals such as Hulu and Netflix, analysts said.If they do an ad-supported service, they will decouple it from Prime and that is a Netflix killer, Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. It wont be $99 a year.Pachter suggested Amazon would undercut Netflixs current monthly price of $7.99.Who wouldnt switch if you were poor or youre a cord-cutter? he added.Although it will be separate from Prime, the ad-supported service is ultimately a bid by Amazon to lure people to eventually pay up for Prime membership, said one ad source familiar with Amazons plans.The main point is to bring in more users that you can eventually up-sell to Prime, or to get to a broader audience that doesnt want to pay for Prime, in order to increase their video share, the source said.The Wall Street Journal reported in March that Amazon was weighing such a move, but sources confirmed that its a definite go.Amazon is prepping a new attack at a time when its video service is gaining ground, sources said. Amazon doesnt disclose the number of Prime members, but RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney estimates it has 50 million global customers.While Primes big draw has been two-day shipping, about half of Prime subscribers use the video service that is included with it, or around 25 million, sources said. By comparison, Netflix has 33 million domestic subscribers.A recent Sandvine study also shows that Amazon is making major strides but has a long way to go before catching Netflix. Amazons broadband traffic on fixed networks grew from 1.61 percent to 2.58 percent, the study showed. One change is that Amazon snagged popular HBO content, including The Wire, True Blood and Boardwalk Empire. Netflix accounts for 32.39 percent of aggregate traffic.Rumors have been rampant that Amazon plans to let advertisers into its media ecosystem. Amazon has already experimented with ads in some shows, according to tech site Re/code.For advertisers, the service could be the Holy Grail in terms of targeting. In theory, Amazon could tell if ads viewed online led to purchases on its retail site.The news that Nielsen will start rating shows on subscription video services starting with Netflix is likely to encourage advertisers who want to make the leap without forcing Amazon to give up its own data.Amazon will also have leverage over content producers when it comes to the way it chooses to promote shows and movies within its growing ecosystem, a Hollywood source said.Amazon didnt return a call seeking comment.Share this:FacebookTwitterGoogleFacebook MessengerWhatsAppEmailCopy 	N/A

There has been quite a few people pretending to be 'the sun' but only I could tell you the real story.""The 19-year-old broke the news on Facebook (SWNS.com)In 1996, her mother, Anji Smith, 44, took her to Edenbridge Hospital to be weighed and a health visitor, who had been asked by Ragdoll Productions to find smiley babies, put Jess's name forward.Mrs Smith said it was never intended to be a big thing: ""It was just something a bit different to do and we didn't expect it to be as big as it was.""They just sat her in front of a camera and she just laughed and smiled at her dad.""We didn't hear anything until we got a letter when she was 18 months old saying she'd been picked.""It was really weird seeing her on television.""Jess was put in a high chair for the filming so she would be looking down like the sun.Her furniture deliverer father Bill, 49, made her giggle by playing with a teddy bear behind the camera.And as no one could predict the success of the show, Jess was paid just Â£250 for filming and given a box of toys to take home."

Variety reported on Oct. 15 that Bale was in talks to star in âJobs,â Sonyâs biopic about the late Apple co-founder. Writer Aaron Sorkin recently confirmed the Bale casting. Jessica Chastain is being eyed for an unspecified role. Based on Walter Isaacsonâs biography âSteve Jobs,â the real-life drama is directed by Oscar-winner Danny Boyle. Scott Rudin is producing the tech drama along with Mark Gordon and Guymon Casady. Sorkin, who also penned the Facebook drama âThe Social Network,â has publicly said the movie will be divided into three long scenes, each taking place backstage before one of Appleâs famous product launches. Sony acquired rights following the Apple mogulâs death in 2011. Wozniak founded Apple with Jobs and Ronald Wayne and is credited with launching the AppleÂ I and AppleÂ II computers in the late 1970s, which had a profound impact on the microcomputer revolution. He left Apple as a full-time employee in 1987. Last yearâs independently financed âJobsâ starred Ashton Kutcher as Jobs and Josh Gad as Wozniak and covered the era from 1974 to 2001 when the iPod launched. Worldwide box office was modest at $36 million. He is represented by UTA, Principal Entertainment LA and attorney Fred Toczek.	N/A

https://www.emergent.info/ESPN-domestic-violence-panel	Claim: ESPN planned a special domestic violence panel that didn't include any women	false	['ESPN', 'NFL']	https://www.esquire.com/	https://www.esquire.com/blogs/news/espn-has-a-women-problem?src=soc_fcbks	2014/09/29	"Sep 26, 2014Rob Poetsch/FlickrUPDATE: The original opening sentence of this piece was widely interpreted as saying that ESPN was set to run a special panel, hosted only by men, which would address the specific subject of domestic violence in the NFL. In fact, we believed the pre-game show was to run as normal, with a segment on domestic violence. We apologize for the confusion that the language of our opening statement created and we have been told that ESPN was not planning to cover this topic in such a format and has covered domestic violence on air before with its female commentators . The first sentence and headline have been amended to reflect this change.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowAdditionally, we would like to apologize for saying that ESPN is not in the business of journalism. They have produced excellent journalism over the years, such as last year's NFL At a Crossroads: Investigating a Health Crisis .âKate Lewis, VP, Content Operations & Editorial DirectorESPN has issued a statement in response to this story, as seen below.Statement from John Wildhack, ESPN EVP, Programming and ProductionContrary to published reports in Esquire, there was no panel on domestic violence ever planned for tonight's Monday Night Countdown. We will present our normal Monday Night Football pre-game show, with Suzy Kolber hosting. ESPN is proud of the work it has done covering the issue of domestic violence, and is committed to continued coverage. Much of that work has been informed by several talented female colleagues from our television and espnW platforms, including Hannah Storm, Jemele Hill, Jane McManus, Kate Fagan, Sarah Spain and more.Here is a rundown of tonight's show .On Monday night, during Monday Night Football's two-hour pregame show, I thought it likely that the regular commentators were going to discuss domestic abuse in the NFL. Last week, seven men, but no women, discussed Ray Rice's punishment in the opening block of Monday Night Countdown. Victims of domestic violence in America are most likely to be women aged 20-24 .When the show has updates from the fieldâbrief reports about injuries and the upcoming gameâthey'll cut to female sideline reporters, Lisa Salters and, on some weeks, Suzy Kolber.These people are not allowed at the table.On Monday, you will hear the voices of 11 men tripping over themselves to condemn the actions of one man who knocked his wife unconscious and dragged her motionless body into a casino lobby, and another man who head-butted his wife because she would not have sex with him.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowYou will hear their beliefs on the commissioner who did not punish Ray Rice appropriately and whose investigation into Rice's domestic violence incident is currently unclear, and might have been intentionally obfuscated or covered up.But you will not hear these words: ""Roger Goodell is a liar.""You will not hear these words because ESPN has a $15.2 billion broadcasting agreement with the NFL. You will not hear these words because it would interfere with the amount of money both ESPN and the NFL can make.You will not hear these words because ESPN has intimidated its on-air staff into standing down against domestic violence.Last week, ESPN suspended one of its editors, Bill Simmons, for calling NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell ""a liar"" and daring his bosses to suspend him for it. They suspended him for it.Long-tenured editors and personalities of ESPN: It is now time for you to walk out with him.This is the kind of moment that separates a ""journalist"" from a ""commentator."" What do you want to be?Simmons' suspension at ESPN will last three weeksâone week longer than Ray Rice's initial suspension by Goodell himself. Ray Rice punched his fiancÃ©e in the face, knocking her unconscious. Bill Simmons called the head of a corporate interest a liar. His suspension is one of the longest in the history of his company .Simmons' ascendence is credited to his willingness to say sentences exactly like this. By refusing to wait in line or repeat pabulum and talking points all the way to a potential columnist job later in life, he gained an audience. The network hired Simmons to absorb his growing readership into its offshoot Page 2 section, developing a major success in spite of itself.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowSimmons disabused the language of testosterone-soaked talking heads, and it worked. He avoided the intentionally adversarial outrage only created for TV ratings purposes, like the collection of recent controversies by Stephen A. Smith.Before the second, damning tape in the Ray Rice incident became available, Smith initially attempted to deflect the blame of Ray Rice's domestic incident onto Rice's fiancÃ©e , Janay.[pullquote align='C']""What I've tried to employ the female members of my family â some of who you all met and talked to and what have youâis that: Let's make sure we don't do anything to provoke wrong actions. Because if I comeâor somebody else come, whether it's law enforcement officials, your brother or the fellas that you knowâif we come after somebody (who) has put their hands on you, it doesn't negate the fact that they already put their hands on you.""Advertisement - Continue Reading Below[/pullquote]Smith had seen Ray Rice dragging a lifeless body out of an elevator and assumed the victim was somehow asking for it.He was suspended for one week for those comments. Bill Simmons was suspended for three weeks.Not even six weeks after returning from his suspension, Smith was back on First Take, an ESPN morning debate show, having a partial statement read to him from the National Organization for Women about Roger Goodell and Ray Rice. In the statement, NOW President Terry O'Neill implored Goodell to resign. Exactly 39 seconds after hearing her words for the first time in his life, Smith said that the President for the National Organization for Women had ""lost her mind.""Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below""I'm sorry, I think this woman is off her rocker. I think she's lost her mind. That's right, I said it. This is the most ridiculous nonsense I've ever heard in my life. Roger Goodell deserves to lose his job?"" he said. ""That's crazy. That's crazy.""It was a temper tantrum. Smith was not suspended. Simmons was suspended for three weeks. ESPN has no affiliation with the National Organization for Women. ESPN has a broadcasting agreement with the NFL until 2021.Still, this week, ESPN's ombudsman Robert Lipsyte called this ""ESPN's finest hour during my tenure.""Last night, Lipsyte defended Simmons' suspension with this sentence : ""Bill Simmons has no license to call him (a liar) without more justification than 'I'm just saying it.'""Six weeks ago, this is how Stephen A. Smith defended advocating for the discussion of ""the elements of provocation"" that could lead to a man hitting a woman : ""I don't think that's broached enough, is all I'm saying.""Bill Simmons was suspended for three weeks. Stephen A. Smith was suspended for one.In the old boys club of sports mediaâone with no room for reflection and one that empowers only those who can speak about a base emotion in the fastest and loudest wayâSimmons succeeded by writing differently. When his contract expired, Simmons was convinced to stay after ESPN promised him his own outlet, Grantland. The site has since produced thoughtful pieces from different voicesânot just retired, bravado-filled athletes or 50-something male anchors who have paid their corporate dues, but also writers who would rather drill deep into statistics, experiment with art and new media, or write contemplatively, creatively and passionately, sometimes under pseudonyms.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowGrantland finally allowed for the journalism and opinions of, basically, anyone else.When female contributors write features for Grantland, they are equalâanother voice amidst other smart ideas. Women at Grantland are not cast aside to a separate, less-visited section of their website. That's precisely what happens at ESPN proper, the home of ESPNWâa well-intentioned, largely ignored property at the bottom of ESPN.com , called upon only when ""women's issues"" affect sports.This is the kind of tokenism that affected FoxSports.com's Katie Nolan. In August, before the elevator footage of Ray Rice's domestic abuse incident was released, Nolan had the chance to ask Roger Goodell about why he didn't suspend Rice for more games, based on the first video. She didn't. ""I'm really going to hear about it from my bosses,"" she said. ""It's really not my role,"" she said. ""I played the role that had been assigned to me,"" she said.A month later, she understood this to be a part of a culture of quiet repression. ""Women in sports television are allowed to read headlines, patrol sidelines and generally facilitate conversation for their male colleagues,"" she said. ""Sometimes they even let us monitor the Internet from a couch.""She said all of this in a video on FoxSports.com. She ended it with, ""I'm ready when you are, Fox.""Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowShe was not suspended. She was applauded on the company's website .And that is the problem with ESPN and the old-wave of sports media: Sports are not now being infiltrated by ""women's issues"" that demand one-off responses. Women are half the population of the worldâand sports are a part of that world.There are 11 seats at the table at ESPN. All of them go to men. Women get their own table, but only sometimesâand ESPN has placed that table where no one can hear them.ESPN personalitiesâeven those 11 menâhave spent the last two weeks on television defending their position atop a moral high-ground. Each retired player and 60-year-old man has had his chance to spout tough talk about how he would never personally commit or condone domestic violence.Now that their company is standing behindâas ESPN anchor Keith Olbermann put itâ ""an enabler of men who beat women"" instead of an employee, where have these personalities gone?They are silent.Long-tenured editors and personalities of ESPN: Those condemnations mean nothing if you don't stand up for your ideals, your integrity, and the rights of women when your paycheck is on the line.It means you, too, are just like your bosses: When faced with reporting the truth or collecting a paycheckâeven at the most critical moment of your journalistic careerâyou will take the paycheck.It means every word spoken about morality from now on is simply just posturing to protect your public image.It means you are not a journalist. It means you are a commentator, for now and forever.So stand up. You'd stand for the defining issues of the moment: Corporate entanglement, equal rights, the idea of journalism, and your own integrity.You would be vindicated in the eyes of history during this very tiresome moment. You would be standing for the truth.Advertisement - Continue Reading Below"	N/A

I truly believed there was two or even three babies in there he commented laughingly, but no, it was just one big sturdy guy. He obviously has a career as a future rugby player he added with humor.The largest recorded baby in the world was previously thought to be a South African baby who is believed to have weighed 38 pounds (17.2 kilos) and was born in 1839.The young boy of Zulu origin is reported to have grown to an impressive 76 feet or 2.28 meters high before he reached his 18th birthday.

https://www.emergent.info/argentina-president-adopts-boy-werewolf	Claim: The president of Argentina became the adopted godmother of a boy to help stop him from becoming a werewolf	false	['Argentina', 'Christina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner', 'Werewolf']	https://www.jta.org/	https://www.jta.org/2014/12/25/news-opinion/world/argentinas-president-adopts-jewish-godson	2014/12/29	Argentinaâs president adopts Jewish godson under law to counteract werewolf legendDecember 25, 2014 12:17pmArgentine President Christina Fernandez lighting Hanukkah candles with the family of Shlomo and Nechama Tawil, whose son became the first Jewish boy adopted under a law intended to counteract an old Argentine legend.BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (JTA) â Argentinaâs president adopted a Jewish godson under a law intended to counteract an old legend about werewolves.President Christina Fernandez described in seven tweets her meeting with her new godson, Yair Tawil, a member of a Chabad-Lubavitch family.The adoption practice derives fromÂ an old custom byÂ which the presidentÂ adopts theÂ seventh son born after six boys with no girls in between to prevent him from becoming a werewolf. Belief in the legend was once so widespread that families were abandoning, giving up for adoption and even killing their own sons.The custom became a law in the 1970s and provided the boys withÂ presidential protection, a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until their 21st birthday. Until 2009, the law only applied to Catholic boys.Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, in 1993 wrote a letter to the president asking for the honor and were denied. But this year, Yair wrote a letter to the president citing the 2009 decree and asking for the designation of godson.OnÂ Tuesday, he became the first Jewish godson of a president in Argentinaâs history. Fernandez received Yair, his parents and three of his brothers in her office, where they lit Hanukkah candles together.The president in herÂ tweets and photos described to her 3.4 million Twitter followers aÂ âmagical momentâ with a âmarvelous family.â She described Yair asÂ âa total sweety,â and his mother a âQueen Esther.âShe tweeted that the Tawils âare a very special family. They have a sort of peace, happiness and a lot of love that is not common.â The tweet included a link to the presidential blog, which includes more photos from the meeting.CORRECTION: The original brief stated incorrectly that Shlomo Tawil was the director of the Chabad House in Rosario, located in central Argentina. The sentence has been deleted.Â The original brief also stated incorrectly that the original law was adopted in the 1920s. It was actually adopted in the 1970s.

https://www.emergent.info/Planetary-alignment-weightlessness-hoax	Claim: A unique planetary alignment on Jan. 4, 2015 will cause partial weightlessness on earth	false	['Daily Buzz Live', 'Fake News', 'Hoaxes', 'Science']	https://dailybuzzlive.com/	https://dailybuzzlive.com/planetary-alignment-jan-4-2015-will-decrease-gravity-5-minutes-partial-weightlessness/	2014/12/29	"Sharing is caring!0Tweet0Share0Share0Pin0Mail0SharePlanetary Alignment On Jan 4, 2015 Will Decrease Gravity For 5 Minutes Causing Partial Weightlessness.Strange natural occurrences are happening in the world today. But nothing more magnificent than the one you will experience on January 4, 2015.According to British astronomer Patrick Moore, at exactly 9:47 PST AM on January 4th, Pluto will pass directly behind Jupiter, in relation to Earth. This rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull, temporarily counteracting the Earths own gravity and making people virtually weightless. Moore calls this the Jovian-Plutonian Gravitational Effect.Moore told scientists that they could experience the phenomenon by jumping in the air at the precise moment the alignment occurred. If they do so, he promised, they would experience a strange floating sensation.Astronomers have long been aware that there would be an alignment of the planets on that date, when Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto would be on the same side of the sun, within an arc 95 wide. But now they are guaranteeing the occurrence as the gravitational effect of the other planets on the Earths crust is maximum even at their closest approach.But dont get too excited. If you think youll be able to float around your house, youre wrong. But, if you jump in the air at 9:47 AM PST, on January 4, 2015, it should take you about 3 seconds to land back on your feet instead of the usual 0.2 seconds.So, mark this date on your calendar and share it with your friends!

https://www.emergent.info/bosnian-girls-pregnant-school-trip	Claim: Seven underage Bosnian girls got pregnant on a school trip	unverified	['Bosnia', 'Pregnancy']	https://inserbia.info/	https://inserbia.info/today/2014/12/bih-seven-primary-school-students-pregnant-after-five-day-excursion/	2014/12/23	BANJA LUKA â Primary school students from a small town in Bosnia and Herzegovina went to a five-day excursion, and after some time it turned out that seven schoolgirls got pregnant on it.Illustration National Coordinator for Reproductive Health of the Republika Srpska Nenad Babici said that children engage in sexual relations as early as at age of 13 or 14 and added that primary school students from a small town in Bosnia and Herzegovina went to a five-day trip, and after some time it turned out that seven schoolgirls got pregnant on it.He said that the reason for this was neglect of parents, but also educational institutions, toward the education of children.Babic said that early engagement in sexual relations later leads to a series of consequences such as infertility, various diseases, miscarriages and premature births.âIn the Republika Srpska between 15 to 18 percent of people are struggling with infertility, we have 15 percent of miscarriages and between 5 to 10 percent premature births,â he said.Only last year, according to the Clinical Center of the University in Sarajevo, 31 minors gave birth, four of them are 15 years old, ten are 16 years old and 17 are 17 years old.The problem of adolescent in Bosnia and Herzegovina is becoming more prominent, but information on the increasing number of sexually active girls aged between 13 and 15 years of age is also shocking.Thus, on a website where girls seek advice from experts, gynecologists, peers, one of them wrote:âI would have sex with my boyfriend, even though Iâm only 14â¦ But I am afraid Iâll be judged.âThe page also contains information according to which boys engage in sexual relations at age of 11, writes âDnevni Avazâ.Sarajevo gynecologist Senad Mehmedbasic says that it is terrible that girls aged 13 or 16 engage in sexual relations, but adds that this is something that, unfortunately, is in the trend.He warns that in these cases both pregnancy and child birth are highly risky. âIt is obvious that children do not have enough of health education so they engage in such activities, not knowing the consequences. We have to be more direct in the educational system, it must not be allowed that street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life,â he said.	N/A
https://www.emergent.info/texas-plumbing-truck-isis	Claim: A Texas plumbing company's truck is now being used by militant Islamist fighters in Syria	true	['ISIS']	https://www.cbsnews.com/	https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-plumbers-truck-on-front-line-of-syria-war/	2014/12/19	"By Tucker Reals CBS News December 16, 2014, 10:06 AMTexas plumber's truck on front line of Syria warA photo posted to Twitter on Dec. 15, 2014, by the Islamic extremist rebel faction Ansar al-Deen Front shows a truck once owned by a plumbing company in Texas City.EmailLONDON -- A pickup truck once owned by a plumbing company in Texas has somehow found its way to the front lines of Syria's civil war and been converted into an anti-aircraft weapon for Islamic militants.A photo posted to Twitter on Monday by the Ansar al-Deen Front, an Islamic extremist brigade seemingly comprised largely of Chechen fighters, shows the Ford F-250 with a militant standing in the bed firing the anti-aircraft gun.Speaking to CBS News Tuesday morning, a representative of the plumbing company in Texas City said the vehicle was sold to the AutoNation dealership in Houston in Oct. 2013, and that's the last they knew of it.The company has been besieged by phone calls -- including threats -- since the photo appeared online, clearly showing the company's name and phone number. CBS News is not identifying the company due to the nature of some of the attention it has received.They have employed an attorney and intend to pursue legal action to force Twitter to remove the photo from the Internet.Reached by CBS News Tuesday morning, a person identifying himself as a manager at AutoNation would not comment on the sale history of the vehicle in question, saying ""we can't give information like that over the phone,"" before hanging up the phone.The representative of the plumbing company in Texas City said they would ""most definitely"" be removing their logo from all vehicles sold in the future.Ansar al-Deen Front has been fighting in the complicated Syrian war primarily around Aleppo, Syria's largest city and formerly the economic powerhouse of the nation.It has been the scene of some of the most vicious fighting between Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces and the myriad rebel groups trying to topple him, but is largely controlled by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ).CBS News' Khaled Wassef contributed to this report.Â© 2014 CBS Interactive Inc.

So how will McDonalds define overweight?Obesity rates in America have more than doubled over the last 2 decades and has become the leading public health issue in the U.S. With more than two-thirds of the adult population overweight, McDonalds has decided to become part of the obesity rate solution not the problem.According to reports, beginning January 1, 2015, McDonalds will no longer serve customers who show risks of being overweight. They will define overweight by these standards: Over 170 lbs for women and 245 lbs for men. Childrens weight restrictions will vary depending on age and height.McDonalds is currently running campaigns to shake its junk food image, insisting they sell nothing but good quality food. They are are branding themselves from A dining experience of fast food to Good food served fast. They want people to understand the risks of being overweight.So how will they know if you are overweight ? Will they ask you what you weigh and trust your answer? NOThey are implementing scales at the from of every register just like the one in the photo below. You must stand on the scale when ordering or you will not be served. They also plan on posting signs to let customers know that they have the legal Right to refuse service to anyone. For drive-thru patrons it may be a bit more difficult to enforce. However, if the person looks like they exceed the weight restrictions, they will be refused service at the drive-thru window.CLICK HERE > To FOLLOW us on TWITTERCLICK HERE > TO LIKE DAILY BUZZ LIVE ON FACEBOOK!You Might Also LikeJennifer Aniston: Should Rachel Have Ended Up With Joey?Elon Musk Sells 15,000 Flamethrowers in 48 HoursYoutubers Seeing Red After Recent Policy ChangesMan Charged With Drug Offenses Because $324K Smelt Like CocaineHaunted House AdventureNetflixs Altered Carbon Is a Sci-Fi RollercoasterRailbookers Takes You on Worlds Most Scenic Train JourneysPowerball Ticket Sold In Massachusetts Wins Record $758.7 MillionRussian Journalist Fakes Own Death to Avoid Assassination?These content links are provided by Content.ad.

https://www.emergent.info/NSA-elf-on-shelf	Claim: Popular Christmas toy Elf On The Shelf is an espionage project run by the National Security Agency	false	['Elf On the Shelf', 'Fake News', 'Hoaxes']	https://www.duffelblog.com/	https://www.duffelblog.com/2014/12/elf-on-a-shelf-snowden/	2014/12/17	Share TweetSTOCKHOLM â Speaking via Google Hangout to officials in Sweden last week, former NSA Contractor Edward Snowden dropped a bag of coal on his former employers by revealing the hugely popular âElf on a Shelfâ trend is actually an intelligence gathering operation originating with and run by the National Security Agency.âIt actually started out as a joke,â Snowden said in his speech. âSomeone photocopied a picture of an elf with the caption âIâm watching you,â and it just kept moving from cubicle to cubicle.âSnowden said that at some point it occurred to someone that if people as paranoid as NSA staff would play this game, what would happen with civilians?âNow, the NSA has an agent inside practically every home with a child in it,â Snowden said.âThe elves have basic mobility, which isnât a problem because when one shows up someplace unexpected,â Snowden added, âitâs just assumed to be part of the game.âThrough these adorable snoops, the NSA has gained access to millions of tax returns, bank statements, and 10-year old boys unwrapping and re-wrapping their presents in the days ahead of Christmas.âWe would flag those kids for later recruitment to the intelligence community,â Snowden said. âEspecially for Tailored Access Operations .âIn addition, the NSA has uncovered a trove of data about the personal lives of millions of Americans, sources confirmed.âThe NSA has incorporated advanced sensors into these things that can uncover all kinds of information,â journalist Glenn Greenwald told Duffel Blog in an email. âThey can tell things about peopleâs health â cancer, heart disease, liver disease. They know whoâs being naughty, and whoâs beingÂ really naughty, thingsÂ that even extensive online snooping couldnât provide. Dildos, vibrators, chains â all the things stashed in closets and under beds.âSources told reporters these were previously inaccessible to the governmentâs leading intelligence agency, if the owners paid cash at least.âIf you want to know why the âprivacy advocatesâ have settled down, and moved on? My guess is, blackmail. These elves have accumulated petabytes of evidence against pretty much everybody,â Snowden said.âYou wouldnât believe what perverse things people will do to each other, right in front of these things,â Snowden concluded. âItâs why âElfMonitorâ is such a highly sought after duty assignment.âRecommended For You:	N/A
https://www.emergent.info/heart-rate-glance	Claim: The Apple Watch will include a feature called Heart Rate Glance	true	['9to5 Mac', 'Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Features', 'Mark Gurman']	https://9to5mac.com/	https://9to5mac.com/2015/03/06/sources-offer-hands-on-apple-watch-details-battery-life-unannounced-features-and-more/	2015/03/06	Just ahead of the finalized Apple Watchs presentation at Apples March 9th Spring Forward event, sources with hands-on Apple Watch experience have revealed a collection of new details about the devices features to 9to5Mac. Our sources have offered new information on the Watchs real-world battery life, health and fitness features, apps, and experiences using Apples next-generation touchscreen hardware...iPad Air 2Power Reserve Mode and Battery LifeThe Apple Watchs battery life has concerned many prospective customers, as Apple said only that the Watch will need to be charged nightly. Earlier this year, we reported that Apples development targets for Apple Watch battery life were 2.5-4 hours for heavy app usage, versus 19 hours per day of combined usage between light app access, notifications, and Glances. Sources who have handled the Apple Watch tell us that Apple has improved the devices battery life, noting that the final Apple Watch should be able to handle 5 hours of fairly heavy application usage, and it and wont run out of battery during a typical day of mixed active and passive use. However, the source says that the device will still need to be charged nightly, as it will definitely not last through a second full day.As The New York Times reported, Apple will address battery life concerns with a new Power Reserve Mode that cuts optional services to preserve as much of the Apple Watchs core functionality as possible. Our sources have shared several new details about the feature. First, Power Reserve Mode can be activated via a Battery Glance thats accessible at any time, or via the Apple Watchs Settings application. The Battery Glance will show the percentage of battery life remaining, the amount of time since the last full charge, and a large button to activate Power Reserve Mode.Power Reserve Mode can even be accessed when the Watch has a full 100% charge, and it is not solely activated when the Watchs battery life is low. The mode noticeably dims the display, slows down communication with the iPhone to an on-demand level, and puts the display to sleep after roughly two seconds of inactivity. One unit tested allowed access to all Apple Watch functions while in Power Reserve mode, while another unit was limited to the Clock face. Were told that some test units took between four and five hours to charge up to 100% from 0% via the wall-attached MagSafe charger. This is a notable improvement, were told, from fall 2014 prototypes.Unlike the iPhone, when battery life is low on the Apple Watch, the device does not show a modal popup window indicating the battery life percentage remaining. Instead, with 20% battery life remaining, the Battery Life glance turns an orange/amber color as a subtle alert to the user. At 10%, the glance turns from orange/amber to a red color. On the iPhone side, our sources say that they did not see any meaningful change to the iPhones battery while using the Apple Watch.Heart Rate GlanceOne notable yet-to-be-announced Apple Watch feature is the Heart Rate Glance. Thanks to the devices heart rate monitor, the Heart Rate Glance will allow the user to see their Beats Per Minute at any time. When accessing the Glance, an outline of a heart will appear, similar to the heart in the image above. After a button is tapped to start measurement, the screen will show the constantly updating BPM reading. Our sources say that the process of reading the heart rate was almost instant and the readings were seemingly accurate. Previously, Apple has only stated that the Heart Rate sensor will be used to send other users their heart beat via the communication features and to measure intensity for calorie reading in the fitness app. Of course, heart rate readings could be transferred to the Health application on the accompanying iPhone.Notification Center, Glances, and Clock FacesOur sources indicate that the following Glances are installed on the Apple Watch by default, in addition to Heart Rate and Battery Life: Fitness Stats, Activity, Clock, Weather, Music, Quick Settings, Calendar and Maps. As discussed on one of our recent Happy Hour podcasts, sources also indicate that the Apple Watch will have a full Notification Center like the iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Mac. To access Notification Center, a user can swipe down from the top of the display in any screen. The list of notifications will show each app name as well as truncated descriptions of the alerts, akin to an iPhone. Developers will be able to customize which notifications can show up in Notification Center as well as the Apple Watch app icon specific to this view. As for Clock Faces a source says that the level of detail and customization is insane. The source also called the quality of faces incredible, and said each face is like an app in itself so its [a little curious] is not (yet) allowing third-party faces. The source also said that the astronomy Watch Face is smart: in one mode you can use the crown to scroll through time and see planetary alignments for the whole solar system.Onboard Storage and MusicAs Apple has announced, the Apple Watch will be able to store music that can be played while unlinked to an iPhone. Prototype Apple Watches within Apple are said to include 8GB of storage; it is yet to be seen whether the shipping versions will all include 8GB. As we noted yesterday, the internal units also include Lightning connectors, which wont be on the shipping models. Users will be able to specify individual songs, albums, and playlists to be loaded to their Apple Watches via a panel in the Companion app for iPhone. Users will also be able to stream music from the Apple Watch to external speakers or headphones over Bluetooth. iPhone Companion AppAs we extensively reported earlier this year, the settings for individual Apple Watch applications will be controlled by a Companion application on the iPhone. The Companion app has a dark black user interface with a glyph of the Apple Watch as the app icon. In addition to controlling various settings and music storage, the Companion app allows users to re-arrange the icons on the Apple Watchs Home screen. This can be done from the Watch itself as well via a long press, just like on the iPhone and iPad. When a user downloads an iPhone application from the App Store with a WatchKit component, the Watch app is automatically installed on the Watch. Users can remove the WatchKit applications through the Companion app without deleting the app from the iPhone. Interestingly, if the iPhone is not connected to the Watch, third-party application icons will remain on the devices Home screen, and the applications will still work for a period of time with cached data.Force Touch, Digital Crown + Voice ControlSources have praised the Watchs next-generation force-sensing touchscreen interface, saying that the screen feels like a giant button than you just want to press in the manner needed for Force Touch. A source added that the feature feels natural on the small screen. Also, the Digital Crown input device is required to use the Apple Watch, as the Watch differs from the sixth-generation iPod nano in lacking pinch to zoom capabilities: it registers touches and movements up, down, left, and right. There is no keyboard at all on the device; all forms of input are handled with pre-populated options and voice dictation. Speaking of dictation, the menus within the Apple Watch label all voice control features as Voice Control, rather than as Siri. As we reported earlier, this initial version of the Watch OS does not support replying to emails, even by voice. Users will need to access the Mail app via Handoff on their iPhone to conduct replies.Speed, Display, and BandsPeople who have used the Apple Watch say that the device feels very fast overall, which is in line with our report that the S1 chip is comparable with the current iPod touchs A5 chip. But there are limits. One source said that an Apple Watch with over 200 WatchKit applications became noticeably sluggish on the Home screen. It is unlikely that the majority of users will ever install 200 WatchKit applications, so this should not be a typical concern. The sources say that the display will light up when the iPhone is locked for all of the phones notifications, but if the iPhone is unlocked, the Watch will not light up for new alerts.A designer familiar with the quality of mobile device screens who has used the Apple Watch says that the screen is the best [smartwatch] screen I have ever seen, noting that its like vibrant digital paper, and does not look rendered, with especially great black levels. The source thinks that the smaller, 38mm version is tiny, but of course this will differ between users of different sizes. Apples Sport Band, the default on the $349 aluminum Apple Watch, is said to take time to get used to as it is somewhat difficult to put on at first due to the pin-based closure system. As for the stainless steel link bracelet, a source says that Apple have seemingly got around [hair getting stuck between links] by having the case expand the links flexibility from the outer rim only.Powering Off, Force Quitting and SettingsSome users have wondered how the Apple Watch will be powered off without a dedicated power button. Our sources say that its turned off by long pressing the large communication button on the right side of the Watch. When this is pressed, a confirmation slider akin to the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch is shown, letting a swipe finish the shut down. Users can also Force Quit an unstable application by accessing the shut down screen and then quickly pressing the button on the right side. The Apple Watch also includes a Settings application that includes various toggles including Bluetooth and Airplane Mode. There is not a dedicated Wi-Fi settings panel, which instead will likely be controlled by the accompanying iPhone.Apple will officially announce Apple Watch pricing and availability on Monday, March 9, starting at 10:00AM Pacific/1:00PM Eastern Time. 9to5Mac will offer coverage of the event in the hours leading up the keynote, during the presentation, and afterwards, so please join us for more news and commentary then.

https://www.emergent.info/apple-tv-refresh	Claim: Apple will reveal a refreshed Apple TV at the March 9th Spring Forward Event	false	['Andrew Cunningham', 'Apple', 'Apple TV', 'Ars Technica']	https://arstechnica.com/	https://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/03/what-to-expect-when-we-spring-forward-with-apple-on-march-9/	2015/03/05	"Sign up or login to join the discussions!Stay logged inSign up to comment and more Sign upTech âWhat to expect when we âspring forwardâ with Apple on March 9The Apple Watch will get the spotlight, but a few Mac updates are long overdue.reader commentsShare this storyThere's an Apple event on Monday , soÂ it's time to run down our list of rumors and hunches so you know whatÂ to expect from the company.Apple's tagline for the event is ""spring forward,"" a less-than-subtle reference to the Apple Watch and a reminder that holding a product event the day after Daylight Saving Time begins is cruel. Since this event is likely to be the springboard for an all-new product line, it's probably going to crowd out most other announcements, which makes this list shorter than it normally is. That said, the timing is right for a handful of other announcementsâhere's whatÂ we think will share the stage on Monday.Apple WatchEnlarge / Don't be sad, Apple Watch! It's almost your ""time"" to shine.Megan GeussNot quite hands-on with the Apple Watch, and the questions it doesnât answerThis is a gimme. The Apple Watch has already been announced, so we know what it looks like and some basic things about how it works. We know it's scheduled to launch in April, and we have some basic information about what it does. We know it requires an iPhone 5 or better and that it will support Apple Pay even when tethered to older phones. We know the price starts at $349, probably for the aluminum Apple Watch Sport model with a basic band.What we're likely to get on Monday is an actual launch date, more specific pricing information for all three versions of the product and their bands, and some kind of showcase of third-party apps. At iPhone and iPad launches, Apple usually has at least one or two devs come on stage to walk the audience through a demo that shows what the new hardware is capable of. iOS still enjoys the widest and deepest third-party support of any mobile platform, so we'd expect third-party support to be a major selling point for the Apple Watch as well.We donât know whether the Apple Watch will succeed or notânobody knows, no matter how many op-eds have already called it oneÂ way or theÂ other . In either case, its launch signifies the start of something new for Apple.MacsEnlarge / The 2013 MacBook Air is a year-and-a-half old, mid-cycle processor bump notwithstanding. That's an eternity in computer years.Andrew CunninghamSame wrapper, all-new candy center: The 2013 MacBook Air reviewedMacs aren't the targets of leaksÂ to the extent that iDevices are, so this one is not as sure a bet as the Apple Watch. That said, most of Apple's Mac lineup hasn't been refreshed in well over a year ( blameÂ Intel ). Among those products, there are three for which new Intel processors now exist: the MacBook Air ( BroadwellÂ U or perhaps CoreÂ M ), the 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro (Broadwell U again), and the Mac Pro ( Haswell-EP and refreshed workstation GPUs from AMD ). Higher-wattage quad-core parts suitable for the 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro and most iMacs aren'tÂ dueÂ untilÂ midyear .Of those three, the MacBook Air is the only thing we've really heard many rumors about. Earlier this week, we saw convincing screenshots that suggested the current 11- and 13-inch MacBook Airs would be refreshed with Broadwell chips, but not with new designs. Another rumorÂ proposes something totally differentâ a 12-inch versionÂ ofÂ theÂ computer that streamlines the chassis and does away with nearly all ports. One USB Type-C port would handle all wired connectivity, and using Intel's Core M rather than the more powerful Core i5 and i7 CPUs would allow it to run without a fan. It may or may not use a Retina-class display; reports are less clear on that one.Even if the latterÂ product exists, we're not sure where it would slot into Apple's lineup. Is it a new product line entirely? Is it intended to be the future of the MacBook Air, leaving power users with the 13-inch MacBook Pro if they want more ports and more performance? We can't say for sure, but remember that Apple didn't replace non-Retina models immediately when it introduced the RetinaÂ MacBookÂ Pros and the RetinaÂ iMac . There may be a transitional period.However the lineup shakes out, we think MacBook Air news is most likely, followed by everything else we just mentioned, followed by some kind of surprise like a 4K 21.5-inch iMac.iOSEnlarge / The Apple Watch needs an iOS update to work, so we'll probably get one.Andrew CunninghamNewest iOS 8.2 beta spills the beans on more Apple Watch featuresThe Apple Watch requires iOS 8.2, so iOS 8.2 is likely to drop on the day of the event or just after. It's been through five developer betas and a new beta hasn't been issued in a few weeks, which is usually a sign that release is imminent. If you don't care about the Apple Watch, this update probably won't amount to much more than a handful of bug fixes, but that's fine too.Apple is also expected to announce aÂ publicÂ betaÂ programÂ forÂ iOS at some point in March, beginning with iOS 8.3 and eventually extending to iOS 9.0 (don't expect word about the next major iOS version before WWDC this summer, though). Launching something like this really doesn'tÂ requireÂ stageÂ timeÂ atÂ aÂ majorÂ productÂ event , but we wouldn't be surprised to hear about it.We're not expecting anything in the way of major iOS hardware announcements. Rumors aboutÂ a new 12-inch ""iPad Pro"" spring eternal, but the newest itemÂ from a reputable source says not to expect it before this fall (if we ever actually see it). The current iPads and iPhones are still in the middle of their typical releaseÂ cycle. Most iOS news is going to be about the way iOS interacts with the Apple Watch.And the restThe AppleÂ TVÂ wasÂ lastÂ updatedÂ inÂ MarchÂ ofÂ 2013 , and there's plenty of new hardware that could speed it up. Apple doesn't seem to have the 4K fever that most other consumer electronics companies are suffering from right now, but it would be a logical next step (the current maximum resolution is 1080p).Most of the Apple TV rumors from the last year or so have revolved around something entirely new, thoughânot a faster version of the little $99 black box, but some kind of collaboration with content providers that would integrate Apple TV functionality into cable boxes (or maybe the other way around).iPods haven't been touched since 2012, either, but the iPod Touch is the only one that could use new hardware to get better at the stuff it does. Its A5 chip dates back to early 2011, after all. Don't hold your breath, but if Apple intends to drop support for Apple A5 devices in iOS 9, now is the time to start replacing them.And that's the rundown! The Apple Watch is the only sure thing, but Apple usually uses events like these to refresh a few things at once. Whatever happens, we'll be on the ground in San Francisco to liveblog the speech, and we'llÂ go hands-on with anything we can get our mitts on afterward.Listing image by AppleLatest Ars Video >First Look: Xbox Adaptive ControllerArs Technica's Sam Machkovech visits Microsoft for a first-hand look at the company's new controller that focuses on accessibility.First Look: Xbox Adaptive ControllerFirst Look: Xbox Adaptive ControllerArs Technica's Sam Machkovech visits Microsoft for a first-hand look at the company's new controller that focuses on accessibility.Andrew Cunningham Andrew has a B.A. in Classics from Kenyon College and has over five years of experience in IT.

Instead, Apple currently plans to introduce the service, at least in beta form, at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in early June. The WWDC keynote likely takes place on Monday, June 8th, and thats the event where the debut will occur. The new iTunes music streaming service is based on technology acquired from Beats Music, including curated playlists, cloud-based libraries, and offerings customized to the musical tastes of individual users. The service will be priced as high as $7.99 per month, which is less expensive than current $9.99 pricing for Beats Music, Spotify, and Rdio...iPad Air 2The service was initially planned for launch earlier in 2015, but was delayed by the departures of key employees, as well as difficulties integrating Beats human and technology resources into Apple. Some Beats executives such as Bobby Gaza, who was a Senior Vice President at Beats in charge of technology, have departed Apple in recent weeks. The new Apple-made service will also make way for Apples first entirely-in-house Android application, but sources say that delays to the Android app are also possible as some of Apples Android developers have also left the company. Apple has, not coincidentally, published job listings for Android developers in recent days.Apple currently plans to launch the new music service as part of an iOS 8.4 upgrade for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch following WWDC, but a final decision has not yet been made. Its possible that the service will be bundled into iOS 9 this fall, which is expected to have a significant focus on bug fixes and stability improvements. The service will be integrated into the standard iOS Music application and will function similarly to Beats Music for iPhone, but it will have an entirely Apple-designed aesthetic that matches the Music app and iOS. On the Mac side, the new service will be implemented with an iTunes update.As for the Apple TV, the new service will be an app that replaces the existing Beats channel. Sources say that Apple is also finishing up work on a slimmer Apple TV set-top-box with a more capable and tactile remote control and a redesigned operating system bundled with an App Store. As of last fall, Apple had hoped to debut a new set top box as soon as this month, but with reports of the discussions between Apple and content providers being in only early stages, it seems that, just like last year, content roadblocks could keep the new Apple TV from debuting until another point in the future. As we learned yesterday regarding the larger iPad Pro, Apple will have another busy fall, so perhaps the new Apple TV will launch later in the year.While the streaming service wont debut at the March event, as some had hoped, Apple still has plenty to talk about. The Apple Watch will be the cornerstone of the event, where sources expect Apple to spend a significant amount of time introducing and demonstrating third-party WatchKit applications as selling points for the device. It is also highly likely that Apple will discuss the rest of the price points for the device and its accessories before the April ship date. Apple has a redesigned MacBook Air with Retina display in the works for this year, but it remains unclear whether Apple actually plans to debut the computer at the March event.	N/A
https://www.emergent.info/apple-macbook-air-refresh	Claim: Apple will announce a refreshed MacBook Air models at the March 9th Spring Forward Event	true	['Andrew Cunningham', 'Apple', 'Ars Technica', 'MacBook Air']	https://arstechnica.com/	https://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/03/what-to-expect-when-we-spring-forward-with-apple-on-march-9/	2015/03/05	"Sign up or login to join the discussions!Stay logged inSign up to comment and more Sign upTech âWhat to expect when we âspring forwardâ with Apple on March 9The Apple Watch will get the spotlight, but a few Mac updates are long overdue.reader commentsShare this storyThere's an Apple event on Monday , soÂ it's time to run down our list of rumors and hunches so you know whatÂ to expect from the company.Apple's tagline for the event is ""spring forward,"" a less-than-subtle reference to the Apple Watch and a reminder that holding a product event the day after Daylight Saving Time begins is cruel. Since this event is likely to be the springboard for an all-new product line, it's probably going to crowd out most other announcements, which makes this list shorter than it normally is. That said, the timing is right for a handful of other announcementsâhere's whatÂ we think will share the stage on Monday.Apple WatchEnlarge / Don't be sad, Apple Watch! It's almost your ""time"" to shine.Megan GeussNot quite hands-on with the Apple Watch, and the questions it doesnât answerThis is a gimme. The Apple Watch has already been announced, so we know what it looks like and some basic things about how it works. We know it's scheduled to launch in April, and we have some basic information about what it does. We know it requires an iPhone 5 or better and that it will support Apple Pay even when tethered to older phones. We know the price starts at $349, probably for the aluminum Apple Watch Sport model with a basic band.What we're likely to get on Monday is an actual launch date, more specific pricing information for all three versions of the product and their bands, and some kind of showcase of third-party apps. At iPhone and iPad launches, Apple usually has at least one or two devs come on stage to walk the audience through a demo that shows what the new hardware is capable of. iOS still enjoys the widest and deepest third-party support of any mobile platform, so we'd expect third-party support to be a major selling point for the Apple Watch as well.We donât know whether the Apple Watch will succeed or notânobody knows, no matter how many op-eds have already called it oneÂ way or theÂ other . In either case, its launch signifies the start of something new for Apple.MacsEnlarge / The 2013 MacBook Air is a year-and-a-half old, mid-cycle processor bump notwithstanding. That's an eternity in computer years.Andrew CunninghamSame wrapper, all-new candy center: The 2013 MacBook Air reviewedMacs aren't the targets of leaksÂ to the extent that iDevices are, so this one is not as sure a bet as the Apple Watch. That said, most of Apple's Mac lineup hasn't been refreshed in well over a year ( blameÂ Intel ). Among those products, there are three for which new Intel processors now exist: the MacBook Air ( BroadwellÂ U or perhaps CoreÂ M ), the 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro (Broadwell U again), and the Mac Pro ( Haswell-EP and refreshed workstation GPUs from AMD ). Higher-wattage quad-core parts suitable for the 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro and most iMacs aren'tÂ dueÂ untilÂ midyear .Of those three, the MacBook Air is the only thing we've really heard many rumors about. Earlier this week, we saw convincing screenshots that suggested the current 11- and 13-inch MacBook Airs would be refreshed with Broadwell chips, but not with new designs. Another rumorÂ proposes something totally differentâ a 12-inch versionÂ ofÂ theÂ computer that streamlines the chassis and does away with nearly all ports. One USB Type-C port would handle all wired connectivity, and using Intel's Core M rather than the more powerful Core i5 and i7 CPUs would allow it to run without a fan. It may or may not use a Retina-class display; reports are less clear on that one.Even if the latterÂ product exists, we're not sure where it would slot into Apple's lineup. Is it a new product line entirely? Is it intended to be the future of the MacBook Air, leaving power users with the 13-inch MacBook Pro if they want more ports and more performance? We can't say for sure, but remember that Apple didn't replace non-Retina models immediately when it introduced the RetinaÂ MacBookÂ Pros and the RetinaÂ iMac . There may be a transitional period.However the lineup shakes out, we think MacBook Air news is most likely, followed by everything else we just mentioned, followed by some kind of surprise like a 4K 21.5-inch iMac.iOSEnlarge / The Apple Watch needs an iOS update to work, so we'll probably get one.Andrew CunninghamNewest iOS 8.2 beta spills the beans on more Apple Watch featuresThe Apple Watch requires iOS 8.2, so iOS 8.2 is likely to drop on the day of the event or just after. It's been through five developer betas and a new beta hasn't been issued in a few weeks, which is usually a sign that release is imminent. If you don't care about the Apple Watch, this update probably won't amount to much more than a handful of bug fixes, but that's fine too.Apple is also expected to announce aÂ publicÂ betaÂ programÂ forÂ iOS at some point in March, beginning with iOS 8.3 and eventually extending to iOS 9.0 (don't expect word about the next major iOS version before WWDC this summer, though). Launching something like this really doesn'tÂ requireÂ stageÂ timeÂ atÂ aÂ majorÂ productÂ event , but we wouldn't be surprised to hear about it.We're not expecting anything in the way of major iOS hardware announcements. Rumors aboutÂ a new 12-inch ""iPad Pro"" spring eternal, but the newest itemÂ from a reputable source says not to expect it before this fall (if we ever actually see it). The current iPads and iPhones are still in the middle of their typical releaseÂ cycle. Most iOS news is going to be about the way iOS interacts with the Apple Watch.And the restThe AppleÂ TVÂ wasÂ lastÂ updatedÂ inÂ MarchÂ ofÂ 2013 , and there's plenty of new hardware that could speed it up. Apple doesn't seem to have the 4K fever that most other consumer electronics companies are suffering from right now, but it would be a logical next step (the current maximum resolution is 1080p).Most of the Apple TV rumors from the last year or so have revolved around something entirely new, thoughânot a faster version of the little $99 black box, but some kind of collaboration with content providers that would integrate Apple TV functionality into cable boxes (or maybe the other way around).iPods haven't been touched since 2012, either, but the iPod Touch is the only one that could use new hardware to get better at the stuff it does. Its A5 chip dates back to early 2011, after all. Don't hold your breath, but if Apple intends to drop support for Apple A5 devices in iOS 9, now is the time to start replacing them.And that's the rundown! The Apple Watch is the only sure thing, but Apple usually uses events like these to refresh a few things at once. Whatever happens, we'll be on the ground in San Francisco to liveblog the speech, and we'llÂ go hands-on with anything we can get our mitts on afterward.Listing image by AppleLatest Ars Video >First Look: Xbox Adaptive ControllerArs Technica's Sam Machkovech visits Microsoft for a first-hand look at the company's new controller that focuses on accessibility.First Look: Xbox Adaptive ControllerFirst Look: Xbox Adaptive ControllerArs Technica's Sam Machkovech visits Microsoft for a first-hand look at the company's new controller that focuses on accessibility.Andrew Cunningham Andrew has a B.A. in Classics from Kenyon College and has over five years of experience in IT.

https://www.emergent.info/apple-macbook-air-12	Claim: Apple will announce a 12-inch MacBook Air Retina at the March 9th Spring Forward Event	true	['Apple', 'MacBook Air', 'The Michael Report']	https://themichaelreport.com/	https://themichaelreport.com/2015/03/04/exclusive-retina-macbook-air-spring-forward/	2015/03/04	"Last week, Apple sent out the invites for its Spring Forward event, slated to be held at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco on March 9th.Many are expecting Apple talk more about the Apple Watch. However, sources familiar with the matter within Apple have exclusively told The Michael Report that Apple plans to unveil the long-awaited Retina MacBook Air at the same event. The Michael Report has independently verified this information to be highly credible.We should note that this information falls in line with what Apple analysts such as KGI Securities Ming-Chi Kuo and Oppenheimers Andrew Uerkwitz have been predicting for months. Supply chain sources who spoke to the press have also said that Apple ramped up their production in late 2014 and entered the mass production stage in December, with the goal of producing enough units for an early-2015 debut.Apples MacBook Air line, which got upgraded in April last year (the only real upgrade being a small speed bump), still features a non-Retina screen with the same screen resolution that hasnt been updated since late 2010. This is a stark contrast from the rest of the Apple computer lineup, which have been steadily upgraded to a Retina (or at least, a version of it is offered) screen since the first Retina MacBook Pro was unveiled in 2012.The upcoming Retina MacBook Air, if earlier reports are to be believed, will come in an ultra slim design that combines the productivity of the current larger-screened 13-inch MacBook Air with the portability of the 11-inch MacBook Air.Internally, the new Retina MacBook Air is said to feature Intels next-generation Broadwell Core M low-power processors, which would allow Apple to strip the computer of its fan assembly to create an even thinner profile. Other compromises Apple reportedly made in exchange for a thinner and lighter body includes the full-sized USB ports, MagSafe connectors and SD card slots.The Retina MacBook Air, currently codenamed MacBook Stealth internally, will also come with a modest price decrease according to previous reports.[Image rendition via]Advertisement Advertisements Report this ad Report this adShare this now!76Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)76Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)RelatedThis Is The Real Reason Why Apple Doesn't Want You To Focus On The Gold Watch's PricingHow Much Will/Can The Apple Watch Sell For?In ""Analysis""BLOCKBUSTER EXCLUSIVE: This Is The iPad Air 2Hot Off The Heels Of The iPhone 6 Announcements...

https://www.emergent.info/apple-tv-hbo-now	Claim: HBO Now streaming subscription is coming to Apple TV	true	['Apple TV', 'HBO', 'International Business Times', 'Michael Learmonth']	https://www.ibtimes.com/	https://www.ibtimes.com/hbo-talks-apple-be-launch-partner-coming-web-service-hbo-now-exclusive-1835882	2015/03/04	"By Michael Learmonth @learmonth03/04/15 AT 2:28 PMGeorge R.R. Martin teased that some of the characters still alive in the books will die in ""Game of Thrones"" Season 5. Photo: Facebook/Game of ThronesHBO is in talks with Apple to make Apple TV a launch partner for its highly anticipated streaming service when it debuts next month. HBO and streaming partner Major League Baseball Advanced Media are working to have the standalone service, called âHBO Now,â ready to launch in April in conjunction with the premiere of the fifth season of âGame of Thrones,â according to sources familiar with the plan.When it launches, consumers will be able to subscribe to HBO Now directly from HBO for the first time, rather than through a cable, satellite or telco TV distributor such as Comcast or Verizon. The retail price is expected to be $15 a month when purchased directly from HBO, or about what consumers pay when they order HBO through their cable, satellite or telco provider.HBOâs corporate parent, Time Warner Inc., will rely on a whole new line of distributors (e.g., Apple TV, Roku, Xbox, PlayStation, Amazon, etc.) to help market HBO Now to an estimated 10 million U.S. broadband subscribers who do not pay for a cable TV bundle. CEO Jeff Bewkes has said the offering could also help reach some of the 70 million cable TV subscribers who do not subscribe to HBO but might if given the opportunity to subscribe online.HBOâs over-the-top service has been cast as the biggest challenge yet to the so-called cable bundle, in which consumers are required to buy packages of channels, some of which they may never watch. One study claimed the service would lead to a 7 percent drop in pay TV subscriptions , as users opt out of cable and opt in to HBO Now.Some cable providers, however, such as Cablevision and Cox Communications, have expressed interest in bundling HBO Now with broadband for their own subscribers who donât get cable TV.Apple has been most aggressive in courting HBO in a bid to add the service to Apple TV, sources say. Apple TV already carries HBO Go for current HBO subscribers, but it may add a second app for HBO Now. Apple has spent the past several years negotiating for the rights to offer its own linear TV package; in the meantime, HBO Now is seen as an added service to drive adoption of Apple TV.While HBO has not confirmed a launch date for HBO Now, internally the target is an April launch, in time for the April 12 debut of âGame of Thrones.â Thatâs an aggressive time frame for Major League Baseball Advanced Media, which is building the back end along with a new front end separate from HBO Go. HBO is taking care not to launch HBO Now before it can guarantee that the service will work without some of the technical glitches that plagued HBO Go during last year's debut of cult-fave ""Game of Thrones.""The launch of HBO Now will be a milestone for Time Warnerâs premium TV channel, which has for most of its 42-year history been distributed as an add-on to a package of cable channels. The Web service will allow HBO to sign on a new group of distribution partners, which it sees as no different than when it added satellite TV and, later, telcos such as Verizon and AT&T.Each of those distributors pays a wholesale price for HBO and then resells it to consumers for anywhere from $13 to $18 a month. Most see HBO as a retention device; those who subscribe are less likely to drop service or switch providers. HBO and Time Warner declined to comment.At $15 a month, HBO Now will be significantly more expensive than Netflix, which ranges from $8 to $12 a month for various levels of service, but cheaper than some were predicting. HBO makes the case that it has more original programming than Netflix and a better, more current film library. âItâs a premium product, and it will be priced accordingly,â HBO CEO Richard Plepler said during a Time Warner earnings call in February.HBOâs push to launch HBO Now comes after years of talking about launching an over-the-top service that bypasses traditional cable TV. Understandably, it has been met with some resistance from current distributors, including Time Warner Cable and Comcast, two companies in the midst of a $46 billion merger, according to sources.HBO, of course, heard the same misgivings from cable companies when it first added satellite TV providers and then telcos as distributors. HBOâs strategy is to give early partners a pricing advantage over newer ones; itâs unclear how this will go over with Apple, which has a track record of squeezing advantageous deals out of media, including the 99-cent single more than a decade ago.Bewkes said in December that he saw âcord-cuttingâ accelerate as pay TV providers dropped subscribers. U.S. pay TV providers lost 125,000 subscribers in 2014, according to Leichtman Research Group. At the same time, HBO and Cinemax reported their highest number of new subscribers (2.8 million) in 30 years.Among the challenges HBO faces to get HBO Now launched is how to avoid confusion with HBO Go, the service that allows HBOâs cable TV subscribers to access it on the Web, smartphones and tablets. The two services will have separate log-in pages and separate apps, but some cable execs are concerned about customer confusion.Â The explanation might challenge even the best call center employee: HBO Go is for TV subscribers to watch their content on devices; HBO Now for those who donât subscribe via TV.âStay up to date with our daily newsletterRelated Stories"	N/A
https://www.emergent.info/apple-pad-pro	Claim: Apple delayed production of a 12-inch iPad Pro and will not announce it at the March 9th event	true	['Apple', 'Bloomberg', 'iPad', 'Tim Culpan', 'Tim Higgins']	https://www.bloomberg.com/	https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/apple-said-to-delay-larger-ipad-production-on-panel-challenges	2015/03/04	Apple to Delay Production of Larger iPadsTim Culpan and Tim HigginsUpdated onApple Delays iPadApple Inc., which has seen stagnating iPad sales, will delay the start of manufacturing for a larger-screened version of the tablet, people with knowledge of the matter said.Production of the 12.9-inch-screen iPad is now scheduled to start around September because of delays involving the supply of display panels, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the details arenât public. Apple had initially planned to begin making the larger version this quarter, people familiar with those plans had said .A new big-screen tablet is part of Chief Executive Officer Tim Cookâs effort to reinvigorate the iPad product line, where sales have declined for four straight quarters. IPads are also facing competition from larger iPhones, which were introduced in September and helped Apple deliver record profit in the latest quarter.Apple, based in Cupertino, California, currently sells the iPad with a 9.7-inch display and the iPad mini, which has a 7.9-inch screen. Apple hasnât disclosed plans for a bigger iPad.Existing suppliers to Apple include Sharp Corp., Japan Display Inc. and LG Display Co., according to the companyâs supplier list . LG Display fell 2.5 percent to a four-month low in Seoul. Sharp fell as much as 2.6 percent before closing 0.9 percent higher in Tokyo while Japan Display dropped 2.1 percent.Business ToolsA larger iPad could also bolster Cookâs initiative to make Appleâs products more appealing to business users. Apple announced a partnership last year with International Business Machines Corp. to create mobile software for businesses and for IBM to help sell iPads to corporate customers.Even as consumers shift away from tablets in favor of bigger smartphones, businesses remain a growth opportunity for iPads because the devices can be used for field work and as laptop replacements. In total, global sales of tablets to businesses, institutions and governments are projected to jump to 101 million units in 2018 from 19 million in 2013, according to IHS Technology.Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn cited the opportunity to boost iPad sales to businesses as one of the key reasons why he thinks Apple shares are undervalued. Improvements to the iPad and the IBM partnership should help boost revenue from the device by 13 percent in each of the next three fiscal years, Icahn wrote in a public letter to Cook last year.(Adds closing shares in fifth paragraph.)Share	N/A

Munster sees an overall ASP at around $650 for the mid-tier Watch series.On the high end, the analyst forecasts base model Apple Watch Edition devices to start at $4,999, but classifies segment ASP closer to $7,500 after adding in straps made from precious metals.Based on current pricing for Apple's silicon iPhone 6 cases, which come in at $35, Munster sees elastomer Apple Watch straps to start in a similar $29 to $35 range, while leather bands could be priced between $49 to $59. Pricing for metal bands like the link bracelet and Milanese loop are more difficult to determine, but the analyst believes steel versions will come in at $99, while gold bands could be priced into the thousands of dollars.""If you assume that 55 percent of bands purchased are elastomer, 35 percent leather, 10 percent steel, and about 5,000 total gold bands are sold, the average band ASP could be around $50,"" Munster writes.He added that if half of all Watch buyers purchase a band âassuming 8 million Watches are sold in 2015 âthe accessory range would add $25 to Apple's watch category, equating to a $575 ASP. If every Watch customer purchases an extra strap, it would tack on $50, bringing ASP up to $600.The lower-cost Sport model is expected to make up 55 percent of overall Watch sales, while the mid-tier Apple Watch will take another 45 percent. That leaves very little room for Apple Watch Edition, but Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10,000 units this year. In an interesting comparison, the firm calculates that Apple Watch Edition business could equate to about two percent of luxury watchmaker Rolex, which moves between 600,000 to 750,000 units each year.Finally, Munster expects Apple to reveal a better sense of device pricing at its March 9 event , as well as highlight ""special features"" to drum up consumer interest ahead of release.AppleInsider will be covering the ""Spring forward"" event live from San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center next week.Topics:"	N/A

https://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-launch-Germany	Claim: The Apple Watch will be available in Germany at launch	true	['9to5 Mac', 'Apple Watch', 'Germany', 'Mark Gurman']	https://9to5mac.com/	https://9to5mac.com/2015/03/02/tim-cook-says-apple-watch-will-be-available-outside-u-s-in-april/	2015/03/02	Speaking at the Berlin flagship Apple Store last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook told employees that the Apple Watch will not be exclusive to the United States in April, according to employees in attendance. Specifically, Cook said that the Apple Watch will launch in Germany during the month of April. Its possible that the Apple Watch will launch first in the United States in early April, with Germany and other countries following later in the month, but it definitely appears that the Watchs rollout will be more aggressive than the first iPhone and iPad launches...iPad Air 2The iPhone was notably exclusive to the United States and AT&T for the first several months of the products life, while the iPad launched exclusively in the U.S. in April 2010 and was followed by launches in Europe and Australia over a month later, in mid-May of that year. Besides Germany, sources indicate that an April launch in Australia is also likely as Apple has already been training select Apple Retail employees on Apple Watch sales procedures by way of secret briefings in Sydney. The United Kingdom and France have both seen Apple Watch marketing pushes, so those countries are likely also in the April mix.The usual first wave countries for major Apple product launches also includes Canada, where Apple is soon planning to launch the Watch-compatible Apple Pay system, but we havent yet confirmed if those countries will be home to the new product in April. Apple has been heavily promoting the Apple Watch in China, so perhaps the wearable will launch to the Chinese market in or around April as well. However, launches in China could be delayed due to government regulatory factors. During his trip to Germany, Cook also stopped by Chancellor Angela Merkels office to discuss consumer privacy and the offices of BILD to discuss Apple rumors, Steve Jobs, and the NSA.Asked if employees will get free Apple Watches (like when full time employees got original iPhones from Steve Jobs in 2007), Cook reportedly said youve given me something to think about, I agree with your point, I think its great, and I think everyone should use our products. Its a good point for me to think about, Ive got some more plane rides to think about it on. Cook also discussed the expansion of Apple Pay into Europe, reportedly saying:Apple Pay will be global, its not a U.S. program. We want it everywhere. We are working to bring it out of the US. It is going to take a little bit of time to do so. We want to be in Germany. We want to be in Europe generally this year. I dont know if we will make it, I think we will. Its our intention to get here as fast as we can.We previously reported that Apple Pay will arrive in Canada as soon as March.	N/A

https://www.emergent.info/Gruber-Apple-Watch-Edition-10k	Claim: The gold Apple Watch Edition will cost $9,999 USD	true	['Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Edition', 'Apple Watch Price', 'Daring Fireball', 'Jon Gruber']	https://daringfireball.net/	https://daringfireball.net/2015/02/apple_watch_pricing	2015/02/20	On the Pricing of AppleÂ WatchFriday, 20 February 2015After the gala announcement event in September at which Apple introduced Apple Watch and whatever last yearâs iPhone was, I ran into SlashGear editor-in-chief Vincent Nguyen in the private hands-on area Apple had set up for select members of the media. Iâve known Vincent for years from various Apple events, and I always enjoy his perspective. I was actually looking around for him this time, though, because I really wanted to hear his take on Apple Watch. Vincent is a watch guy â he knows the watch industry, and his taste is excellent.We greeted each other, walked in, and started staring, close-up, at the lineup. When we got to the Edition models, Vincent said, with some excitement, âThis is going to cost $20,000.âIâd already started thinking that the Edition models would cost thousands, plural, but $20,000 struck me as a price from Bananas Town. Vincentâs reply was something to the effect of, âTry to find a good 18-karat gold watch for less than $20,000. You wonât.âHereâs what I wrote back in September , in my initial thoughts regarding Apple Watch:In short: hundreds for Sport, a thousand for stainless steel, thousands for gold.Most people think Iâm joking when I say the gold ones are going to start at $5,000. I couldnât be more serious. I made a friendly bet last week with a few friends on the starting price for the Edition models, and I bet on $9,999.The more I think about it, and the more I learn about the watch industry, the world of luxury goods, and the booming upper class of China, the better I feel about that bet. I donât think I was wrong to place a friendly late night bar bet on a $9,999 starting price. I think I was wrong to guess just $4,999 in my ostensibly sober published analysis.I can see which way the wind is blowing. For months Iâve been asking friends who might know â or know someone else who might know, or even know someone who knows someone who might know â whether my guess of $5,000 is too high for the Edition starting price. The answer has always been âNoâ. But the way Iâve been told âNoâ has given me the uneasy feeling that Iâve been asking the wrong question. I should have been asking if $5,000 is too low.I now think Edition models will start around $10,000 â and, if my hunch is right about bands and bracelets, the upper range could go to $20,000. I was off by a factor of two, and my friend Vincent, I think, nailed it back on the day Apple Watch was introduced.Itâs All About the BandsLouie Mantia helped clarify my thinking on this by publishing this seemingly sparsely populated table of Apple Watch collection/band combinations . Study that for a few minutes, and you should come to a few surprising â to me at least â conclusions.One of the selling points Apple emphasized in September is that bands are easily interchanged on Apple Watch. You just press a button underneath and itâs released; slide a new one in and it securely clicks into place. And they showed a wide variety of bands: Sport, Classic Buckle, Leather Loop, Modern Buckle, Milanese Loop, and Link Bracelet. Six different styles, all of them â other than the Milanese Loop â in multiple colors.I walked out of the event under the assumption that all of these bands would be available to purchase as accessories, like iPhone cases. So that one could, say, buy an Apple Watch Sport with a white sport band, and buy a Milanese Loop or one of the leather bands to make it dressier.I am no longer certain thatâs going to be the case. And if it is the case, the non-Sport bands are going to be expensive â in most cases, even more expensive than the Apple Watch Sport itself.What seems clear to me now is that the various bands signify tiers within the three collections â particularly for the stainless steel Apple Watch models. Take a look at Appleâs page for the steel Watch collection , and scroll down to the bottom, where they present a scrolling carousel of âall 18 models in the collectionâ. From left to right:38mm with White Sport Band42mm with White Sport Band38mm with Black Sport Band42mm with Black Sport Band38mm with Black Classic Buckle42mm with Black Classic Buckle38mm with Milanese Loop38mm with Soft Pink Modern Buckle38mm with Brown Modern Buckle38mm with Midnight Blue Modern Buckle42mm with Stone Leather Loop42mm with Bright Blue Leather Loop42mm with Light Brown Leather Loop38mm with Link Bracelet38mm Space Black Stainless Steel with Link Bracelet42mm Space Black Stainless Steel with Link BraceletThings to note:The âModern Buckleâ is only available for 38mm models. The Leather Loop is only available for 42mm models. The Space Black watch is only available with a single band option: the Link Bracelet.Sport Bands are surely the least expensive. Link Bracelets, Iâm almost as sure, are the most expensive. I think Apple placed these models in order from least to most expensive, going from left to right. (Including the fact that 38mm models will cost slightly less than their 42mm siblings.)Why are there both Classic Buckles and Modern Buckles? From their descriptions, it sounds like the Modern Buckle uses a better leather, and without question it has a more advanced clasp mechanism. I conclude: Modern is more expensive. They both exist because theyâll sit at different price points.Note too, that on the regular Apple Watch collection page, the Classic Buckle description states, regarding color options: âAvailable in black.â This, despite the same band being offered in Midnight Blue for the Edition collection.So Iâm thinking the regular Apple Watch will come in at least five pricing tiers:Entry: Sport Band, black or white.Regular leather: Classic Buckle, youâll get it in black and youâll like it.Milanese Loop.Deluxe leather: Modern Buckle for 38mm models, Leather Loop for 42mm models. Each with a choice of three colors.Link Bracelet.Youâll pay a premium for color straps and advanced clasp mechanisms, and youâll pay even more for the Link Bracelet.I think the spread between these tiers could be significant, ranging from, say, $700 for the entry model with the Sport Band to well over $1,000 for the Link Bracelet. I still think the average for the steel Apple Watch will be around $1,000, but depending on your strap choice, youâll pay several hundred less or more.But wait. I would not bet against Apple bringing back the black tax. Remember the plastic MacBooks from 2006? Apple charged $150 more for the black one than the white one, even though they had nearly identical specs.Note that the silver Apple Watch Sport only has four band color choices: white, blue, green, and pink. The space gray Sport edition has only one band: black. I think Apple might charge more for both the space gray Sport model and the space black stainless steel model.Further, I donât think any of the stainless steel bands will be available for retail purchase. Theyâll sell sport bands, which youâll be able to use on any Apple Watch, but I donât think any of the nicer bands will be available for retail purchase. Donât hold your breath for a space black Link Bracelet to put on your $349 Sport model. The nicer bands arenât accessories that Apple hopes youâll tack onto your purchase; theyâre signifiers of how much you paid for your stainless steel or gold Apple Watch.Limited EditionWhich brings me to the Edition collectionâs curiously thin lineup of strap choices . There are only three for each watch size, and Apple doesnât present them side-by-side in a carousel like they do with the stainless steel models:38mm Yellow Gold with Bright Red Modern Buckle38mm Rose Gold with White Sport Band42mm Rose Gold with White Sport Band38mm Rose Gold with Rose Gray Modern Buckle42mm Yellow Gold with Black Sport Band42mm Yellow Gold with Midnight Blue Classic BuckleThatâs the order in which the six models appear on Appleâs page. It almost certainly does not correspond to price.Things to note: None of these leather colors are available in the standard Apple Watch lineup. These are not regular Sport Bands â they have gold clasps. None of them have metal bands.These are (I think) $10,000+ watches, but half of them come with rubber sport bands that are nearly indistinguishable from the bands on the $349 Sport collection.Glaringly omitted is a gold Link Bracelet. Iâd place a side bet Apple withheld it in September, and will unveil it as a surprise option at the event theyâll hold before releasing the watches. If youâre going to go gold, go gold. Some people buy a gold watch simply because they like it. Others buy a gold watch because they want everyone to know they wear a gold watch. The latter group will gladly pay $20,000 for a watch with gold band.Perhaps Iâm biased by my personal taste in watch bands, but at the hands-on event in September, the Link Bracelet was my favorite by far, followed by the Milanese Loop. It seems downright ludicrous to me to charge significantly more for the Edition models and not offer the best of the bands. Note too that among the Edition combinations Apple currently lists, there is but a single 42mm model with something other than a rubber Sport Band â the Midnight Blue Classic Buckle. Further, as stated above, I think the Classic Buckle is the low-end leather strap. Iâm guessing Apple will offer Edition models with gold Link Bracelets for $20,000, and perhaps Milanese Loops for $15,000 and a Leather Loop for around $12,500.Look at the Watch IndustryDonât try to guess the price of the Edition models based on the amount of gold they contain. I did it this week , but itâs the wrong way to look at this. It doesnât matter if the gold in an Apple Watch Edition model is âonlyâ worth $1,000 or $1,500 or whatever. The gold in a Rolex is only worth that, too â and their gold watches sell for $20,000 and more, for the exact same movements in their $6,000 stainless steel models. The value of a gold watch is only tangentially related to the number of ounces of gold it contains. And Edition isnât just made of 18-karat gold â itâs made of the best 18-karat gold in the world. (I donât know that for a fact â I donât know anything about gold â Iâm just saying what Apple is saying.)Apple Watch Edition is not a tech product, so donât try to price it like one.Apple Watch Edition is a luxury wrist watch. Appleâs ambitions in this arena, I am convinced, are almost boundless. Theyâre not entering the market against Rolex, Omega, and the rest of the Swiss luxury watch establishment with disruptive prices. Theyâre entering the market against those companies going head-to-head on pricing, with disruptive (they think) features.Again I point you to someone from the watch world, Grail Watchâs Stephen Foskett, who points out that gold watches typically cost $10-15,000 more than the same watch in stainless steel â and tens of thousands more if they come with a gold bracelet. Even if Iâm wrong about Apple having gold Link Bracelets lying in wait as an April surprise, I donât think a $10,000 starting price for Apple Watch Edition is even a step out of line for the watch industry. 1Will it work? Will people actually buy these? I have no idea. But I think Apple thinks itâs going to work.At prices like these, an Apple Watch Edition is not an accessory for your iPhone â your iPhone is an accessory for your Apple Watch Edition. â©ï¸Previous:	N/A
https://www.emergent.info/Apple-Watch-straps-available-at-launch	Claim: Apple have different Watch bands for sale at launch	true	['9to5 Mac', 'Apple Watch', 'Apple Watch Accessories', 'Jordan Kahn']	https://9to5mac.com/	https://9to5mac.com/2015/02/20/apple-watch-straps-accessories-available-separately/	2015/02/15	Despite speculation to the contrary, Apple does in fact plan to sell an array of bands as separate accessories for the Apple Watch at launch, according to sources. So far Apple has only shown the Watch in pre-assembled collections, which reduces their potential for customization, but our sources say that Apples retail outlets will be stocked on day one with individual straps so customers can easily mix and match the looks of their Watches.While Apple has hinted at millions of combinations of Apple Watch when considering the various watch faces and interchangeable strap combos, up until now weve not had confirmation that straps would be available to purchase separately alongside the Apple Watch at launch.The best 4K & 5K displays for MacWhat we know about the Apple Watch lineup so far from Apple is that it will come in three models Apple Watch, Sport, and Edition with each of those models offering a selection of the total 6 straps Apple has shown so far on the 38mm size, 42mm size, or both. Some of the straps Apple shows on its website, such as the Modern Buckle and Leather Loop will be limited to either the 38mm or 42mm models in select colors for the Apple Watch and gold Apple Watch Edition. Its unclear Apples exact motivation in limiting certain watch straps to either the 38mm and 42mm options in the Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition lineups. The Apple Watch Sport line offers all strap options and colors for both sizes, according to Apples site. However, its possible that some of the straps Apple shows as limited to either the 38mm or 42mm sizes will become available to purchase for the other size separately. Some straps and bracelets might make more sense to offer as standalone accessories. Not offering straps for the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition could be something Apple does strategically to increase the exclusivity of those models that many expect to sell as high-end fashion items with matching price tags. Theres no confirmation on what straps Apple will make available to purchase separately at launch or if the options will reflect all variations of the device currently shown on Apples website. Its of course also possible, and quite likely, that Apple will offer straps beyond the designs its outed so far. 	N/A

BlackBerry played down the comment.Later that year, the Canadian government reportedly blocked a potential BlackBerry deal with Lenovo , due to national security concerns.Lenovo announced Wednesday, the creation of a new company focused on internet-based smart devices, to be launched on April 1, 2015.

https://www.emergent.info/comcast-fired	Claim: Comcast got a man fired from his job after he complained about the company's service	unverified	[]	https://consumerist.com/	https://consumerist.com/2014/10/06/unhappy-customer-comcast-told-my-employer-about-complaint-got-me-fired/	2014/10/08	UPDATE #3: Conal has filed a lawsuit against the cable giant in a federal court in California, alleging that â among other claims â Comcast violated a federal law prohibiting cable companies from sharing customersâ information without their consent.ââUPDATE #2: Comcast has apologized for the horrible service and billing that Conal experienced during his year-plus as a customer, but says that ânobody at Comcast asked for him to be fired.âââUPDATE: Conalâs former employers have given a brief explanation of his dismissal, without providing any details as to what exactly he said to Comcast that merited terminating his employment.ââ-When you complain to your cable company, you certainly donât expect that the cable company will then contact your employer and discuss your complaint. But thatâs exactly what happened to one former Comcast customer who says he was fired after the cable company called a partner at his accounting firm.TL;DR Versionâ¢ Customer spends 11 monthsÂ being overcharged by Comcast.â¢ Customerâs complaints go unresolved.â¢ Customer contacts office of Comcastâs Controller to complain about billing practices.â¢ Comcast contacts customerâs employer, which happens to do a lot of business with Comcast, says customer used employerâs name during complaint.â¢ Customer insists he did not use company name; fired by employer anyway.â¢ Comcast will not release e-mails or audio recordings to counter customerâs claim that he didnât use the name of his employer.IT BEGAN INNOCENTLY ENOUGHâ¦Conal began subscribing to Comcast service in early 2013 after he says he was sold a 9-month promotional pricing offer. But from the start, there were issues with his service, as he was being charged for set-top boxes that had yet to be activated. Additionally, someone at Comcast billing had misspelled Conalâs last name, meaning some of his bills were not being delivered.He says he met with a Comcast rep in May 2013 about the billing issues and promised they would all be sorted out, but things only got worse.A few months later, the promotional discount shrunk and Conalâs monthly bill increased by $20, in addition to still being charged for unactivated devices in his house. Comcast also twice charged him an additional $7 for a second modem he did not have.Meanwhile, attempts to get a resolution from Comcast went unanswered.CUTTING THE CORDHe attempted to cancel his service in Oct. 2013 but says a Comcast rep convinced him that the billing issues would be resolved and that he would get free DVR service and The Movie Channel for three months as compensation.But things didnât just continue as they had before; Comcast somehow managed to sink even lower than it had before, sending Conal about a dozen pieces of equipment that he didnât order.âThere were a few DVRs, modem, standard boxes and equipment that I was unfamiliar with,â he says.Making matters worse, Comcast billed him $1,820 for all this stuff heâd never requested and had no use for.When Conal returned all the equipment to Comcast and, being an experienced accountant at one of the nationâs most prestigious firms, even prepared a spreadsheet detailing every charge, overcharge, payment and credit on his account for his brief time as a Comcast customer.He says even this didnât convince Comcast that there was a problem and that Conal had been overcharged. And even though it wasnât yet past due, Comcast sent Conalâs account into collections in Feb. 2014.THE CALL IN QUESTIONAnd so on Feb. 6, 2014, he chose to try going above Comcastâs customer service, which hadnât been of any help in the year heâd been a subscriber, and instead contacted the office of the companyâs Controller. He spoke to someone in that office who promised Conal would receive a call back to address the issues.He describes that callback as âbizarre,â with the rep not identifying which company she was calling from, just starting out with âHow can I help you?â Then she kept insisting that a technician had shown up for an appointment, but wouldnât specify which appointment. The rep then began asking him for the color of his house.So he tried the Controllerâs office again, to let them know that the rep theyâd sent his way had failed miserably at her job.During this call, he says that he mentioned that Comcastâs billing and accounting issues should probably be investigated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a private-sector oversight operation. This ultimately led to two service calls where no one ever showed up and no explanations were given.But something did happen. Just not anything good.WE KNOW WHERE YOU WORKRemember how we briefly mentioned above that Conal worked for a large, prestigious accounting firm? Comcast certainly noticed that fact, especially since that firm is one that does business with Comcast.At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conalâs subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says heâd only received positive feedback and reviews for his work.Comcast maintained that Conal used the name of his employer in an attempt to get leverage. Conal insists that he never mentioned his employer by name, but believes that someone in the Comcast Controllerâs office looked him up online and figured out where he worked.When he was fired, Conalâs employer explained that the reason for the dismissal was an e-mail from Comcast that summarized conversations between Conal and Comcast employees.But Conal has never seen this e-mail in order to say whether itâs accurate and Comcast has thus far refused to release any tapes of the phone calls related to this matter.And while his former employer did provide consulting services to Comcast, it was not the accounting firm that audited Comcastâs books. So Conal doesnât quite see how mentioning the name of his employer would have helped gain him any leverage.In response to a letter from Conalâs lawyer â he has not filed a lawsuit, but itâs not out of the question â Comcastâs Senior Deputy General Counsel admits that the company did contact Conalâs employer but says that Conal âis not in a position to complain that the firm came to learnâ about his dispute with Comcast.THE HEART OF THE MATTERI think whether or not Conal mentioned his employer is beside the point. The problem should not have reached the point where he was even reaching out the Comcast Controllerâs office.Had the billing issues been fixed on the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth chance that he gave Comcast to address the issue, the call in question would never have happened.And even if Conal did identify his employer in the hope of getting his billing issue fixed, he wouldnât have been trying to get preferential treatment; just the service heâd paid for.Iâm also curious why, even though Comcast insists that Conal attempted to leverage his place of business to get his issue resolved, it has not specifically cited language that he allegedly used in the call.How many times a day do Comcast reps hear a customer say something like âIâm a lawyerâ or âIâm a big shot at [fill in the blank]â? How many of those result in Comcast going out of its way to contact that customerâs employer?We reached out to Comcast to ask whether itâs company policy to contact customersâ employers. No one answered that question, but a rep for Comcast did give a brief statement.âOur customers deserve the best experience every time they interact with us,â reads the statement. Comcast says it has previously apologized to Conal, but adds âwe will review his lawyerâs letter and respond as quickly as possible.âWant more consumer news?

A Comcast agent named Jeremy allegedly called Tor an âillegal service.â The Comcast agent told its customer that such activity is against usage policies./r/darknetmarketsThe Comcast agent then repeatedly asked the customer to tell him what sites he was accessing on the Tor browser. The customer refused to answer.The next day the customer called Comcast and spoke to another agent named Kelly who reiterated that Comcast does not want its customers using Tor. The Comcast agent then allegedly told the customer:Users who try to use anonymity, or cover themselves up on the internet, are usually doing things that arenât so-to-speak legal. We have the right to terminate, fine, or suspend your account at anytime due to you violating the rules. Do you have any other questions? Thank you for contacting Comcast, have a great day.How did Comcast know its customers were using Tor in the first place? Because Tor Browser provides online anonymity to its users, This would mean that Comcast is monitoring the online activities of its users, to (among other things) check if they are following their Acceptable Use Policy.Comcast has previously been listed by the Tor project as a Bad ISP . The users of the Tor project listed Comcast as a bad ISP that is not friendly to Tor. The Tor project cited Comcastâs Acceptable Use Policy for its residential customers which claims to not allow servers or proxies under â technical restrictions .â:use or run dedicated, stand-alone equipment or servers from the Premises that provide network content or any other services to anyone outside of your Premises local area network (âPremisesLANâ), also commonly referred to as public services or servers. Examples of prohibited equipment and servers include, but are not limited to, email, web hosting, file sharing, and proxy services and servers;A Comcast spokesperson told DeepDotWeb that:We respect customer privacy and security and would only investigate the specifics of a customerâs account with a valid court order. And if weâre asked by a court to provide customer information, then we ask for a reasonable amount of time to notify the customer so they can decide if they would like to hire a lawyer and if they do, then we turn the case over to them and they proceed with the judge directly and we step away.However, this statement appears to be at odds with Comcastâs treatment of Ross Ulbricht, alleged Dread Pirate Roberts.Comcast previously corroborated with the FBI by providing information on alleged Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbrichtâs internet usage. Ulbrichtâs legal defense without a warrant. Ulbricht was most certainly never given a warning by Comcast or given time to contact a lawyer before he was arrested in a San Francisco library last October.Comcast already monitors its customers internet usage to prevent them from downloading pirated media in violation of copyright laws. Under the âSix Strikesâ plan, Comcast customers who are caught by Comcast pirating copy-written material are emailed by Comcast and told to cease the activity. Comcast will continue monitoring them, and if they violate the âSix Strikesâ plan five more times, their internet service will be terminated.EDIT 14.9.14: Removed a sentence that was wrong. Added link.EDIT2 15.9.14: Comcast released a post Setting the Record Straight on Tor denying the above and stating: âThe anecdotal chat room evidence described in these reports is not accurate.â Without explaining what is the âaccurateâ explanation?

https://www.emergent.info/apple-path	Claim: Apple is buying Path	unverified	[]	https://pando.com/	https://pando.com/2014/09/09/source-apple-set-to-acquire-path-in-an-attempt-to-bolster-ios-social-cred/	2014/09/10	LinkedInFrom The News DeskIn a day packed with major Apple announcements, the company tackled smartphones, wearables , and payments . But there is one more sector that may be about to get the Apple treatment: Social.According to a single well-placed source inside Appleâs engineering team, the company is poised to announce an acquisition of Dave Morinâs Path social network. To quote our source, who requested to remain anonymous because the deal has not been announced yet, âItâs almost done, if not signed already, but itâs essentially a done deal.âIf true, it would be major news for the heretofore struggling social platform that has been known more for its design and user interface innovations than for its ability to drive adoption among consumers â particularly in non-Asian markets. Apple hasnât fared much better in the social realm historically, having flopped with its Ping social network and having made very little out of its acquisition of the team and IP from failed location-based photo social network, Color.According to our source, this is more than just a talent acquisition, or acquihire. The Path product will likely survive the acquisition and be incorporated, in whole or in part, into Appleâs newly refreshed Messages app. That doesnât mean that the deal will be priced like some other recent high-profile mobile communication deals, namely Facebookâs $19 billion Whatsapp acquisition and rumored $3 billion-plus offers extended to Snapchat by Facebook and Google.Facebook paid $42 per Whatsapp user, and $33 per Instagram user before that. By comparison, Rakuten bought the far less beloved Viber for just $3 per user. With Path having somewhere in the vicinity of 25 million users at the beginning of this year, and far weaker growth and engagement than any of the above platforms, it would be lucky to commandÂ anywhere near Instagram/Whatsapp sums. According to App Annie, Path ranks just 177th among iOS Social Networking apps in the US and not among the top 1000 overall iOS apps. When Path raised its most recent round in January of this year, the company reportedly commanded a sub-$400 million valuation, well below the $500 million-plus levels reportedly sought by management. Given the trajectory it was on, exiting at that level would likely be considered a win among most Path insiders. Hell, for many Valley observers, that would be the win of the century for Path investors, many of which have all but left the company for dead.Appleâs re-entry into social would also be a notable development. With Facebook (including Instagram and Whatsapp), Twitter, and Snapchat each looking stronger than ever in their respective social verticals, itâs unclear just where an Apple-driven social product would fit in among consumers daily habits. Google seems to have reached a similar conclusion, all but abandoning its strategy of pushing Google+ as a standalone social platform, and instead choosing to let the platform fade into the background of its other consumers platforms like Gmail and YouTube. Appleâs one stronghold has been in messaging via iMessage, which recently got a facelift. And Path has recently leaned more in this direction with its launch of an ephemeral messaging product, abandoning its long-held loveÂ ofÂ more lasting, intimate communications . Itâs certainly conceivable that Path could be integrated into Apple's messagingÂ platform, but itâs unclear, beyond the design prowess, how this acquisition helps Apple, at any price.Adding additional fuel to this fire, Dave Morin was spotted sitting in the front row for todayâs Apple keynote event, a high profile position reserved for Dr. Dre and other key Apple insiders.Did not forget about Dre. pic.twitter.com/fWNDpFhfYrâ Dave Morin (@davemorin) September 9, 2014 Apple has been known to be a fan of Morinâs, as well as the Path design aesthetic and broader design team. Take for example the companyâs decision to feature the Path app early on in numerous keynotes and advertising campaigns. In that sense, it wouldnât be that surprising if such a deal were to be consummated. Jason Calacanis made a similar observation in his evening email newsletter today, noting Morinâs seating at todayâs event and Appleâs long-standing frustrations around social. Others have been asking whether such an acquisition makes sense for years.To be clear, even if our source is correct, these transactionsÂ are never a sure thing until ink has been put to paper and (at least in the case of a public company like Apple) a public announcement has been made. But the tea leaves seem to be aligning on this deal. It's certainly an unexpected outcome, but it would sound even more crazy if Apple didnât have north of $150 billion in cash burning a hole in its pocket and a love for all things aesthetic. And with Morin's vaunted reputation for design, and Apple's social struggles I can't think of a better home for the once-hyped app.Â Donât be surprised to see Apple swoop in to rescue Path from social also-ran status.Pando hasÂ reached out to MorinÂ for confirmation (or otherwise) of the claim. We willÂ update this post as soon as I hear back.	N/A

https://www.emergent.info/apple-12-inch-Macbook-air	"Claim: Apple will launch a 12"" MacBook Air in 2015"	true	['9to5 Mac', 'Apple', 'MacBook Air', 'Mark Gurman']	https://9to5mac.com/	https://9to5mac.com/2015/01/06/macbook-air-12-inch-redesign/	2014/01/07	Apple is preparing an all-new MacBook Air for 2015 with a radically new design that jettisons standards such as full-sized USB ports, MagSafe connectors, and SD card slots in favor of a markedly thinner and lighter body with a higher-resolution display. Sources within Apple, who have used internal prototype versions of the upcoming computer, have provided in-depth details about the machine, and our exclusive artist renditions of the revamped MacBook Air provide the first close look at Apples first major step in mobile Mac computing since the Retina MacBook Pro launch in 2012.iPad Air 2The 12-inch MacBook Air will be considerably smaller than the current 13-inch version, yet also slightly narrower than the 11-inch model. The new 12-inch version is approximately a quarter-of-an-inch narrower than the 11-inch version, yet it is also a quarter-of-an-inch taller in order to accommodate the slightly larger display. In order to fit the larger screen into a footprint about the size of the current 11-inch model, the bezels on the display have been reduced on all sides.Besides a new look for the front of the computer, the entire unibody has been revamped from the keyboard to the trackpad to the speakers. Taking cues from the 12-inch PowerBook introduced by Steve Jobs over a decade ago, the new keyboard sits edge-to-edge across the width of the laptop. In addition to going edge-to-edge, the entire key set has been subtly redesigned so that each key sits noticeably closer together. Apple has squeezed the keys closer in order for the computer to be as narrow as possible, which can be seen in the rendition below:Apple has also relocated some of the function keys across the top and simplified the arrow key array in order to keep the keyboard as narrow as possible without taking away from overall usability. In addition to the keyboard, the trackpad has been changed. The trackpad is approximately the same width as that on the 11-inch MacBook Air (if not ever-so-slightly wider), but it is apparently slightly taller, nearly touching the bottoms of the keyboard and the frame. In line with earlier rumors, it also appears that the new trackpad does not have the same clicking effect as found on current and earlier MacBook models.The elimination of physical feedback in the click is part of Apples plan to reduce the thickness of the MacBook to a bare minimum. As can be seen in 9to5Mac artist Michael Steebers rendition above, the new 12-inch Air (on the left) is far thinner than the current 11-inch model (on the right). Taking cues from the current Air, the future model has a teardrop-like, tapered design that gets thinner from top to bottom. Above the keyboard are four redesigned speaker grills that actually double as ventilation holes for the fan-less device to keep cool.The upcoming laptop is so thin that Apple employees are said to refer to the device as the MacBook Stealth internally. In order to reach that new level of portability, Apple not only slimmed down the trackpad and tweaked the speakers but the ports as well:The upcoming 12-inch Air has the fewest amount of ports ever on an Apple computer, as can be seen in the rendition above. On the right side is a standard headphone jack and dual-microphones for input and noise-canceling. On the left side is solely the new USB Type-C port. Yes, Apple is currently planning to ditch standard USB ports, the SD Card slot, and even its Thunderbolt and MagSafe charging standards on this new notebook. We must note that Apple tests several designs of upcoming products, so Apple may choose to ultimately release a new Air that does include the legacy components, though there is very little space on the edges for them.As weve reported on multiple occasions, the new USB Type-C connector is smaller, faster, and more capable than the standard USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports on existing computers. The connector is able to replace the Thunderbolt Display port on the current Apple laptops as USB Type-C actually has the technology to drive displays. Additionally, the latest specifications from the USB foundation indicate that USB Type-C can actually be used to power computers, which makes the standard MagSafe plugs unnecessary on this new device. The connector is also reversible like Lightning on iPads and iPhones, which should make the overall experience a bit more intuitive. As the new MacBook may only have a single port, it would make sense for Apple to create a hub of some sort for users to be able to plug in multiple devices into the new laptop. Apple already ships all sorts of adapters for its Macs and iOS Devices, so adding yet another attachment to the accessory portfolio would not be unprecedented. With Apple moving to a new Space Gray color on its iOS devices and on some Macs (such as with the 2013 Mac Pro), it seems possible that this new MacBook may come in a new gray color, as shown off in some of our renditions.The latest rumors indicate that the new MacBook Air will ship in mid-2015 (perhaps around WWDC), while other reports have claimed that the new Air is already nearing production. With Intel revealing the latest news on the Broadwell chipset family at CES this week, the ball is likely now in Apples court for pushing the future of mobile computing into the world.	N/A

https://www.emergent.info/elon-university-freshman-ban	Claim: Elon University has banned use of the term 'freshman'	false	['Elon University', 'Freshman', 'University']	https://www.thecollegefix.com/	https://www.thecollegefix.com/post/20172/	2014/11/23	Diana Stancy - Elon University â¢November 19, 2014OFFICIAL: Celebrates wider range of identities and expressions, protects young women from sexual violenceELON, N.C. â Elon University has dropped the term âfreshmanâ from its vocabulary and replaced it with âfirst-year,â a move made official this fall and implemented in everything from its website to orientation workshops.The change at the small, private liberal arts college in North Carolina was done to promote inclusivity, celebrate diversity, and ensure the campus did not promote sexist stereotypes or create a hostile and unsafe environment for female students, campus officials said in interviews with The College Fix.Leigh-Anne Royster , director of Elonâs âInclusive Community Wellbeing,â said in an email toÂ The College Fix that she has been told by some that they believe the term âfreshmanâ is outdated, and that replacing âfreshmanâ with âfirst yearâ is a âcelebration of diversity.âRoyster stated the word âfreshmanâ naturally insinuates a hierarchy among students on campus. She said she believes that students are viewed as younger and less experienced when referred to as âfreshman.â With that, Royster stated âfreshmanâ may contribute to sexual violence on campus because it labels the youngest students, causing them to be targets.âThe term has often been felt to refer to the vulnerableness of young women in college for the first time,â Royster said. âGiven the rates of sexual violence perpetrated against women on college campuses, it is useful to examine any use of a term that suggests that a group of people just entering college might be targets for such violence in any way.âRoyster said she believes this change will positively impact future students at Elon and foster progress in inclusivity related to gender.âUsing language that allows for a more inclusive understanding of gender will be important in our culture moving forward,â she said. âMoving away from language, including pronouns, that denote a gender binary will be something we see more and more as our culture evolves to celebrate a wider range of identities and expressions.âAt this semesterâs student orientation leader training, administrators made it clear that incoming students must be called âfirst-years.â No public announcement was made regarding this change â administrators relied largely on word of mouth to carry the news.Elon sophomore Alaina Schukraft, an orientation leader, told The Fix that each time an orientation leader said âfreshmanâ in training, he or she was immediately corrected.âThey engrained over and over in our brains that it was supposed to be âfirst-year,â not âfreshman,ââ Schukraft said. âThey were very adamant about using the correct terminology and stressed the importance of using language that would make the new students feel comfortable.âBut when the new wording was rolled out, not all incoming students were comfortable with this change. Schukraft said multiple incoming students approached her saying they were more comfortable with the term âfreshman.âBut Greg Zaiser, vice president of admissions and financial planning, said in an email to The College Fix that the change improves the campus environment.Zaiser said administrators believe the change keeps with Elonâs core values, and is a more appropriate description for new students. He added some believe âfreshmenâ is a âsexistâ term, and Elon is attempting to move away from gendered stereotypes.âAs an inclusive community, Elon strives to incorporate language that is current and reflective of our student body,â Zaiser said in an email to The College Fix. â âFreshmanâ isnât necessarily wrong, but itâs not completely applicable to Elonâs entire population, which includes internationals, transfers, spring admits, along with traditional students beginning their first year on a college campus.âCollege Fix contributor Diana Stancy is a student at Elon University and president of the Network of enlightened Women (NeW) chapter at Elon.

https://www.emergent.info/texas-turkey-farm-ebola-hoax	Claim: A Texas turkey farm was contaminated with Ebola	false	['Ebola', 'Fake News', 'Texas']	https://dailybuzzlive.com/	https://dailybuzzlive.com/texas-turkey-farm-contaminated-ebola-holiday-turkeys-infected/	2014/11/16	"Sharing is caring!0Tweet0Share0Share0Pin0Mail0ShareTexas Turkey Farm Contaminated With Ebola, Over 250,000 Holiday Turkeys Infected.A Texas turkey farm employee is now under quarantine after he tested positive for the Ebola virus. Texas Prime Turkey Farm, the largest supplier of turkeys in the United States, has been ordered by the CDC to quarantine over 250,000 holiday turkeys. The CDC has confirmed 3,000 turkeys have tested positive for the virus since Fridays incident.According to investigators, long time employee Philip Canseco was seen vomiting in the facilities restroom three days prior to the incident on Friday. I was passing by the restroom, when I heard somebody throwing up inside, said one Texas Prime Turkey Farm employee. I opened the door and looked inside and saw Canseco throwing up in one of the urinals. I asked him if he was okay, he said yes, and I left. I didnt want to get close to him and get sick.Management confirmed that Canseco worked three full work days at the facility with flu-like symptoms, before passing out unconscious with a fever of 106. Due to his symptoms, he was rushed to a local hazmat tent where he tested positive for the Ebola virus. The CDC reports an additional 7 coworkers are being quarantined and tested. However, they have not released those results as of yet.The facility has been ordered by the CDC to burn their entire flock of turkeys, over 250,000. Texas Prime Turkey Farm is requesting permission from the state of Texas to send the shipment of incinerated turkey ashes to Veolias Port Arthur environmental waste facility. This facility has already accepted one shipment of Ebola waste from household goods where Thomas Eric Duncan had stayed. Duncan was the first man to die of Ebola on US soil.Activists are protesting the shipments of contaminated Ebola waste to their community. We feel every precaution should be taken to protect our community, our children and our elderly. We are not a dumping ground for the nations, or the worlds bio waste.Plant manager Mitch Osborne said on Saturday that even though no contract has yet been signed, the plant will likely receive the second shipment of contaminated Ebola waste. It is a safe and sound process, Osborne said. I am not going to place my employees in harms way, or the community. The company is here to improve the environment and I believe we are doing a pretty darn good job of that. I believe we are doing the right and safe thing.A spokesperson for Texas Prime Turkey Farm said there is a good chance Ebola turkeys may have already shipped out to major suppliers for distribution. Each retailer will have to perform recalls individually if they feel they have received a contaminated shipment.CLICK HERE > TO LIKE DAILY BUZZ LIVE ON FACEBOOK!Sharing is

https://www.emergent.info/ny-marijuana-tickets	Claim: New York Police will start issuing tickets, rather than make arrests, for small amounts of marijuana	true	['Marijuana', 'NYC', 'Police']	https://www.nytimes.com/	https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/nyregion/in-shift-police-dept-to-stop-low-level-marijuana-arrests-officials-say.html?_r=0	2014/11/10	Nov. 10, 2014A clearer picture is expected to emerge this week, as Mr. de Blasio prepares for his first meeting with the cityâs five district attorneys. A spokeswoman for the mayor, Marti Adams, declined to comment on the proposed policy change, although officials in two of the district attorneyâs offices confirmed that the de Blasio administration was working on a new policy for how the police handle marijuana cases.In an interview on Sunday, Mr. Thompson expressed concern about the mayorâs plan, calling it an end-run around the district attorneys that could end up hurting some of the very people the changes are supposed to help.Since July, the Brooklyn district attorneyâs office has dismissed 849 misdemeanor marijuana cases involving police arrests, or about 34 percent of the total 2,526 such cases in Brooklyn.Under the proposed changes, it appears that instead of being arrested, those given a ticket for marijuana will be told to appear in a courtroom. But the new policy could push prosecutors out of the process, because summonses issued without an accompanying arrest generally do not receive prosecutorial review.ImagePolice Commissioner William J. BrattonCreditMichael Appleton for The New York TimesâIn order to give the public confidence in the fairness of the criminal justice system, these cases should be subject to prosecutorial review,â Mr. Thompson said. âBy allowing these cases to avoid early review, by issuing a summons, there is a serious concern that many summonses will be issued without the safeguards currently in place. These cases will move forward even when due process violations might have occurred.âAnother possible effect of the new policy would be that many of the tickets later convert into arrest warrants if the person misses a court date, he said. There are currently about 1.2 million active warrants in New York relating to missed court dates and unpaid fines for misdemeanors and noncriminal violations. In 2013, people failed to pay or show up to court about a quarter of the time for the 329,198 summons cases on the dockets of the cityâs lowest level criminal courts, according to court statistics.Under the current practice, more than half of those arrested for marijuana were released a couple of hours after being brought to a station house, according to 2012 data gathered by the Criminal Justice Agency, a nonprofit that assists with bail determinations. They were fingerprinted, checked for warrants and issued a ticket demanding their appearance in court six to eight weeks later. The remainder of those arrested for marijuana possession were âput through the system,â meaning they were held for up to 24 hours before being arraigned before a judge.In New York, the debate over marijuana arrests has been less about drug decriminalization than it has been about the aggressive stop-and-frisk tactics that came to define the Police Departmentâs crime-fighting strategies . During the Bloomberg administration, the police arrested as many as 50,000 people a year on minor marijuana charges, meaning that some years, approximately one in eight arrests made by the police was for marijuana. In some cases, arrests were made after officers stopped people under dubious circumstances and instructed them to remove any contraband from their pockets.ImageKenneth P. Thompson, the Brooklyn district attorney.CreditBebeto Matthews/Associated PressIn 1977, the Legislature in New York moved to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana that were not in public view. That meant that carrying a small bag of marijuana hidden in a pocket was supposed to be a ticket-eligible violation that did not amount to a crime.Â But since the mid-1990s, the police have routinely arrested people they found with marijuana and charged them with a misdemeanor, even though it was only supposed to apply to marijuana that was burning or discovered in âpublic view.âÂ In 2011, the police commissioner at the time, Raymond W. Kelly, issued an unusual order reminding officers that the misdemeanor was not the appropriate charge in many cases.In 2013, the police still arrested more than 28,000 people for marijuana possession, and in 2014, the arrests were occurring at a similar pace, Professor Levine said.While campaigning for mayor, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, emphatically criticized the departmentâs marijuana arrest practices. His populist outrage against heavy-handed policing in minority neighborhoods helped propel him into City Hall. But since becoming mayor in January, he has exerted little pressure on the department, instead often deferring to Commissioner Bratton, who has made a national reputation for aggressive street policing combined with an ability to soothe the often-inflamed relations between big-city police departments and the minority neighborhoods they serve.Yet Mr. de Blasio now finds himself under increasing pressure to deliver on his platform of police reform. That pressure began in July after a black Staten Island man died after a police officer put him in a chokehold while trying to arrest him for selling untaxed cigarettes. Since then, the departures of the departmentâs top Hispanic official and its highest-ranking black officer have led a number of minority lawmakers and City Hall allies to begin to question Mr. de Blasioâs oversight of the police.A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: In City, Marijuana May Mean Ticket, Not Arrest.

https://www.emergent.info/white-house-fence-jumper-made-it-inside	Claim: White House fence-jumper made it inside the main floor	true	[]	https://www.washingtonpost.com/	https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house-fence-jumper-made-it-far-deeper-into-building-than-previously-known/2014/09/29/02efd53e-47ea-11e4-a046-120a8a855cca_story.html?hpid=z1	2014/09/29	The man who jumped the White House fence this month and sprinted through the front door made it much farther into the building than previously known, overpowering one Secret Service officer and running through much of the main floor, according to three people familiar with the incident. An alarm box near the front entrance of the White House designed to alert guards to an intruder had been muted at what officers believed was a request of the usherâs office, said a Secret Service official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The officer posted inside the front door appeared to be delayed in learning that the intruder, Omar Gonzalez, was about to burst through. Officers are trained that, upon learning of an intruder on the grounds â often through the alarm boxes posted around the property â they must immediately lock the front door. After barreling past the guard immediately inside the door, Gonzalez, who was carrying a knife, dashed past the stairway leading a half-flight up to the first familyâs living quarters. He then ran into the 80-foot-long East Room, an ornate space often used for receptions or presidential addresses. Gonzalez was tackled by a counterassault agent at the far southern end of the East Room. The intruder reached the doorway to the Green Room, a parlor overlooking the South Lawn with artwork and antique furniture, according to three people familiar with the incident. Secret Service officials had earlier said he was quickly detained at the main entry. Agency spokesman Edwin Donovan said the office is not commenting during the ongoing investigation of the incident. Breaches of the White House fence have become more common, but most jumpers are tackled by Secret Service officers guarding the complex before they get even a third of the way across the lawn. Gonzalez is the first person known to have jumped the fence and made it inside the executive mansion. Secret Service Director Julia Pierson has said the breach was âunacceptableâ to her, and on Friday she briefed President Obama on her plans to shore up security. Pierson is expected to face tough questions about the Gonzalez incident Tuesday at a hearing of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The hearing is likely to cover a number of security lapses by the agency, including new revelations published over the weekend by The Washington Post about the failure to identify and properly investigate a 2011 shooting attack on the White House. The more detailed account of this monthâs security breach comes from people who provided information about the incident to The Post and whistleblowers who contacted Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the oversight panelâs subcommittee on national security. Chaffetz said he plans to ask Pierson how an alarm meant to alert officers to intruders could be silenced or turned down. The congressman said two people inside the agency told him that boxes were silenced because the White House usher staff, whose office is near the front door, complained that they were noisy. A Secret Service official told The Post that the usherâs office was concerned the boxes were frequently malfunctioning and unnecessarily sounding off. The alarm boxes, which officers call âcrash boxes,â are key pieces of the agencyâs first-alert system, according to former agents and officials. If officers spot an intruder, they are trained to hit the large red button on the nearest box â sending an alert to every post on the complex about the location of an incursion and piping sound from that location to other boxes around the property. âIf true, the fact that crash boxes were muted to avoid being âdisruptiveâ is not due to a lack of resources or an insufficient number of checkpoints or barriers,â Chaffetz said. He called the incident a âfailure of leadershipâ by the Secret Service. âThe agency needs a solution that goes deeper than more fences and more people,â Chaffetz said. The new revelations follow accounts provided to The Post last week detailing how Gonzalezâs ability to enter the White House reflected a failure of multiple levels of security at the compound. The agency relies on these successive layers as a fail-safe for protecting the president and the White House complex. In this incident, a plainclothes surveillance team was on duty that night outside the fence, meant to spot jumpers and give early warning before they made it over. But that team did not notice Gonzalez. There was an officer in a guard booth on the North Lawn. When that officer could not reach Gonzalez, there was supposed to be an attack dog, a specialized SWAT team and a guard at the front door â all at the ready. The dog was not released, a decision now under review. Some people familiar with the incident say the handler probably felt he could not release the dog, because so many officers were in pursuit of Gonzalez and the dog may have attacked them instead. Since the incident, the Secret Service has added an additional layer of temporary fencing while the agency reviews its procedures. Alice Crites contributed to this report.	N/A

James Foleyâs brother, Michael, also told ABC News that he was directly threatened with possible prosecution by a State Department official.âIt was very upsetting because we were essentially told to trustâ¦ that the way they were handling things would bring our son home,â Diane Foley said.The U.S. government did try to rescue James Foley along with other American and European hostages from an ISIS stronghold in Syria in early July, but by the time the elite commandos arrived at the location, the hostages had been moved. Foley was executed weeks later by a self-professed ISIS militant.Digital GlobeThis satellite photo shows a compound on the Euphrates River just south of Raqqah, Syria where ISIS hostages, including James Foley, were believed to have been held in the Spring of 2014 based on descriptions by former hostages.Diane Foley said the family believed they knew where their son was being held prior to his execution, but other than the July rescue mission, it didnât seem like anything was being done.âBut weâre not politicians, weâre not government people, we donât know,â she said. Diane Foley said the problem was that the family âhad no ideaâ because the government didnât tell them.At times, Diane Foley said the family âhad to begâ the government for information on their son.âWe were an annoyance, it felt, at some levelâ¦ They didnât have time for us,â she said.Today White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said that government officials were in constant contact with the Foley family and declined to comment on the alleged ransom warnings, telling reporters heâs ânot going to be in a position to detail the kinds of conversations that took place so often between members of the administration and the Foley family.ââIt is a long standing policy of this administration, it was the policy of previous administrations that ransoms should not be paid to terrorist organizations,â Earnest said before referring more specific questions about the Foleyâs situation to the Justice Department .Secretary of State John Kerry today told reporters that he was âreally taken aback [and] surprisedâ by Foleyâs allegations. âI can tell you that I am totally unaware and would not condone anybody that I know of within the State Department making such statements,â Kerry said.State Department spokesperson Marie Harf today denied the State Department told the family they could be prosecuted for paying ransom, only that the department helps hostage families âunderstand what our laws are about terrorists or paying ransom to terrorists.ââBut this department would never and did not ever intend nor do we think we ever did anything that we would consider threatening,â Harf said.Obtained by ABC NewsA screengrab from a video posted online appears to show American journalist James Foley shortly before he is killed by a masked captor.Thursday an NSC spokeswoman also said that the Foley family was informed of U.S. laws banning terrorism financing but denied the family was told they could face charges if they made a ransom payment.""Without getting into the details of our private discussions with families, the law is clear that ransom payments to designated individuals or entities, such as ISIL [ISIS], are prohibited. It is also a matter of longstanding policy that the U.S. does not grant concessions to hostage takers. Doing so would only put more Americans at risk of being taken captive. That is what we convey publicly and what we convey privately,"" NSC spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a statement.The spokeswoman also asked ABC News to withhold the military officer's name for fear his personal security could be compromised by those who might wrongly blame U.S. officials for Foley's slaughter at the hands of ISIS militants who may never have considered sparing him for any price.Diane Foley did not disclose how much her family had raised before his high-profile public execution but she and a surviving son, Michael, said that the administration's intimidation tactics succeeded.""It slowed my parents down quite a bit. They didn't want to do anything that could get them in trouble. It slowed them down for months in raising money. Who knows what might have happened?"" Michael Foley said.The family launched the James W. Foley Legacy Fund this week, which in large part is intended to help other hostages' loved ones navigate the frustrating currents they encountered both with the terrorists and with their own government.Two American and several British hostages remain in ISIS captivity.Asked whether she had believed ISIS would accept a ransom payment and free their son, as they had many European hostages liberated for between $2-3 million each, Diane Foley replied, ""I do, maybe -- I mean, who knows?""""ISIS is a very brutal group. They may have already decided, that Jim and the others were Americans and they were going to kill him,"" Diane Foley said.In the end, Diane Foley said she didn't want to blame anyone for what happened to her son, but said that when it comes to the U.S. governmentâs treatment of the families of hostages, âAs Americans, we can do better.â"	N/A
https://www.emergent.info/foley-executioner-gitmo	Claim: A former Guantanamo Bay prisoner executed journalist James Wright Foley.	unverified	[]	https://www.washingtonpost.com/	https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/islamic-state-claims-it-beheaded-american-photojournalist-james-foley/2014/08/19/42e83970-27e6-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html	2014/08/22	The Islamic State militant group claimed Tuesday to have beheaded an American photojournalist in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes in Iraq. A video posted on YouTube, later removed, purported to show the execution of James Foley after he recited a statement in which he called the U.S. government âmy real killers.â A second prisoner, said to be Steven Joel Sotloff, like Foley an American journalist who disappeared while covering Syriaâs civil war, then appears in the video. American intelligence officials believe the video is authentic but are continuing to evaluate it, senior U.S. officials said Wednesday morning. In a statement Tuesday, National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said of the video: âIf genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends. President Obama was briefed on the video aboard Air Force One as he returned to his Marthaâs Vineyard vacation and will be updated on further developments, the White House said. British Prime Minister David Cameron cut short a family vacation and returned to London to chair emergency meetings on Iraq and Syria. In an interview with the BBC, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond acknowledged that the apparent executioner spoke with a British accent and said the video seemed to be genuine. Hundreds of Britons are believed to have traveled to Syria to fight in the countryâs civil war, including many who have joined the Islamic State. âWeâre absolutely aware that there are significant numbers of British nationals involved in terrible crimes, probably in the commission of atrocities,â Hammond said. A European intelligence official said the British government was examining the video, and the speech of the purported executioner, to compare it with former Guantanamo Bay prisoners and other British residents believed to have joined the Islamic State. Both prisoners in the video are wearing orange shirts and pants, similar to orange jumpsuits worn by detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A similar outfit, believed to be a jihadist symbol of the prison, was worn by Nicholas Berg, an American businessman kidnapped in Iraq in 2004 whose execution by an Islamic State precursor organization was recorded on video and posted online. Foley, 40, was working in Syria for the Boston-based news Web site GlobalÂ­Post when he disappeared on Thanksgiving in 2012. Philip Balboni, GlobalPostâs chief executive and co-founder, said in a statement: âOn behalf of John and Diane Foley, and also GlobalPost, we deeply appreciate all of the messages of sympathy and support that have poured in since the news of Jimâs possible execution first broke. We have been informed that the FBI is in the process of evaluating the video posted by the Islamic State to determine if it is authentic. Until we have that determination, we will not be in a position to make any further statement. In a statement Tuesday night on a Facebook page dedicated to his freedom, Foleyâs mother appeared to accept that the video was authentic. âWe have never been prouder of our son Jim,â Diane Foley wrote. âHe gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people. âWe implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages. Like Jim, they are innocents. Praising James Foley as âan extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person,â she asked that the familyâs privacy be respected. Sotloff, a freelancer who worked for several news organizations, disappeared in Syria in August 2013. In addition to Foley and Sotloff, at least three other Americans are believed to be captives in Syria, including Austin Tice, a freelance journalist whose articles appeared in McClatchy publications and The Washington Post before his disappearance in August 2012, according to a 2013 GlobalPost article. No one has claimed to be holding them. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 66Â journalists, all but 10 of them Syrian, have been killed covering the Syrian war. If the video is authenticated, Foley would be the first American journalist known to be executed since the conflict began in early 2011. The video evoked the 2002 taped execution in Pakistan of Wall Street Journal correspondent Daniel Pearl by al-Qaeda. The Islamic State, an offshoot of al-Qaeda, is the most powerful among a number of extremist organizations that have emerged during the Syrian civil war, which began as a popular uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. Fighting against both Assad and U.S.-backed rebels, the militants now control much of eastern Syria and claim to have established an Islamic caliphate spanning Syria and neighboring Iraq. As the group has grown, it has merged with the group formerly known as al-Qaeda in Iraq, under the leadership of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. According to U.S. intelligence, it numbers in the thousands, including foreign fighters from Europe and the United States. In April, Islamic State fighters swept across the border into northern Iraq, taking over the city of Mosul before moving southward to within 60 miles of Baghdad. Extensive reports of executions, including beheadings and crucifixions, have emerged from areas under the groupâs control. This month, amid reports of stranded and besieged Iraqi minorities threatened with execution, the militants advanced eastward toward Irbil, the capital of the semiautonomous Kurdish region of Iraq. On Aug. 7, Obama authorized U.S. airstrikes to rescue stranded minorities and protect U.S. personnel and facilities in Irbil and Baghdad. On Monday, after a total of 68 strikes from jets, bombers and drones, Obama announced that Iraqi and Kurdish forces, with U.S. air support, had retaken a strategic dam north of Mosul from the militants and that they had been pushed back from Irbil. Within hours of that announcement, the Islamic State posted an online message warning it would attack Americans âin any placeâ in response to the airstrikes. âWe will drown all of you in blood,â it said. The title of the video posted Tuesday was âA Message to Americaâ and was produced by the Islamic Stateâs media arm, according to the Site Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist Web sites. A masked man dressed in black is shown standing in an unidentified desert location beside a prisoner kneeling beside him with his hands behind his back. âObama authorized military operations against the Islamic State effectively placing America upon a slippery slope towards a new war against Muslims,â the masked man says. The video then shows a clip of Obamaâs Aug. 7 announcement, followed by a statement from the prisoner. âI call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government, for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality,â he says. The prisoner also appeals to âmy brother John, who is a member of the U.S. âI wish I had more time,â he says. âI wish I could have the hope for freedom to see my family once again, but that ship has sailed. The masked man then identifies the prisoner as âJames Wright Foley, an American citizen of your country.â He then reaches down with a large knife and begins the apparent beheading of the prisoner; the screen fades to black and the next image is of a body with a head placed upon its chest. The masked man then appears with another prisoner, identified as Sotloff, in a similar kneeling position. Foley reported from some of the most dangerous recent crises and was imprisoned for 44 days in Libya in 2011 by forces loyal to deposed leader Moammar Gaddafi. According to GlobalÂ­Post, two eyewitnesses saw his interception by a group of armed men in a silver-colored van on a road near the town of Taftanaz in northern Syria on Nov. 22, 2012. Since then, GlobalÂ­Post âhas mounted an extensive international investigation . . . to determine who kidnapped Foley and where he was being held,â GlobalÂ­Post said in an article on its Web site late Tuesday.
