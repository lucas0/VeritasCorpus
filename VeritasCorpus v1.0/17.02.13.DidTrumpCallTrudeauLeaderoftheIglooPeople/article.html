  On 13 February 2017, the web site
  <em>
   The Burrard Street Journal
  </em>
  published a satirical
  <a href="http://www.burrardstreetjournal.com/trump-overheard-calling-trudeau-leader-of-the-igloo-people/" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  that reported that President Donald Trump had been overheard referring to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the “leader of the igloo people”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   After blanking on the name “Canada”, U.S. President Donald Trump was overheard referring to Justin Trudeau as the “leader of the igloo people”, as the two met for crunch talks.
  </p>
  <p>
   The incident occurred during the President’s sit down meeting with the Prime Minister in the Oval Office, while Trump was commenting on how “great” the PM was as well as a “great leader of—”, he said before pausing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unaware that his microphone was on, or that everyone else in the room could easily hear him, Mr. Trump leaned over to his advisor Kellyanne Conway and whispered:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Ah, what do they call themselves again, those people,” Trump said while discreetly pointing upwards. “You know, up there where it’s cold,” he added, snapping his fingers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Before an alarmed looking Conway could respond, Trump bluttered, “the igloo people, is that it? He’s the leader of the igloo people, right?”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  In case the use of the word “bluttered” didn’t make it clear, this is not a genuine news item, but a piece of fiction from a satire web site. The
  <em>
   Burrard Street Journal
  </em>
  , which also refers to itself as the “BS Journal,” carries a
  <a href="http://www.burrardstreetjournal.com/disclaimer/" target="_blank">
   disclaimer
  </a>
  that clearly labels its content as satire:
