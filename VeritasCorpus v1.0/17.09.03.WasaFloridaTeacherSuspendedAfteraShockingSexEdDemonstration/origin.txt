  Shocking images out of a classroom in Jacksonville, Florida illustrate how 11-12 year olds in 6th grade are being taught how to use strap-on dildos amidst a debate about sexual content finding its way into other Common Core subjects, material which has been attacked by some as pornographic.
 </p>
 <p>
  The pictures were taken by a student with a cellphone camera. They show a teacher demonstrating how to use a strap-on sex toy in a number of different positions.
 </p>
 <p>
  In one image, the teacher even shows how to insert the strap-on while her buttocks are in the air and her legs up over her head.
 </p>
 <p>
  In another image, the woman shows the children how to wear a harness to which the strap-on is attached.
