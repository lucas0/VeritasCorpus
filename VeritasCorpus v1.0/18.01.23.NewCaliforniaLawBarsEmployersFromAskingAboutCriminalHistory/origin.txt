<blockquote>
 <p>
  AB 1008 provides that it is an unlawful employment practice for an employer to include on any
  <br>
   application for employment any question that seeks the disclosure of an applicantâ€™s conviction history;
   <strong>
   </strong>
   to inquire into or consider the conviction history of an applicant until after the applicant has received a conditional offer; and, when conducting a conviction history background check, to consider, distribute, or disseminate specified information related to prior convictions, except where certain state laws require a background check, as in the case of law enforcement positions.
