  In January 2016, social media users became interested in rumors stating that for $1, individuals could purchase a key tag at Wendy’s entitling customers to free Frostys for the entire calendar year.
 </p>
 <p>
  Confusion about the promotion was rife, as evidenced by much of the social media chatter about the Wendy’s $1 Frosty Key Tag promotion. Clearly, many users were interested in the deal, but few were able to locate any useful information, even from the official Wendy’s Twitter account:

  We contacted Wendy’s media relations department by phone, but were unable to get an answer. We e-mailed that department along with their social media relations team, neither of which replied to our query.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wendy’s social media accounts didn’t feature any information on the promotion, nor did its staff respond to customer questions in any posts we could see. We located a

   press release
  </a>
  dated 30 November 2015, which stated:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Finding a way to give back this Giving Tuesday, a global day dedicated to giving back, has never been sweeter than with Wendy’s® National Frosty® Key Tag Program. Until the end of the year,*
   <strong>
    customers can buy a Frosty Key Tag for $1 and receive a free Jr. Frosty with every purchase until December 31, 2016
   </strong>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   *Selling period for Frosty Key Tags is 11/23/2015 through 12/31/2015.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Whether the promotion was offered at all Wendy’s locations, specific participating locations, or was regionally limited remained unclear. We obtained photographs of a 2016 Wendy’s Frosty Key Tag, obtained at an unspecified Wendy’s location on the West Coast:

  It also was not immediately apparent whether Wendy’s sold a limited amount per location, or just restricted the promotion to a certain timeframe.
  <!--Frosty fans interested in obtaining a Frosty Key Tag appeared to be out of luck, however, as one of the sole clear aspects of the promotion was its conclusion on 31 December 2015.-->
  On 6 January 2016 Wendy’s provided the following response:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Thanks for reaching out. We appreciate your support of Foster Care adoption. We did sell a limited supply in December for 2016 and we will begin selling Frosty Key Tags at a later date this year. Be sure to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Linked In as we will update our fans once we’re ready to sell another supply.
  </p>

 <p>
  Wendy’s Frosty Key Tag for 2017 was confirmed via the brand’s Twitter account in November 2016:
 </p>
 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
  <p dir="ltr" lang="en">
   Grab a $2 Frosty Key Tag today! You get a year’s worth of free Jr. Frosty treats &amp; help find forever homes for kids in foster care.
