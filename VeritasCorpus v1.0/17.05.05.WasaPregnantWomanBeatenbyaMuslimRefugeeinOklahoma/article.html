  In April 2017, claims a woman who was seven months pregnant was badly beaten by a “Muslim refugee” in Oklahoma began spreading on social media:

  The claims were spread by sites like
  <a href="https://archive.is/XXQMC" target="_blank">
   True Trumpers
  </a>
  and
  <a href="https://archive.is/WVbLV" target="_blank">
   The New York Evening
  </a>
  , but neither site included any details about the purported attack other than an image. True Trumpers’ brief, poorly written, and ominous caption stated:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   BREAKING NEWS: This 7 month pregnant woman was beaten by Muslim refugee in Oklahoma. Do you support hang him?
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The New York Evening’s iteration also lacked any details whatsoever, and bore the same broken English as True Trumpers:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   THIS 7 MONTH PREGNANT WOMAN WAS BEATEN BY MUSLIM REFUGEE IN OKLAHOMA. DO YOU SUPPORT HANG HIM?
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Both posts largely rely on the attached photograph to flesh out their claim, such as it is, but that image is actually a still, not a photograph, and comes from a 2014 thriller movie called “
  <a href="http://www.thewrap.com/baby-beaten-pregnant-woman-controversial-thriller-film-proxy-exclusive-video/" target="_blank">
   Proxy
  </a>
  ,” in which a pregnant woman miscarries after being beaten by an unknown assailant:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The film, which debuted at last year’s Toronto International Film Festival and hits theaters on April 18, begins with a shocking assault. Alexia Rasmussen, playing a lonely pregnant woman named Esther, is brutally assaulted within minutes of the movie’s opening, suffering a brutal beating that carries with it serious consequences both physical and psychological.

  Both

   True Trumpers
  </a>
  and
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fake_news_websites" target="_blank">
   The New York Evening
  </a>
  are known purveyors of fake news, and in this case they use a stolen screenshot from a (fictional) movie to bolster their false claim, not a photograph from an actual event.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another iteration of this story popped up in late April on the web sites
  <a href="https://archive.is/DDvY8" target="_blank">
   Red Country
  </a>
  and
  <a href="https://archive.is/UszXR" target="_blank">
   bluevision.news
  </a>
  . In this case, the page, which lacked an accompanying photograph, asked readers:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   This is 78 years old Trump supporter woman who was beaten by Muslim refugees in Ohio. Trump going to deport them all . . . Do you support this?
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  A 78 year-old woman was not beaten by Muslim refugees in Ohio — nor has President Trump promised to deport all Muslim refugees.
