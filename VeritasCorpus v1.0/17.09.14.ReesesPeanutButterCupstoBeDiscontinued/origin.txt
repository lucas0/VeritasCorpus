  The announcement was released late on Friday Sept 8th in a press conference, that the famous candy, the original Reese’s peanut butter cups would no longer be available! “By October 2017 they will all be removed from the shelves!” Manufacturer said due to the new versions and a severe decline in sales. It is no longer justifiable to continue producing the product. Originally there were plans to keep them through Halloween, however those plans have fallen through. We say goodbye to a candy icon. RIP Reese’s peanut butter cups. Make sure to get you one before they are gone!
