  Ahh, the religion of peace and tolerance. Whenever Muslims move to Western nations they try to change everything about the culture to conform to sharia law. When they’re not doing that, they’re tearing down Christmas trees, because, Jesus, birth of the Son of God and all that. To them, Jesus is only a prophet, to Christians, He is God’s only son born of a woman.

  You can see in the video several Muslim men climbing a Christmas tree in a Mall. They are trying to tear it apart. They don’t do a very good job which leads one to believe it must be made of metal or something.
