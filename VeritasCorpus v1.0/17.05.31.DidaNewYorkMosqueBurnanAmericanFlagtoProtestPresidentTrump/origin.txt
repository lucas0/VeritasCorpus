  The Masjid Abu Bakr mosque in Flushing, New York, burned an American flag on Saturday in protest of the Trump presidency.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Down with Trump!” and “Not my president”, they chanted as the flag burned.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many are disgusted by the act and have called for the mosque to face legal punishment, or at the very least lose their tax exempt status.
