  At a press conference in Eminem’s native Detroit this morning, Eminem made this announcement:
 </p>
 <p>
  “Hey everyone, I’m excited to tell you about a new movie coming up. Working title is “8 Mile 2″ and it will be about my life after I came up and will follow basically my whole career. I’m really looking forward to seeing this movie with y’all and I hope you like it as much as I’ve liked filming it.”

  Surprisingly, the flick is being directed by none other than Clint Eastwood, a man you don’t normally think of when you think of rap. Eastwood had his own comments about the upcoming film:
 </p>
 <p>
  “This movie was a big challenge for me, not only because of the subject matter, but also because it’s hard to dramatize a man’s entire career like we set out to do. Nevertheless I am very pleased with how things are going and I think we’re really coming up with a multi-dimensional, well rounded story about Eminem’s career, both the bright and the dark parts.”
