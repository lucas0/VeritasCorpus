  The

   Gadsden flag
  </a>
  , with its familiar coiled rattlesnake and the warning “Don’t Tread on Me,” is an iconic piece of American revolutionary symbolism. That logo has also been strongly associated with the U.S. Navy and the war on terrorism since U.S. Navy Secretary Gordon England issued an
  <a href="http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq122-1.htm" target="_blank">
   instruction
  </a>
  on 31 May 2002 authorizing the “rattlesnake jack” to replace the union jack as the Navy’s official jack “for the duration of the Global War on Terrorism.” The U.S. Navy began flying the new Navy Jack on 11 September 2002 (the first anniversary of the 9/11 attacks), and the rattlesnake jack has been featured in a patch warn on the left shoulder by sailors and SEALs deployed in war zones.

  On 1 November 2013, the
  <em>
   Daily Caller
  </em>
  published an
  <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/01/navy-seals-ordered-to-remove-dont-tread-on-me-navy-jack-from-uniforms/" target="_blank">
   opinion piece
  </a>
  by Carl Higbie, a former Navy SEAL and Republican candidate for Congress, claiming that new regulations had been issued requiring Navy SEALs to discontinue wearing the “Don’t Tread On Me” patch (the First
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_of_the_United_States" target="_blank">
   Navy Jack
  </a>
  ) on their uniform sleeves in favor of a U.S. flag patch:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   ALL:
  </p>
  <p>
   WARCOM and GROUP TWO/ONE have pushed out the uniform policy for NWU III and any patches worn on the sleeve.
  </p>
  <p>
   All personnel are only authorized to wear the matching “AOR” American Flag patch on the right shoulder. You are no longer authorized to wear the “Don’t Tread On Me” patch.
  </p>
  <p>
   Again the only patch authorized for wear is the American flag on the right shoulder. Please pass the word to all.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  That piece also suggested the regulation had been issued at the behest of President Obama because the Navy Jack was “too closely associated with radical groups” such as the Tea Party, who use the similarly-themed Gadsden flag as an emblem:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   I first wondered, ‘why?.’ Why would our leaders sell out our heritage? Why would they rob present and future sailors of our battle cry?
  </p>
  <p>
   When a friend of mine asked his leadership the same question, he was told, “The Jack is too closely associated with radical groups.” We must assume that this thought policeman embedded in the SEAL community is speaking of the Tea Party, whose flag (which also dates from the American Revolution) depicts a snake with the same defiant slogan as The Navy Jack.
  </p>
  <p>
   This begs yet another question: Who defines “radical group”? The last time I checked, all military personnel are under oath to “support and defend the constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.” The Tea Party stands for constitutional rights and founding principles of civil liberties and limited government. Radical? Not unless you’re a leftist hell-bent on destroying the foundations of our country. Or as the President has stated as the objective of his presidency, “to fundamentally transform” America.
