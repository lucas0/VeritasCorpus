  On 26 June 2017, the web site NeonNettle.com
  <em>

  published an
  <a href="https://archive.is/gMXv3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  purportedly containing quotes from a “recent” interview with Brad Pitt in which the actor repeatedly claimed that the “Hollywood elite” are all part of a pedophile ring:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Mr. Pitt describes how the whole TV and film industry is run around a culture of grooming children for child trafficking networks that reach across the United States and beyond, into the upper echelons of the political spectrum and societal hierarchy:
  </p>
  <p>
   “You think Hollywood is about making movies? That’s just a byproduct: It’s about money, and more importantly, power and control.”
  </p>
  <p>
   “The people who run Hollywood, also run America, and most of the world, and they don’t care about movies.”
  </p>
  <p>
   “You’ve heard of the Illuminati right? The secret societies, the politicians, the bankers and the media – they’re the ones running these pedophile rings, and they’re the ones that run the world, and it all goes back to Hollywood.”
  </p>
  <p>
   “Kids wanna be in movies, or should I say; parents want their kids to be in movies, and they’ll do anything to get them famous”
  </p>

  The web site frequently dabbles in conspiracy theories and occasionally publishes, as in the case above, works of complete fiction.
