  Corporate media is still adding in superdelegate “promises” to make it look like HRC has over 2200 and is about to clinch the nomination.
 </p>
 <p>
  NOPE.
 </p>
 <p>
  Super delegates still don’t count. Super delegates don’t vote until the convention in July.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this rate, neither HRC nor Bernie will get to the required 2383 pledged delegates needed to lock up the nomination before the convention.
 </p>
 <p>
  This race will be decided at the convention.
