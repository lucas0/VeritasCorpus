   meme
  </a>
  posted in the Facebook group “Lyme Disease Posters” on 3 December 2016 (and its accompanying text) provides dire warnings about the risks posed by potentially tick-infested Christmas trees.
 </p>
 <p>
  While ticks, specifically the kind that can transmit Lyme disease, are indeed a serious medical concern and could conceivably be found on Christmas trees brought into your home, the information presented in this meme is generally misleading, scientifically inaccurate, or incomplete. More likely than not, a Christmas tree would not contain any Lyme disease-bearing ticks, and if it did the overwhelming likelihood is that the tick would not be in a position to transmit a disease during Christmas.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lyme disease is
  <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/index.html" target="_blank">
   caused
  </a>
  by the
  <em>
   Borrelia
  </em>
  genus of bacteria which is transferred from one animal (typically birds or small rodents), into the gut of a specific genus of tick called blacklegged ticks (genus
  <em>
   Ixodes
  </em>
  ) in their larval stages, where it can then be transferred to a human through biting once that tick is in later stages of life.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/transmission/blacklegged.html" target="_blank">
   Per
  </a>
  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The lifecycle of blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis and Ixodes pacificus) generally lasts two years. During this time, they go through four life stages: egg, six-legged larva, eight-legged nymph, and adult. After the eggs hatch, the ticks must have a blood meal at every stage to survive.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  A blacklegged tick’s feeding times are seasonally determined, with little to no activity happening during the weeks leading up to Christmas,
  <a href="http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/idepc/dtopics/tickborne/twoyrcycle.html" target="_blank">
   according
  </a>
  to the Minnesota Department of Health (though the information is broadly applicable to all blacklegged ticks):
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   In the spring and summer of year one, eggs hatch into larvae which feed once and molt into nymphs. Nymphs become dormant for the fall and winter.
  </p>
  <p>
   In year 2, nymphs feed from May through July. At this time, the nymph may transmit disease-causing organisms (such as the bacteria that cause Lyme disease) to humans or to wild or domestic mammals. In the fall, nymphs molt into adult male and female ticks. The females feed on deer and other large mammals, mate, lay eggs, and die. If females don’t feed in the fall, they try to find a large mammal host in the following spring. Male blacklegged ticks attach to a host to wait for females, but do not take a blood meal.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  This is the season-to-season life cycle of a blacklegged tick, according to the
  <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/transmission/index.html" target="_blank">
   CDC
  </a>
  , which shows the times of highest risk of transfer to humans is late spring into summer:

  The blacklegged tick’s ability to transmit the disease to a human is dominantly relegated to only one-and-a-half of its four life stages (the nymph stage and female adult stage). Both of these stages are generally dormant during Christmas, making most of the claims about the dangers of ticks and Lyme disease in Christmas trees fairly trivial. The actual human data provided by the CDC bore this out as well, clearly demonstrating that there are relatively few cases of Lyme disease during Christmas based on 10 years of monthly
