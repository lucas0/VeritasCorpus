  This week, Beruff was at it again, this time calling for the new First Lady, Melania Trump, to “sterilize the White House” after the “animals’ departure.” In an interview with KYOT Radio stationed in Orlando, the GOPer argued that President-elect Trump and the new First Lady Melania Trump will have “some serious thinking to do” before they move into the White House in January, as well as that they’d be “wise to sterilize the place” now that the previous president “is getting evicted.”
