  A woman introducing Hillary Clinton at a campaign event conspicuously removed the words “under God” from the end of the Pledge of Allegiance, prompting the Democratic primary front-runner to laugh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Susan Shin Angulo, a member of the Camden County Board of Freeholders, began to say the phrase at a campaign rally in Blackwood, New Jersey, on Wednesday, but caught herself in the act and skipped over it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Only Hillary can bring us together as one nation, un- — indivisible, with liberty and justice for all,” Ms. Angulo said.
 </p>
 <p>
  The crowd broke out into applause and cheers. Mrs. Clinton nodded and laughed.
