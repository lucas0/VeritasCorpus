  On 10 October 2016, an entertainment Facebook group called “Stop the World, the Teabaggers Want Off” published a meme featuring an image of Michele Bachmann alongside the text of something she supposedly said about the Columbus Day holiday:

 <blockquote>

  This is not a real quote from the former Republican congresswoman (and presidential candidate). “Stop the World, the Teabaggers Want Off” is an entertainment Facebook group that frequently creates fake quotes mocking politicians; Bachmann is apparently one of their favorite targets, as the group has attributed several fake quotes to the former United States representative, including one

  Columbus Day has become an increasingly controversial holiday, as more
