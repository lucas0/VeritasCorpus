  On 6 March 2016, the video of a protesting crowd embedded below was circulated along with the following comment about what it supposedly depicted
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Muslim’s in Chicago chanting: “Free Palestine, death to Israel, death to America”.
  </p>
  <p>
   Where was the mainstream media on this?

  On 7 March 2016, the unreliable web site
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2015/11/03/muslim-national-anthem/" target="_blank">
   ClashDaily
  </a>
  also reported (in a piece bearing the title “WATCH: Muslims in THIS U.S. City Chant ‘DEATH To America”) that there had been a concerted effort by the news media to cover up an anti-American, anti-Israel march in Chicago:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Where was the mainstream media on this? You better not hold your breath while waiting for them to cover this, because it isn’t gonna happen. Watch as these Muslims in Chicago chant “Free Palestine, death to Israel, death to America”

  In addition to the video’s being nearly two years old, it did not capture Muslim marchers chanting  “death to America.” A description of the clip stated that it depicted a “Protest in downtown Chicago. Palestinian supporters were protesting the bombings in Gaza.”

  Claims that the footage received no mainstream media attention were also easily disproved, as videos were readily available through the
