<blockquote>
 <p>
  The hermits, who live on withered and wind-borne leaves, are tempted by the sight of
  <em>
   naari-lata
  </em>
  flowers and lose their devotion; hence if any one who lives sumptuously on milk, curdle and other nourishing food says that he has subjugated his senses, it is like saying that Maha Meru is floating on the surface of the ocean.
