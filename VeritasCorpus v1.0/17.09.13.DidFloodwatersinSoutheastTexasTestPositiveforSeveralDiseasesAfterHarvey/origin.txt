   DISEASE WARNING:
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  I just got a call from a Southeast Texas disaster relief group (I was in direct contact with them and a few other groups assisting with rescues via phone).
 </p>
 <p>
  They’re spreading the word that the water in all areas (Beaumont, Vidor, Port Arthur, Orange, Lumberton, Bridge City, etc.) has tested positive for MRSA, Typhoid Fever, flesh eating bacteria, sewage, and toxic chemicals.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you or anyone you know were participating in rescues, or were in the water with open wounds, and start experiencing signs of illness, get to a hospital immediately for vaccination and antibiotics. They’re already getting reports of people becoming violently ill.
