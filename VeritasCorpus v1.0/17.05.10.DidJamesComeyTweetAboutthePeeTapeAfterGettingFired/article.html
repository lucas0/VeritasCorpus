  FBI Director James Comey on 9 May 2017, an image purportedly showing a screenshot of a tweet sent by Comey about “the pee tape” was widely circulated on social media:

  The “pee tape” refers to a

   dossier
  </a>
  which alleged, among other things, that Russia had a footage of Trump urinating on prostitutes. The existence of the tape was never confirmed so this Tweet, if it were real, would be major news.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, this tweet is fake.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are several aspects of this tweet indicating that it never appeared on Comey’s Twitter account. For instance, this image shows a relatively high retweet count (11,355), yet we were unable to uncover any tweets linking back to the original message. Also, Twitter has a 140-character limit for text tweets, yet this message clocks in at 153 characters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, James Comey does not have an official Twitter account. The former FBI director has
  <a href="http://gizmodo.com/this-is-almost-certainly-james-comey-s-twitter-account-1793843641" target="_blank">
   said
  </a>
  that he is “on Twitter now,” but whatever account he uses does not have the handle @JamesComey.
