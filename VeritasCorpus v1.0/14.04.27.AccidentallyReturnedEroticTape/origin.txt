 <p>
  First-term Morris County Sheriff Corky Woodward went to the only video rental store in this farm town of 2,300 and checked out a camera, a videocassette player and some blank tape.Then he and his wife, Dannette, made a movie — 90 minutes, in full color, X-rated.
 </p>
 <p>
  But when Woodward returned the equipment to the store, he apparently left the tape in the player by mistake. And when the player was rented out again, so was the homemade movie of him and his wife.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly the 32-year-old sheriff found himself with more public exposure than he knew what to do with. Copies were made and passed from living room to barroom to meeting hall as quickly as stores could sell blank tapes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some people estimate there are more than 200 copies of the videotape in circulation, with a demand for more that has stretched well beyond Council Grove.
 </p>
 <p>
  The tape has been dubbed everything from “The Sheriff Without His Pants” to “The Sheriff Rides Again.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The tape and the month’s worth of jokes and speculation that followed have divided the town into three camps: those who think it is funny, those who are outraged, and those who are embarrassed not only for the sheriff and his wife but for the entire community.
