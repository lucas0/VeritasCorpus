  The Spanish loanword aguacate (stress on the ca) is used to refer to “testicle” [as] does huevo. Seems to me that contemporary Nahuah get a giggle out of looking up at the fruit hanging in the trees and thinking of them as vegetable testicles. (Likewise, on the campus of the U. Of Hawaii-Manoa there is an exotic tree known as a “dead-rat tree” and people, myself included, are forever looking at it and imagining its fruits as rats hanging by their tails.)

  But, except in jest, I don’t think a Nahua would imagine a:huacamo:lli to be anything other than mashed up avocado.
