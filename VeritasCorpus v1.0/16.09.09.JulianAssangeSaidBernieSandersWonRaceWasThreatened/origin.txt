 <p>
  John Pilger made an interview with Assange and is planning to use this material for his next documentary about Wikileaks founder! We gonna report with every major info from this interview in the nex few days! You can read the first part of the interview in a link below!
 </p>
 <p>
  Pilger: Julian, we cut you off earlier when you were talking about what you felt were the most significant emails that you have released. Is there any last one that you’d like to mention? And also, do you have any thoughts on Bernie Sanders? I mean what is your opinion why Bernie Sanders drop out of the race?
 </p>
 <p>
  Assange: Look, I think — you know, we know how politics works in the United States. Whoever — whatever political party gets into government is going to merge with the bureaucracy pretty damn fast. It will be in a position where it has some levers in its hand.
  <strong>
   And Bernie Sanders was independent candidate trying to get the nomination trough the Democratic Party and if you ask me he did get the nomination, but he was threatened to drop out!
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Pilger: What do you mean by that will your next leak contain information about Bernie Sanders?
 </p>
 <p>
  Assange: Of course we’re very interested in revealing the truth about any candidate and yes we have some material about Bernie Sanders that will be published!
 </p>
 <p>
  Assange isn’t focusing entirely on Clinton however, urging anyone with information on Bernie Sanders to come forward!
