  You just HAVE to love Texas!!
 </p>
 <p>
  Recently, the City of Dallas, Texas, passed an ordinance stating that if a driver is pulled over by law enforcement and is not able to provide proof of insurance, the car is towed.
 </p>
 <p>
  To retrieve the car after being impounded, they must show proof of insurance to have the car released.
 </p>
 <p>
  This has made it easy for the City of Dallas to remove uninsured cars.
 </p>
 <p>
  Shortly after the “No Insurance” ordinance was passed, the Dallas lots began to fill up and were full after only nine days.
  <nobr>
   80 + %
  </nobr>
  of the impounded cars were driven by illegals.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only must they provide proof of insurance to have their car released, they have to pay for the cost of the tow, a $350 fine, and $20 for every day their car is kept in the lot.
 </p>
 <p>
  Accident rates have gone down 47% and… Dallas’ solution gets uninsured drivers off the road WITHOUT making them show proof of nationality.
 </p>
 <p>
  Wonder how the ACLU or the Justice Department will get around this one?
 </p>
 <p>
  Just brings tears to my eyes. GO Dallas!!!!!
 </p>
 <p>
  Sheriff Joe??? How about this one?

  If they came up with a law like this in Al, Ga, Fl., there wouldn’t be but a few cars on the road, and not neccesarily because of illegals…. except for about
  <nobr>
   30 days
  </nobr>
  when the license renewal is due…….
