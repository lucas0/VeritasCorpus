 <p>
  The most frightening thing about the recent Wikileaks drop, which included excerpts of Hillary’s paid Wall St. speeches is her excitement over ending the United States as we know it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hillary is an extreme globalist.
 </p>
 <p>
  She not only embraces the globalist mentality but she actually wants to end the U.S. as we know it and replace it with a “Hemispheric Government.”
 </p>
 <p>
  No wonder Angela Merkel is her “favorite leader.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Hillary wants to turn the United States into Germany — or worse.
