  When Donald Trump officially take office, you can expect some major changes. Donald Trump believe Americans became lazy with all of the government assistance programs that the government offer the people. Donald Trump recently said “Americans will no longer be able to be lazy, and depend on the government to take care of them”.

  Many working American believe a lot of government assistance programs need to be abolished. One of them programs are Section 8. Why do a such program exist anyway? Well Donald Trump doesn’t believe in any of it and believe working citizens of America would like to see their tax money being spent in better ways than taking care of able working Americans that simply refuse to. Even though there are working Americans that are on Section 8, 75% of Section 8 recipients go through numerous jobs, and some refuse to work at all.

  Another program Donald Trump doesn’t believe in is Welfare. Although he openly admitted that he see the point in the program, he don’t think Americans understand that if should be used to help those get on their feet instead of a reliable source of income. He believe American need to recreate jobs and recreate American Businesses that other countries are now benefiting from.
