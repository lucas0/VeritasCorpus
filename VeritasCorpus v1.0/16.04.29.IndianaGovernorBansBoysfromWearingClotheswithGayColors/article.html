  On 28 April 2016,
  <em>
   The

  <em>
   Huffington Post
  </em>
  published an article claiming that Indiana Governor Mike Pence had signed a law making it illegal for boys to wear “gay” colors:
 </p>
 <blockquote>

    Indiana Gov. Mike Pence signed an executive order Wednesday that bans what he called “gay colors” to be worn by boys in public elementary and secondary schools in the state.
   </p>

    Pence referred to pink, chartreuse, teal and magenta, in particular, as “gateway colors” for young boys who might have an inclination toward homosexuality.
   </p>

    “Governor Pence believes that if boys wear clothes with colors traditionally worn by young girls, this can cause gender confusion for the boy,” said Hugh Strait, a spokesman for the governor.

  is best-known for publishing genuine news articles, but the web site also has a comedy section. Some readers who encountered the above-displayed article mistook it for a piece of real news.

  While there’s no disclaimer explicitly labeling the comedy section of

  </em>
  as fictional, the
  <i>

  “comedy” banner at the top of the page and “satire” tag at the end of the article make it clear that this piece was written in jest:

   criticized

  by gay rights activists, Governor Mike Pence has not passed any laws banning boys (or girls) from wearing clothing bearing certain colors.
