  The Vatican decided that Nuns with Guns was not a good image for the Catholic Church, so the Vatican Women’s Rifle Team was disbanded in February, 1938. Sister Juliette left to join the French resistance as a sharpshooter. She was credited with the assassination of several Nazi officials and awarded the Médaille Militaire.
