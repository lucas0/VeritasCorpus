   have now heard from three different sources this little gem: McDonalds’ apple pies contain no apple. Instead they are made out of potatoes or pears + flavouring.

  Supposedly, McDonalds restaurants (at least in this area) don’t make their Milkshakes out of any sort of dairy product, that’s why the menus call them “shakes” and not “milkshakes.” (I saw this myself, so I know this, at least, is true). She (the sister of the friend of the friend) can verify that they aren’t made of dairy stuff because she’s lactose intolerant and can drink them without any bad side effects (except the usual McD’s vague-feeling-of-illness, but that doesn’t count.)

  don’t know about now, but it is apparently true that in the 70s (I think) that McDonald’s did use a non milk shake, and used to use styrofoam balls as a filler (they pass right through you, I guess), but they stopped after people who actually didn’t drink their shakes right away and examined the left-over goop realized it and complained like crazy.

  The fast food restraunt mcdonalds serves mcflurries that contain feathers, there was a girl who went to mcdonalds and ordered a mcflurry and then almost died because she is really allergic to bird feathers, and so they traced all the food that she had eaten and then they phoned the head office of mcdonalds and they found out what was really in the mcflurries.

  Regarding your item on McDonalds and cow eyeballs, I think the intended connection was between the use of the eyeball fluid as a thickener for milkshakes rather than as filler.
