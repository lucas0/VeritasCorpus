  Urban legendry comprises many different tales of swindlers who have managed to take in large amounts of money not through violence, intimidation or overt theft, but by impersonating figures authorized to collect funds from the public.

  or the like, these criminals need not resort to the use of guns or threats to acquire their booty; they simply take in cash innocently handed to them by unsuspecting patrons who believe they are engaging in ordinary, authorized transactions. By the time anyone realizes something’s amiss (because, for example, a particular establishment starts hearing about its “washroom attendant”  from customers even though it has never hired anyone for such a position), the scammers are long gone.

  The tale of larcenous ingenuity referenced above is a remarkable example of this genre in that it posits a crafty crook didn’t simply pull off a phony “parking lot attendant” ruse for a short while and then abscond with a few hundred pounds in ill-gotten gains, but that he kept up the deception for over twenty years and took in hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of pounds before “retiring” to live a life of luxury.  According to legend, he was able to achieve such amazing longevity at his unauthorized profession because he plied his trade in a parking lot used by zoo visitors, and both the zoo and the local city council each thought the other was responsible for the operation of (and thus the collection of funds from) the carpark.
