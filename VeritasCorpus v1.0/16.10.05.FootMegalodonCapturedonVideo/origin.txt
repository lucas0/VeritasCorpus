  Absolutely Terrifying #Breaking #50ftShark
 </p>
 <p>
  A 50 foot shark has been found 1 mile down the marina trench. At first, many thought it was a Pacific Sleeper Shark. The issue with that theory is the Pacific Sleeper Shark grow only to 20 feet, the shark featured is 50+ feet long. That measurement is estimated using the length of the cage, which is 10 feet across.

  Could this be the last remaining Megalodon? Watch and share!
