  On 4 May 2016, the web site
  <em>
   Biz Standard News
  </em>
  published an article reporting that televangelist and pastor Creflo Dollar, the founder of the non-denominational World Changers Church, had received a “divine message” instructing him to endorse Republican candidate Donald Trump for president:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Creflo Dollar recently announced that he had received a divine message telling him to get behind Trump.
  </p>
  <p>
   “God came to me in a dream last night and said that Trump is his chosen candidate,” Dollar said. “God apologized for the mixed messages he was sending. I now know that Trump has been touched by the hand of God.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  There was no truth to this report, as
  <em>
   Biz Standard News
  </em>
  (i.e., BS News) is an entertainment web site that does not publish factual stories.  The
  <em>
   Biz Standard News
  </em>
  article didn’t receive much attention when it was first published in May 2016, but rumors about Creflo’s endorsement of Trump went viral a few months later when
  <em>
   WordOnDaStreet.com
  </em>
  mistook this fake news story as real news and rehashed the article on their web site on 19 August 2016. Soon, media outlets such as
  <em>
   <a href="http://www.centrictv.com/news-views/centric-news/articles/2016/08/24/creflo-dollar-says-god-told-him-to-endorse-donald-trump.html" target="_blank">
    Centric TV
   </a>
  </em>
  were falsely reporting that Creflo Dollar had endorsed Donald Trump.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Biz Standard News
  </em>
  ‘s disclaimer notes that the site’s content is satirical in nature:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The Business Standard News is a satirical site designed to parody the 24-hour news cycle. The stories are outlandish, but reality is so strange nowadays they could be true.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  A spokesman for Dollar told the
  <em>
   <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/lifestyles/did-creflo-dollar-endorse-donald-trump-spokesman-s/nsLhx/" target="_blank">
    Atlanta Journal-Constitution
   </a>
  </em>
  that Creflo Dollar “never endorses” political candidates, and on 24 August 2016,
  <em>
   Centric TV
  </em>
  issued a correction which included a statement from the Pastor:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “Any reports stating that I have endorsed Donald Trump for President are false. I have not endorsed any candidate and do not plan to. This rumor originated on a satirical website and is 100% untrue.”
