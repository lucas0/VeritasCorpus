  This image was taken in June 2016 after thousands of homes were evacuated in Brazoria County, Texas, due to a severe flood. In an attempt to protect his home, local resident Randy Wagner purchased an “Aqua Dam” and installed it around his property, a local television station

   Of the thousands of homes evacuated and damaged by flooding in Brazoria County, one family’s home is high and dry on West FM 1462 in Rosharon.

   Randy Wagner decided to take a chance on something called an Aqua Dam, a product he discovered online.

  The product in question is not filled with air, but with water:

   He filled up 400 feet of 30 inch high tubes made of plastic and fabric with water.

  <p>
   “I was the crazy guy. Everybody was kinda going by, laughing at me. But today they are really impressed with this AquaDam,” said Wagner.
