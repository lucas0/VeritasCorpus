A hundred million years ago, for the record, is roughly a hundred million years before modern

  filed to the “consciousness” section of new-age web site “Earth. We Are One” (EWAO), which suggests that a photograph from a mountain range first

  is now breaking news:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   Recently, Google Earth satellite imagery discovered a constellation of three snow-covered pyramids in Antarctica. Scientists and researchers are, admittedly, rather taken aback. Two of the three pyramids are about 10 miles inland, while the third is directly near the coastline.
  </p>
  <p class="p3">
   The implications? Well, this discovery could end up re-writing our entire history. No research has ever mentioned a civilization in Antarctica, much less one with the technological know-how to construct pyramids. So, how did these pyramids get there?
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p class="p1">
  Without actually answering that question, EWAO then lists a litany of undeniably cool, but wholly irrelevant facts about the geologic history of Antarctica, even including some that are not completely incorrect:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   Over millions of years, Antarctica has drifted from a position closer to the equator to its present perma-frozen location.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p class="p1">
  What EWAO describes here is plate tectonics — the foundational theory of modern geology that has been well accepted

  of 250-million-year-old fossils of plants in Antarctica by British explorer Robert Falcon Scott during a 1912 expedition, which later provided support for the concept.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  EWAO then unnecessarily cites a scientist at the British Antarctic Survey who (
  <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2007/1047/kp/kp03/of2007-1047kp03.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   <span class="s1">
    factually
   </span>
  </a>
  ) stated that there was lush vegetation on the continent 100 million years ago. EWAO presumably does this so they can write the words “The British Antarctic Survey backs this up”, also presumably hoping that the reader wouldn’t catch on that the Survey was talking about long-established science rather than the complete redefinition of evolutionary history and wholesale rejection of the geologic and archeological records.

 <p class="p1">

  the height of the Great Pyramids of Giza) is information provided by a series of expeditions to Antarctica’s Lake Vida, which, in EWAO’s words, “discovered unexpected microbial lifeforms trapped under a 65-foot-thick sheet of ice [that] resemble descendants of microorganisms from much warmer climates”.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  The discovery of these organisms was notable, given the

 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  Despite the irrelevance of the allegedly supporting information provided, EWAO concludes:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   About 100 million years ago, someone was building pyramids on the Antarctica that was then located at the equator.

   </span>
  </a>
  (its most recent warm periods were caused by climatic factors, not tectonics), the question EWAO should have been answering is this: Why would a mountain look like a pyramid?
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  The answer to that question is that pyramidal peaked mountains, also called a

   <span class="s1">

   </span>
  </a>
  (as in Matterhorn), are a feature of glaciated areas; they form from the convergence of glaciers that scour the sides of an existing landmass. This is a great explanation for the pyramid shaped mountains highlighted by EWAO, as they exist at the
  <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X17301851" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   <span class="s1">

  of multiple ice sheets on a continent noted for its nearly 100 percent glaciated surface.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  Therefore, we rank this claim as false because, as University of California, Irvine geology professor Eric Rignot
