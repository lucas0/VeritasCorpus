  bearing their likenesses, has waded into political controversy yet again by being photographed wearing socks adorned by cartoon images of pigs wearing police caps. The photos, some of which are said to date from early August 2016, circulated widely via social media, capturing the attention of the National Association of Police Organizations, whose executive director, Bill Johnson, said in a statement to

  </p>
  <p>
   “I think the league is in a downward spiral regarding their obligations to the public under [commissioner] Roger Goodell, and this is just another example of that.
