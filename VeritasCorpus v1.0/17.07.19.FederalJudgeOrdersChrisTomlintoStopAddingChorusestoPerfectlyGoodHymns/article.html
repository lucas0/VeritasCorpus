  appearing to claim that a federal judge ordered Christian singer-songwriter Chris Tomlin to “stop adding choruses to perfectly good hymns”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   ATLANTA, GA—A federal judge passed down a ruling Tuesday morning ordering popular worship and CCM artist Chris Tomlin to immediately cease and desist adding catchy choruses to perfectly good hymns, sources confirmed moments ago.
  </p>
  <p>
   The order bars Tomlin from modifying, altering, deleting, or adding any lyrics of songs originally published in church hymnals before 1959.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tomlin burst out weeping as the verdict was read.
  </p>
  <p>
   “What am I supposed to do now? This is my entire livelihood!” he cried out. “I just came up with a really snappy chorus for the Doxology too. That would have made millions!”

  However, the Babylon Bee is a satire site whose humor is intended for Christian readers. Its prominent footer reads:

  Although the Babylon Bee is openly satirical, its subtle (and not so subtle) articles are sometimes mistaken for real news, particularly ones that pertain to nuanced aspects of Christian culture. Articles appearing to claim that imprisoned abortion provider
