  A 28-year-old Michigan man, Ralph Holden, was arrested and booked on charges of first-degree murder after his girlfriend was found dead in their 82nd St. home over the weekend … [police] found 26-year-old Wendy Miller unresponsive on the kitchen floor. Holden immediately confessed to police that he killed his girlfriend, but the reason stunned investigators … “According to Holden’s confession, he complained that Miller would not make eye contact with him when he was trying to have a conversation with her. I mean, have you seen this guy’s eyes? I don’t mean to be rude, but nobody would know which way he was looking or which eye to make contact with. It’s just a real shame.”

  According to the 911 transcripts, a neighbor reported the disturbance saying she heard shouting were Holden continued to demand from his girlfriend, “look at me, look at me, look at me!”  The neighbor could hear Miller crying, “I am but you never believe me!”
