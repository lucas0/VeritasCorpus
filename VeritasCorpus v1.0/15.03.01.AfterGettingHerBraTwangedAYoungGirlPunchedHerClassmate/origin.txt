  (I’m an A&amp;E nurse. We’re not allowed [to keep] our phones on us; they’re to be kept in our lockers. A call comes into hospital reception on a private line for me.)
 </p>
 <p>
  Phone: “This is [Teacher] from [School]. There’s been an incident involving [Daughter]. We need you to come in.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Me: “Is she ill or injured? Can it wait until my shift is over in two hours?”
 </p>
 <p>
  Phone: “[Daughter] has struck another pupil. We’ve been trying to call you for 45 minutes. It really is very serious.”
 </p>
 <p>
  (I go to the school and am ushered into the head’s office. I see my daughter, her head of year, a male teacher, the headmaster, a boy with blood around his nose and a red face, and his parents.)
 </p>
 <p>
  Head: “Mrs. [My Name], how kind of you to FINALLY join us!”
 </p>
 <p>
  Me: “Yeah, things get busy in A&amp;E. I’ve spent the last hour administering over 40 stitches to a seven-year-old who was beaten by his mother with a metal ladle and then I had to deal with the police regarding the matter. Sorry for the inconvenience.”
 </p>
 <p>
  (After watching him try to not act embarrassed, he tells me what has happened. The boy had twanged my daughter’s bra and she had punched him in the face twice. I got the impression they were more angry with my daughter than the boy.)
