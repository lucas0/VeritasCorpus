  Please keep in mind heâ€™s not posable. But he can turn slightly his head.
  <br>
   Please also keep in mind this is a one of a kind fully handmade artist doll and it requires careful handling and is not made for children. As a handmade work it may have some imperfections.
   <br/>
   Thank you for understanding.
