  A photograph purportedly showing a baby platypus appeared on social media in July 2016, with one of the most popular versions of the image being distributed via the “Our Real Amazing World” Facebook page.
 </p>
 <p>
  The picture doesn’t depict an actual baby platypus, however, but rather a doll made by a Russian artist listed as “Oso Polar” on her

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Platypus is handmade of sculpey living doll and fur fabric, painted with acrylics and sealed with matte finish. His eyes are glass (clear eyes laboratory).
  </p>
  <p>
   Please keep in mind he’s not posable. But he can turn slightly his head.
   <br>
    Please also keep in mind this is a one of a kind fully handmade artist doll and it requires careful handling and is not made for children. As a handmade work it may have some imperfections.
    <br/>
    Thank you for understanding.

  Additional images of the “baby platypus” clearly show that this is a doll and not a real animal:

  It’s not uncommon for dolls or art pieces to be mistaken for animals or babies in still photographs. In 2014, pictures of puppet creator Marina Yamkoskaia’s
