  In March 2016, a network of several “local news aggregate” web sites (including mbynews.com, ky6news.com, kspm33.com, alynews.com, mckenziepost.com headlinebrief.com, and localnews33.com) published items reporting that a sequel to the 2008 Will Ferrell comedy
  <em>
   Step Brothers
  </em>
  was in the works:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The long awaited sequel to the 2008 film, Step Brothers, is finally on its way.  Will Ferrell and Adam McKay are once again collaborating on a script that should be finished this spring.  All of the original cast including Will Ferrell, John C. Reilly, Richard Jenkins, Mary Steenburgen, and others are set to return.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  There is no truth to this report.

  In addition to the fake news article spread by

  Neither of those online entities is associated with the creators of the
  <em>
   Step Brothers
  </em>
  film, however.
 </p>
 <p>
  In January 2016, director Adam McKay was asked about a potential sequel to
  <em>
   Step Brothers
  </em>
  and responded by saying that it was a
  <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/26/director-adam-mckay-says-step-brothers-sequel-is-possible" target="_blank">
   possibility
  </a>
  but that nothing was currently in the works:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   When we recently caught up with McKay, we asked about the potential for a sequel to one of his older movies — namely Step Brothers.
  </p>
  <p>
   “You know, never say never” was his response. “Not right now, but man oh man, if we had an idea, and the funny thing is the older Will [Ferrell] and [John C.] Reilly get, the funnier idea gets. So is it possible when they’re like 57/58-years old, we do a Step Brothers sequel? Maybe.”
