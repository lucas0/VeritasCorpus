  published an item asserting that comedian Adam Sandler had been found

   dead
  </a>
  of an apparent suicide:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   US actor and comedian Adam Sandler has been found dead, aged 49, in an apparent suicide.
  </p>
  <p>
   Marin County Police in California said he was pronounced dead at his home shortly after officials responded to an emergency call around noon local time … His publicist said he had been “battling severe depression”.
  </p>
  <p>
   The local Sheriff’s office said Sandler was found unconscious and not breathing at his home near Tiburon, north of San Francisco.
  </p>
  <p>
   “At this time, the Sheriff’s Office Coroner Division suspects the death to be a suicide due to asphyxia, but a comprehensive investigation must be completed before a final determination is made,” police said in a statement.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a statement, Adam’s wife, Jackie Sandler, said she was “utterly heartbroken” and asked that he be remembered for the joy he brought to the world.
