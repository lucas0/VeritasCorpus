  reporting that scientists in North Carolina had successfully created “the first fully living dinosaur embryo in millions of years” using DNA from chicken skin:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   A 68 million-year-old DNA sample retrieved from soft tissue cells found in a recently excavated pregnant Tyrannosaurus Rex fossil has led researchers at North Carolina State University to produce the first fully living dinosaur embryo in millions of years.
  </p>
  <p>
   The pregnant Tyrannosaurus Rex’s DNA, that was preserved in “extremely good condition” according to experts, was introduced into the skin cells of a chicken, a modern relative to the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
  </p>
  <p>
   “We often think of the T-Rex as this huge crocodile-like bipedal reptile but in fact, its closest modern relative are birds and the T-Rex was actually the dinosaur equivalent of a chicken” explains Linda Rushmore, head researcher at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences’ Paleontology Research Lab.
  </p>
  <p>
   “The similarity of both DNA’s actually surprised us at first and we are extremely enthustiac about the positive results and growth of the embryo,” she adds.

  is a fake news site, and the story was completely fabricated, but the article gained enough traction online that the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences published a

   statement
  </a>
  informing the public that it was a hoax:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   A recent “news story” falsely reports an account of the recreation of a Tyrannosaurus rex embryo in the Paleontology Research Lab of the NC Museum of Natural Sciences. This story is a complete fabrication and the personnel cited in the report are, as far as we can tell, made up. For accurate information regarding dinosaur DNA research, check out this blog post:

  WNDR typically attaches unrelated images to fictional clickbait headlines to generate traffic from social media shares. In this case, their picture  of “French bioethicist Jacques Clement” was in fact a photograph of University of Washington’s associate professor of genome sciences
