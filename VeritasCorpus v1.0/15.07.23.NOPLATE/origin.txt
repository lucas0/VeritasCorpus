  Jim Cara wanted a vanity license tag that would make people laugh.
 </p>
 <p>
  But when he chose “NOTAG” for the plate on his Suzuki Hayabusa, a sleek blue and silver motorcycle with a speedometer that reaches
  <nobr>
   220 mph,
  </nobr>
  the joke backfired.
 </p>
 <p>
  The new tag arrived Saturday under an avalanche of Wilmington parking violations.
 </p>
 <p>
  “All the traffic tickets say, ‘Notice of violation. License number: no tag,'” Cara said.
 </p>
 <p>
  City computers, talking to state Division of Motor Vehicles computers, had finally found an address for ticketed vehicles that lacked license tags: Cara’s home in Elsmere.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I messed up the system so bad,” Cara said. “I wonder if they can put me in jail or something?”
 </p>
 <p>
  He has received more than 200 violation notices. The mail carrier came twice on Saturday. Cara opened a few. They ranged from $55 to $125 for violations such as meter expirations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Cara, 43, who works for the American Motorcycle Association, said he’s been a lifelong prankster. This time, though, “the cleanup is going to be worse than the joke,” he said.
