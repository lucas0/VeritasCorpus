  With nothing more than a fistful of cornmeal in his stomach, a small pile of once-forgotten science textbooks, and an armory of curiosity and determination, he embarked on a daring plan to bring his family a set of luxuries that only two percent of Malawians could afford and what the West considers a necessityâ€“electricity and running water.

A second machine turned a water pump that could battle the drought and famine that loomed with every season.
