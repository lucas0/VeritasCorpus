  Nothing screams tolerance and diversity like a university workshop designed to target white people.
 </p>
 <p>
  The State University of New York in Binghamton has a bit of explaining to do after they held a workshop titled, “#StopWhitePeople2K16.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The workshop was an official part of the residential assistant training program at the taxpayer-funded university.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Binghamton Review, the university’s conservative newspaper, exposed this nonsense and they deserve a round of applause for their efforts.
