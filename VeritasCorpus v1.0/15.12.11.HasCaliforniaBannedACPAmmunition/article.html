  In April 2015, web site
  <em>
   NationalReport.net
  </em>
  published a piece titled, “California Implements Statewide Ban On All .45 ACP Ammunition.”  The piece read, in part:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The California Legislature has passed a controversial Assembly Bill that creates a ban on the future sale and ownership of all .45 ACP ammo. The bill states that the ban on the popular ammunition is in effect immediately, however does include a 60 day grace period prior to state law enforcement enforcing the ban.
   <br>
    Though the ban has created a clear divide among the citizens of California, it’s said to be widely supported by political figures across the state. Many politicians and citizens alike feel that that ban is a clear infringement of California citizen’s second amendment rights, however; many feel that the ban is a positive step towards much needed gun control.

  is enormously

   popular
  </a>
  , the article immediately caused a
  <a href="http://www.downrange.tv/forum/index.php?topic=30456.0" target="_blank">
   furor
  </a>
  in gun and ammunition forums and on social media.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some were taken in initially, particularly since the article was also published under the now-suspended spoof web address
  <em>
   NYTimes.com.co,
  </em>
  but commenters quickly
  <a href="http://forums.gunsandammo.com/showthread.php?23952-California-bans-45-acp-ammo" target="_blank">
   discovered
  </a>
  that the story was a
  <a href="http://crosshairsusa.net/there-is-no-california-ban-on-45-acp-ammo/" target="_blank">
   hoax

  .

  <em>
   NationalReport.net
  </em>
  is a satire site. Its disclaimer page reads:
 </p>

  Other stories that originated from the site had titles such as,”Sarah Palin Bans Muslims from Entering Bristol Palin,” and “Adolf Hitler Tired of Being Compared to Donald Trump.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite this, the hoax article continued to take in people — and sometimes entire news outlets. On 9 December 2015, the New York Times breathed new life into the piece when it published an
  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/opinion/an-opening-for-states-to-restrict-guns.html" target="_blank">
   editorial
  </a>
  titled, “An Opening for States to Restrict Guns,” which linked to the hoax site in the following paragraph:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
