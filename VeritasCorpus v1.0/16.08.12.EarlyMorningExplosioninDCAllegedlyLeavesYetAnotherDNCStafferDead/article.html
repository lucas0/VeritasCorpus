  On 11 August 2016 the web site

  published an

   article
  </a>
  reporting that “YET ANOTHER DNC staffer” was killed in a “mysterious” explosion at a Maryland apartment complex:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   At least two people died and several remained missing after a natural gas explosion and fire leveled an apartment building late Wednesday in the Washington suburb of Silver Spring, Md., fire officials said.
  </p>
  <p>
   Assistant Chief Russ Hamill of the Montgomery County Police told reporters Thursday that two bodies were found in the ruins and that the scene would be handled as a “death investigation.” The identity of one of the bodies has led some to speculate, especially following the revelations about murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich this week.
  </p>
  <p>
   Immediately after the explosion, journalists and observers began to ask questions … One source CTN spoke with said that 5 to 7 people are still considered to be missing, and it is believed that a long-time DNC staffer may be among the group.
  </p>
  <p>
   “No bodies have been identified at this time,” the police chief told surrounding media. “It is very likely that DC staffers, including political types, live in this building.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Eyes have turned to mysterious deaths surrounding DNC employees lately, with Julian Assange of Wikileaks offering a cash reward for Seth Rich, who was murdered in a northwest DC neighborhood early last month. Assange even went as far to say that Rich may have been Wikileaks’ source within the Democratic Party.

 in the immediate wake of the tragedy:



<blockquote>The family of slain Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich is calling on conspiracy theorists to stop speculating about factually baseless connections between his death and a WikiLeaks hack.

In a statement to Business Insider on Wednesday, Brad Bauman, a spokesperson for the Rich family, thanked investigators and implored high-profile figures to stop attempting to politicize Rich's death by perpetuating unfounded theories about the shooting.

"The family welcomes any and all information that could lead to the identification of the individuals responsible, and certainly welcomes contributions that could lead to new avenues of investigation," Bauman said.

He added:

<em>"That said, some are attempting to politicize this horrible tragedy, and in their attempts to do so, are actually causing more harm than good and impeding on the ability for law enforcement to properly do their job. For the sake of finding Seth's killer, and for the sake of giving the family the space they need at this terrible time, they are asking for the public to refrain from pushing unproven and harmful theories about Seth's murder."</em></blockquote>
