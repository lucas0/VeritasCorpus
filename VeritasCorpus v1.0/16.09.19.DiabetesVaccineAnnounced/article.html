  reporting that “The vaccine against diabetes promises to be the solution for the advance of the illness and even reverses its effects.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The story cited work of two supposed Mexican scientists, Salvador Chacón Ramírez, president of the “Live Your Diabetes Foundation,” and Lucila Zárate Ortega, of the “Mexican Association for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Autoimmune Diseases,” along with Doctor Jorge González Ramírez, using a therapy called “auto-chemotherapy.”  According to the Time for You article (which appeared to rely on a bad auto-translation), the procedure for immunizing against diabetes works as follows:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   About 5 cm of blood were extracted from each patient and then they were injected with 55 milliliters of blood solution. It is refrigerated at five degrees centigrade. When the temperature changes to 37 grades, since it goes out of the body to a new temperature, a shock happens takes place and what was a problem turns into the solution inside the bottle, in such a way that the genetic and metabolic flaw is corrected or inmunometabolised in the vaccine.
  </p>
  <p>
   The vaccine lasts for 60 days and the treatment is about one year. This vaccine is much more than a medicine; it is a medical practice that has turned into an alternative, a possible solution to stop the complications that are chronically degenerative: embolism, loss of ear; amputation, renal insufficiency and blindness, etc.
