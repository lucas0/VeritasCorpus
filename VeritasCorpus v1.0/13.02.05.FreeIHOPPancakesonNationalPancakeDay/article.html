  Whenever someone inquires what my favorite kind of food is, the answer is always the same: “Free!” So, on 27 February 2018,
  <a href="https://www.ihop.com/en/national-pancake-day" target="_blank">
   IHOP
  </a>
  restaurants (formerly known as the International House of Pancakes) will be dispensing my favorite kind of food.

 <p>
  While IHOP normally ties its National Pancake Day celebration to
  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/holydays/lent_2.shtml" target="_blank">
   Shrove Tuesday

   Pancake Day
  </a>
  , in 2011 opted to hold its event one week before Shrove Tuesday:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Known also as Fat Tuesday or Mardi Gras, National Pancake Day dates back several centuries to when the English prepped for fasting during Lent. Strict rules prohibited the eating of all dairy products during Lent, so pancakes were made to use up the supply of eggs, milk, butter and other dairy products … hence the name Pancake Tuesday or Shrove Tuesday.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  <!--
The significance of that day is that it's <NOBR><A HREF="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/holydays/lent_2.shtml" TARGET=shrove target="_blank">Shrove Tuesday</A></NOBR> (or Fat Tuesday), also known as International (or National) <NOBR><A HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/20020102190043/http://www.pancakeparlour.com/Annual_Events/Shrove/shrove.html" TARGET=pancake target="_blank">Pancake Day</A>.</NOBR>
