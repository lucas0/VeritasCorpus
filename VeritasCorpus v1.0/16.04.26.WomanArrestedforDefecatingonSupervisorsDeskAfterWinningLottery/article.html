  On 25 April 2016, entertainment web site
  <em>
   The Valley Report
  </em>
  published a fake news article claiming that a woman was arrested for defecating on her supervisor’s desk after she had won more than $3 million from a lottery ticket:

   A 41-year-old woman had the winning lottery ticket worth over 3 million dollars on Friday night, but showed up to work anyway on Monday to deliver one last package.
  </p>
  <p>
   The courier company had no idea of her winnings. “I knew something was wrong because I came back from lunch and the door to my office was closed,” said the manager. I slowly opened the door to discover the woman with her pants around her ankles, hunched over on my desk like a hippopotamus/cheetah dropping a massive poo on my desk.

  There is no truth to the above-quoted story.

  A common tactic among purveyors of
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2016/01/14/fake-news-sites/" target="_blank">
   fake new
  </a>
  s is to include a mugshot with the story to lend it some credibility. While these images typically show real mugshots (which are often regarded as fair game by fake news sites because they are, at least nominally, in the
  <a href="http://www.newmediarights.org/business_models/artist/are_mugshots_public_domain" target="_blank">
   public domain
  </a>
  ) they are random photographs that are in no way related to the fake news stories, and in fact, the people depicted are probably unaware that their likenesses are now adorning often-embarrassing “satire” stories.

 <p>
  In this case, the woman pictured above was not arrested for defecating on her boss’s desk. The picture was taken from an August 2014 news
