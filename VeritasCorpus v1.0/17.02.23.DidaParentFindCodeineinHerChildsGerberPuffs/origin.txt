  PARENTS: Please carefully inspect whatever it is you give your little ones! I put B into his high chair and dumped some Puffs onto his tray &amp; a little piece of what looks like a white pill came out with them. After removing him, I dumped the rest of the container and found another little piece. I’m not sure what it is, but the thought that sometimes we all as parents don’t always pay attention terrifies me that he or some other child could have eaten it. Always always always inspect their food/snacks! ??

  Update 2/17/17: After taking the “foreign object” to be tested in 2 different cities, 3 different pharmacist have concluded that it was a Tylenol 3/Codeine 300mg. That’s all I can currently say. Thank you all for helping spread the awareness!

  Update # 2, 2/19/17: Other families with similar experiences are starting to contact us with information, pictures, case numbers &amp; complaint file numbers where Gerber has swept this recklessness under the rug. This Momma &amp; Daddy WILL get something done about this! And as I always say, continue to be vigilant when giving your child pre-packaged snacks! ?

  Also- when posting this originally I did it as a scared mother, in a complete state of shock and disappointment. My goal was to reach my immediate friends and family whom we personally know. In posting and being terrified of what I had just found, I failed to mention that the container of Puffs was sealed twice. Once under the lid and one on top surrounding the lid- both seals were 110% in tact with no holes, cuts or damage. The container its self was in perfect condition. When I notified Gerber within minutes of my finding I did inform them of that from the start. Thank you to those of you whom brought it to my attention that the information regarding the seals was lacking from my post. I had stated it numerous times in comments throughout but had failed to update on the main post!

  Update 2/23/17: Update: not too long ago in Illinois some parents found a white tablet of medication in their child’s Gerber oatmeal and filed a police report. I just got off of the phone with that police department and they informed me that they had sent the evidence to Gerber and that Gerber said it was an isolated incident and never reported back their findings. Just a quick update for those who seem to believe this is not real or it is not worth raising concern over.
