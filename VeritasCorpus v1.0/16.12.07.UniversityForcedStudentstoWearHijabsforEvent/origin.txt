  Islam week at schools in America, administrators demand females wear hijabs to show support.

 <p>
  Every journey begins with a single step. And in Wisconsin this week, that first step was to persuade American women to don the garb of traditional Muslims.

  The vehicle is “Islam Appreciation Week”, an event hosted by the University of Wisconsin Muslim Student Association and Wisconsin Union Directorate Global Connection.
