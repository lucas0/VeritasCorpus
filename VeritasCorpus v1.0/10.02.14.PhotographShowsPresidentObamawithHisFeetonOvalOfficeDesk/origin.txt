  Bill Curley, a middle-aged Apple marketing manager, remembers this incident from his very first week on the job at Apple. “I was at a meeting with [Apple CEO Steve] Jobs and several other managers, and he is in shorts, running shoes, and no socks. He’s disagreeing with a guy, so he kicks off his shoes and puts his bare feet on the table. He framed the guy’s face with his feet.”
