  A photograph that has been circulating online for several years purports to show a humorous sign warning people not to cross a field unless they can outrun a bull:

    </a>
   </center>
   <br>
    Do not cross this field. Unless you can do it in 9 seconds because the bull can do it in 10.

  The image, which can be found on several joke web sites, is frequently followed by

  claiming that it was somehow either faked or digitally manipulated. One often-cited reason for this belief is that the sign is written in Comic Sans

  However, despite the image quality and the font, the sign is completely real. We were able to find several examples of similar signs written in an identical typeface,
