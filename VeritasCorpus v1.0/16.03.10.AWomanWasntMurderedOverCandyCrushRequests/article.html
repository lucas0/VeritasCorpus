  On 8 March 2016, the entertainment web site
  <em>
   The Valley Report
  </em>
  published a fake news article claiming that a woman had murdered her college roommate after receiving one too many requests to play the mobile game
  <em>
   Candy Crush:
  </em>
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   A 19-year-old woman beat her roommate to death with an industrial sized bag of jelly beans on Tuesday afternoon.
  </p>
  <p>
   The woman was reportedly frustrated by the amount of invites received for the popular Facebook game Candy Crush. “It started off as once a week,” the woman said in her statement. “Soon it was happening every day. My battery was constantly dying from notifications from this girl. I tried disabling notifications, I tried blocking her, I tried everything except murder. Now I’ll never have to see that horrible notification again.”

 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The above-quoted story is a work of fiction.
