  Fred Rogers began his television career as a result of his being convicted of child molestation; one condition of his sentence was that he fulfill a community service obligation by performing a television show for children on a local public station.  This circumstance explains the lack of children on his program and the presence of adult characters with suggestive names, such as Mr. McFeely.
