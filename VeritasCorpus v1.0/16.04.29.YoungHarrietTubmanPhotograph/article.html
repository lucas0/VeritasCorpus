  camp was a viral social media photograph, purportedly depicting a “young Harriet Tubman,” that was floated as a “better choice” for the note in question that the image initially presented.
 </p>
 <p>
  The purported “young Harriet Tubman” image featured a softer aesthetic than the more familiar historical image of Tubman often used in mock-ups for the $20 bill:

  While this image was certainly popular on social networks, it took far less than a minute to determine that the

   woman
  </a>
  depicted in it was not Harriet Tubman at all. Rather, the photograph shows Lady Sara Forbes Bonetta Davies, whose biographical information is summarized thusly by Wikipedia:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Lady Sara Forbes Bonetta (1843- 15 August 1880) was a West African Egbado Omoba who was orphaned in intertribal warfare, sold into slavery, and in a remarkable twist of events, was liberated from enslavement, and became a goddaughter to Queen Victoria. She was married to Captain James Pinson Labulo Davies, the wealthy Victorian Lagos philanthropist.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Visually, Tubman and Bonetta bore little resemblance to one another:

 <p>
  Neither “young Harriet Tubman” (nor her older self) had any real-life connection to Sara Forbes Bonetta Davies. Moreover, none of Tubman’s predecessors on American currency were depicted in a manner that focused on glamor over historical context.
