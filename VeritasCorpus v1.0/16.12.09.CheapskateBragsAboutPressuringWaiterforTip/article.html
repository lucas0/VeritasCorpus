  An unidentified eater’s alleged account of a cruel way to get better service has been gaining traction online.
 </p>
 <p>
  The meme is based around a purported screenshot of five $1 bills on a table, with a knife holding them together, and if the server does something the patron does not like, the patron ostentatiously takes one of the bills away. The money, the poster explains, is meant to goad the server into providing “better service.” (There is no name listed alongside the image.)
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite this, a Facebook thread highlighting the meme has been shared 7,891 times since being posted on 6 December 2016; the picture was also highlighted in a Reddit thread for “

  .”

  Popular food blogger Darron Cardosa (a.k.a. The Bitchy Waiter) also broke
  <a href="http://thebitchywaiter.com/2016/12/i-just-found-the-biggest-ahole-on-the-internet.html" target="_blank">
   down
  </a>
  why he felt the boastful eater was “the biggest asshole on the Internet” (emphasis his):
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   <strong>
    “So I took the wife out to dinner last night, and we have always talked about doing this.”
   </strong>
   When most people talk about the things they have always wanted to do, they are thinking exotic trips to foreign lands, buying a second home or going skydiving. Not this couple, though. They dream of toying with the financial well-being of waitress who is just hoping she will get a fucking 20% tip from her asshole customer.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    “You put 5 singles out on the table at the beginning of dinner for the waiter/waitress to see. (Don’t say anything to them).”
   </strong>
   If I had a customer do that, I wouldn’t think twice about them not saying anything to me about why there was money on the table. And what if we don’t see it? Are you going to wave those five bills in our face and then place them back on the table just to make sure I’m paying attention to them? You’re an ass.
  </p>

 <p>
  It should be noted, though, that the stunt described in the meme is not without precedent. It is identical to the opening scene from the
  <em>
   Cheers
  </em>
  episode
  <a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/620128" target="_blank">
   “Rebecca Redux,”
  </a>
  in which a mouthy customer tells Carla (Rhea Perlman):
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Do you see this roll of dollar bills here? This is your tip. I’ve set it aside in advance.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now here’s the deal. Every time you do something wrong, I take a dollar bill, see? That way, I get decent service. Understood?
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Carla responds with her own proposal: that every time he does that, she gets to flick beer in his face. Eventually, she dumps the whole drink on him.

  Another NBC show,
  <em>
   3rd Rock from the Sun,
  </em>
  had a variant on that scene in the episode “Sex and the Sally” when Dick (John Lithgow) “reinvents tipping” by placing a stack of bills on the table and
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVD5wvJ1ru4" target="_blank">
   telling
  </a>
  his waitress:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   This pile of $1 dollar bills represents your potential tip. Every time you please me you’ll see the pile grow. However, if I am unsatisfied — if you’re slow, mouthy, or sneeze into your hands — you’ll notice the pile shrinking. Agreed? Good luck!

  The Facebook user who garnered the large response to the image told us that it had originated in a Florida restaurant’s private Facebook group, and is based on a user’s sibling’s actual “experiment” while dining out. We reached out to the person who posted the image seeking comment.
