   “So I took the wife out to dinner last night, and we have always talked about doing this.”

  When most people talk about the things they have always wanted to do, they are thinking exotic trips to foreign lands, buying a second home or going skydiving. Not this couple, though. They dream of toying with the financial well-being of waitress who is just hoping she will get a fucking 20% tip from her asshole customer.

   “You put 5 singles out on the table at the beginning of dinner for the waiter/waitress to see. (Don’t say anything to them).”
  </strong>
  If I had a customer do that, I wouldn’t think twice about them not saying anything to me about why there was money on the table. And what if we don’t see it? Are you going to wave those five bills in our face and then place them back on the table just to make sure I’m paying attention to them? You’re an ass.
