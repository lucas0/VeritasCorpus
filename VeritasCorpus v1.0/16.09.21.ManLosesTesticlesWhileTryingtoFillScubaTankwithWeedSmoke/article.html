  On 3 September 2016, the entertainment web site
  <em>

  </em>
  published a hoax article that reported a man in Calgary had lost a testicle when he knocked over a scuba tank he was attempting to fill with marijuana smoke, causing it to explode and send shrapnel flying into his body:

   A 29-year old Calgary local has suffered extensive injuries to his lower body after an unconventional attempt to ‘fill a scuba tank with weed smoke’ failed spectacularly last Thursday night. According to the testimony of several witnesses, Robert Palmer had consumed a copious quantity of alcohol before making the decision to demonstrate the home-made device.

   “Rob’s a recreational diver,” commented one of the injured man’s friends. “For some time, he’s been tinkering with an old scuba tank that he’d bought cheaply from a dive shop. His plan was to use an air compressor to feed smoke into the tank, and then use a scuba regulator to inhale it.”
