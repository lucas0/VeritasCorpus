  On 29 September 2016, the World News Daily Report web site published an
  <a href="http://archive.is/8wcjg" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  reporting that police in Kentucky had shot a white coal miner after mistaking him for a black man:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Officers of the Bell County Sheriff Department have mistakenly shot an unarmed coal miner, thinking he was a black criminal.
  </p>
  <p>
   37-year old Jason Morris had just finished his night shift in a mine operated by the Bell County Coal Corporation and was boarding his vehicle to head home, when the deputies arrived.
  </p>
  <p>
   Seeing a dark faced individual enter a brand new Lincoln Navigator worth more than $75,000, the officers believed he was an African American man attempting to steal a vehicle.
  </p>
  <p>
   After he ignored three shouted warnings from the deputies, Mr Morris was shot five times in the back, in both legs and in the left arm.
  </p>
  <p>
   Many miners witnessed the incident, and all of them insist that the shooting was totally unprovoked and unjustified.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  In addition to being crass and offensive, the report was entirely fabricated.  World News Daily Report (WNDR) is a fake news site that publishes clickbait hoaxes using unrelated images to spin wild and salacious stories.   The site’s disclaimer notes that WNDR’s content is fictional:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   WNDR assumes however all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website — even those based on real people — are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle.
