  However, during a mass [on 9 November 2016], Pope Francis said that, he is simply shocked to see how Americans elected their president despite the significant differences of Christian values both candidates possess. Jesus never looked at race, religion, creed or cast when healing people, reached out to everyone with the same love and care. Anyone could reach out to Jesus or the god for forgiveness and guidance.

  “True Christians do not treat anyone differently, talk bad about them or look down on them. God help poor Mexicans, Africans and Cubans who wanted to realize American dream” he said.

  “I am not sure whether we still can vouch for the faith of American Christians, as they need more wisdom looking at the leader they finally elected”, said Pope Francis.

  Last time when pope made the controversial statement Trump responded promptly saying that its “”disgraceful” for a religious leader to question anyone’s faith.

  He added, “If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISIS’s ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been the president,”. Ironically he is now the president and he has another statement by Pope Francis to deal forthwith.
