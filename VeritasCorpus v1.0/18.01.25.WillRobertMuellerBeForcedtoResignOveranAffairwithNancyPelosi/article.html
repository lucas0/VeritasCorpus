  reporting that Robert Mueller, the former FBI director who now heads the Special Counsel investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, would soon be resigning his position due to the disclosure of his long-term affair with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Robert Mueller’s steamy, 13-year affair with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is going to cost him more than a little bit of embarrassment and his marriage, according to a trusted source inside the Department of Justice. Mueller will also be forced to resign from his position as Special Prosecutor for the FBI, nullifying everything that investigator has uncovered as fruit of the poisonous tree.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pelosi, who says her husband was well-aware of the affair, swears that Mueller was just a friend whose company she enjoyed on long, lonely working nights and weekends in Washington. The California “progressive” says her husband was afforded the same freedom to explore “pleasures of the flesh.”
