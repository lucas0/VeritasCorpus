  A man who asked for help on a server forum, claiming that he had deleted his entire company with just one line of code, now says the whole thing was a stunt.
 </p>
 <p>
  Marco Marsala had originally posted the following plea on a
  <a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/587102/monday-morning-mistake-sudo-rm-rf-no-preserve-root" target="_blank">
   question
  </a>
  and answer site for system and network administrators.
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   I run a small hosting provider with more or less 1535 customers and I use Ansible to automate some operations to be run on all servers. Last night I accidentally ran, on all servers, a Bash script with a rm -rf {foo}/{bar} with those variables undefined due to a bug in the code above this line.
   <a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/769357/recovering-from-a-rm-rf" target="_blank">
    All servers got deleted and the offsite backups too
   </a>
   because the remote storage was mounted just before by the same script (that is a backup maintenance script).
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  His situation (i.e., that he had deleted all of his serves and backups with an errant rm command) was so awful, and so believable, that his post received
  <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/04/14/man-deletes-his-whole-company-after-typing-wrong-bit-of-code/" target="_blank">
   widespread
  </a>
  <a href="http://www.sciencealert.com/guy-accidentally-deletes-his-entire-company-with-just-one-line-of-bad-code" target="_blank">
   attention
  </a>
  , particularly from users who pointed out that he was at fault for not properly backing up his files.
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sudo+rm+-rf+%2F" target="_blank">
   sudo rm -rf /
  </a>
  command is famously
  <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/555550/undo-sudo-rm-r/555589" target="_blank">
   destructive
  </a>
  , but — happily for Marsala’s clients — this particular situation was a hoax.  Marsala admitted to making up the scenario in order to promote his small company, which (naturally) provides outsourced server management services.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It was just a joke,” Marsala told Italian news outlet

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The command that I mentioned in the article is harmless but it seems that almost no one has noticed … With the inaccuracies that are in the online comments I could write a book.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Ansible tool prevents these errors. Almost every serious administrator uses it, but among those who answered, no one seemed to know that, otherwise they would know that what I have described could not happen.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Marsala said he is also working on a “Unix for Dummies” book, and that the situation he described actually did happen, but to someone else “before 2006.”
