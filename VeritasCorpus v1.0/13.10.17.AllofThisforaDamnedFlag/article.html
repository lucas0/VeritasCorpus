  The above-displayed video clip from a 9/11 commemoration ceremony in 2011 shows President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama observing a portion of the ceremony in which an honor guard has folded an American flag, at which point the First Lady leans over to her husband and makes a remark, to which the President nods in agreement.  The clip has been circulated with the claim that what Michelle Obama said to her husband was the question, “All of this for a damned flag?”

  For what it’s worth, a lip reading instructor at the River School in Washington, D.C., did not, as claimed, provide the proffered explanation (“All of this for a damned flag?”) of what Michelle Obama supposedly said in this video clip.  The school posted a disclaimer on its
