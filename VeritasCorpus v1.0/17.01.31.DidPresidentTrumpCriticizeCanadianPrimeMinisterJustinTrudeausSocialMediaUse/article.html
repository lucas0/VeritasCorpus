  On 28 January 2017, the satirical web site BurrardStreetJournal.com
  <a href="http://www.burrardstreetjournal.com/trump-tweets-trudeau-stop-wasting-time-on-facebook/" target="_blank">
   reported
  </a>
  that President Donald Trump had scolded Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for using Facebook too frequently:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “I mean don’t you have a country to run or something?” Trump asked, labelling the Canadian Prime Minister a “social media whore”.
  </p>
  <p>
   “He’s constantly online, 24/7. He’s obsessed,” Trump continued, suggesting the PM should seek psychiatric help for his addiction.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 45th American President claims Trudeau’s “embarrassing” attempts to “get likes” is all the more pathetic given he has so few followers compared to Trump:
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    “As of 3am last night, Trudeau only had 3,735,257 followers on Facebook compared to my 19,359,401. Sad.”
   </em>
  </p>
