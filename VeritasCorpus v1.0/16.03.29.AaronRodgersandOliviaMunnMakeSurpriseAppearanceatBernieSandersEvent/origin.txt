  The superstar couple kept a low profile and spoke only briefly with press and fans. “Today is about Bernie Sanders,” Rodgers told the Plymouth Review, “his message is resonating with the youth of this country and it’s an exciting thing to witness.” Olivia credits Senator Sanders for getting her interested in politics again. “Bernie is one of those once-in-a-lifetime candidates. I think he would make a wonderful president,” said Munn.
