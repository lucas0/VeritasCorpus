  In what promises to be the biggest White House scandal since intern fellatio, President Barack Obama’s daughter,
  <nobr>
   16-year-old
  </nobr>
  Malia, has confirmed that she is pregnant.
 </p>
 <p>
  For now, Malia is staying hush-hush about the father’s identity, but one thing she would say is that he is white.
 </p>
 <p>
  “My mom always hoped I would get with a nice mixed-race man like dad, but love is so colorblind. Mom was probably right though. The dad already left me for some tramp. And of course, like all white men, my baby daddy won’t want to pay his child support. I already told him, ‘You want to keep your license so you can drive that bleach-blond tramp around in your little Jaguar, right? Better step up.'”
