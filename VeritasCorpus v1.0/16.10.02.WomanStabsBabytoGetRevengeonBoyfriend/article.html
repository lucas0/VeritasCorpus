  purportedly showing a woman stabbing her baby to death in order to get revenge on her boyfriend. [The video linked above is disturbing and may not be suitable for all viewers.]

  This video quickly went viral and racked up more than 1.2 million views within the first few days of its posting. Despite the video’s popularity, neither it nor other sources provided any information about the incident depicted. That status changed on 22 October 2015, when Zaida Pugh posted a second video to her Facebook page explaining that the video was a prank in order to raise awareness for … well, it’s actually not clear what Zaida Pugh was trying to raise awareness for:

   Why did I do this video? Why do I do any of my videos. Because there’s messages out there. I feel like I might be repeating myself a little too much. It’s a wake up call. This is a call to the public. Hello? Wake up. This is actually something that is going on. This is something that we need to face and we need to make a change. Hello, this is a wake up call to everybody.
