  Sometimes apocryphal quotes are put into the mouths of famous persons to lend credence to (or denigrate) the idea those words express.  And sometimes  apocryphal quotes are put into the mouths of historical figures as a shorthand form of expressing what those people thought and did.  The Adolf Hitler quotation displayed above about “how to control a people” combines elements of both those purposes but fails for being doubly false.

  According to this item, the infamous Nazi leader once proclaimed that:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The best way to take control over a people and control them utterly is to take a little of their freedom at a time, to erode their rights by a thousand tiny and almost imperceptible reductions. In this way the people will not see those rights and freedoms being removed until past the point at which those changes can be reversed.
