  Pensioners should apply as refugees!

  It is interesting that the federal government provides a single refugee with a monthly allowance of $1,890.00 and each can also get an additional $580.00 in social assistance for a total of $2,470.00
 </p>
 <p>
  This compares very well to a single pensioner who after contributing to the growth and development of America for 40 to 50 years can only receive a monthly maximum of $1,012.00 in old age pension and Guaranteed Income Supplement.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe our pensioners should apply as refugees!
 </p>
 <p>
  Lets send this to all Americans, so we can all be ticked off and maybe we can get the refugees cut back to $1,012.00 and the pensioners to $2,470.00 and enjoy some of the money we were forced to submit to the Government over the last 40 or 50 years.

  Please forward to every American to expose what our elected politicians have been doing over the past 11 years â€” to the over-taxed American.

  SEND THIS TO EVERY AMERICAN TAXPAYER YOU KNOW
