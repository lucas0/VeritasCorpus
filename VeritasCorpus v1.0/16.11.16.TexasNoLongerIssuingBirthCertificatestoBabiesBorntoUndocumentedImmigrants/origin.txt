  Since Donald Trump announced his intention to run for president, there have been several issues in connection with immigration policy that have become the subject of debate. One of the most heated debates has surrounded the issue of whether illegal immigrants who give birth to children in the United States should be able to obtain citizenship and whether their children born on United States soil can in fact obtain birth certificates.

  Within the state of Texas, many counties simply will not grant birth certificates for children born in the United States to parents who are undocumented. Mexico has threatened that this recent failure to issue birth certificates could greatly threaten the relationship with Mexico. Given Mexicoâ€™s proximity to Texas, this is a major issue that needs to be addressed.
