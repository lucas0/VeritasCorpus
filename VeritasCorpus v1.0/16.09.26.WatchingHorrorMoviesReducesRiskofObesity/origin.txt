  The University of Westminster study measured the total energy expenditure of ten different people as they watched a selection of frightening movies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Scientists recorded their heart rate, oxygen intake and carbon dioxide output — and discovered the number of calories used increased by an average a third during the films.
 </p>
 <p>
  The research also revealed films featuring moments designed to make viewers jump in terror are the best calorie-burners, as they cause heart rates to soar.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dr. Richard Mackenzie, senior lecturer and specialist in cell metabolism and physiology at the University of Westminster, said: “Each of the ten films tested set pulses racing, sparking an increase in the heart rate of the case studies.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As the pulse quickens and blood pumps around the body faster, the body experiences a surge in adrenaline.
 </p>
 <p>
  “It is this release of fast acting adrenaline, produced during short bursts of intense stress (or in this case, brought on by fear), which is known to lower the appetite, increase the Basal Metabolic Rate and ultimately burn a higher level of calories.”
