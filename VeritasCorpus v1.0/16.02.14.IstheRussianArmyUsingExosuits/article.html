  In February 2016, an image purportedly showing two Russian soldiers wearing “exosuits” in Syria started circulating via English-language web sites after it was posted to the
  <em>
   Reddit
  </em>
  community forums.

  Exosuits, or powered exoskeletons, are wearable machines used to enhance ordinary human strength or speed.  They’re generally the stuff of dystopian science fiction, but they have been around in one conceptual form or

   story

  about the Russian military working to develop combat exoskeletons by 2020:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   A Russian defense contractor says it will be able to mass produce mind-controlled combat exoskeletons for Russian soldiers in five years. The devices would allow the troops to run faster, jump higher and lift weights beyond human capacity.
  </p>
  <p>
   I think in about five years we will have a neuro-interface to control exoskeletons and prosthetics through the brain’s electric impulses,” Aleksandr Kulish, the head of the medical equipment development and manufacturing department of Russia’s United Instrument Manufacturing Corporation, told TASS news agency.
  </p>
  <p>
   The new system could increase the wearer’s strength and endurance many fold, allowing soldiers to make tremendous leaps, lift and throw objects they normally could not, as well as carrying up to 300 kilograms of equipment.

  Thhis image, however, has little to do with the Russian military or the development of combat exoskeletons, as this photograph was taken on the set of the movie
