  On 7 July 2016, the
  <em>
   Christian Post
  </em>
  published an
  <a href="http://www.christianpost.com/buzzvine/obama-commissions-rob-bell-to-write-gender-neutral-bible-166165/" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  reporting that President Obama signed an executive order commissioning megachurch pastor Rob Bell to create a gender-neutral version of the Bible:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Meant to serve as a corollary to Obama’s demands that public schools allow boys to go into girls’ bathrooms, the executive order will give Bell $7 million to research, write and and publish a Bible that breaks through the barriers of gender.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a rare White House press briefing, Obama said Bell is the most competent person for the job.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Rob Bell is an excellent person, aaaaaaaaaa religious man, aaaaaaaaa smart individual who, like me, knows what it’s like to be accused of not being Christian,” Obama said.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Best of all, Bell knows how to irritate the heck out of evangelicals. And while I believe we need a country that is welcoming of all Americans, regardless of who they are, everybody and their dog knows that evangelicals, babies, and nuns don’t count.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The article concluded, referencing a portion of
  <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/22-19.htm" target="_blank">
   Scripture
  </a>
  that holds nothing shall be added to the Bible:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “Finally, I can stop spending time ignoring the parts of the Bible I hate and instead start rewriting the parts of the Bible I hate. After all, love wins!”
  </p>
  <p>
   While Obama wanted merely to remove the thousands of references to men and women from the sacred text, Bell has already added a few of his own ideas for the new edition. These include:
  </p>
  <p>
   — Editing out every reference to the term “Christian,” as Jesus would be mortified about the idea that the word in question was being used. At all. In any circumstance.
  </p>
  <p>
   — Omitting all references to eternal punishment or damnation, especially Jesus’ parable about the Rich Man and Lazarus. After all, Jesus would be mortified about that being there also.
  </p>
  <p>
   — Removing all verses that refer to homosexuality and extramarital sex as sinful and replacing them with the phrase “Love Wins!”
  </p>

  <em>
   Christian Post
  </em>
  isn’t a satirical
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Christian_Post" target="_blank">
   web site
  </a>
  and typically delivers straight news from an Evangelical perspective. However, the above-quoted article was pubished in a section of the site called
  <em>
   BuzzVine
  </em>
  , where content is preceded by the following disclaimer:

  However, that vague signifier is rendered in light gray text, making it extremely easy to skim miss:
