  In April 2016, a blurry photograph purportedly showing two urinals that had been installed in a women’s bathroom at a Target retail store in Los Angeles spread widely on Facebook. The picture was posted amidst debate over the chain’s announced

But although some consumers have genuine concerns over Target’s policy of allowing transgender individuals to use the restrooms that correspond with their gender identities, the online outrage has also spurred a number of transphobic and baseless items spread via social media.
