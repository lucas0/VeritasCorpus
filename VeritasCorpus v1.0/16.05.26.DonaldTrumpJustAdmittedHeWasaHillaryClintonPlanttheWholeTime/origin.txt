  The rumors were true after all. Donald Trump just admitted he was a Hillary Clinton plant the whole time.

 <p>
  Many have suspected as much but now Donald Trump himself has admitted that he is running as a Republican to ensure Hillary Clinton will win in November. Trump revealed via Twitter that he made a deal with Hillary in late May mere weeks before he announced his run.

  After Donald Trump made this announcement we reached out to his incarcerated campaign manager Corey Lewandoski who filled us in on the whole story:

 <p>
  Electing Hillary Clinton, the most disliked Democrat politician in decades, would have been impossible unless she were running against a Republican that was even worse. Although, it couldnâ€™t just be any Republican, it would have to be the absolute worst Republican in the country. It would have to be a Republican that was so bad even other Republicans would denounce them. It would have to be someone that would split the party and ensure Hillary could win the White House with only 40% of the vote.
