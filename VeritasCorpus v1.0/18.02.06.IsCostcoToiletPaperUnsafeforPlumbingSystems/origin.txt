  If you use Costco toilet paper then please read this!

  In addition to the burst pipe, we also found out that there was an issue with our septic tank today.
 </p>
 <p>
  When the guy looked in our septic tank, he said, ‘You use Costco toilet paper.’ We agreed that we did.
 </p>
 <p>
  He said it is not biodegradable and does not break down which is why our septic tank was full of white toilet paper that was still intact.
 </p>
 <p>
  He said even people who are on city services have issues because it clogs the pipe that takes their waste to the city pipe.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eventually, the sewage will back up into your house.
 </p>
 <p>
  I hope this helps someone else as it was an expensive lesson for us to learn.
