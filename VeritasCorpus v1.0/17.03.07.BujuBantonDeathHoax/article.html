  an article appearing to report that reggae musician

  This site, which does not carry a disclaimer labeling its contents as fiction, has published several hoax news articles. A brief look at the web site’s front page shows at least two stories that are completely fictitious: “Usain Bolt

 <p>
  This is not the first fake news story that NetLiveMedia.com has published about Buju Banton; the site also
  <a href="https://archive.is/veTsb" target="_blank">
   claimed
  </a>
  (falsely) that the musician had been released from prison in January 2017. Baju, who was sentenced to ten years in prison for his role in a cocaine deal, isn’t scheduled for release until December 2018. As of this writing, the
  <a href="https://www.bop.gov/inmateloc/" target="_blank">
   Federal Bureau of Prisons
  </a>
  still had Baju listed as an inmate.

 <p>
  Banton appeared to be in high spirits on the day

  A similar rumor
  <a href="http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Buju-alive-and-okay_14117368" target="_blank">
   circulated
  </a>
  about Buju in 2013. Lorna Strachan, the mother of Banton’s five children, told the
  <em>
   Jamaican Observer
  </em>
  at the time:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Since Friday, reports emerged on social media that Banton, whose real name is Mark Anthony Myrie, had been stabbed to death during a fight in the Pinellas County Jail in Tampa, Florida.
  </p>
  <p>
   Last week as well, rumours emerged that he had committed suicide in prison.
  </p>
  <p>
   But in a message sent to his fans worldwide through Lorna Strachan, the mother of five of his children, Banton laid fears of his mortal demise to rest.
  </p>
  <p>
   “I don’t like rumours about me being killed or committing suicide. Tell them I like the rumours that I am free or out on bail,” Strachan told the Jamaica Observer that Banton said.
  </p>

 <p>
  There was no truth to the 2013 rumor, either.
