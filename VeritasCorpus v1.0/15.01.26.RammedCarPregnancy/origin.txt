  A couple of car-crossed lovers is suing an insurer for damages, claiming an unplanned pregnancy resulted from an automobile accident in Naples’ “love park.”

  Italian newspapers reported Friday that the claim involves an accident in March involving a medium-sized Regata and a tiny Panda car. The accident occurred in a park that nightly attracts scores of couples who make love in their cars.

  The case came to light when an agent of the insurance company decided to publicize the claim to illustrate the absurdity of some bids to win compensation,

  The suit demands compensation for the cost of repairing the Panda and the cost of the wedding the couple decided to have after discovering the woman was pregnant.
