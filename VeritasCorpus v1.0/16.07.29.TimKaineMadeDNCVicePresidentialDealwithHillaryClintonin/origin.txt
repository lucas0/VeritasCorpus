  OK, so we all know Debbie Wasserman Schultz (DWS) was the co-chair of Hillary’s 2008 presidential run, where she lost the nomination to Obama. So, in order to lock down the nomination for 2016, Hillary was able to get DWS in charge of the DNC and manipulate it from within. That’s the theory anyway, except …

  In order for this to work, they would first have to, not only get the DNC chair to step down, but also get them to recommend DWS for the position. The Clinton’s would have to promise something to that person, something more prestigious than being head of the Democratic party. So who was that person and what did they get in return?

  It would appear that Donna Brazile was in-line to get the position, but she was only the interim chair after the previous chair left, served only one month. According to this,
