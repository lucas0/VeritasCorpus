  The entertainment web site
  <em>
   The Good Lord Above
  </em>
  published a fake news article in April 2016, reporting that the Dalai Lama had converted to atheism:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The Dalai Lama, head of the Buddhist faith, abruptly announced today that he no longer believes in ‘nonsense’ and has converted to atheism.
  </p>
  <p>
   “I myself, I can no longer be a believer in nonsense,” the Dalai Lama said at a press conference at the Chan Centre. “Frankly speaking, all religions are bull excrement. So I have become atheist. When our brothers and sisters talk about God, creator, I can only face-palm.” He laughed, perhaps a bit too hard.
