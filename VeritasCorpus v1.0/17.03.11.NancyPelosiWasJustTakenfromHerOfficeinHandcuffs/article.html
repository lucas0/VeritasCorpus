   BREAKING: Nancy Pelosi Was Just Taken From Her Office In Handcuffs
  </p>
  <p>
   Liberal menace and purveyor of lies, Nancy Pelosi (D-California), was just taken from her office in handcuffs by the United States Secret Service. While little information is available as of yet, one agent did tell a reporter for the Washington Examiner that the arrest came at the direct order of the president:
  </p>
  <p>
   “Mrs. Pelosi’s arrest order comes directly from the Oval Office,” said Special Agent Matthew Derpmore, “She’s wanted for questioning in a possible coup attempt against the president. That’s all we’re authorized to say at this time.”

  The article went on to state that warrants were also being served on three other (unnamed) members of Congress believed to have participated in the plot.

 <p>
  Although various unreliable web sites such as LastDeplorables.com, RedCountry.us, and USARumor.com copied the report, which also spread rapidly via social media, no such incident was reported in any legitimate media sources, and for very good reason: it was satire, not fact.
