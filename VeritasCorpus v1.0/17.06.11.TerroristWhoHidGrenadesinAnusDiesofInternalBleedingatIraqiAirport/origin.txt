<blockquote>
 <p>
  An Iraqi terrorist who tried to smuggle two grenades in his backside at Baghdad International Airport was apprehended and left to die from his wounds 2 km outside of the airport reports the Iraqi Times.
 </p>
 <p>
  The terrorist warned airport authorities himself claiming he was in agonizing pain after he had hidden two grenades in his rectum and had planned to blow up a plane.
 </p>
 <p>
  An Iraqi bomb squad rapidly evacuated the man in the back of a pickup truck and brought him 2 km outside of the airport, in the middle of the desert, and out of “harm’s way” declared officials.
