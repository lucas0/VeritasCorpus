  In early February 2018, the Facebook page of Outback Steakhouse was awash in angry posts from consumers pledging never again to dine at the chain because it purportedly had a no-gun policy and had kicked out a “uniformed police officer” with a gun in Tennessee:

  published to the shared account Andrew-Amanda Ward, which in part characterized all Outback Steakhouse locations as “
  <a href="https://www.snopes.com/buffalo-wild-wings-gun-controversy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   gun free zones
  </a>
  .” The post went on to describe the incident in which a customer became frightened by the presence of a firearm:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Well we had a first tonight…. while I was at work tonight (in uniform) I stopped by Outback Steakhouse to eat supper with my wife. I was approached by the manager and asked if I would put my gun in my truck. I let her know that I couldn’t because I was in uniform. She then went and made a call and came back and we were asked to leave because Outback is a gun free zone.
  </p>
  <p>
   Note: I don’t blame the manager… but this is ridiculous and we will never go back there ever again.
  </p>
  <p>
   What is this country coming to? A uniformed Law Enforcement Officer who is sworn to protect and serve the public, is refused service because they have a firearm! I am disgusted and have no other words!!!
  </p>
  <p>
   Outback has contacted us and has apologized for the incident. There was another customer that was “scared for her life” who was seated across from us. This customer also stated that she was afraid because “police are shooting people” and this customer went on to demand to be escorted to her vehicle out of fear of being shot. Again I don’t blame the manager in this situation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Folks we need to turn our attention to people like this who try and push their agenda on all those around them. When an entire restaurant full of other happy people were completely fine with my presence. As a country we need to stand up for each other as so many who have shared this post have done. I am truly humbled by the support we received.

<blockquote>Update with the situation tonight with Outback- the manager has apologized and is sending us a $100 gift card that can be used in multiple restaurants and stated a lady sitting next to our table felt scared for her life ! She said police are shooting people and she could have gotten shot in the parking lot and the manager had to walked her and her husband to their vehicle. We were told it was a policy they don't allow guns - if we would have known there was a complaint we would not have went anywhere! Seriously she was scared for her life ? We were joking and laughing with our server as we ordered then prayed . What was scary about that??</blockquote>

   We’ve always allowed uniformed law enforcement officers to carry their sidearms while dining with us. A manager made a mistake. We have contacted the guest personally and apologized.

  We contacted Outback’s parent company, Bloomin’ Brands, for clarification but had not received a response by press time.
