  In actual fact, this woman’s name was Franziska Mann, stage name Lola Horovitz (Amann/Aust 2013). She was born in 1917, was a dancer and began her career in Warsaw before the war. She was among the best dancers of her generation in Poland. She was imprisoned in the Warsaw Ghetto, and later, like other prominent Jews, internet in Hotel Polski and in Bergen-Belsen. Rumours that she was a Nazi informer have never been confirmed. Her killing of SS man Schillinger in Auschwitz was described by the only surviving eyewitness of this scene, the Slovak Jew Filip Müller, a member of the Sonderkommando (Müller 1979; in English
  <em>
   Eyewitness Auschwitz – Three Years in the Gas Chambers
  </em>
  , 1979). Although Lustig could not know Müller’s report in the sixties, when
  <em>

  </em>
  was written and edited, his description of this event is much more authentic and impressive than later i
