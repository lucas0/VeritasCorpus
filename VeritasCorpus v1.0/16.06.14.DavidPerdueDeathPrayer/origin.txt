<blockquote>
 <p>
  At a major event for conservative Christians this morning, a Republican senator joked about praying for President Obama’s “days to be short.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Sen. David Perdue, a freshman senator from Georgia, opened his remarks at the Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition’s Road to Majority conference by encouraging attendees to pray for President Obama. But, he added in a joking tone, they need to pray for him in a very specific way: “We should pray for him like Psalms 109:8 says: Let his days be few, and let another have his office,” the senator said, smiling wryly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The crowd chuckled and he moved on with his address.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rest of that passage, which Perdue did not recite, reads, “May his children be fatherless and his wife a widow. May his children be wandering beggars; may they be driven from their ruined homes.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The psalm is a pointed, lengthy death wish for one of David’s enemies.
