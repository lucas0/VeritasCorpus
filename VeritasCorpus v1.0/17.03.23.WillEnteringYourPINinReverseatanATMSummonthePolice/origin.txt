  I just found out that should you ever be forced to withdraw monies from an ATM machine, you can notify the police by entering your Pin # in reverse. The machine will still give you the monies you requested, but unknown to the robber, etc, the police will be immediately dispatched to help you.
 </p>
 <p>
  The broadcast stated that this method of calling the police is very seldom used because people don’t know it exist, and it might mean the difference between life and death. Hopefully, none of you will have to use this, but I wanted to pass it along just in case you hadn’t heard of it. Please pass it along to everyone
  <br>
   possible.

  PIN NUMBER REVERSAL
 </p>
 <p>
  If you should ever be forced by a robber to withdraw money from an ATM machine, you can notify the police by entering your PIN # in reverse.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example if your pin number is 1234 then you would put in 4321.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ATM recognizes that your pin number is backwards from the ATM card you placed in the machine
 </p>
 <p>
  The machine will still give you the money you requested, but unknown to the robber, the police will be immediately dispatched to help you.
 </p>
 <p>
  This information was recently broadcast on CTV and it states that it is seldom used because people don’t know it exists.
 </p>
 <p>
  I checked with my Bank of Nova Scotia to see if this was correct and staff said yes this information is correct.
 </p>
 <p>
  Please pass this along to everyone possible.

  WHEN A THIEF FORCES YOU TO TAKE MONEY FROM THE ATM, DO NOT ARGUE OR RESIST, YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW WHAT HE OR SHE MIGHT DO TO YOU. WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IS TO PUNCH YOUR PIN IN THE REVERSE, I..E IF YOUR PIN IS 1254, YOU PUNCH 4521.
 </p>
 <p>
  THE MOMENT YOU PUNCH IN THE REVERSE, THE MONEY WILL COME OUT BUT WILL BE STUCK INTO THE MACHINE HALF WAY OUT AND IT WILL ALERT THE POLICE WITHOUT THE NOTICE OF THE THIEF. EVERY ATM HAS IT; IT IS SPECIALLY MADE TO SIGNIFY DANGER AND HELP. NOT EVERYONE IS AWARE OF THIS.
 </p>
 <p>
  FORWARD THIS TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS AND THOSE YOU CARE
