  Frozen Dairy Dessert products are made with many of the same high-quality ingredients that are commonly found in Ice Cream – like fresh milk, cream and sugar – and offer a great taste and even smoother texture. According to the FDA, in order for a product to be labeled ice cream, it needs to meet two key requirements:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Not less than 10% dairy fat
  </li>
  <li>
   A percentage of overrun that results in a finished product weighing more than 4.5 pounds per gallon
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Anything that does not meet both of those requirements is not considered ice cream.
