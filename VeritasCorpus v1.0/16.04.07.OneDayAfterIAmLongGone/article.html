  In April 2016, a quote of indeterminate age and origin attributed to John F. Kennedy was circulated on social media, words in which the former president prophetically warned that someday after he was “long gone, we would remember him” and realize “we should have stopped the nuclear program of Israel, abolished the Federal Reserve and kicked all secret societies, occultists, usurpers and Zionists out of our wonderful country”:

  (The quote wasn’t new to April 2016, as readers had asked us about it as far back as

  President John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1963, remains a revered figure to many with whom these words would resonate; but the notion of such an aptly appealing, contemporary commentary’s having been lost to the annals of history is a hard sell with respect to plausibility. Kennedy’s words have been cataloged and studied by countless historians and academics; such a seemingly-prophetic quote about Israel, the Federal Reserve, “Zionists,” and other issues still relevant half a century after his death would surely have piqued the interest of historians and history aficionados long before now. Yet there appears to be no record of anyone’s having attributed this statement to JFK until around 2012 or so.

 <p>
  The predictive nature of the quote is another telling aspect of its unlikelihood. John F. Kennedy was shot and killed in Dallas on 22 November 1963; and the manner in which he died was sudden, violent, and unexpected. A old man near the end of his life or a younger man slowly dying of an untreatable disease might issue a maudlin “when I’m gone” statement; but the youngest U.S. president ever elected, who was still in the White House when he died, wasn’t a prime candidate for making eerie “one day when I’m gone” prophecies.

   In regards to the Federal Reserve (of which Kennedy spoke more frequently), he made no mention of abolishing that body. As late as April 1962 he penned a

   The Kennedy record includes no mention of “occultists” or “usurpers” by him at all.
