 <p>
  For the first time since his own presidency, George H.W. Bush is planning to stay silent in the race for the Oval Office — and the younger former president Bush plans to stay silent as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bush 41, who enthusiastically endorsed every Republican nominee for the past five election cycles, will stay out of the campaign process this time. He does not have plans to endorse presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump, spokesman Jim McGrath [said].
 </p>
 <p>
  “At age 91, President Bush is retired from politics,” McGrath wrote in an email. “He came out of retirement to do a few things for Jeb [Bush], but those were the exceptions that proved the rule.” His son Jeb Bush dropped out of the GOP presidential race in February [2016].
 </p>
 <p>
  Bush 43, meanwhile, “does not plan to participate in or comment on the presidential campaign,” according to his personal aide, Freddy Ford.
