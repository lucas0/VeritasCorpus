  celebrity astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson for (among other things) rudely admonishing a 12-year-old girl who expressed a desire to “live on Jupiter”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   I’ve listened to Neil deGrasse Tyson before. And what I observe is a smart guy who consistently enjoys asserting his intellectual supremacy over others more than he actually likes educating. In one of his worse moments, Tyson mocked a 12-year-old girl who suggested she’d like to live on Jupiter. He ridiculed her in the midst of a crowd, then later, several times, on Twitter. That told me everything I needed to know about Neil deGrasse Tyson.
  </p>
  <p>
   For that moment he was just a horse’s astrophysicist.

  Although Larson didn’t provide a link to the purported dressing down administered by Tyson, it wasn’t difficult to locate the source of his claim — a 1 December 2015 item published by the satirical web site

  a purported interaction between an 8-year-old girl and Tyson:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Get ready for the most incredible science win ever, delivered by none other than Neil deGrasse Tyson. He’s pretty much the king when it comes to shutting down people who peddle bad science, but this most recent case completely takes the cake: When an 8-year-old told the badass astrophysicist that she wanted to live on Jupiter, he completely shut her down using science.
  </p>
  <p>
   Amazing! How many times can Neil deGrasse Tyson win the internet?
  </p>
  <p>
   The epic science burn happened toward the end of one of Neil’s lectures at the Hayden Planetarium in New York last weekend. Third-grader Liza Collins was attending the lecture with her parents, and during the Q&amp;A session, she raised her hand and told Neil that she wanted to live on Jupiter. But Neil wasn’t about to let her—and her bunk science—off the hook.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Hold on, you want to live where?” Tyson said. “On a planet made entirely of unbreathable gases? One that doesn’t even have a rocky surface you could stand on? A planet that would take you six years to even get to? That’s where you want to live? Because that’s Jupiter. Enjoy your great new home!”
  </p>
  <p>
   And of course, Neil didn’t let it end there. After the event, the Cosmos host took to Twitter to really show Liza what’s what.
