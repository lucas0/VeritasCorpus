  On 23 January 2016, presidential candidate Donald Trump caused controversy when he stated the following during a campaign rally in Iowa:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose voters.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The comment was part of a larger point Trump was making about the loyalty of his voting base, a comment that appears in context in the video embedded below at approximately the 0:22 mark:

  Although the excerpted remark was widely reproduced in an accurate fashion, the broader context of Trump’s comments was generally absent in news and social media reports. On 23 January 2016,
  <em>
   Mother Jones
  </em>
  published an
  <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/contributor/2016/01/shorter-donald-trump-haha-my-supporters-are-so-stupid" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  that consisted of a looping Vine clip of the singular remark, along with the following text:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and wouldn’t lose any voters, ok? It’s, like, incredible.” — Donald Trump, who is currently the frontrunner for the Republican nomination for president,

    insulting the intelligence of his own supporters.
   </a>
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  A longer version of the clip was available by clicking the provided link, but the Vine version elided the larger context of Trump’s comments. Gawker filed a
  <a href="http://gawker.com/donald-trump-floats-new-campaign-strategy-murder-peopl-1754733944" target="_blank">
   post
  </a>
  on the issue that reported:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Nothing can stop Donald Trump, according to Donald Trump — not even cold-blooded murder.
  </p>
  <p>
   In an effort to demonstrate how dedicated his supporters are, Trump
   <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-says-he-could-shoot-somebody-still-maintain-support-n502911" target="_blank">
    said at a rally at Dordt College in Iowa on Friday
   </a>
   that even if he were to shoot someone, his voters would still support him[.]
