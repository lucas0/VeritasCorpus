  On 18 April 2016, the “gasoline society” web site
  <em>
   Iron Demons
  </em>
  published an article reporting that Paul Teutul, Sr., star of the popular
  <em>
   American Chopper
  </em>
  motorcycle-themed reality TV series,  had been killed in a motorcycle crash in Louisiana:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Louisiana State Police say 68-year-old Paul Teutul was killed, April 18, 2016, when his motorcycle was struck by an SUV in Greta. The crash involved five vehicles. A second motorcyclist, Mark Duffy, was also injured and was in critical condition Monday.

   A 68-year-old Paul Teutul was killed today (April 18) when a driver ignored a red light and caused a five-vehicle crash in Gretna, Louisiana State Police said. A second motorcyclist involved in the crash was in critical condition.
  </p>
  <p>
   The second motorcyclist, Mark Duffy, 56, of Gretna, was also ejected when his 2006 Harley Davidson struck Liccardi’s QX80 on the driver’s side rear door during the crash. Duffy was being treated at University Medical Center, police said. Harmon was also taken there but pronounced dead upon arriving at the hospital.
