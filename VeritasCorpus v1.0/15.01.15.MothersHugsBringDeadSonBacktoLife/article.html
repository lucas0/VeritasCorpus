  On 25 March 2010, Australian mother Kate Ogg gave birth to twins Jamie and Emily just
  <nobr>
   27 weeks
  </nobr>
  into her pregnancy. Although Emily survived the birthing process, Jamie was born in distress and was not breathing.  After doctors spent
  <nobr>
   20 minutes
  </nobr>
  trying to resuscitate Jamie and failed, they told Kate and her husband David that Jamie had died, and nurses placed Jamie’s unmoving body onto his mother’s chest so she could say her goodbyes.  But then the couple experienced a seeming miracle.
 </p>
 <p>
  As Kate and David thought they were extending a farewell to their deceased child, a remarkable thing occurred: after about five minutes or so, Jamie began moving, and his movements became more and more pronounced.  Nonetheless, the doctor present at the scene informed the parents such movements were simply  reflex actions and were not indicative of life.
 </p>
 <p>
  So Kate and David steeled themselves to spending an extra minute or two with the child they believed they would never know for more than just those few moments: “I wanted to meet him and to hold him and for him to know us,” Kate said. “If he was on his way out of the world, we wanted for him to know who his parents were and to know that we loved him before he died. We’d resigned ourselves to the fact we were going to lose him; we were just trying to make the most of those last precious moments.”
 </p>
 <p>
  That “extra minute or two” ended up stretching out to more than two hours. And then something even more remarkable than Jamie’s previous movements took place: the supposedly dead child opened his eyes.  “We thought, ‘What a blessing, we get to see his eyes before he passes away,'” Kate said. “But they stayed open!”
 </p>
 <p>
  As most of us probably would, at that point the couple began to considered the possibility their child wasn’t dead at all. “I think half of us said [then], ‘What if he actually makes it?'” David said. “If he does, this would just be a miracle. The other half was saying, ‘No, he’s been declared dead, this is purely instinct.'”
 </p>
 <p>
  As noted in news accounts, David and Kate were practicing what Australians call “kangaroo care”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Actually, it is widely practiced throughout the world, especially in poorer countries where incubators may not be available for premature babies. An infant is held skin-to-skin to their mother or father, generating heat for the newborn much like a baby kangaroo receives in its mother’s pouch.
  </p>
  <p>
   Kate had heard of kangaroo care before. “[The baby] comes out of you, and all of a sudden there isn’t the warmth or smell of the mother or the sound of their heartbeat. And so putting him back on my chest was as close to him being inside me where he was safe.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Jamie continued to come around as he lay across Kate’s chest. He began grabbing at his mother’s finger, as well as his father’s. And when Kate put a dab of breast milk on her finger, Jamie eagerly accepted it.
