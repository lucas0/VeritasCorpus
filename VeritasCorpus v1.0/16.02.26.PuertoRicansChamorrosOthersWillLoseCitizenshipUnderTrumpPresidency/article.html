  On 3 September 2015, the Adobo Chronicles web site published an article reporting that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump had promised to revoke the U.S. citizenship of all Puerto Ricans if he won the presidency:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, while speaking to a group of investment bankers and hedge fund owners in New York City, allegedly declared that if elected, he will revoke the U.S. citizenship of all Puerto Ricans because they are “not part of the American race.”
  </p>
  <p>
   While Trump mentioned only Puerto Rico, his campaign told reporters that he meant to say all citizens from the territories of the U.S., including Guam, American Samoa, U.S. Virgin Islands and Northern Mariana Islands.
  </p>
  <p>
   “We don’t really need these non-Americans and I don’t need their votes to win the presidency,” Trump said.
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  There was no truth to this story, which originated with Adobo Chronicles, a fake news web site.  The article didn’t garner much attention when it was originally published, but the story was eventually picked up by

  While these web sites cited a “South American newspaper,” all of the information they reported originated on The Adobo Chronicles, a site whose disclaimer notes that its content is not meant to be taken seriously:

 <blockquote>
