  The threat of imminent collapse of the Oroville Dam emergency spillway eased Sunday night, hours after authorities ordered the evacuation of more than 180,000 downstream residents upon discovering damage to the structure.

 <p>
  But there is still serious concern about the condition of the auxiliary spillway, and it’s unclear when residents will be able to return to their homes.

  With a storm expected to arrive Wednesday, the state Department of Water Resources needs to make room for the water that will be flowing in. The agency aims to drain about 1.2 million acre feet of water from the reservoir over the next day or so. The capacity of the reservoir, California’s second-largest, is about 35 million feet.

  Gov. Jerry Brown declared an emergency to beef up the state’s response to the evacuations and dam threat.
