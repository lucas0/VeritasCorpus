  On 23 April 2016, the web site
  <em>
   US Chronicle
  </em>
  <a href="http://archive.is/RYpIR" target="_blank">
   reported
  </a>
  that a menu from a private Bernie Sanders flight to Rome revealed hypocritically luxurious fare on a presumably swanky voyage:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   One thing that Socialist Bernie Sanders will tell you, ad nauseum, is that the rich have too much. They live like kings, and don’t spread that wealth to the masses of people who work for them. He will point to fast food workers, who put lettuce and pickles on burgers all day, and say that it’s not right that a person has to work forty hours per week still can’t make ends meet.
  </p>
  <p>
   A menu has been obtained by New York Times best selling author, Conservative commentator, and former Secret Service Agent Dan Bongino, in which only the humblest of food choices were offered to ‘average Joe’ candidate, Bernie Sanders.

  Delta’s charter flight program is used by large groups traveling together as a more economical alternative to multiple separate ticket purchases. Companies and organizations that arrange charter flights not only receive customized, branded menus, but also are presented with a catalog of options that come standard with each flight chartered. Among those choices are several catering options.
 </p>
 <p>
  The items seen in the above photographs are offered by Delta as part of their in-flight menu, not requested by Sanders or his staff specifically. The selections are closely in line with
