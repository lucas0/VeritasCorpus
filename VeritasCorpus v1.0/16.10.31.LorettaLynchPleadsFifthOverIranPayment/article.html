  In October 2016 the conspiracy-mongering site InfoWars was one of several outlets

   claiming
  </a>
  that Attorney General Loretta Lynch “[took]” or “[pled]” the Fifth (Amendment) to avoid testifying with respect to the Obama administration’s controversial

   transfer
  </a>
  of money to Iran in settlement of a long-standing Hague Tribunal claim:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Attorney General Loretta Lynch has plead the fifth to avoid incrimination in the illegal transfer of billions of dollars in cash to Iran.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lynch was first approached by Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Mike Pompeo and asked numerous questions about details on the cash payment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik responded for Lynch on October 24 and told lawmakers that not only would Lynch refuse to answer but that they would not be allowed to publicly disclose any information on the payment to Iran.
  </p>
  <p>
   “It is frankly unacceptable that your department refuses to answer straightforward questions from the people’s elected representatives in Congress about an important national security issue,” the lawmakers wrote in response. “Your staff failed to address any of our questions, and instead provided a copy of public testimony and a lecture about the sensitivity of information associated with this issue.”

InfoWars cited a 28 October 2016 <em>Free Beacon</em> <a href="http://freebeacon.com/national-security/attorney-general-lynch-pleads-fifth-secret-iran-ransom-payments/" target="_blank">item</a> which held:


<blockquote>Attorney General Loretta Lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of Congress about the Obama administration’s secret efforts to send Iran $1.7 billion in cash earlier this year, prompting accusations that Lynch has “pleaded the Fifth” Amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments, according to lawmakers and communications exclusively obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.</blockquote>

  ] was sent from Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik in response to queries issued by Rep. Mike Pompeo and Sen. Marco Rubio about the January 2016 transfer of money to Iran.  In his reply, Kadzik essentially said the Department of Justice would not be providing any more information on the matter beyond what had already been offered in documents and hearings:
