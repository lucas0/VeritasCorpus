  So, my dear friends nephew goes to Peotone high school. They had an assembly and were told that the American flag will not be tolerated in any way shape or form, as it will offend others. He has an American flag on his vehicle and was suspended! This is such bullshit! Our rights as American citizens are being stripped before our eyes! People we need to stand up to this bullshit! This is outright insanity! Jer and I plan on driving around the school with our flag flying high in support of all who are being suppressed! Anyone who wants to join us is welcome!
