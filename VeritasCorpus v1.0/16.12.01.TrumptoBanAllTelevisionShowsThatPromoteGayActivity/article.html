  On 1 December 2016, a hoax news article claiming that Donald Trump had promised to ban all “gay activity” from appearing on television shows (starting with the Fox show
  <em>
   Empire
  </em>
  , for some reason)
  <em>
  </em>
  was published by several disreputable web sites:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “These shows that all appeared during the Obama administration will be banned from TV. We can’t have the rest of the world looking at America like we’re a bunch a F*gs,” said Donald Trump during an interview on
   <em>
    Fox News
   </em>
   about his plans to ban all TV shows that promote gayness.
  </p>
  <p>
   He will reportedly start with the Gayest show ever put on network television ‘Empire’.
  </p>
  <p>
   Trump rolled out a 2 year plan to remove all shows that have too much gay activity and will imposed stiff penalties including hefty fines for any cable network that breaks the rules.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  There is no truth to this story, as Trump did not make this comment in an interview with
  <em>
   Fox News
  </em>
  or in any other medium. We also found no record of Fox or any other network airing shows featuring gay characters commenting on this purported plan, because it does not exist.
