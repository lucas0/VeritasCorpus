  Anyone who has viewed Clint Eastwood’s infamous “

  ” monologue at the 2012 Republican National Convention likely has no illusions that the Academy Award-winning actor/director is a fan of President Barack Obama.  However, this circulated piece about the realizations of one’s “twilight years” which ends with a castigation of the current president is not a reproduction of anything Clint Eastwood said or wrote.

  Clint Eastwood did express some thoughts on pending mortality during a January 2011

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Eastwood is 80, with a good head of steel-grey hair and a tanned, lined face, but he still works like a man half his age. Although, he admits, thoughts of mortality are never far away these days. Indeed, his latest film as director, Hereafter, tackles head-on the subject of life after death.
  </p>
  <p>
   “You’re forced to think about death a lot at this age,” he says, “because you’ve lost a lot of people. Let’s put it this way, there wouldn’t be much point in me attending a high-school reunion now because there wouldn’t be anybody there. We’d struggle to raise a quorum. I picked up the paper the other day and another two were gone — people I’d grown up with.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Whether you like it or not, you’re forced to come to the realisation that death is out there. But I don’t fear death, I’m a fatalist. I believe when it’s your time, that’s it. It’s the hand you’re dealt. And I don’t feel any different to how I did when I was 60 or 70. I felt good then, and I feel good now.”
