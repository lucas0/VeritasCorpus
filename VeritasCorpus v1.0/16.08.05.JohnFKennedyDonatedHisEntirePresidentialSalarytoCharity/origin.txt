  President Kennedy’s entire salary is going to charity, duplicating a procedure followed three decades ago by President Herbert Hoover, the Minneapolis Tribune and Des Moines Register say.
 </p>
 <p>
  Six charities benefited from the $94,583.32 the President received in 1961, the story said. Fletcher Knebel of the newspapers’ Washington bureau reported that all of the $100,000 Kennedy will receive this year will go to charity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Knebel said that the $50,000 annual expense allowance Kennedy receives is used for public entertaining he must do as President. Actually, the reporter added, not much of the $50,000 probably is used because it is taxable and the president already is in a very high bracket. Private entertaining is financed out of Kennedy’s pocket.
