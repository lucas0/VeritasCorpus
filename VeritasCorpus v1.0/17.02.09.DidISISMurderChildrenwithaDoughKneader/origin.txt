  A distraught mother has relived the horrors of the brutal rule of ISIS and revealed how the extremist group would ‘knead children to death in bakery machines’.
 </p>
 <p>
  Alice Assaf said her son was killed ‘because he was called George’ and refused to identify himself by a Muslim name.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ms Assaf claims ISIS slaughtered Christians in Syria, kneading children to death in bread machines and ‘baking men in ovens’.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ms Assaf said during the massacre she and her son had sought refuge in the home of a Muslim neighbour, who betrayed them … ‘Later on, we heard that the militants grabbed six strong men working at the bakery and burned them inside the oven,’ she said.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘After that, they caught some 250 kids and kneaded them like dough in the bakery dough machine.’
