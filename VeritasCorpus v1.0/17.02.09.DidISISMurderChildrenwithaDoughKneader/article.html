  In late October 2016 a number of tabloids and bloggers published a
  <a href="http://archive.is/gtybv" target="_blank">
   tale
  </a>
  that was as harrowing as it was improbable and thinly-sourced, asserting that ISIS operatives had murdered 250 children (largely toddlers) by placing them into a dough kneader:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   A distraught mother has relived the horrors of the brutal rule of ISIS and revealed how the extremist group would ‘knead children to death in bakery machines’.
  </p>
  <p>
   Alice Assaf said her son was killed ‘because he was called George’ and refused to identify himself by a Muslim name.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ms Assaf claims ISIS slaughtered Christians in Syria, kneading children to death in bread machines and ‘baking men in ovens’.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ms Assaf said during the massacre she and her son had sought refuge in the home of a Muslim neighbour, who betrayed them … ‘Later on, we heard that the militants grabbed six strong men working at the bakery and burned them inside the oven,’ she said.
  </p>
  <p>
   ‘After that, they caught some 250 kids and kneaded them like dough in the bakery dough machine.’
