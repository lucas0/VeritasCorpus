  On a recent trip to the southwest U.S. I saw on several different news programs a rather strange story.
 </p>
 <p>
  Apparently in the movie “Three Men and a Baby” there is one scene that revealed what appeared to be a young boy standing between curtains in a room.  The scene had Ted Danson speaking to a woman I believe.
 </p>
 <p>
  All the news programs I watched, froze the clip and zoomed in on the boy.  It was very clear and well defined.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was only noticed after the film was distributed for home viewing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The facts are, a young boy died in the house in which the movie was filmed.  Some people think it was his spirit.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t know if this was a ploy to increase rentals of the tape or not.  But what the news programs did show was just a bit too eerie for me.
