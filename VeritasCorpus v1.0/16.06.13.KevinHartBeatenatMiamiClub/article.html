  A photograph purportedly showing Kevin Hart with a black eye and a fat lip has been circulating online since at least 2013, with a variety of backstories attached to it. In May 2016, for example, the web site
  <em>
   That Viral Feed
  </em>
  used the image as the focus of an article reporting that the actor had been mugged outside of a Miami nightclub:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Well Known comedian Kevin Hart Robbed Outside Miami Night Club Tuesday Night.
  </p>
  <p>
   Witness told police that Kevin was drunk and cracking jokes and ended up getting into a altercation with a group of guys at the night club he attended.
  </p>
  <p>
   After they beat him they took his jordans and his wallet also a $5,000 Rolex. The police are still looking for the suspects.

  The image has also been tied to fictitious mugging incidents in

  In fact, Hart posted this
