  An image purportedly showing Vice President Joe Biden groping a woman’s breast during an official government ceremony was recirculated on social media in October 2017, after

  This image has been manipulated. It uses a photograph that former White House reporter Nedra Pickler took in February 2015 during the swearing-in of Defense Secretary Ash Carter. The original image showed Biden with his hands on Stephanie Carter’s shoulders:

  The manipulated image originally appeared on
  <a href="https://archive.is/qpmkE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   World News Bureau
  </a>
  , a “satire” web site that carries the following disclaimer:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   This is fictitious satire and any resemblance to persons, places, or events is coincidental.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The original image, showing Biden’s hands on Carter’s shoulders, stirred a good deal of controversy in 2015. Several outlets criticized Biden for getting a little too close to Carter during the ceremony.

   NBC News
  </a>
  <em>
  </em>
  even asked if Biden was a “Veep Creep” due to the incident:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Veep Creep? Biden’s Odd Move at Carter Ceremony
  </p>
  <p>
   Vice President Joe Biden was swearing in new Defense Secretary Ash Carter when he got up close and personal with the wife of the man who now runs the most powerful military in the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   As Carter began speaking in the Roosevelt Room, Biden beckoned Stephanie Carter from across the room, then put both hands on her shoulders as her husband thanked Biden for presiding over the ceremony. Biden’s hands lingered for roughly 20 seconds until he leaned in and whispered in her ear.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  You can glimpse the moment in the following video. Biden places his hand on Carter’s shoulders around the 12:30 mark:

  Ash Carter later said that he

   laughed
  </a>
  about the incident and said that he and Stephanie were great friends with the Bidens:
  <em>

 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “Oh, I laughed. I laughed. I laughed. They know each other extremely well, and we’re great friends with the Bidens,” he said in an

    interview
   </a>
   aired Tuesday with NBC’s Savannah Guthrie on the “Today” show. Carter was traveling to his high school alma mater for a speech on the future of the armed forces.
  </p>
  <p>
   Carter’s wife later said she was not offended by the vice president putting his hands on her shoulders and whispering in her ear, but Biden’s actions drew close scrutiny on social media and late-night talk shows.

  Another photoshopped picture purportedly showing Biden groping a woman has also circulated on social media. In November 2017,

  Again, this fake photograph was created by the satire web site WorldNewsBureau.com, and it was originally
  <em>
  </em>
  <a href="https://archive.is/0n5KQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   published
  </a>
  in December 2013. In addition to digitally altering the position of Biden’s hands, World News Bureau
  <em>
  </em>
  also photoshopped a bottle of liquor into Biden’s pocket.
 </p>
 <p>
  The original image, which shows Jill Biden, NBC producer Chris Donovan, and Vice President Joe Biden with his arms around White House reporter Amie Parnes at a Christmas party at the White House, was also circulated in
  <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2013/12/16/vice-president-joe-biden-gropes-white-house-reporter/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   articles
  </a>
  criticizing Biden for improper behavior.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here’s a comparison of the real photograph (left), which was reportedly taken from Parnes’ Facebook page, and the doctored image (right):
