  The United Nations has a track record of protecting minority populations. There was tribal warfare between the Tutsis and the Hutus in Africa, and they deployed peacekeeping troops there to help save those populations and reduce the bloodshed. We have to do something â€” black people in Chicago make up 30 percent of the population but 80 percent of those who are killed by gun violence.
