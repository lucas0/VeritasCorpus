  This image does not show the death of a young Palestinian boy; rather, it is a still frame taken from the 2012 film
  <em>
   Mamlakat al-
  </em>
  Naml (
  <em>
   Kingdom of Ants)
  </em>
  . The scene depicted in the image can be glimpsed at the 3:34 mark of the movie’s trailer:

  <em>

  was
  <a href="http://medisnetwork.net/index.php/en/news/126" target="_blank">
   directed
  </a>
  by Chawki Mejri and was first released in Tunisia in March 2012:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Palestinians have deep-rooted traditions. Although they have not yet been able to beat their oppressors, they have not yet learned the philosophy of defeat. Their enemy saw this in them and director Chawki al-Mejri wanted to show it to the entire world.
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    Mamlakat al-Naml
   </em>
   (The Kingdom of Ants), coming soon to Lebanese theaters, is a poetic portrayal of Palestine in cinema.
  </p>
  <p>
   The film does not document the Palestinian struggle. Rather, it weaves legends that touch the heart and not the mind.
