  In February 2016, the entertainment web site
  <em>
   Nevada County Scooper
  </em>
  <a href="http://www.ncscooper.com/metallicas-james-hetfield-celebrates-a-phd-in-astrophysics/" target="_blank">
   reported
  </a>
  that Metallica singer James Hetfield had earned a PhD in astrophysics:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Metallica’s lead singer and heavy metal guitarist James Hetfield just put us all to shame by getting a PhD in astrophysics. Oh, and by the way, that’s
   <em>
    Dr Hetfield
   </em>
   to you.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hetfield recently finished defending his PhD dissertation at CalTech and made the announcement on Facebook. Apparently, the guy had been attending university on and off for the past 12 years!
  </p>
  <p>
   “I like playing music because it’s a good living and I get satisfaction from it. But I can’t feed my family with satisfaction,” said Dr Hetfield. “So I figured if Brian May could do it, so could I. Which is why I did this other gig. Turns out, I was pretty good at it.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  While the article didn’t gain much traction when it was first published, the  hoax was eventually picked up by legitimate publications, such as culture web site
  <em>
   <a href="http://www.lostateminor.com/2016/08/22/metallicas-james-hetfield-now-has-a-phd-in-astrophysics/" target="_blank">
    Lost at E Minor
   </a>
   ,
  </em>
  and shared as real news:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>

   <em>
    Dr Hetfield
   </em>
   to you.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  However, there is no truth to this rumor. Metallica’s James Hetfield has not earned his PhD in astrophysics. The
  <em>
   Nevada County Scooper
  </em>
  is a
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2016/01/14/fake-news-sites/" target="_blank">
   well-known
  </a>
  satire web site that has previously published high-profile hoax stories, such as a report that
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/false-merle-haggard-estate-lgbt/" target="_blank">
   Merle Haggard
  </a>
  had left his estate to an LBGT group, that White Stripes’ drummer
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/meg-white-drummer-rush/" target="_blank">
   Meg White
  </a>
  was joining the band Rush, and that Sen. Bernie Sanders called for “

   chemtrail reform
  </a>
  .”
 </p>
 <p>
  This isn’t the first time that James Hetfield has been the subject of a hoax news story this year. In March 2016, a
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/metallica-james-hatfield-country/" target="_blank">
   rumor
  </a>
  circulated that the Metallica singer had released a country album.  (The rumor was false.)
 </p>
 <p>
  This article would be remiss not to mention Brian May, perhaps best known as the guitarist for rock band
