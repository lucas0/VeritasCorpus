  The hotly contested June 2017 runoff election in Georgia’s 6th congressional district has drawn much coverage and discussion in the weeks leading up to election night.

   , at least in my view. But I don’t have a vote in Congress and Republicans do, and they’ve tallied the costs and benefits differently, given that the bill has already passed the House and is very much

  Even President Donald Trump joined the discussion, using his Twitter account to once again criticize Democratic Party candidate Jon Ossoff. On the day of the vote, Trump

  Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel are vying for the seat vacated by Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and qualified for the runoff after none of the 18 candidates in a separate election on 18 April 2017 failed to win more than 50 percent of the vote. Trump first appeared to question Ossoff’s legitimacy on the day of that election, when he

  While the president’s allegation about Ossoff’s residency is true, the 30-year-old documentarian has not hidden that fact. He

   I grew up in this district. I grew up in this community. No one knew there was going to be an election coming. I have been living with Alicia — my girlfriend of 12 years — down by Emory University where she is a full time medical student. As soon as she concludes her medical training I will be back into the district where I grew up, but I want to support her and her career and do right by her.

  Ossoff said he lives “a mile and a half down the street” from the district. For her part, Handel has lived in the area for the past 25 years.  Unlike other states, though, Georgia does not have a law mandating that congressional candidates live in the district they seek to represent. Ossoff’s residency does comply with the
  <a href="http://history.house.gov/Institution/Origins-Development/Constitutional-Qualifications/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">

  requirement that Congressional candidates live in the state in which they are running.

 <p>
  While Trump has also accused Ossoff of wanting to raise taxes, however, Ossoff has
