  <em>
   World News Daily Report
  </em>
  published an article positing that the Cuban Coast Guard had intercepted the SS
  <em>
   Cotopaxi
  </em>
  , a ship that disappeared in the area known as the ‘Bermuda Triangle’ while en route to Havana in 1925:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The Cuban Coast Guard announced this morning, that they had intercepted an unmanned ship heading for the island, which is presumed to be the SS Cotopaxi, a tramp steamer which vanished in December 1925 and has since been connected to the legend of the Bermuda Triangle.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Cuban authorities spotted the ship for the first time on May 16, near a restricted military zone, west of Havana. They made many unsuccessful attempts to communicate with the crew, and finally mobilized three patrol boats to intercept it.
  </p>
  <p>
   “It is very important for us to understand what happened … Such incidents could be really bad for our economy, so  want to make sure that this kind of disappearance doesn’t happen again. The time has come to solve the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle, once and for all.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  While the article’s claim was compelling, the SS
  <em>
   Cotopaxi
  </em>
  remains lost at sea.
