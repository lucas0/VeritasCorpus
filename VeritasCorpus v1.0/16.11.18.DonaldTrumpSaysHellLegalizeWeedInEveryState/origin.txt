  If you are looking for the presidential candidate most likely to ensure marijuana will be legalized across the country, Donald Trump is your man.

 <p>
  Trump is on record claiming US ‘drug enforcement is a joke’ and drugs should be legalized to ‘take the profit away from these drug czars.’
 </p>
 <p>
  According to Trump, tax revenues from the legalized drug trade will be used to educate the public about the dangers of drugs.
