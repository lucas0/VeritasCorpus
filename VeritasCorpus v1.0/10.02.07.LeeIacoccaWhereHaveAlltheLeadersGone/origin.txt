  These are times that cry out for leadership and we are getting ready to put the most Liberal Senator in the U. S. Senate in as our next President because we want to be fair and elect someone just because of his race. We don’t have time to be fair, we need a strong leader.

  It’s another thing to lead when your world comes tumbling down. George Bush, Dick Chaney and who it this Bozo coming up next? One of the most Liberal Idiots in the U.S. Senate and he is talking about disarming America. I can’t believe the American people are seeing what he is about to do to this country. May God have mercy on us all.
