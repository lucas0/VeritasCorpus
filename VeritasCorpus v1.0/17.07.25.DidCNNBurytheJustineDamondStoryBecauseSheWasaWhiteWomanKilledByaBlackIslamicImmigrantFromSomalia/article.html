  “Prepare to Take America Back” shared a meme that informed its fans that CNN and other major news media outlets “buried” the story of Justine Ruszczyk (who went by her fiance’s surname Damond), a white Australian woman who was shot and killed on 15 July 2017 by a Somali-American Minneapolis police officer:

  Damond, 40, died after calling 911 at about 11:30 P.M. to report what she believed to be a sexual assault happening in an alley near her home. Minneapolis police officers Matthew Harrity and Mohamed Noor responded to the call. According to a preliminary investigation by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, Harrity reported being startled by a loud noise as Damond approached the squad car. Noor opened fire through Harrity’s open window, striking her in the abdomen and killing her. A search warrant

  by Minnesota Public Radio revealed that a female had “slapped” the back of the squad car before Damond was killed, but it is unclear if she was the one who touched the vehicle.

   appropriated

  the term “fake news” to essentially mean organizations and stories that report narratives that they dislike.

  However it is easy to disprove the claim that the news media has buried the Damond story in an effort to suppress the fact that the police officer who shot her was an immigrant from Somalia. For example, a very simple Internet
