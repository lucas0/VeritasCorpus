  on 20 September 2016 kicked off protests in Charlotte, North Carolina, events that a clickbait fake news site shamelessly played upon to lure readers into generating advertising revenue for them.

  On 21 September 2016, the
  <em>
   Baltimore Gazette
  </em>
  — a purveyor of fake news, not a real news outlet — published an
  <a href="http://archive.is/0Lg7B/image" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  reporting that any “rioters” caught looting in Charlotte would permanently lose food stamps and all other government benefits:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   According to multiple reports, city officials have announced new measures in an effort to curb the violence sweeping Charlotte since the shooting of Keith Lamont Scott. Any individuals caught rioting, looting, destroying property or otherwise reacting in a violent and unlawful manner will have their government benefits permanently revoked.
  </p>
  <p>
   According to the local affiliate WBTC, the punishment also applies to minors who might be participating in the ongoing melee. Parents of underage individuals who are captured while engaging in criminal activities related to the rioting will be held fully accountable, and could risk losing state benefits, as well as the custody of their child.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Parents are responsible for their children. If they are allowing them to engage in lawless behaviors there will be consequences for them as parents.” Charlotte City Official, Wilson Stewart, told reporters during the 30 minute press conference. “Many of the individuals we have detained are high school students. We urge parents out there to know where their children are at all times until tensions are quelled. Have them adhere to the mandatory curfew. Make them aware that participation in looting, destruction of property, and violently demonstrating on any level will come with severe penalties.”
  </p>

   The announcement was made shortly after hundreds of national guardsmen and law enforcement officers took to the streets intent on restoring calm to the city. Whether or not the recent announcement had any impact on the chaos remains to be seen as the riots grind on into their tecond [sic] night.

  The false “rioters will lose food stamp and welfare benefits” rumor is a favorite for fake news sites to trot out during periods of protest and demonstrations:
