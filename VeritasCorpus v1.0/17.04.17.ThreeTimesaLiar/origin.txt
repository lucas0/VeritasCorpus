  The final key to the way I promote is bravado. I play to people’s fantasies. People may not always think big themselves, but they can still get very excited by those who do. That’s why a little hyperbole never hurts. People want to believe something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular.

  I call it truthful hyperbole. It’s an innocent form of exaggeration — and a very effective form of promotion.
