  While devoting ourselves to the ‘Noble’ pursuit of perfecting the flavor of Noble Hops we’ve been exploring Noble Gasses as well.

  Lightened from heavier gases like CO2, HeliYum takes advantages of the properties of helium — one of the noble gases — for a truly remarkable brew. Helium’s unique index of refraction creates brilliant clarity while providing an incredibly light mouth feel. Since Helium is an odorless gas, it doesn’t compete with the natural aromas of the ingredients. From a freshness perspective, helium doesn’t oxidize which allows for a much longer shelf life.
