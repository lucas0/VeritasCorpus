  A white, 11-year-old girl filed federal lawsuits Monday claiming she identifies as a 50-year-old Salish Indian chief and deserves all the entitlements and benefits of an esteemed tribal member.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bambie Buffy Remington, originally from Orange County, CA., said she started identifying as a middle-aged tribal chief after watching a rerun of the TV show F-Troop and felt great compassion for the Native Americans, known on the show as “Indians”
 </p>
 <p>
  “The Native Americans on the TV show were noble and outsmarted the military leaders who supported barbaric means of law enforcement,” said Bambie while wearing her eagle feather headdress. “I felt a great personal tie even though we have no common blood relatives but had the same Moon Mother.”
