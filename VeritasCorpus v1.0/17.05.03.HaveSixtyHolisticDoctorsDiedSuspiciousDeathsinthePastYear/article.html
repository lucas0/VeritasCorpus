  On 19 June 2015, a controversial doctor named Jeffrey Bradstreet was found dead in a river by a local fisherman from what the local sheriff’s office later determined was a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his chest. Bradstreet was an outspoken proponent of the discredited theory that vaccines cause autism, as well as a

  fears for the safety of partner, Joseph Mercola, a prominent holistic doctor with an extensive web site, have added a sense of urgency. Her posts, often devoid of details that provide any tangible link between events, almost invariably tie the deaths if not directly, then by not-at-all-subtle innuendo, to the conspiracy narrative created in the Bradstreet story.

 <blockquote>

   of Boca Roton, Fl. who died suddenly on Father’s Day, leaving behind a beautiful family. Sources tell me that he was found dead in his car; there had been no accident and it wasn’t running. He had exercised earlier at an event, but we don’t want to speculate as the authorities have yet to rule on his cause of death. […]
  </p>
  <p class="p3">
   Both Dr Hedendal and Dr. Bradstreet had dealt with run ins with the feds in the past. In fact, Dr. Bradstreet’s office was just raided by the FDA days before he died.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p class="p1">
  In this post, we critically and systematically examine each person that Elizabeth has included in her series to see if suggestions of linked causes or outright conspiracy hold up. In doing so, we demonstrate that Elizabeth’s series fails to a) coherently articulate the conspiracy, b) consistently utilize the same list of victims, or c) demonstrate any connection between the victims whatsoever.

  <b>
   What Is the Conspiracy?
  </b>
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  Elizabeth, who repeatedly stresses that she has no proof of a connection between any of these cases, generally suggests that there have been a large and underreported number of holistic doctors whose deaths were suspicious or unexplained. In its early iterations in the summer of 2015, the claims suggested a local Florida connection (Bradstreet had moved from Florida to Georgia), as she wrote in the 21 July 2015
  <a href="http://archive.is/5H3fq#selection-2269.0-2281.75" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

  </a>
  :
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   Yet another doctor was just found murdered inside his home here on the East Coast of Florida. This makes six doctors to be found dead in the last month, from this region of the country alone. Four out of the six were found dead here in Florida.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p class="p1">
  As the series progressed, however, the geographic and chronologic window widened, with later reports coming from numerous states across the U.S., Canada and Mexico, the Caribbean island of Grenada, and the United Kingdom. Chronologically, the series has expanded retroactively to include
  <a href="http://archive.is/Z4qAr#selection-1537.0-1547.17" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   <span class="s1">
    incidents
   </span>
  </a>
  that predate Bradstreet’s death, going back as early as the

   <span class="s1">
    summer of 2014
   </span>
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  Other aspects of the story that have been broadened with its telling and retelling are the defining characteristics of the alleged victims of the conspiracy. In some cases, the doctors that Elizabeth includes have no connection to holistic medicine whatsoever (despite her headlines), and in other cases the link to holistic medicine is extremely tenuous and based on observations such as liked Facebook pages, veganism, or an openness to preventive medicine.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  Elizabeth herself does not offer any suggestions or explications for motive, but strongly suggests the link lies within their alternative approach to medicine, as she does in her most recent
  <a href="http://archive.is/NJF46" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   <span class="s1">
    recap
   </span>
  </a>
  of the “series”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   Some of the biggest skeptics, those who rolled their eyes at the first few deaths, are now wondering if there isn’t a connection. There have been theories, from GcMAF to CBD oil, but I don’t think all doctors used both of these treatments. I’m not convinced either is the smoking gun, but might hold part of the answer.
  </p>
  <p class="p3">
   There are several unsolved murders here (and some alleged suicides, most still under investigation), and I sincerely hope they get to the bottom of this as again, we knew several of these amazing doctors personally.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p class="p1">
  The dubious (and unsubstantiated) shared connections of GcMAF and CBD oil — a non-psychoactive component of cannabis used primarily for pain management — among these doctors is about as close to a motive as you will find on Health Nut News. Still, it has been enough fodder for others to attach their own pet theories to—some conspiracy

   <span class="s1">
    peddlers
   </span>

  focus on GcMAF despite the fact that almost none of the other doctors were involved in it, while others tie the conspiracy more generally to the heavy-handed interference of the federal government.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  <b>
   Who Are the Victims?
  </b>
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  Elizabeth claims that “well over 60” victims, who are “mostly holistic” doctors have died suspiciously. She has not published a definitive list, but when she recaps the growing list of departed doctors, she posts a photo montage of the alleged victim’s faces.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  Without a clear tally from Elizabeth, we took it upon ourselves to generate a list of the doctors whose deaths she has said were suspicious. The task proved complex because many of her reports come with the caveat that they are “not part of the official series” but are nonetheless included in her photo montage. Elizabeth told us via email that this inconsistency stems from advice she got from a reporter:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   After talking to a seasoned reporter in NY, I decided he was correct I couldn’t pick and choose who to put into this ‘series’ so I included all of them and usually wrote about right after their deaths were announced.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p class="p1">
  Our list includes 61 doctors (provided for your own fact-checking pleasure on this
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KB_lYdZaSj1RXuLjJr2a6NBh5PwZutkpsn62k16s_1U/edit?usp=sharing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

  </a>
  ) and is derived from Elizabeth’s posts, reverse image searches of the collage of victims’ faces, and discussions with Elizabeth herself. 56 of the doctors on our list come from her collage (which includes two duplicate faces). Elizabeth sent us links to an additional five posts about deaths that she has not yet included in the photo montage.

  As we will show below, of these now 61 doctors, all but five can easily be excluded from any conspiracy attacking alternative medical practice.

   11 of the Remaining 16 Cases Cannot Plausibly Be Considered Suspicious
  </b>
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  In ten of the remaining cases, the cause of death is known and generally accepted. This includes the death of Alfredo “Dr. Sebi” Bowman, an alternative health guru and traditional healer who
  <a href="http://thesource.com/2016/08/08/dr-sebi-dies-in-police-custody-in-honduras/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   <span class="s1">

  where he was being held on money laundering charges. Bowman was an important figure in the alternative health world, but conditions in Honduran prisons are

    notoriously
   </span>
  </a>
  harsh, crowded, and unsanitary, making it unsurprising that an 82 year-old with pneumonia did not survive his detention there.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  Similarly, 56 year-old anesthesiologist and libertarian presidential candidate Mark Feldman, who was anti-vaccine, died in a motel where he was found by an unidentified woman. Authorities determined that his death was caused by a

    heart attack
   </span>
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  In other cases, Elizabeth barely makes an attempt to draw the deaths of these individuals into a larger narrative, as with chiropractor Armon Burt — the victim of a heart attack whose inclusion in the series stems from Elizabeth’s barely-articulated hunches that minor
  <a href="http://archive.is/QCrC3#selection-2289.0-2289.261" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   <span class="s1">
    details

  surrounding his death are strange:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   Dr. Armon Bert, who was reported missing by his family, was found in his car in the parking lot of a Kirkwood Lowes store (St Louis suburb), the “apparent’ victim of a heart attack (how do they clock his death at exactly 10:04 AM if they found him in the car?).
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p class="p1">
  The remaining cases here are those in which Elizabeth challenges the reader to prove a negative — that there is not evidence that it

  <b>
   Five Cases Involving ‘Holistic Doctors’ Remain
  </b>
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  After eliminating the above 55 doctors from the “official unintended series”, we are left with only five cases involving individuals who practiced some form of alternative medicine and whose death could arguably (though this is a stretch) look suspicious. This includes the death of Jeffrey Bradstreet (discussed earlier), the incident that spawned this whole “series” in the first place.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  Elizabeth includes another indisputably prominent figure in the alternative medicine scene, Mitchell Gaynor, in her series. As with Bradstreet, Gaynor’s death was ruled a suicide, which Elizabeth questions for spurious reasons. She
  <a href="http://archive.is/D212b#selection-2351.0-2369.314" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   <span class="s1">
    argues
   </span>
  </a>
  that Gaynor, who supplemented his traditional treatment with natural remedies, wouldn’t have committed suicide because he had recently beat the flu and survived a car accident:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   I’m confused because his close friend and patient (also a doctor) told me that they were told he had walked away from a car accident, but then days later he was found in the woods at his country home in Upstate New York.
  </p>
  <p class="p3">
   I’m also confused because posts on his personal Facebook page (which you might only be able to see if you are friends with him or have mutual friends) had colleagues saying that they were so sorry he missed the conference he was supposed to attend last weekend because allegedly he said he had the intestinal flu.
  </p>
  <p class="p3">
   So, let’s say the information we were given was true. Let’s say he survived a car accident (we don’t know the details yet) and walked away from it, then he gets the intestinal flu (apparently survives that too) and then kills himself (allegedly in the woods at his country home, according to a patient and friend)?
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p class="p1">
  We are unsure what these details have to do with his state of mind, but it should be noted that surviving both the flu and a car accident are not necessarily indicators of mental health.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  The other notable figure is Nick Gonzalez, an oncologist who practiced controversial and unproven alternative cancer treatments. Gonzalez died at age 67 of cardiac-related issues. His death sparked its own conspiracy theories and memes, as he once joked that pharmaceutical companies might target him for his work, as Vitality Magazine
  <a href="http://vitalitymagazine.com/article/alternative-medicine-takes-on-cancer-and-wins/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   <span class="s1">
    reported
   </span>
  </a>
  :
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="p3">
   The keynote speaker at this year’s Whole Life Expo is Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez of New York, one of a small number of doctors whose success in treating cancer exceeds that of mainstream oncology by a wide margin. His work thereby puts the lie to pharmaceutical propaganda that fuels a cancer industry bringing in hundreds of billions of dollars while fooling millions of desperate and bewildered patients. “I’ve been told drug companies know about my work but hope I get hit by a bus,” Dr. Gonzalez observes wryly.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p class="p1">
  The two remaining cases included here involve people who had connections to holistic medicine, but were far from national figures in the movement and could barely be considered primary targets for a hit job:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li class="p3">
   Curtis Clogston, a medical doctor (who had at one point wrote about acupuncture and whose body was
   <a href="http://www.kens5.com/news/local/bpd-body-found-near-car-accident/121622312" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

     found in his car
    </span>
   </a>
   near his house after having been missing for a

    <span class="s1">
     disputed
    </span>
   </a>
   amount of time)
  </li>
  <li class="p3">
   Alex Shvartsman, a holistic dentist (who also reportedly committed suicide, but whose death Elizabeth categorizes as suspicious because “
   <a href="http://archive.is/MlnZW#selection-1495.161-1498.2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
    <span class="s1">
     his patients
    </span>
   </a>
   are posting on my Facebook page (and sending emails) that they don’t believe it was suicide”
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p class="p1">
  These five cases, and perhaps even some suicides mentioned above, form a kind of Rorschach Test — if you are looking for evidence of a plot against alternative medical practitioners, you will likely be drawn to them.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  However, recognizing that nearly every story included in Elizabeth’s “unintended series” is demonstrably unrelated to each other means that any conspiracy made must be crafted from the deaths of three prominent doctors — plus two doctors who, despite having experience with alternative medicine, were not national figures or a plausible threat to any medical establishment.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  <b>
   A Collection of Unrelated Tragedies
  </b>
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  As we
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2015/07/21/five-holistic-doctors-dead/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   <span class="s1">
    reported
   </span>
  </a>
  in the earliest debunking of this conspiracy theory, around 700 doctors can be expected to die each year in the United States alone. These five deaths over the span of a year and a half, from a statistical standpoint, are not abnormal. Further, outside of vaguely defined philosophical beliefs, there is absolutely no connection between any of them.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  In fact, amongst the whole series, the only true defining similarity between all the cases described on Health Nut News is that Elizabeth promises to keep people updated on their developments if they join her email list.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  Because the claim of “over 60” dead doctors cannot be demonstrated even by Elizabeth herself, and because nearly all of the cases she uses can be easily excluded from a larger conspiracy, we rate the claim as false.
 </p>
 <p class="p1">
  There is no conspiracy afoot. Instead, there are simply 61 individual tragedies that have been inelegantly strung together by an alternative health website whose not-so-subtle innuendo has subsequently echoed through the darkest and most paranoid corners of the internet — and which has begun to leak into mainstream media outlets as well.
