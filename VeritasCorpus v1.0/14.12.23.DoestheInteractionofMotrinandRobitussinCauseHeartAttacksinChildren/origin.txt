 <p>
  Medicine interaction!
 </p>
 <p>
  Madison, age 8, passed away just a few days ago. We’ve been asked to pass this on. Doctors told her family that there have been quite a few children Madison’s age that have died recently the same way that she did. The only common link between them was that they were given Motrin (ibuprofen) and Robitussin together, this caused a heart attack.
 </p>
 <p>
  They believe this is what happened to them. They told her to alert everyone to this. Do not give children both of these medicines together. You can give them one or the other but not both.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Madison collapsed she suffered a heart attack and they were able to revive her but the loss of oxygen damaged her brain and she was put on the respirator.
 </p>
 <p>
  After this she had four strokes before she died after being taken off the respirator. Please pass this on.
