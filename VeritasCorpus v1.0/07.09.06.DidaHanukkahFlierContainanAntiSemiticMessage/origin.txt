 <p>
  A holiday shopping flier that’s been distributed to thousands of households in north Texas is creating controversy because a message of hate is included within an advertisement.
 </p>
 <p>
  An ad for “Party City” was supposed to highlight a sale on Hanukkah items, but it also contained a hateful anti-Semitic message.
 </p>
 <p>
  The advertisement includes the sentence “CC Hates the Jews” in large, bold letters.
