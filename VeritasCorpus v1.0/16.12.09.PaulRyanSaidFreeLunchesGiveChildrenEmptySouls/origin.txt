<blockquote>
 <p>
  Continuing his holy war against government assistance, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan declared during a conservative PAC speech that giving children free meals deprives them of something vital – their souls.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ryan was speaking before the Conservative Political Action Conference when he made his uneducated opinion on social welfare programs, specifically referring to free school lunches.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ryan claimed that free school lunches deny children their dignity, giving them “a full stomach – and an empty soul.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The Speaker shared a personal story he had heard second-hand of a small child who said he was embarrassed to accept the free school lunch because he wanted to be like the other children.
