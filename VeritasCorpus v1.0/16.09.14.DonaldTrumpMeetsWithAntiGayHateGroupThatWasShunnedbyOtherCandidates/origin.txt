  So let me say this right up front: A Trump administration, our Christian heritage will be cherished, protected, defended, like you’ve never seen before. Believe me. I believe it. And you believe it. And you know it. You know it. And that includes religious liberty – remember, remember. I recently had a chance to visit a church in Detroit, Great Faith Ministries International. Stand up if you’re member. That’s good. That was a great – that was an amazing experience. And the bishop, what a great guy.
