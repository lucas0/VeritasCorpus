  Thank you for doing your part to curb the urban legend about Arby’s Roast Beef. I’m sure I’m not the first to express frustration about this type of story.The answer to your question is no. Our product does not arrive as a paste, gel or liquid.

 <p>
  Arby’s Roast Beef consists entirely of Beef and a Self-Basting solution, which contains just enough water to keep the product juicy throughout our restaurants’ 3-hour roasting process and during slicing — this ensures that we will deliver the quality that our customers have come to expect from our famous roast beef sandwiches.
