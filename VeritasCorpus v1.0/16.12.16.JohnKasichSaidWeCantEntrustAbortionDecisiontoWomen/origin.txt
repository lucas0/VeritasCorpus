  Recently, Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich vetoed the so-called “heartbeat bill,” a measure that would have banned all abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, or before many women even know that they are pregnant. At the same time, Kasich signed a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions only for saving a pregnant woman’s life or preventing the “substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.”

  “At the risk of sounding discriminatory, which is not at all my goal here, but at the risk of sounding like that, there is no way women should be allowed control over whether or not they are going to have abortions,” Kasich told the Ohio Daily Star. “Women are wonderful beings, they are kind, loving, incredible and a whole other plethora of adjectives could be used to describe them, but at the end of the day, I’m sorry to have to say this, but the honest truth is that women used to be all those things. The women of today are mainly opportunists and gold diggers, who typically get pregnant due to unsafe sex, or to get their partners to marry them … That’s that, if a woman these days is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed when they’re supposed to be closed, if she doesn’t have the foresight to make sure she doesn’t get herself in a situation where she might be pregnant, then there is no way a woman like that can or should be entrusted with the decision of having an abortion.

  Women in this country really need to learn to either keep their legs closed or their other orifices open,” the governor concluded.
