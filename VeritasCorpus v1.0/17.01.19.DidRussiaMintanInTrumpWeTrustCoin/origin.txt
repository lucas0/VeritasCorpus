  Just before the Inauguration for the president-elect, a Russian metal working company has minted a sterling silver coin to commemorate Donald Trump’s big day. The coin features Trump’s face and the Statue of Liberty is on the flip side. The coin includes the slogan “In Trump we trust.” Well, Russia certainly trusts Trump more than American citizens do. Trump will enter the Oval Office with the worst approval rating in modern history for a president-elect.
