  On 17 January 2017, the liberal web site Addicting Info published a story with a headline that could be mistaken to mean that the Russian government had created a new piece of currency dedicated to incoming U.S. President Donald Trump: “Russians Mint ‘In Trump We Trust’ Coin to Commemorate U.S. Inauguration.”
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the body of the story revealed the fact that the coins were being manufactured and sold by a private Russian company, not minted by the Russian government and distributed as currency:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Just before the Inauguration for the president-elect, a Russian metal working company has minted a sterling silver coin to commemorate Donald Trump’s big day. The coin features Trump’s face and the Statue of Liberty is on the flip side. The coin includes the slogan “In Trump we trust.” Well, Russia certainly trusts Trump more than American citizens do. Trump will enter the Oval Office with the worst approval rating in modern history for a president-elect.

  The coins are being sold by
