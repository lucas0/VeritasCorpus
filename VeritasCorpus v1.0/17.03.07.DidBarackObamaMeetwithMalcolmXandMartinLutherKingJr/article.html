  Of course, anyone with a basic grasp of American history would not for a moment think that this image could be anything other than an idealized product of someone’s imagination, because it is chronologically impossible for an adult Barack Obama to have met or posed with these two men, who both died when he was a mere child.

  Barack Obama was born on 4 August 1961, but Malcolm X was assassinated on 21 February 1965 (when Obama was but three years old) and Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated on 4 April 1968 (when Obama was only six years old)

  the picture as follows:

   The senator was clearly sleep-deprived today, but still in good spirits. I saw him lean on his hands and slouch forward a little more than usual.

   The campaign trail is a hard life.
