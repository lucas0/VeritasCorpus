 <p>
  A San Diego Zoo employee has been hospitalized and is lying in critical condition after allegedly trying to sexually assault a Giant Pacific Octopus.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 28-year-old employee was found partially naked and unconscious when security agents discovered the young man and alerted an ambulance.
 </p>
 <p>
  It took medical personnel several hours to successfully release the octopus that had latched itself to the man’s genital area.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We did the best we could but the octopus’s beak has tremendous pressure and the animal had started to digest part of the man’s genitals,” explained Dr. Julia Andrews of the San Diego Medical Center.
