  On 11 August 2016, the web site Newslo
  <em>
   .
  </em>
  com
  <a href="https://archive.is/McDYB" target="_blank">
   published
  </a>
  an article containing a faked quote from Cornerstone megachurch founder, Pastor John Hagee, about the average bust size of lesbian women:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   In an interview with Breitbart News, the televangelist argued that lesbians are “the scourge of the earth,” and that “God hates them so much that he’s made sure normal people can tell them apart from normal women.” Asked to elaborate, he went on about how some of their physical characteristics differ from those of normal, straight women. “In his infinite wisdom, God made sure that we are able to tell them apart from the diseased so that we may protect ourselves and our children from them. That’s why most lesbians are as flat as an ironing board,” he opined.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  These are not real quotes from Pastor John Hagee. Newslo
  <em>
   .
  </em>
  com is a “hybrid” web site that publishes articles containing a
  <a href="https://archive.is/rKygP" target="_blank">
   mixture
  </a>
  of factual and fictional information. The web site displays two buttons near the top of its “hybrid” articles allowing readers to either “show” or “hide” the facts:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Newslo is the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web. Readers come to us for a unique brand of entertainment and information that is enhanced by features like our fact-button, which allows readers to find what is fact and what is satire.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  In this particular case, the “show facts” button highlighted the first paragraph of the article, which contains a legitimate quote from Hagee about “counterfeit Christians” who endorse the “homosexual lifestyle,” originally
  <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/hagee-pro-choice-pro-lgbt-counterfeit-christians-are-nations-greatest-problem/" target="_blank">
   said
  </a>
  during an August 2014
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QCpqD9xuHI" target="_blank">
   sermon
  </a>
  :
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   <span class="fact">
    “Those of you who got on national television and endorsed homosexual lifestyle because the president did so, you are a counterfeit Christian, you are a moral coward, you are a hireling shepherd,” Hagee said, condemning the increasing number of pastors that are accepting homosexuality. “Shame on you.”
   </span>
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The remainder of the text, which was not highlighted after the “show” facts button was pressed, was fictional.  Although Newslo.com made an attempt to distinguish fact from fiction, many people encountered the story after it was republished by a related web site (
  <a href="https://archive.is/pHiBk" target="_blank">
   USPOLN
  </a>
  ) in March 2017. This  site, which almost exclusively regurgitates content from Newslo.com
  <em>
   ,
  </em>
  did not include the “show” and “hide” facts buttons.
