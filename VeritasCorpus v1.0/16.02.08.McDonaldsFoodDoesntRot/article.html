  On 3 February 2016, Facebook user Jennifer Lovdahl published the above-reproduced status update, to which were appended were two images of an otherwise unremarkable McDonald’s Happy Meal along with the following comment:

  A receipt was attached to the Happy Meal box, indicating that it had been purchased over six years earlier, on 8 January 2010:

  held that a McDonald’s cheeseburger purchased in 1996 showed few signs of decomposition twelve years on. The phenomenon was also examined by
  <em>
   BuzzFeed
  </em>
  in a 2014 video comparing seven separate fast-food burgers that had each been stored in glass jars for 30 days:

  On 15 October 2010 (the same year Lovdahl reportedly purchased the Happy Meal in question), the food blog
  <em>
   Serious Eats
  </em>
  published an article about “The Myth of The 12-Year-Old McDonald’s Hamburger.” The site took a more in-depth look at whether claims about McDonald’s held up in more detailed testing conditions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most claims about McDonald’s food failing to decompose were presented in the context of individuals’ having purchased food items specifically to evidence the phenomenon, but rarely (if ever) did such claims provide much information about the conditions under which the experiments were conducted. Moreover, ever fewer of them included one or more “control” samples of items purchased at other outlets or made at home to rule out factors such as environmental or storage conditions as factors. Since most experiments involved significant passages of time and lacked control specimens, their probative value was significantly diminished.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Serious Eats
  </em>
  foregrounded their experiment by explaining that:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The thing is, the hamburger [Karen Hanrahan, of the blog Best of Mother Earth has] been using as a prop is the same plain McDonald’s hamburger she’s been using for what’s now going on 14 years … Karen is neither the first nor last to document this very same phenomenon. Artist Sally Davies photographs her 137 day-old hamburger every day for her Happy Meal Art Project. Nonna Joann has chosen to store her happy meal for a year on her blog rather than feed it to her kids. Dozens of other examples exist, and most of them come to the same conclusion: McDonald’s hamburgers don’t rot …  Most of you are probably thinking just plain,
   <em>
    “ew”
   </em>
   — a perfectly reasonable reaction to what at first seems like a totally disgusting perversion of nature. I mean, what kind of chemical-laden crap are they stuffing those burgers with to make them last that long?
  </p>
  <p>
   But then there’s a few people who’re probably shouting out, “now wait just a minute here! This ain’t science!”
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  <em>

  </em>
  writer J. Kenji Lopez-Alt surmised that “[t]he problem with all of these tests is that there is but a single data point, and a single data point is about as useless as a one armed man in a clapping contest”; he then set out to “design and carry out the first well-documented, scientific experiment to shed some light on whether or not there is something truly evil lurking between the buns.” After pointing out the extensive number of factors involved, he listed the items with which he would attempt to replicate the results:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     A plain McDonald’s hamburger, stored on a plate at room temperature.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     A homemade burger of the same weight and dimensions as a McDonald’s burger (I was fine using a store-bought bun, because who bakes their own buns?)
    </p>
   </blockquote>
  </li>

   <blockquote>
    <p>
     A McDonald’s hamburger patty on a store-bought bun.

  On 5 November 2010, Lopez-Alt published a

   follow-up
  </a>
  , in which he noted of his testing conditions:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Every day, I monitored the progress of the burgers, weighing each one, and carefully checking for spots of mold growth or other indications of decay. The burgers were left in the open air, but handled only with clean kitchen tools or through clean plastic bags (no direct contact with my hands until the last day).
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Lopez-Alt first presented his findings visually, producing an image of four virtually identical samples:
