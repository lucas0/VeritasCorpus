  Now they can just just kill him. The intelligence services of the United States are not interested in the type of president Trump vows to be, because the contrived enemy in the form of Russia justifies their existence.

Trump, on the other hand, who is ready to reach agreements, would bring about a different set of financial opportunities, flowing in other directions.
