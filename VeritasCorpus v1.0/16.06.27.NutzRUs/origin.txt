  Question: So, this inquiry comes from a psychiatrist at Broughton Hospital in Morganton, Dr. Suzannah McCuen, who a few weeks back sent us a letter questioning the name choice of a local company. “I learned today that a company in the Buncombe County area whose business it is to provide care facilities for the mentally ill is called Nutz R Us,” McCuen said. “I found that hard to believe and so Googled them and called one of their homes, White Fawn. The woman who answered the phone verified that Nutz R Us is the corporate name. She seemed to think that using a “z” in the spelling mitigated the harm, I suppose, as she pointed that out to me. An online search reveals this company runs several homes in the area. While I am grateful that this company is providing homes for the mentally ill, I find their choice of a company name offensive, to say the least. I am hopeful that some public exposure will convince them to change the company name while still endeavoring to provide much needed services and homes for the mentally ill in Western North Carolina.”

  My [] answer: I didn’t have much more luck than the good doctor in getting hold of someone with the company.

  I left multiple messages in January and last week with the administrator and at the White Fawn home, and I’ve not heard anything back.

  I don’t think McCuen is going to let this go. She’s alerted a patient advocacy organization and the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill.

  Businesses often use colorful parent company names — I know one or two that would not be appropriate for a family newspaper. But this one does seem a bit tin-eared for a mental health provider.
