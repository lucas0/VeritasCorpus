  On 9 January 2018, the YourNewsWire web site published an
  <a href="http://archive.is/mmMyw" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  reporting that actor Sylvester Stallone had labeled former president Barack Obama as a “closet homosexual” who has “lived his whole pathetic life as a lie”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Barack Obama is a “closet homosexual” who has “lived his whole pathetic life as a lie” according to Sylvester Stallone, who says “I have nothing against homos, but I can’t stand liars.”
  </p>
  <p>
   “Everybody who is anybody in Chicago knows all about the real Barack Obama,” Stallone said on the set of Creed 2. “I’ve spent a lot of time in Chicago and the stories you hear about that guy – wow. It just disturbs me and concerns me that we had a liar and a fraud in control for eight years.“
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  However, this story was completely false: the
  <em>
   Rocky
  </em>
  star made no such statements, either on the set of
  <em>
   Creed 2
  </em>
  or at any other place and time. This tale originated solely with
  <a href="https://www.snopes.com/?s=yournewswire" target="ad">
   YourNewsWire
  </a>
  , a fake news site that drives traffic with fabricated clickbait headlines about celebrities and politicians, including those that

   involve

  the former dissing the latter.
