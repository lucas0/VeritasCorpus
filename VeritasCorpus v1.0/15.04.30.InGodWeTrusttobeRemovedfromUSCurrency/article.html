  On 24 May 2014, the
  <i>
   National Report
  </i>
  published an
  <a href="http://www.donotlink.com/exle" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  positing that President Obama had ordered the removal of the words ‘In God We Trust’ (the U.S. national motto) from all U.S. currency by 1 July 2014:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Beginning July 1st the Federal Reserve along with the United States Department of the Treasury will begin printing all currency, which includes all notes and coins, without the words ‘In God We Trust’. This modification comes under strict orders from President Barack Obama and his administration.
  </p>
  <p>
   Obama held a press conference this morning to explain the impending change and to answer questions.
  </p>
  <p>
   “As our country grows and changes, so must our money,” Obama said. “There is [sic] now too many individuals living in this great nation of ours that do not worship the same God as most of us. In fact some folks don’t believe in a God at all. This currency adjustment is truly change we can believe in.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  By the following day, links and excerpts referencing this article were being circulated via social media, with many of those who encountered the item mistaking it for a genuine news article. However, the article was just a bit of fiction from the
  <i>
   National Report
  </i>
  , a web site whose stock in trade is publishing outrage-provoking fake news stories such as “President Obama Reported

   In fact, legislation passed in 1955 makes the appearance of the motto “In God We Trust”

   on all coins and paper currency issued by the United States. That requirement cannot be unilaterally overturned by the President; Congress would have to specifically pass a bill rescinding the previous legislation in order for the change described here (i.e., the removal of the U.S. motto) to take effect.

  (Although various lawsuits over the years have challenged the appearance of “In God We Trust” on U.S. money as a violation of the First Amendment’s
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishment_Clause" target="_blank">
   Establishment Clause
  </a>
  , so far all such lawsuits have been rejected by federal courts.)

   petition
  </a>
  posted on the official White House web site that urges the Obama administration to “Keep The Words ‘IN GOD WE TRUST’ on All American Currency” was linked from within the
  <i>
   National Report

  article; that petition was simply a ruse created by the author of the
  <i>
   National Report
  </i>
  piece himself to lend an air of verisimilitude to his fictional article.
