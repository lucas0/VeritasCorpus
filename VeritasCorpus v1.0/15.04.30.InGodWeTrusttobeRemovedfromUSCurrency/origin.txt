  Beginning July 1st the Federal Reserve along with the United States Department of the Treasury will begin printing all currency, which includes all notes and coins, without the words ‘In God We Trust’. This modification comes under strict orders from President Barack Obama and his administration.
 </p>
 <p>
  Obama held a press conference this morning to explain the impending change and to answer questions.
 </p>
 <p>
  “As our country grows and changes, so must our money,” Obama said. “There is [sic] now too many individuals living in this great nation of ours that do not worship the same God as most of us. In fact some folks don’t believe in a God at all. This currency adjustment is truly change we can believe in.”
