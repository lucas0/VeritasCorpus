  Atlanta, Georgia | A 32-year old man went on a killing frenzy last night, after spending 36 hours in a row watching Walkind Dead while doing drugs.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to the police, Kevin Fogarty was so badly intoxicated with crystal meth, that he became convinced his apartment was surrounded by zombies.
 </p>
 <p>
  He equipped himself with an assault rifle, two pistols, a machette and a hammer, before going outside to “kill undead”.
