  If you received a robocall from Carnival, Norwegian or Royal Caribbean, you might want to enter your phone number on a class-action website. A class-action lawsuit against those cruise lines and Resort Marketing Group means you might get between $300 to $900 for the calls. Philip Charvat filed the lawsuit, saying he had received telemarketing calls without his permission after the cruise lines contracted with Resort Marketing Group. Without that consent, Charvat and his attornies claimed the involved companies hadÂ violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.
