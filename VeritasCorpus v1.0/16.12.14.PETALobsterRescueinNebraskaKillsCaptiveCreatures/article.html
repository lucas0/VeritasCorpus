  On 14 December 2016, the Facebook page “Occupy Democrats Logic” (not to be confused with “

  “)
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OccupyDemocratsLogic/photos/a.1647169182167657.1073741828.1646874365530472/1830157213868852/?type=3&amp;theater" target="_blank">

  the screenshot reproduced above, alongside the following claim about People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and some lobsters they attempted to save:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   PETA came to Nebraska and bought a bunch of our live lobsters and freed them onto the Missouri River.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Missouri River is freshwater.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lobsters are saltwater.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yeah, they died.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thanks, PETA.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The original post depicted in the screenshot was dated 29 March, but without a year. Also missing: the name of the fishmonger, identifying information about the bungled lobster rescue, or any other details that would help find out more about the issue.

   Years ago a PETA activist smashed a lobster tank in the middle of NYC to let the lobsters “run free.” They all died. — Darth Paul (@PaulGof2814)

  Lobsters are indeed unable to survive in

  , and the Missouri River is a freshwater

  . However, comments made by the Facebook page’s operators suggested that the claim was shared as a joke or parable about PETA and its associates, and not as a reflection of a real-life incident:

   We asked PETA via Twitter whether there was any truth to the tale, but did not receive a response. Meanwhile, as participants on

   </a>
   discussed the claim during its December 2016 circulation, we found no information (either in news reports or anecdotes) suggesting that this particular story existed before early December 2016.

  The “lobsters in Nebraska” rumor is one of a constellation of claims that PETA engages in behavior that is negligently or purposely
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/critters/crusader/petakillspets.asp" target="_blank">
   harmful
  </a>
  to the animals they profess to care deeply about. But (as with earlier rumors of the same thematic basis) there is no evidence the described lobster abuse took place, either incidentally or regularly.
