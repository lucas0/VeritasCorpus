  On 13 June 2016, an image purportedly showing a futuristic new Audi truck began circulating on social media as if it were photograph of a truck that was actually in production.
 </p>
 <p>
  The image does not depict an actual truck, however, but rather a conceptual design for a truck created by Artem Smirnov and Vladimir Panchenko. The image was originally posted to creative project showcase site

  along with sketches, plans, and several other illustrations of the concept:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   <em>
    Our goal was to develop an unmanned electric truck brand Audi. In sketching stage, we have identified two possible directions:Option A is an electric truck autonomously driving for highways; Option B is an electric truck show car. We decided to work in two directions, then to choose the best option. But the plan failed:/. We could not choose a better version, so we present to your court both.
