  On 8 May 2015, the web site
  <em>
   Newswatch 28
  </em>
  published an article reporting that the FDA had approved a new tranquilizer dart to put children to sleep:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The Food and Drug Association (FDA) has announced this morning that it has approved pharmaceutical giant Johnson &amp; Johnson’s request to produce and sell tranquilizer dart guns specially developed to put kids to sleep.
  </p>
  <p>
   The alleged new medical device would allow parents to put a child to sleep within 4 seconds, and is said to have no serious longterm consequences on the child’s health.
  </p>
  <p>
   There has been a high demand for such a device for years now, explains to us Ernie Knewitz, media relations vp over at Jonhson and Johnson. We have tested over hundreds of recipes to finally find one that doesnt cause too much damage to the brain despite regular use. We have finally found a mix of PCP and a heroin derivative that seems to do the job.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The above-quoted article was shared thousands of times on Facebook. While most commentators agreed that the sleep-inducing methods described in this story would qualify for cruel and unusual punishment, some claimed that the use of tranquilizer darts on children was a necessary evil.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regardless, the story is pure fiction.
  <em>

  is one of the myriad of fake news web sites on the Internet, the purveyor of such invented headlines as
  <br>
   “

    76-year-old woman expelled from KFC for breastfeeding her 42-year-old son

  Regardless of public opinion, the FDA has not approved a tranquilizer dart to put children to sleep. While the above-displayed photograph does feature a child snoozing in a humorous sleeping position, the tranquilizer dart was added to the image via Photoshop. The origins of the photo are unknown, but it has been circulating online as a demotivational poster since at least 2010:
