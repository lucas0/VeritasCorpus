  On 2 December 2016, a “satirical” site — which contains a disclaimer buried deep on its “About Us” page — posted a hoax story (“Obama Crushed After Trump Orders White House to Stop His Sickest Tradition”) that reported outgoing United States President Barack Obama was seen storming out of the White House because of the cancellation of one of his most “secretive rituals.”
 </p>
 <p>
  According to the article, Obama secretly ordered White House staff to order silence in the building during the five daily Muslim prayers, collectively known as the
  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/practices/salat.shtml" target="_blank">
   Salat
  </a>
  or Salah. The story also accuses Obama of making prayer rugs available in order to make Muslims more comfortable. However, it says, President-elect Donald Trump put a stop to the practice and ordered “all pagan symbols” to be removed from the property:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Obama was seen storming away from the West Wing after staffers from Donald Trump’s transition team began preparing the Executive offices for the new administration. On Trump’s orders, one of Obama’s most secretive rituals is being reversed and all signs of it removed from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  To further its spurious claim, this story features a photo of Muslim men in prayer, suggesting that it was taken as part of this “secret” ritual. The picture

  The allegation about the prayer rug is similar to a thoroughly debunked
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/photos/ovaloffice.asp" target="_blank">
   claim
  </a>
  that Obama had a “Muslim prayer curtain” put in the White House. Obama has also been (falsely) accused of “

   enforcing”
  </a>
  Islamic prayers on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, and
