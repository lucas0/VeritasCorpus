  This alarmist warning claims a provision of the Affordable Care Act [ACA] (commonly known as “Obamacare”) supposedly requires that a primary care physician must admit patients of age 76 and older to a hospital in order for those patients’ hospital costs to be covered by Medicare.  It originally turned up as a piece tacked onto to the widely-circulated (and largely erroneous) “

  </p>
  <p>
   • Part B also covers most of your doctor services when you’re a hospital outpatient. You pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount after you pay the
