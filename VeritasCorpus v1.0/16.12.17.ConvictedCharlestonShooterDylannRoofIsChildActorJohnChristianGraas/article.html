  In December 2016, 22-year-old Dylann Roof was

   convicted

  on 33 federal hate crimes counts related to the
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2015/06/22/dylann-roof-burger-king/" target="_blank">
   June 2015
  </a>
  Charleston church shooting that left nine people dead.  The news of his conviction revived a June 2015 conspiracy theory that the Roof was not who he was claimed to be, but rather was a former child star and crisis actor named John Christian Graas.
 </p>
 <p>
  A constellation of “crisis actor” rumors widely entered mainstream
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/info/news/sandyhoax.asp" target="_blank">
   conspiracy theory
  </a>
  after the

   Sandy

  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/guns/newtown.asp" target="_blank">
   Hook
  </a>
  school shootings of 2012. Shortly after news of that earlier massacre broke, multiple persons connected to the tragedy (typically family members of dead victims) were accused of being crisis actors (i.e., professional actors supposedly engaged by government agencies and the news media to deceive the public about the reality of allegedly staged (also known as “false flag”) events, hired to convincingly portray persons in the throes of trauma and suffering).
 </p>
 <p>
  After Sandy Hook, iterations of the “

   crisis actor
  </a>
  ” claim were attached by online conspiracy buffs to virtually every subsequent

  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/virginia-journalist-false-flag/" target="_blank">
   truthers
  </a>
  attempting to “out” these potential “plants” by matching them up with images of persons who had no connection to those events.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Charleston church massacre took place on 17 June 2015, and in less than a week conspiracy theorists were
  <a href="http://archive.is/w3fee" target="_blank">
   asserting
  </a>
  that accused shooter Dylann Roof was

   actually
  </a>
  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0333174/" target="_blank">
   John Christian Graas
  </a>
  , a former child actor who had appeared in several films and episodes of numerous television series (and who, according to the Internet Movie Database, enlisted as a U.S. Marine in 2010).
 </p>
 <p>
  One early version of the rumor held:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   There’s been tons of speculation in regards to the Charleston shooting rampage.
  </p>
  <p>
   Was this another False Flag to distract and terrorize the masses?
  </p>
  <p>
   What would be gained from such an event?
  </p>
  <p>
   In this video you are about to watch, you will see hard core evidence that the shooter is really 33 year old John Christian Graas, Hollywood child actor and US Marine aviator as of 2010 and on US Marine register as of 2013.

  The associated video clip documented only that Graas and Dylann Roof bore a passing resemblance to one another, its “hardcore evidence” hinging on facial similarities between Roof at the time of his 2015 arrest and Graas as a young boy in the early 1990s:
