  Olivia is not supposed to have her phone in her bedroom at night, but she sneaked it in and had it in her bed, so she fell asleep with it touching her leg.

 <p>
  She woke up in the middle of the night and came into my room and said her leg was hurting – I just thought she was being silly and sent her back to bed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then in the morning I saw this awful burn on her leg — I was so shocked a phone case could do that. Doctors have said it is a severe chemical burn and she will be scarred for life. I can’t believe it — she will have a scar in the shape of a phone on her leg.
