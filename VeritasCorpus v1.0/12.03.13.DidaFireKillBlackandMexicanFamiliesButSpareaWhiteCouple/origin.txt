  Fire in LA [as reported in the LA Times 8/1/2008]
 </p>
 <p>
  A fire was reported in a three family house mid-morning Wednesday last week.
 </p>
 <p>
  There were many fatalities.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the first floor lived a black family – 6 fatalities.
  <br>
   On the second floor lived a Mexican family – 13 fatalities.
   <br/>
   On the third floor lived a white family of 2 – no fatalities.
  </br>
 </p>
 <p>
  A reporter at the scene made headlines with this story. Immediately the fire chief and his department were attacked by NAACP, Jesse Jackson and other black rights groups, as well as, the Mexican Consulate as being racist in their handling of the fire and loss of life issues.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was some unsettling discomfort when questioned further the fire chief explained why the family on the third floor survived the fire and the others did not.
 </p>
 <p>
  His only response was, “They were at work!”
