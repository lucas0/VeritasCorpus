 <p>
  Jill Stein just came out and destroyed Hillary Clinton and everything she stands for.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the video, she says that “Donald Trump is better” and that “Hillary Clinton more likely is start nuclear war” … Stein also goes on to talk about how Gorbachev has said that we are closer to NUCLEAR WAR with Russia than we ever have been because of Hillary Clinton’s policies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hillary policies will start a war with Russia that will go nuclear.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stein brings up a good point that she won’t sleep well at night if Hillary Clinton were to get elected.
 </p>
 <p>
  I can’t imagine anyone would with the threat of nuclear war looming over our country’s head.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is Huuuge for Donald Trump! Even the independents are beginning to hop on the Trump Train!
 </p>
 <p>
  Hillary Clinton was definitely hoping she would win some of the independent vote but not after this … Please share this everywhere! Hillary Clinton must be stopped!
