  In January 2016, a photograph purportedly showing a group of American students being “forced” to pray to Allah at mosque as required by their Common Core was widely circulated via social media. The picture was not taken in the United States, however, and has nothing to do with the Common Core curriculum.

   As part of the project ‘other cultures’, pupils of OBS Vinkenbuurt visited the Ghulzar-e-Madina mosque in Zwolle. Imam Mawlana Tahier Wagid Hosain Noorani gave a tour of his mosque. All questions that the students had were answered in a fun and understandable way. Students OBS Vinkenbuurt also tried to say the Arabic alphabet. They also have experienced what it is to pray. They have learned a lot during the visit of Islam.
