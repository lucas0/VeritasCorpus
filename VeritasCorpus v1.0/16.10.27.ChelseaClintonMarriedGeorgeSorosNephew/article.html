  On 26 October 2016, Donald Trump surrogate and former

  to share some new “discoveries” he had unearthed about the Clinton family.  Chief among them was the claim that Chelsea Clinton had married the nephew of billionaire and philanthropist

   George Soros
  </a>
  :
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Did you know????
   <br>
    Some Clinton connection I just discovered.
    <br/>
    So Chelsea is married to George SOROS nephew.
   </br>
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Baio didn’t provide any evidence that Marc Mezvinsky, Chelsea Clinton’s husband, was related in any way to Soros. The closest the actor came to connecting the two was when he said (falsely) that Clinton and Mezvinsky had been married at Soros’ mansion.
 </p>
 <p>
  While this rumor has been circulating for several years, it is as untrue now as it always was. Clinton and Marc were

   married
  </a>
  at Astor Courts on the old Astor estate Ferncliff Farm, a property that is not owned by Soros.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, it’s unclear where Baio “discovered” that Marc Mezvinsky was the nephew of George Soros, as this claim is demonstrably untrue. The billionaire has one brother,

   Paul Soros
  </a>
  , who has two

   children
  </a>
  , Peter and Jeffrey Soros. Therefore, George Soros has two nephews, Peter Soros and Jeffrey Soros, and neither of these people is Marc Mezvinsky.
 </p>
 <p>
  Marc’s father, Ed Mezvinsky, has one brother, Norton (who is not also George Soros’ brother). Norton explicitly

   stated
  </a>
  that he was Marc’s “only uncle” after he did not receive an invitation to his nephew’s wedding:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The A-list roster of 500 guests for the Chelsea Clinton wedding didn’t include a spot for her fiancé’s lone uncle.
  </p>
  <p>
   A family feud blocked a disappointed Norton Mezvinsky from making the cut for the Saturday nuptials of his nephew, Marc, and the former First Daughter.
  </p>
  <p>
   “I’m the senior male member of the family, and Marc’s only uncle,” Norton Mezvinsky told the Daily News Wednesday. “I am not surprised, but extremely hurt I wasn’t invited.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The rest of Baio’s post dealt with the criminal activity of Ed Mezvinsky, Marc’s father, which we have detailed
