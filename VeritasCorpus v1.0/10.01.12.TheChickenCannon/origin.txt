  In an issue of Meat &amp; Poultry magazine, editors quoted from “Feathers,” the publication of the California Poultry Industry Federation, telling the following story:
 </p>
 <p>
  The US Federal Aviation Administration has a unique device for testing the strength of windshields on airplanes. The device is a gun that launches a dead chicken at a plane’s windshield at approximately the speed the plane flies.
 </p>
 <p>
  The theory is that if the windshield doesn’t crack from the carcass impact, it’ll survive a real collision with a bird during flight.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems the British were very interested in this and wanted to test a windshield on a brand new, speedy locomotive they’re developing.
 </p>
 <p>
  They borrowed FAA’s chicken launcher, loaded the chicken and fired.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ballistic chicken shattered the windshield, broke the engineer’s chair and embedded itself in the back wall of the engine’s cab. The British were stunned and asked the FAA to recheck the test to see if everything was done correctly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The FAA reviewed the test thoroughly and had one recommendation:
 </p>
 <p>
  “Use a thawed chicken.”

  Presumably you know that aerospace companies often fire chickens at test aircraft canopies to see how they would stand up to flying through a flock of birds during takeoff? This is true of British Aerospace also, however one time it went wrong.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just before lunch, the engineers set up the chicken-cannon, loaded a frozen chicken into it, and left for the canteen. The chicken would be just about defrosted by the time they got back to do the test. When they came back, they got behind the protective wall, started the high-speed cameras (to play back in detail what happens), and fired the chicken at the canopy. Normally, it should just bounce off, or make a nasty dent. This time, the canopy was destroyed. Bits everywhere. Having checked the cannon, and looked through the (expensive) wreckage, they decided to view the film, to see if it would provide any clues. It did. During lunch, a cat had climbed into the cannon, lured by the smell of fresh chicken, became part of the test.
