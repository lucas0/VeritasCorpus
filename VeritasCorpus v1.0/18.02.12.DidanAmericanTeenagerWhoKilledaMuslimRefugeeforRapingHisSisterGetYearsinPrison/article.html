  On 11 February 2018, an unofficial Facebook fan page dedicated to White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders posted a
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sarahhukabeesanders/videos/546114939095113/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   video
  </a>
  with the obvious intent of spreading false information and hatred directed at Muslim people. The video is adorned with poorly-written English captions that read as follows:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   American teenage whom killed Muslim Refugee for raping his 7 Years Old Sister Sentenced 30 Years in prison!
   <br>
    Would You Set Him Free?
    <br/>
    Dont ignore this video!

  The video does not offer any specific information and was purportedly created by an outlet called “US Politics Info Center,” which is a fake news and click bait

  The entire 20-second clip lacks anything resembling accurate information. Although the jumpsuit-wearing men depicted in it have been convicted of serious and vicious crimes, neither did what the video claims. The apparent “American teenage,” the sobbing young man in royal blue, is

  The bearded man in darker blue who appears in the video handcuffed with his head down is

   Osvaldo Rivera

  of New Jersey, who in 2014 was given a life sentence for raping a 12-year-old girl at knifepoint and murdering her 6-year-old brother when the child tried to save his sister. There is no indication of either his religion or his citizenship status, but the basic facts of his case would be wrong even if the badly written caption described each of them with anything approaching accuracy.

  It is highly unlikely that the Facebook page with 10,000-plus fans dedicated to Sanders has any connection to her other than in name. We sent an inquiry to the White House press office but received no response.
