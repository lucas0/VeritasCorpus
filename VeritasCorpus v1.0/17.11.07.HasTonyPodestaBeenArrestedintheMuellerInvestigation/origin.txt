  Democrat lobbyist Tony Podesta is in police custody after being arrested last night, with arrest warrants also issued for Hillary Clinton and John Podesta, who are “turning themselves in” on Monday morning.In a shocking turn of events, three key Democrats have been indicted, yet there’s a total mainstream media blackout.
 </p>
 <p>
  Arrests records confirm that 74-year-old Anthony, founder of the Podesta Group, brother of John Podesta, and a major player in the Pizzagate scandal, was arrested last night.
 </p>
 <p>
  Just days ago, Tony Podesta stepped down from the Podesta Group after probing conducted under the authority of special counsel Robert Mueller led to an investigation by the Justice Department.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tony is currently in custody with the US Marshals with the Podesta brothers’ lawyers pleading with Mueller to keep the indictments sealed.
