  The Red Cross…threatened the pastors, threatened the priest, and threatened [others]. They began to steal – yes, I said it – the Red Cross was physically taking these donations from the doorsteps of these churches and putting them into their trucks. [The] Red Cross came to the church, with volunteers, and began to steal the donations…The Red Cross was stealing from people who literally had nothing…and they were protected by Order EO 13603. They were protected by Barack Obama, who signed this executive order.
