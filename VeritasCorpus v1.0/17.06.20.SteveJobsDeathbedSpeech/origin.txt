 <p>
  “I reached the pinnacle of success in the business world. In others’ eyes, my life is an epitome of success.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, aside from work, I have little joy. In the end, wealth is only a fact of life that I am accustomed to.
 </p>
 <p>
  At this moment, lying on the sick bed and recalling my whole life, I realize that all the recognition and wealth that I took so much pride in, have paled and become meaningless in the face of impending death.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the darkness, I look at the green lights from the life supporting machines and hear the humming mechanical sounds, I can feel the breath of god of death drawing closer …
 </p>
 <p>
  Now I know, when we have accumulated sufficient wealth to last our lifetime, we should pursue other matters that are unrelated to wealth …
 </p>
 <p>
  Should be something that is more important:
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps relationships, perhaps art, perhaps a dream from younger days
 </p>
 <p>
  Non-stop pursuing of wealth will only turn a person into a twisted being, just like me.
 </p>
 <p>
  God gave us the senses to let us feel the love in everyone’s heart, not the illusions brought about by wealth.
 </p>
 <p>
  The wealth I have won in my life I cannot bring with me. What I can bring is only the memories precipitated by love.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s the true riches which will follow you, accompany you, giving you strength and light to go on.
 </p>
 <p>
  Love can travel a thousand miles. Life has no limit. Go where you want to go. Reach the height you want to reach. It is all in your heart and in your hands.
 </p>
 <p>
  What is the most expensive bed in the world?
 </p>
 <p>
  Sick bed …
 </p>
 <p>
  You can employ someone to drive the car for you, make money for you but you cannot have someone to bear the sickness for you.
 </p>
 <p>
  Material things lost can be found. But there is one thing that can never be found when it is lost — Life.
 </p>
 <p>
  When a person goes into the operating room, he will realize that there is one book that he has yet to finish reading — Book of Healthy Life.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whichever stage in life we are at right now, with time, we will face the day when the curtain comes down.
 </p>
 <p>
  Treasure Love for your family, love for your spouse, love for your friends.
 </p>
 <p>
  Treat yourself well. Cherish others.”
