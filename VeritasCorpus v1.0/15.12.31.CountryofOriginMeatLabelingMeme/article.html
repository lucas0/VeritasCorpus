  The meme was nearly identical to one shared by Wolfe on 1 July 2015; both pertained to Country of Origin Labeling (COOL), effective in the United States following the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of

  Wolfe was a controversial figure in both the alternative health and science/skepticism communities on social media;

   For the most part, David will create a rather innocuous meme that is either cute or motivational in nature, so the casual Facebook user will be naturally inclined to share them. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with following a page that makes/disseminates good motivational quotes. However, David has a method to his madness, and does this in what I call “The David Avocado Wolfe Effect” (or DAWE).

  The meme contained a mixture of true, false, and misleading information. H.R. 2393 was introduced in the House on 18 May 2015, a contemporaneous [

  ] summary explained that the bill would repeal some country of origin labeling requirements for meat (but not all):
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   H.R. 2393 would repeal existing requirements for retailers of beef, pork, and chicken to inform customers at the final point of sale of the country of origin of those products. The repeal would not affect existing requirements for country-of-origin labeling for lamb, venison, goat meat, perishable agricultural commodities, peanuts, farm-raised and wild fish, ginseng, pecans, and macadamia nuts.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The meme maintained that after passing the House the bill moved on to the Senate, where it was “slipped” into a spending bill. That assertion was misleading; agricultural regulations are commonly

  The repealed provisions weren’t all that old. While some had roots in the above-linked 2002 Farm Bill, many only dated to 2009 [

   article
  </a>
  from 21 December 2015 titled “USDA Ends COOL Enforcement With President’s Signature on Omnibus Bill” reported that the bill was part of broader trade concerns:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Congress included COOL repeal in the $1.4 trillion omnibus spending bill after the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled Canada and Mexico could begin imposing more than $1 billion in tariffs on U.S. products to punish it for the harm the labeling requirements were doing to them.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  On 18 December 2015, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) issued a press release
  <a href="http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?contentid=2015/12/0345.xml&amp;contentidonly=true" target="_blank">
   titled
  </a>
  “Statement from Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack on the Country of Origin Labeling Requirements for Beef and Pork”; it confirmed:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today released the following statement regarding the language in the omnibus bill repealing the country of origin labeling requirements for beef and pork products.
  </p>
  <p>
   “The omnibus bill repealed the country of origin labeling (COOL) requirements for muscle cuts of beef and pork, and ground beef and pork. Effective immediately, USDA is not enforcing the COOL requirements for muscle cut and ground beef and pork outlined in the January 2009 and May 2013 final rules.”
  </p>
  <p>
   USDA will be amending the COOL regulations as expeditiously as possible to reflect the repeal of the beef and pork provisions. In addition, all imported and domestic meat will continue to be subject to rigorous inspections by USDA to ensure food safety.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  As Vilsack’s statement explains, the previous country of origin labeling regulations were of debatable value to consumers. Regardless of a meat’s country of origin, all meat sold inside the United States is subject to the same USDA regulations and standards as before.
 </p>
 <p>
  In short, it is true that mandatory COOL labeling was officially repealed in the U.S. late December 2015, but those revised labeling requirements applied only to some meats and had no effect on the required certifications that apply to meat sold in the U.S. (whatever its source). Attachment of the bill to omnibus spending legislation wasn’t sneaky, as USDA provisions are generally passed as part of budget bills for upcoming fiscal years.  Finally, nothing about the COOL repeal prevents manufacturers from labeling meat: those vendors who wish to do so are free to label their meats without penalty.
