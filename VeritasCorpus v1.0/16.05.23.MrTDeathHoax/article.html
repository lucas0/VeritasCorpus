  In May 2016, a message reporting that actor Mr. T (the stage name of Laurence Tureaud), best known for his portrayal of B.A. Baracus on the 1980s television series
  <em>
   The A-Team
  </em>
  , had passed away was widely circulated on Facebook:

 <blockquote>
  <p>

  However, no news outlets have reported on the action star’s alleged passing, and reports of his death are belied by the fact that Mr. T is still active on his social media

  Fake Facebook obituaries for non-dead celebrities are an example of “

Like-farmers will gather clicks, which denote popularity, then scrub the original content and replace it with something else (usually a scammy ad of some sort) to bypass Facebook constraints. Facebook has moved to quash this behavior by adjusting their algorithms, but of course, some scammers’

  Although Mr. T did not pass away in May 2016, one factor that may have contributed to the spread of this death hoax is that the actor celebrated his 64th
