   Tatanysha Hedman

  set her husband on fire after she discovered that he had allegedly been molesting their 7-year-old daughter:

   The man who was badly burned when his wife allegedly set him on fire is now facing sex crime charges.
  </p>
  <p>
   Renton police earlier said Vincent Phillips, 52, had been doused in gasoline July 17 while he slept in bed by his wife, Tatanysha Hedman. Investigators said Hedman then set her husband on fire.

   Phillips then fled their apartment and drove to a Skyway convenience store screaming “I’m on fire!” Customers looked on as Vincent Phillips dropped to his knees, clearly in agony and begging, “Help me!”

  While the above-quoted story is real, it is frequently circulated on social media along with unrelated images. For instance, when the disreputable web site
  <em>
   TMZ Uncut
  </em>
  (no affiliation to the gossip site
  <em>
   TMZ)
  </em>
  rehashed this story in July 2016, they included an unrelated mugshot and a photograph of a man ablaze:

  We have not been able to identify the woman pictured in the above-displayed photograph,  it she is not Tatanysha Hedman. This picture has been circulating online since at least 2008 and is frequently included in “

  ” galleries. The real Tatanysha Hedman looks like this:

  The photograph of the man on fire also comes from an unrelated event. That image was taken in
  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_pictures/4671773.stm" target="_blank">
   2009
  </a>
  and shows a Romanian man who set himself on fire in some form of protest.
 </p>
 <p>
  So it’s true that a woman set her husband on fire after she discovered that he had supposedly been molesting their daughter. However, the images frequently associated with this story come from two different and unrelated events.
