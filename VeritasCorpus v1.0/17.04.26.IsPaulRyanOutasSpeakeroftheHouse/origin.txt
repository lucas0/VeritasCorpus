  Over the past few months, we have been really disgusted with Paul Ryan and his treatment, or should I say, disdain for President Trump.

  As Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan was unable to work with his own House Republican members, and refused to work with the president on repealing Obamacare. This should have been the easiest bill to pass in the House, as Americans are chomping at the bit for better healthcare. Instead, he gave us bad bill that didn’t make it to the floor for a vote. Now, we’re seeing the same issues when it comes to tax reform.

  Let’s just say that America is fed up with the likes of Paul Ryan, and now there is a poll that should force him to think about resigning as Speaker of the House!
