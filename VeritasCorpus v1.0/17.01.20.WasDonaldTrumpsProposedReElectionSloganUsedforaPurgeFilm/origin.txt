 <p>
  Halfway through his interview with The Washington Post, Trump shared a bit of news: He already has decided on his slogan for a reelection bid in 2020.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Are you ready?” he said. “ ‘Keep America Great,’ exclamation point.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Get me my lawyer!” the president-elect shouted.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two minutes later, one arrived.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Will you trademark and register, if you would, if you like it — I think I like it, right? Do this: ‘Keep America Great,’ with an exclamation point. With and without an exclamation. ‘Keep America Great,’ ” Trump said.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Got it,” the lawyer replied.
 </p>
 <p>
  That bit of business out of the way, Trump returned to the interview.
