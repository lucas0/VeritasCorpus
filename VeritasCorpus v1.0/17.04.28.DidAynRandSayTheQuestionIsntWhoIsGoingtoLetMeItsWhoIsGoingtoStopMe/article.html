   Trump is not the first one to attribute the quote to Rand. In 2013, the young women’s clothing line Forever 21 put the quote on a
   <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alannaokun/this-forever-21-shirt-has-an-ayn-rand-quote-on-it?utm_term=.wfbrWyBmp#.gppGKyX05" target="_blank">
    tank top
   </a>
   (the company no longer sells the shirt).

 <p>
  The quote is often attributed to Rand, an influential writer and philosopher with a cult following best known for the 1957 novel
  <em>
   Atlas Shrugged.
  </em>
  She never said or wrote exactly those words — but there is a similar passage in her 1943 book
  <em>
   The Fountainhead
  </em>
  , said Onkar Ghate, chief content officer and senior fellow at the Ayn Rand Institute.
 </p>
 <p>
  In an e-mail, Ghate told us the passage is part of dialogue between the protagonist, Howard Roark, and another character:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   That “quote” is actually a paraphrase of what the hero, Howard Roark, says in Ayn Rand’s novel
   <em>
    The Fountainhead
   </em>
   in response to a question.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Roark, a young, unconventional, aspiring architect is in conversation with the Dean of his college; they are discussing Roark’s expulsion from school. Here’s the relevant part of the conversation: …
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [DEAN] “Do you mean to tell me that you’re thinking seriously of building that way, when and if you are an architect?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [ROARK] “Yes.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [DEAN] “My dear fellow, who will let you?”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   [ROARK] “That’s not the point. The point is, who will stop me?”
  </p>

  Rand founded a school of philosophical thought called Objectivism, which champions individuality and self-reliance. Objectivism has played an influential role in American Libertarian and conservative politics. She is also seen as an intriguing anomaly as a female writer and thinker who become prominent in an era when the field was heavily dominated by men.
