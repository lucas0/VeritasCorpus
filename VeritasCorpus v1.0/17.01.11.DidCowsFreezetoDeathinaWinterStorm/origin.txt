  Dairy producers in Texas and New Mexico have estimated that the number of animals that died during the recent Winter Storm Goliath will climb to more than 30,000.

 <p>
  The winds are believed to be the cause for many of the animals’ deaths. It created drifts as high as 14 feet and pushed animals into fenced corners where they suffocated, according to The Associated Press.

  “As Winter Storm Goliath wrapped up over the southern Plains, strong winds were associated with the storm’s tightening pressure gradient,” said weather.com meteorologist Quincy Vagell. “When combined with snow, the winds were strong enough to create dangerous blizzard conditions.”

  Executive director of the Texas Association of Dairymen Darren Turley said that an estimated 15,000 mature dairy cows died between Lubbock, Muleshoe and Friona, the primary impact area of the storm, AP also reports. This region includes the home of half the state’s top 10 milk-producing counties, which provide 40 percent of Texas’ milk.

  According to an agent with New Mexico State University’s extension service, the state lost an estimated 20,000 cows.

  “Like all agriculture, dairy producers always operate at the mercy of Mother Nature,” said Turley. “With Goliath, she dealt a particularly harsh and costly blow to the area’s dairy producers, from the death of thousands of livestock they spend so much time caring for to a loss of milk production both over the weekend and in the future.”
