  On 27 November 2016, the web site
  <em>
   The American Tribune
  </em>
  published an
  <a href="http://archive.is/0x2Bo/image" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  reporting that Green Party candidate Jill Stein had been arrested for “embezzling” money donated to her to fund a recount of 2016 general election votes:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   In yet another crazy turn of events this election season, Green Party’s Jill Stein was arrested following a speech in Los Angeles this Saturday. Investigators received a tip from an anonymous source that Stein had hosted a “marijuana dinner party for … some of the richest liberals in Los Angeles.”
  </p>
  <p>
   When asked for comment, representatives for Jill Stein refused to respond. A spokesperson for the LAPD only said that they are “taking the case very seriously, and will update the public with any major announcements.”
  </p>
  <p>
   President-Elect Donald Trump was quick to call out “two-face Stein” for her “rude scheme” to “gyp the whiny liberals!” As of now, the guest list for the dinner party, which purportedly cost Stein $75,000, has not been released. It is unclear whether Stein obtained the marijuana legally or not — chances are some legal shortcuts were taken to supply a large amount of cannabis for an event where medical licenses were not verified.
  </p>
  <p>
   If found guilty, Stein faces fines of up to $5 Million (ironically, the amount raised for the recount), and a sentence of up to 2 years in prison.
