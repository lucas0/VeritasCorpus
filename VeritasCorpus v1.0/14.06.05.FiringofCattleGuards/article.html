  The duality of meaning of the word “guard” (commonly used to reference a person who stands protective watch over property) enables the gag employed here of an official’s mistaking physical obstacles used to restrain livestock with persons employed in the task of watching over cattle.

  The anecdote itself dates at least as far back as the 1950s, according to numerous readers who have written to tell us when they first encountered the legend.:

   Regarding your “Cattleguard” story: That joke has been around since the ’60’s at least!  In 1995 it was old hat. (I’m in
   <nobr>
    New Mexico
   </nobr>
   – land of the cattle guard)

   The Cattle Guard story is a really old one. My father was in the legislature in the 1950’s and he got a letter in the mail saying that the then president was going to fire all the cattle guards. I was a teenager and thought it was really stupid. We are ranchers and know what a cattle guard is!

   Re: the “cattle guards” . . . this is an old, old joke that I heard growing up on a dairy farm in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in the
   <br>
    50s.
