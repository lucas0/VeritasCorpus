  LESTER HOLT: “Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton became in the first woman nominated for president by a major party earlier this month. You said “she doesn’t have a presidential look.” She’s standing here right now. What you mean by that?”
 </p>
 <p>
  TRUMP: “She doesn’t have the look. She don’t have the stamina. I said she doesn’t have the stamina. And I don’t believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country you need tremendous stamina.”
 </p>

  HOLT: “The quote was, ‘I just don’t think she has a presidential look …'”
