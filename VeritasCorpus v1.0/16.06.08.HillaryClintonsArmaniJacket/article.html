  In early June 2016, Facebook users widely shared articles that reported that Hillary Clinton wore a $12,495 Giorgio Armani jacket to deliver a speech on income inequality. The claim’s undercurrent was that Clinton’s interest in the plight of middle-class Americans was visibly superficial.
 </p>
 <p>
  Interest in the claim began with a
  <em>
   New York Post
  </em>
  article that focused not on the jacket, but on Clinton’s general wardrobe choices on the campaign trail. Its title referenced the “surprising strategy behind Hillary Clinton’s designer wardrobe,” and the piece began by noting that Clinton’s appearance and style have been publicly scrutinized and mocked for decades:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Hillary Clinton’s New York primary victory speech in April focused on topics including income inequality, job creation and helping people secure their retirement. It was a clear attempt to position herself as an everywoman.
  </p>
  <p>
   But an everywoman she is not — she gave the speech in a $12,495 Giorgio Armani tweed jacket.
  </p>
  <p>
   The polished outfit was a stark contrast to the fashion choices Clinton has made in the past. As first lady, Clinton wore frumpy pastel skirtsuits. As New York senator and secretary of state, she attempted a more serious look, wearing pantsuits in a rainbow of colors — so mocked that they sparked memes. In comparison to Michelle Obama, who’s become known as a style icon during her time in the White House and appeared on the cover of Vogue twice, Clinton has never been able to nail down a personal aesthetic that works for her.

  The article speculated (but didn’t confirm) that Clinton paid full price for the clothing and did not wear it on loan from its designers. The paper also suggested that Clinton’s fashion choices negatively affected her public perception in the past.  The cost of men’s suits worn by fellow politicians didn’t appear in the article for contrast:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   It’s a marked shift from Clinton’s 2008 run, when she regularly recycled outfits such as blue-and-tangerine pantsuits from DC-based designer Nina McLemore. But just like Clinton’s fashion choices of the past, the makeover could turn out to be divisive. On one side will be those who say it’s an appropriate expense for Clinton, given that she’s in the unprecedented position of running for president as a woman — and looking the part is crucial to her success. On the other side are those who will see her spending as being out of touch with her message.
  </p>

  Not long after Clinton’s 2016 campaign looks were dissected by the

  , a litany of items condensed the article to a single headline:
