  A list purportedly naming dozens of Democrats throughout history who have shot and killed presidents, politicians, and civilians has been circulating online since at least 2012 along with the argument that it should be illegal for Democrats to own guns. Musician Ted Nugent

 <p>
  This list has evolved since it first started circulating in the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012. The earliest
  <a href="https://archive.is/NoN2C" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   iteration
  </a>
  of this list we could uncover only contained five items, but as it spread people added new names and dates and removed old ones that were either irrelevant or disproven.
 </p>
 <p>
  The earliest versions of this list reveal two things: It has always been rife with errors (Lincoln’s alleged death-by-Democrat was originally
  <a href="https://archive.is/85gB7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   listed
  </a>
  in 1863, not 1865), and has always circulated with an anti-Democrat, pro-NRA message.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here’s how “

  <a href="https://www.snopes.com/uploads/2017/06/god-like-productions.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   forum
  </a>
  in January 2013:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Why is it that those who steal guns and kill movie goers and children in school are always Democrats and not conservatives or NRA members?
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Another early
  <a href="https://archive.is/1emMT" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   version
  </a>
  of this list ended — as Nugent’s did — with a “solution” to the gun problem in the United States:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   SOLUTION: It should simply be illegal for Democrats to own guns.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Although the message of this meme hasn’t changed, this list has grown from five items in 2012, to 19 as of June 2017. Here is how it appeared on

 <p>
  Setting aside for a moment the accuracy (or lack thereof) of the items on the list, there’s a logical flaw in using this meme to reach the conclusion that Democrats shouldn’t own guns — or that National Rifle Association members, tea party members, or Republicans are less likely to be involved in assassination attempts or mass shootings.
 </p>
 <p>
  This list is not comprehensive. It does not include all of the shootings that have occurred in the United States, nor the political affiliations of every shooter. It ignores shootings committed by Republicans, as well as those with no political party affiliation, and makes no attempt to show how political affiliation leads to violence. In other words, one could make a similar list naming nothing but Republican or politically unaffiliated shooters in order to make the opposing (and still flawed) argument that those groups should not own guns.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to the logical problems of this meme, much of the information is also inaccurate.
 </p>
 <p>
  We searched contemporary reports for each of the listed incidents in an attempt to uncover any mentions of political affiliations, motivations, or voting records. Many of these items can be traced back to poor reporting, articles that were later corrected, or fake news items. And although we encountered this meme (or a similar list) on a variety of web sites, none of these publications provided any documentation to back up these claims.
 </p>
 <p>
  Verifying this information through online state voting registrations proved problematic as
  <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-list-accuracy.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   deceased
  </a>
  individuals are removed from these databases. We reached out to state historical societies for additional documentation, but several of the states we contacted told us that voter registration records weren’t archived. Even if they were, however, one’s official party registration can often contradict one’s political beliefs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the difficulty of finding the political affiliation of many of the individuals on this list, we are highly skeptical that this list is based on credible information.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here’s a look at what we found:
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   In 1865, a Democrat shot and killed Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   MOSTLY FALSE
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Shooter: John Wilkes Booth
 </p>
 <p>
  John Wilkes Booth was a member of the
  <a href="https://www.biography.com/people/john-wilkes-booth-9219681" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   Know-Nothing
  </a>
  Party. However, some of his motivations for assassinating Lincoln (Booth was opposed to freeing the slaves) aligned with the Democratic Party at the time:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Those ideological differences include increasing the power of the federal government and emancipating the slaves, both things Booth was vehemently against. He was angered that the government instituted an income tax and the military draft, and that the government occasionally suspended habeas corpus, a legal protection against unlawful imprisonment. All these things, Alford says, agitated Booth.
  </p>
  <p>
   “But Booth brought to that agitation an extremism, the passion almost of a fanatic,” Alford says. “And it was very dangerous, as we find out.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Although Booth’s motivations may have aligned with the Democratic party of 1865, they bear little resemblance to the party’s modern
  <a href="https://www.democrats.org/party-platform" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   positions
  </a>
  , which have changed dramatically over the past 152 years.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   In 1881, a left wing radical Democrat shot James Garfield, President of the United States – who later died from the wound.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   FALSE
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Shooter: Charles J. Guiteau
 </p>
 <p>
  Guiteau gave what
  <em>
   The Atlantic
  </em>
  calls an “incoherent speech to a small group of black voters in New York City” in support of presidential candidate James Garfield. Guiteau then claimed that the speech — which he had originally written in support of Ulysses S. Grant — was the reason for Garfield’s election victory. The new administration, from Guiteau’s perspective, owed him an ambassadorship. When he was denied his request, Guiteau set out for
  <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/this-is-the-brain-that-shot-president-james-garfield/454212/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   revenge
  </a>
  :
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   After the election, Guiteau moved to Washington to collect his imagined prize. These were the days when any ordinary citizen could pay visits to officials. Guiteau roamed the halls of the State Department and White House, imploring anyone who would listen that he deserved a diplomatic post.
  </p>
  <p>
   […]
  </p>
  <p>
   He didn’t get the diplomatic job. On one visit to the State Department, Secretary of State James Blaine barked at Guiteau, “Never bother me again about the Paris consulship as long as you live.”
  </p>
  <p>
   The words stung, and set Guiteau off on a bizarre chain of logic, which would result in his demise. Blaine was a menace to the Republican Party. To get rid of Blaine, he reasoned, he had to kill the president. After all, it was Garfield’s fault that such a man served in the State Department. Guiteau heard these instructions from God himself. It wouldn’t be an assassination, but a divinely ordained “removal.” The plan was essentially motiveless, as the the death of the president wouldn’t stand to benefit Guiteau or any Republican. “In the president’s madness, he has wrecked the once Grand Old Republican Party; and for this, he dies,” Guiteau wrote in a letter of admission.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Guiteau was not a “left wing radical Democrat” — he was a supporter of the Republican Party.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   In 1963, a radical left wing socialist shot and killed John F. Kennedy, President of the United States.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   MOSTLY TRUE
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Shooter: Lee Harvey Oswald
 </p>
 <p>
  Oswald was a
  <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/8-things-you-may-not-know-about-lee-harvey-oswald/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   Marxist
  </a>
  and supported Fidel Castro and Cuba.
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   In 1959, Oswald travelled to Moscow in hopes of becoming a Soviet citizen. “I want citizenship because I am a communist and a worker,”
   <a href="http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/other/yeltsin/html/Yeltsin_0021a.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
    he wrote in his request for citizenship
   </a>
   . “I have lived in a decadent capitalist society where the workers are slaves.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  However, Oswald’s inclusion on this list is odd in that there is no claim that he is a Democrat.

  Shooters: Lynette Fromme and Sara Jane Moore
 </p>
 <p>
  Two women in one month attempted to shoot Gerald Ford in 1975: Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme, a member of the Manson family, and Sara Jane Moore, a member of radical leftist circles in California and an FBI
  <a href="http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/female-assassins-sara-jane-moore-and-lynette-fromme-gerald-ford" target="_blank">
   informant
  </a>
  . Both women appear to have had mental health issues. For her part, Fromme appears to have been trying to impress Charles Manson. Moore may have been caught between her loyalty to the FBI and to the leftist groups she was a part of, according to Atlas Oscura
  <em>
   :
  </em>
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   One interpretation of Moore’s assassination attempt is that she had made a choice between the two sides—she had decided to throw her lot in with the leftists and wanted to demonstrate her allegiance. In the days before she shot at Ford, Moore called up the San Francisco Police Department and told the officers there she was considering a “test” of the president’s security system. They took away her gun; she bought another one, and with that gun in her car, sped through downtown in the hopes, she later said, of being apprehended. While she stood waiting to fire her shot, she was thinking about whether she’d be on time to pick up her son.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Moore fired a shot, which a
  <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-attempted-assassins-snap-htmlstory.html" target="_blank">

   shot
  </a>
  . Although both women could rightly be described as radicals, we found no evidence to show that they were Democrats. It appears that Moore and Fromme earned their place on this list thanks to a March 2010 article published by the web site

 </p>
 <p>
  Regardless, we contacted the History Colorado (Hinckley’s last place of residence was in the state), who told us:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   We wouldn’t have voting records in our collection at all. If their affiliation happened to be mentioned in a newspaper article, we might have that, but as the relevant years for Hinckley aren’t digitized (nor do we have digital access for current Denver Post content), it would be extremely difficult to find.

  We also contacted the Colorado State Archives, but they didn’t have a record of Hinckley’s purported political affiliation either.

  describes Huberty as a survivalist who was paranoid about government overreach:

   As a self-proclaimed survivalist, Jmes Huberty saw signs of trouble in America, which was on the brink of ruin, in his view, because of government meddling and overregulation that ruined businesses, including his own. He also believed that the country was headed for disaster because a cabal of international bankers purposefully manipulated the federal reserve system, which bankrupted the nation. To prepare for the inevitable apocalyptic collapse, he also collected a half-dozen guns, including those he brought with him to the McDonald’s restaurant that afternoon.

Last week, after two supervisors reprimanded him, Sherrill told a local steward for the American Postal Workers Union that he was being mistreated. “I gotta get out of here,” he said.

   Instead, the angry mailman returned the next morning with a vengeance. At about 7 a.m. he strode into the post office in his blue uniform, toting three pistols and ammunition in a mailbag slung over his shoulder.

  Shooter: Robert Pickett
 </p>
 <p>
  Robert Pickett, who struggled with mental health issues, was fired from his job at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in 1989. In 1994, he sued the government to get his job back, but the case was thrown out. According to CBS News:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Pickett continued to harbor resentment against the IRS. Police sources tell CBS News he sent several letters to an Indiana congressman complaining about it, and that he seemed to be “paranoid.”

  Pickett fired multiple shots at the

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Doug Davidoff, spokesman for the Indiana Democratic Party, said public election records showed Pickett registered to vote in 1992 but did not cast a ballot and has not voted since.

  as the member of a political party. Instead, for the purpose of political primaries, voters affiliate with a party based on their vote in the last election. Since Pickett never voted, he was never officially a member of any political party.

   Newly-released information on the suspect’s birthdate (which, as indicated in our initial report, was a slight mismatch), combined with new details Breitbart News has obtained about the suspect’s likely addresses, together suggest that the suspect may, in fact, not have been registered to vote.

   Engeldinger, 36, worked his shift Thursday and was told that after a dozen years, he no longer had a job. Then he pulled out a 9mm Glock handgun and committed the largest workplace massacre in recent Minnesota history.

   But in recent years, Engeldinger’s family began worrying about what appeared to be his paranoia and delusions. Two years ago, his parents attended a 12-week “Family to Family” class offered by the Minnesota National Alliance on Mental Illness. The class is taught by family members of mentally ill people.

   His family hadn’t had contact with him for about 21 months after he had shown signs of possible mental illness, said Sue Abderholden, executive director of the Minnesota National Alliance on Mental Illness.

   They were trying to get him to seek treatment; they did think something was wrong,” she said. But Engeldinger didn’t appear to be a threat to himself or others — criteria for petitioning for commitment to mental health care, she said.

  This viral list has been published by a wide range of outlets. However, none of those publications provided any documentation to prove that these individuals were all Democrats. Our investigation found that the majority of people on this list had no official connection to a political party, and that the majority of the incidents were not motivated by politics.
