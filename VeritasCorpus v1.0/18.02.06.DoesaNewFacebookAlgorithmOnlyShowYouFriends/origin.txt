  😬I was wondering why my news feed felt so different lately… Just found out, Facebook has another new algorithm. 🙄 It seems like I only see the same small handful of my friends on my newsfeed anymore (whom I love)… so I’m doing a simple check, with your help! 🙌🏽💖
 </p>
 <p>
  Can everybody do me a quick favor, pretty please?? 🙏🏼

  If you’re seeing this, leave me a comment – just a quick “Hey” or your favorite emoji would be great. The more interaction you have with people, the more friends will show up on your feed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Otherwise Facebook CHOOSES who you see.
 </p>
 <p>
  The following post is circulating among my friends on Facebook. Is it true?

  ❤️Thank You!! I really appreciate it because I want to see as many of you as possible, and know what’s going on in all my friend’s lives! ✨🤸🏻‍♂️🎉

 <p>
  Feel free to copy and paste to your own wall so you can have more interaction as well!

  Excited to see more about YOUR life again 😍
