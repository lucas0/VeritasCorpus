  Decker rejected narratives crediting former President Barack Obama’s economic policies with recently developing economic figures during Trump’s presidential tenure, framing such assertions as “absolutely crazy”: “You look at the unemployment numbers, and it’s 4.1 percent. I look at Obama and Bush kind of combined, when I look at this block of sixteen years. Anyone that says this is inheriting some kind of Obama economy, he had eight years, and in 2010, the unemployment rate was 9.6 percent, absolutely crazy … This idea that it has anything to do with Obama is absolutely crazy.”

  “Trump in one year is already better than sixteen years of those guys [i.e., George W. Bush and Barack Obama] put together,” said Decker, pointing to a current 17-year high in consumer confidence.
