 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Kid Rock (real name Robert Richie) interrupted a Hillary Clinton campaign event during the Democratic convention when he shouted ‘Vote Donald Trump’ and ‘Hillary For Prison 2016’ from behind the DNC presidential contender.
  </p>
  <p>
   After entering the rally, Kid Rock blended in with the crowd before starting a loud ‘Vote Donald Trump’ chant. Numerous people in the crowd were swayed and joined the chant with Kid Rock after realizing he is the American hero who wrote ‘Bawitdaba’.

  However, this story was just a bit of “satire” from a web site that does not publish factual stories:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   We often break news stories several years before anyone else reports them, thus sometimes causing some to have a difficult time accepting the truth.
  </p>
  <p>
   The stories we create are purely fictional. The names we use are completely made up — except when public figures are being satirized.

  Despite Heavier Metal’s disclaimer, at least one web site purporting to be a legitimate publication, EndTheFed.com, republished this story as if it were a real news item.
