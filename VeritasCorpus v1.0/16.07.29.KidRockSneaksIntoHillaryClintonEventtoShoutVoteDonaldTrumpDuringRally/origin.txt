  Kid Rock (real name Robert Richie) interrupted a Hillary Clinton campaign event during the Democratic convention when he shouted ‘Vote Donald Trump’ and ‘Hillary For Prison 2016’ from behind the DNC presidential contender.

  After entering the rally, Kid Rock blended in with the crowd before starting a loud ‘Vote Donald Trump’ chant. Numerous people in the crowd were swayed and joined the chant with Kid Rock after realizing he is the American hero who wrote ‘Bawitdaba’.
