  an image of
  <em>
   Star Trek: The Next Generation
  </em>
  star Patrick Stewart along with the following quote from him about the 1999 spoof film
  <em>
   Galaxy Quest
  </em>
  superimposed upon it:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   I had originally not wanted to see [Galaxy Quest] because I heard that it was making fun of Star Trek and then Jonathan Frakes rang me up and said ‘You must not miss this movie! See it on a Saturday night in a full theatre.’ And I did and of course I found it was brilliant. Brilliant.
  </p>
  <p>
   No one laughed louder or longer in the cinema than I did, but the idea that the ship was saved and all of our heroes in that movie were saved simply by the fact that there were fans who did understand the scientific principles on which the ship worked was absolutely wonderful. And it was both funny and also touching in that it paid tribute to the dedication of these fans.
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  Fandom page members were quite fond of Stewart’s sentiment, and the image macro garnered thousands of shares among fans of
  <em>
   Star Trek
  </em>
  and sci-fi in general. However, some viewers questioned whether the

  aspect of the comment was too amusing to be authentic.

Iterations of the Patrick Stewart meme in that form circulated as early as <a href="http://www.tineye.com/search/3fa5bc83b5cdf81ce646eb30d6e40b0ffc46b594/?sort=crawl_date&amp;order=asc" target="_blank">2014</a>, making the quote at the least not recent. Direct authentication of the quote also proved somewhat challenging, as links cited alongside <a href="http://www.questarian.com/Databank/gq-trek_talks.htm#Stewart" target="_blank">transcribed</a> versions were no longer <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006m9j6" target="_blank">operational</a>.
