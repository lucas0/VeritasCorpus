  In late January 2018, several readers asked about a disturbing Facebook video showing a teenage girl displaying a series of cards alleging that a Georgia judge placed her with an abusive parent. The teenager, Maddie Kelley, claims that her mother had beaten her badly enough to cause bruises and had hit her head against the wall.

  On 25 January 2018, the Adairsville Police Department’s official page responded to comments from one of many people still concerned about Maddie Kelley’s welfare:

   court

  in Cobb County, Georgia found that Mathew Kelley, the child’s father, had encouraged Maddie to post the video, which he later said was “absolutely … a lie.” The court also found that he had violated court-ordered parenting agreements in part by “aiding and encouraging” false allegations about Maddie’s mother, Dawn Kelley, to spread online.

  We contacted the Adairsville Police Department to ask whether there were any further updates, and they responded:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   We appreciate your concern for the welfare of a child. The post everyone is concerned about is actually from 2 years ago. The allegations were unfounded at that time. Hope this can ease your mind about this. Thank you.
