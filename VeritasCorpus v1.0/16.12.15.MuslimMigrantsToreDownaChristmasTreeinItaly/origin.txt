  The band, made up of a dozen boys, hooded probably not to be identified by the surveillance cameras, went into action at one o’clock last night. In less than five minutes they stripped the tree of lights and the star to make it lighter and can pull down more easily. Once the tree came down, the ‘commando’ was going to drag it out of the tunnel where the use of two soldiers on duty in the vicinity has put to flight the young.

  In the past it happened many times that the tree was stolen only to be found in the neighboring Spanish Quarter where it is cut into pieces and used for the feast of St. Anthony Abbot, when there is the custom of lighting bonfires (the so-called stones of St. Anthony).
