  THE PILOT OF INFAMOUS FLIGHT MH370 OF MALAYSIA AIRLINES THAT DISAPPEARED IN MARCH 2013, CAPTAIN ZAHARIE AHMAD SHAH, HAS MYSTERIOUSLY REAPPEARED IN A TAIWAN HOSPITAL ON MONDAY, SUFFERING FROM SEVERE DEHYDRATION AND SOME TYPE OF AMNESIA.
 </p>
 <p>
  The 53-year-old pilot was transported to the Taipei Adventist Hospital by a couple of villagers from a nearby town. They claimed to have found the man while he was lying unconscious on the banks of the Tangshui River.
 </p>
 <p>
  He finally woke up almost 16 hours after arriving at the hospital, but couldnâ€™t remember his name or how he arrived in Taipei. He was quickly identified by his fingerprints, which instantly attracted global attention from the media and from various Asian governments.
 </p>
 <p>
  The doctors who have been treating him believe that he may be suffering from regressive amnesia, caused by a major stress or life-threatening situation.
