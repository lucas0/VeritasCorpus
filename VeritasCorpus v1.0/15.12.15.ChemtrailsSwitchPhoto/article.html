  On 13 December 2015, an image purportedly showing a “chemtrails switch” started recirculating around the internet after it was posted to the web site Reddit.

  Conspiracy theorists pushing the idea that chemtrails exist have been using the above-displayed photo as proof since at least 2014, when it was posted on a JetCareers.com

  and the JetCareers forum noted that the original image was taken of an overhead panel on a Embraer ERJ 145. A

  of this panel from the EMB 145 study guide shows the same configuration as the panel in the above-displayed photo, only the “chemtrails switch” is marked as a “Sterile Light” switch:

  Furthermore, the Redditor who uploaded the photo claimed that they shared the image as a joke:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Just an FYI, My dad is very adamant that the chemtrail theory is utter bullsh*t. He sent me this as a joke. Hot air and h2o = condensation
  </p>
  <p>
   Edit: Just to add a little context to this image, I asked my dad to explain the science behind contrails and forwarded me this as a joke. Apparently this is being passed around by his buddies at work.
