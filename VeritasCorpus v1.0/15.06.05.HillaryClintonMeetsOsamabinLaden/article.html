  A photograph of Hillary Clinton shaking hands with terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden has circulated online (divorced from its original context) ever since it was created for a Photoshop
  <a href="http://www.freakingnews.com/Hillary-Clinton-for-President-Pictures--1303.asp" target="_blank">
   contest
  </a>
  held back in 2007 by the web site
  <em>
   FreakingNews.com
  </em>
  , in which entrants were instructed as follows:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Senator Hillary Clinton officially declared her bid for presidency 2008. Making her announcement Hillary said “I’m in.” This is the phrase she rarely heard from Bill in their bedroom.
  </p>
  <p>
   In this contest you are asked to photoshop anything connected to Senator Hillary Clinton running for president of United States. Examples may be photoshopping magazine covers, campaign photos, or future presidency achievements.

  the picture was proof that Hillary would be too friendly with terrorists if she were elected president. (It should be quite obvious to most viewers that Hillary Clinton could not possibly have publicly met and posed for photographs with Usama bin Laden in the post-9/11 world.)

  This isn’t the first time that a photo from
