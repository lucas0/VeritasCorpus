  According to witnesses, after approximately 90-seconds of Edwards failing to put out his marijuana cigarette, the responding police officers became very agitated and confrontational. One police officer allegedly told Edwards, “We have enough problems in our town without thugs like you peddling drugs”. When Edwards reached for a half-empty Gatorade bottle sitting on the porch next to his feet, Police Officer, Thomas Wright, drew his police issues handgun and shot the 36-year old man 3-times in the chest. Paramedics quickly arrived to Brown’s home and Edwards was pronounced dead on the scene.
