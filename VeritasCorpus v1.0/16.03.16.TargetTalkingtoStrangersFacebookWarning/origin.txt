  I asked them to back up so that I could turn my cart around. I made a rather big deal about turning my cart around in line – because NO WAY was I putting my kid out of arms reach while I unloaded my cart. I kept my daughter next to me and turned the backwards cart at an angle so that I could reach the items to place on the belt. This way, the cart was between me and the women and my child was next to me.

  Again, the older woman asked my daughter’s name. By now, this was the 4th time one of them had asked her name. I replied and said we were learning about stranger danger and she didn’t have to reply. The younger woman answered this by saying “oh at some point, she will have to talk to strangers. What if she gets lost in this store? Try as we may, you’ll take your eyes off of her at some point.” She stared at me as she said this. WHO SAYS THIS? The older woman again asked my daughter her name, to which I loudly instructed my daughter not to answer her.
