  [D]id you know there are people literally watching your Facebook account? Yes. There are people who have a specific duty to monitor your posts and activity. While there are many Facebook secrets, for those who enjoy privacy, this one is for you!
 </p>
 <p>
  Here is what you need to do to block the majority of the accounts that monitor your Facebook:
 </p>
 <p>
  1. &gt; Log into Facebook
 </p>
 <p>
  2. &gt; Account Settings
 </p>
 <p>
  3. &gt; Click on blocking
 </p>
 <p>
  4. &gt; In the search field where it says “Block Users” type in: “Facebook Security”
 </p>
 <p>
  5. &gt; A new window will pop up. The list you see is a list of [most likely] Facebook employees, spies, and private accounts that are paid to shill for who knows who (sarcasm (kind of)).
 </p>
 <p>
  6. &gt; Go down the list, and if you don’t like being monitored, just hit the “block button.” Some of the accounts are unable to be blocked. While this is somewhat disturbing, you must remember that Facebook owns everything Facebook, so in essence, you “agreed” to be monitored. (I know. What moral and reasonable organization needs to hire people to monitor you? Right?)
