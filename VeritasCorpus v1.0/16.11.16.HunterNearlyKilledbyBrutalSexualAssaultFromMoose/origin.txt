 <p>
  A man from Michigan is in a critical condition after suffering a savage attack from a large moose, while hunting in Canada.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jeremy Larsen was hunting with his brother and his nephew near Dog Lake, in Ontario, when he accidentally spilled an entire jar of moose urine on himself. He decided to leave the group and head back to their cabin, three miles away, to change his clothes.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had about a mile left to walk when he was attacked by a male moose, weight around 1200 lbs. Mr Larsen tried to use his weapon to defend himself, but he was rapidly knocked out after receiving many kicks from the mooseâ€™s front hooves.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the poor man was lying on his knees, defenseless, the powerful animal began rubbing his massive genitals all over him, mimicking sexual intercourse.
