  </nobr>
  and as a cell phone text message in February 2010:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>

   </nobr>
   by his step dad. The boy was protecting his

   </nobr>
   sister, in whom the

  Although the story was fresh at the time (brave adolescent interrupts evil
  <nobr>
   step-father
  </nobr>
  intent upon raping the boy’s toddler sister and gets shot six times for his trouble), it was the same old hoax underneath: there was no such youngster whose life-saving medical care would be funded by AT&amp;T on a per-text-forwarded basis. Despite the message’s providing a date for when the shooting supposedly occurred and (in the second version quoted above) a name for the victim, the boy whom people are being encouraged to help is fictional.  (The second version also upped the ante to $12.00 per forward and dragged Verizon into the fray, while a third version added “Facebook companies” to the mix.)

 <p>
  As demonstrated so aptly by public efforts to provide relief to earthquake victims in
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/charity/haiti.asp" target="haiti">
   Haiti
  </a>
  , beneficences initiated by cell phone generally involve a tracking and billing mechanism that requires participants to text a specific short word or phrase to a particular (five-digit) number, not the willy-nilly forwarding of a explanatory narrative to as many people as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  <!--
Our search through news archives failed to turn up any articles about such a shooting or of any young man now languishing in a hospital whose medical care that AT&T (or any other business entity) plans to underwrite, with its beneficence tied to how many times a particular cell phone or <NOBR>e-mail</NOBR> message gets sent around.

 </p>
 <p>
  In 2009 we began to note that “Forward this message to help fund medical care for a sick or dying child” appeals were beginning to appear as cell phone text messages as well as being passed in
  <nobr>
   e-mail.
  </nobr>
  That trend continues into 2010, with the “shot
  <nobr>
   14-year-old
  </nobr>
  boy” just another iteration of the same basic
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/medical/cancer.asp" onmouseout="window.status='';return true" onmouseover="window.status='American Cancer Society Hoax';return true" target="cancer">
   hoax
  </a>
  that falsely claims the American Cancer Society, the Make-A-Wish Foundation, or some other large entity will donate a predetermined amount of money every time a particular message is forwarded. Such leg-pulls have been circulating via
  <nobr>
   e-mail
  </nobr>
  since 1997.
 </p>
 <p>
  Typically, a large charity is named as the benefactor standing ready to direct monies towards the costs of medical care for the languishing child, but various corporations have also been fingered for this role in other iterations of the hoax, such as AOL and ZDNet in the
  <a href="/inboxer/medical/arlington.asp" onmouseout="window.status='';return true" onmouseover="window.status='Rachel Arlington';return true" target="arlington">

  </a>
  prank (epileptic in need of long-term care).
 </p>
 <p>
  Everyone wants to help sick children get better, and the thought of a little boy or girl suffering from some dread disease or infirmity because people couldn’t be bothered to forward a message tugs straight at the heartstrings. Problem is, hoaxsters know that, and they play upon these very human drives for their personal amusement. Once again, that is the case here: Well-intentioned forwarding does nothing towards helping a sick child;  it does, however, make the day of some prankster.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you want to make a difference in a sick child’s life, the best way is still the old-fashioned one: donate your money or your time, not a worthless text message.
