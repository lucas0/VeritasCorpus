   A Couple from Cottage Grove, Minnesota discovers a man living inside a secret laboratory inside their basement.  On Tuesday, officers with the Warrington County Sheriffs Office went to the Morgan family’s home after receiving a call of a possible break in.  When the officers pulled up they saw the Morgan Family standing by the road.
  </p>
  <p>
   They ran up to use and said they heard a man shouting inside their basement and that’s when they called it in to 911 Said Captain Bruce Normans with the Warrington County Sheriff’s Office.
  </p>
  <p>
   Officers say they could hear the man yelling in the basement the moment they entered the Morgan’s home.  But when they moved cautiously into the basement they saw nothing but could hear banging sounds coming from behind the northern wall of the Morgan family’s basement, specifically echoing from behind a large storage cabinet.
  </p>
  <p>
   When the Officers moved the large metal cabinet they uncovered an entry way to a large basement room that was full of various science equipment along with a terrified, elderly man.  The 83 year old man was identified as Dr. Winston Corrigan, a chemistry professor from the University of Minnesota who went missing in the fall of 1984 and was a previous resident of the home.
