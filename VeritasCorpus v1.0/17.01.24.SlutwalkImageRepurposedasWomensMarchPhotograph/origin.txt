  In January, 2011, Toronto Police Officer Michael Sanguinetti made a stunning statement during a sexual assault seminar. “You know, I think we’re beating around the bush here,” said Sanguinetti. “I’ve been told I’m not supposed to say this, however, women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimized.”

  In April of that year Women in Toronto held the first SlutWalk. From that point on, SlutWalk turned into a global phenomenon. The protests and rallies are held internationally during the year. Women dress like sluts, wearing revealing attire, to protest excusing sexual assaults or explaining them on the basis of appearance.
