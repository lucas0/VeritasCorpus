  The 57-year old man was walking to his hunting cabin on Sunday, to see if it had suffered any damage during the winter.
 </p>
 <p>
  All of a sudden, a large “gorilla-like” creature dropped from a tree in front of him punched him in the face … While Mr. Whitaker was trying to recover from the attack, the large humanoid creature began to tear his clothes while letting out some terrifying howls.
