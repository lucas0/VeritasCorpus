   The 57-year old man was walking to his hunting cabin on Sunday, to see if it had suffered any damage during the winter.
  </p>
  <p>
   All of a sudden, a large “gorilla-like” creature dropped from a tree in front of him punched him in the face … While Mr. Whitaker was trying to recover from the attack, the large humanoid creature began to tear his clothes while letting out some terrifying howls.
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    “When I regained consciousness, he had already torn my pants and was tearing through my underwear. I stabbed him in the shoulder with my hunting knife, and that made him run away.”
   </em>

  The item included a photograph of large footprints, purportedly captured at the scene of the incident. That image dated back to at least
  <a href="https://archive.is/UTgtc" target="_blank">

  , and was unrelated to any incidents involving a hunter versus Bigfoot encounter in 2017.
