  Concerned for his nation, but more for his party, Lindsey Graham spoke to Free Wood Post candidly after he announced he was dropping out of the race:

 <p>
  “Listen, the Republican party is f*cked. There’s just no nice way to put it. Look who’s leading in the polls. You have the knucklehead Trump in first place, followed by that sleazebucket Ted Cruz. Then who? Carson? Jeb? Rubio? For f*ck’s sake, they could have at least allowed me onto the main debate stage to actually have a solid voice of reason against the overwhelming buffoonery. As Pussy Galore would say, ‘I’m a damn good pilot. Period.’ And I’m a damn good candidate for president. Too bad the rest of America didn’t have a chance to notice. If Trump wins the nomination, you can kiss the GOP as we know it goodbye. We’re toast.”
