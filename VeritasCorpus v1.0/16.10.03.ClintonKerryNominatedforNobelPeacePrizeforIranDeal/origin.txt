  The nuclear deal clinched between Iran and six major world powers caps more than a decade of negotiations.  The “Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action” (JCPOA), known commonly as the Iran Deal, aims to restrict uranium enrichment for 15 years, cut the stockpile of low-enriched uranium by 98%, reduce the number of gas centrifuges by two-thirds over a 13 year period and opens all such facilities to monitors within the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  In exchange, Iran received a large cash payment and will receive relief from the US, European Union, and United National Security Council sanctions.
