  another interesting detail about the former Alabama judge’s past: According to the web site, Moore co-authored the 2011 textbook
  <span class="a-size-large" id="productTitle">
   <em>
    Law and Government: An Introductory Study Course
   </em>
  </span>
  which contained a section arguing that women should not hold political office:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Alabama Republican Senate Candidate Roy Moore co-authored a study course, published in 2011 and recently obtained by ThinkProgress, that instructs students that women should not be permitted to run for elected office. If women do run for office, the course argues, people have a moral obligation not to vote for them. The course is also critical of the women’s suffrage movement, which in 1920 secured some American women the right to vote.
  </p>
  <p>
   The course, called “Law and Government: An Introductory Study Course,” includes 28 hours of audio and visual lectures given by Moore and others, as well as a study guide. The course is available for purchase on Amazon, where “Chief Justice Roy Moore” is listed as a co-author alongside Doug Phillips, Dr. Joseph C. Morecraft, and Dr. Paul Jehle.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Although Think Progress
  <em>
  </em>
  never said that Moore had personally penned the portion of the study guide arguing that women should not hold political office, the use of the term “co-author” left some readers confused. This confusion was

   The Think Progress

   article, however, never said that Moore personally penned this section. Rather, they reported that the lecture entitled “What the Bible Says About Female Magistrates” (included in the book’s chapter “Women’s Roles in Politics”) was delivered by William O. Einwechter:
  </br>
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   One lecture in the Vision Forum study course on which Moore worked is given by William O. Einwechter, a teaching elder at Immanuel Free Reformed Church. The lecture is titled “What the Bible Says About Female Magistrates.” The lesson argues that the Bible forbids women from holding elected office.

   An unidentified man introduces Einwechter’s lesson and criticizes the women’s suffrage movement.

  “Witherspoon School of Law and Public Policy” that was “especially designed for young men.”
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s unclear if this study course was ever used at a university, or if the material was merely marketed to the men who attended to Witherspoon School of Law and Public Policy conference. Our search for this material turned up several listings on eBay, Amazon, and other book sellers, but no universities.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s also important to note that the Witherspoon School of Law and Public Policy wasn’t an actual school. It was an annual four-day “crash course” that was hosted by Vision Forum in which Moore and other like-minded figures delivered

  to young men concerning a “biblical approach to law and public policy.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Vision Forum describes it this way:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Enter the Witherspoon School of Law and Public Policy, a four-day crash course designed to equip students, attorneys, lawmakers, pastors, and fathers with a Reformation understanding of the Scriptures as the source book for law and liberty and the only sure foundation for addressing the challenging ethical questions of the twenty-first century. The Witherspoon School is especially designed for young men who desire to influence our nation for righteousness and who recognize that, to do so, they must communicate an entire world and life view as dictated by Holy Scripture.

  <p>
   Moore’s entanglements with the Vision Forum are complex. He contributed frequently to its publications, usually on topics relating to law, policy, and government. Starting in 1999, he served as a “faculty member” at the group’s Witherspoon School of Law and Public Policy, a misleadingly named four-day conference open only to men. Moore’s legal foundation, the Foundation for Moral Law, has published recommendations of Phillips’ work, and Vision Forum likewise frequently
