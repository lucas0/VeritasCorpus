  The United States Attorney for Northern Illinois has informed the Department of Justice that it will seek formal charges against the Obama Foundation and indictments against four senior officers for racketeering. The “charity,” as it turns out, spends more money in Chicago than any other city, yet there is literally nothing to show for it.

  The Foundation has a Post Office box in the city but no office. The warehouse they pay for was being used as an illegal poker room. The four people in charge of distributing goods and services to those in need in the city are now looking at serious jail time and the Foundation, still in its infancy, is looking at a setback that may bring it to its knees.
