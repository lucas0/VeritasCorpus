  the above-reproduced image of a partially blinded beagle, along with the

   claim
  </a>
  that it represented the harmful effects of cosmetics testing on animals:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   When cosmetics companies like L’Oreal want to test their products, they often use beagles. They take the potentially toxic ingredients in their products and stick them in the puppy’s eye in large doses to test how much of a product is needed to cause harm. When they finish, they remove the Beagle’s eye and start again on the other eye. When the beagle runs out of eyes, they kill him. This is why we never support animal testing companies.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The photograph caused alarm and concern among animal lovers worried about whether the beagle’s injuries were truly inflicted by L’Oreal (or any other cosmetics brand). A reverse image search revealed that the photograph had appeared years

  published in the Brazilian version of the
  <em>
   Epoch Times
  </em>
  reported that the lab in question had been closed after protests by animal rights supporters and stated that the institute tested “cosmetics and cleaning products” of unspecified origin:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The Royal Institute announced it is ending the activities of the laboratory in São Roque, in the state of São Paulo. The decision comes after the release of 178 beagle dogs, used in laboratory tests for cosmetics and cleaning products, by protesters. The case was widely reported and generated discussions on ethics related to the use of animals in testing. The institute has been investigated by prosecutors since 2012 for their mistreatment of animals.
  </p>

  <!--
The then-ongoing dispute appeared on the translated Wikipedia <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testes_com_animais_no_Brasil" target="_blank">page</a> for "Animal Testing in Brazil," which featured a specific subsection on the São Roque beagle controversy but no information on what kind testing was carried out at the since-shuttered laboratory.

   article
  </a>
  also reported on the beagle controversy but made no specific mention of cosmetics testing at the lab in question:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   A group of animal rights activists have been camped in front of the Royal Institute in São Roque (SP) since they stormed the headquarters of the laboratory, which conducts research for the pharmaceutical and veterinary industries, among others. The protesters, including members of the Black Bloc SP, accused the company of the ill-treatment of beagle dogs used in research.
  </p>
  <p>
   Protests against the Royal Institute began just last year. Activists claim that the company practices irregularities and criminal acts against animals … The Royal Institute defends their research on their web site and says they respect all national and international standards in dealing with dogs in the laboratory. The company is an Oscip (Civil Society Organization of Public Interest) and receives public money thanks to the support of funding agencies for scientific research. Animal advocates say the company does not have licenses and permits for the activities it performs.

 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   For the scientific director of the Royal Institute, João Antônio Pegas Henry, the damage is incalculable. John Anthony said that the biggest problem was not the liberation of animals, but rather the destruction of the building, material, and especially of their research.
  </p>
  <p>
   “[The activists] destroyed the laboratory, including computers holding research data. We can fix the material damage, but the damage to science is incalculable. There was material that was in its final stages after a ten-year study. Everything was lost,” says John Anthony.
  </p>
  <p>
   According to the coordinator of the National Council of Animal Experimentation Control (Concea), Marcelo Marcos Morales, the institute in São Roque is the most important laboratory of the country in relation to such experimentation.

 <p>
  While the precise origin of the beagle photograph purportedly linked to L’Oreal research is unknown, the image was originally circulated as one linked to a 2012 controversy involving the since-closed Instituto Royal of São Roque. Testing carried out at the lab while it was operational was not restricted to cosmetics, and most reports named pharmaceutical and household products as the primary substances researched at the Institute. The photograph has long since been repurposed to claim a number of popular cosmetics brands such as MAC, Avon, Mary Kay, and Head &amp; Shoulders were responsible for the beagle’s injuries.
 </p>
 <p>
  On L’Oreal’s web site, the brand
  <a href="http://www.loreal.com/sustainability/l'or%C3%A9al-answers/the-question-of-animal-testing/frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank">
   discloses
  </a>
  their policy on animal testing, a position a representative for L’Oreal reiterated to us on 27 May 2016:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   L’Oréal no longer tests on animals any of its products or any of its ingredients, anywhere in the world. Nor does L’Oréal delegate this task to others. The rare exception allowed is if regulatory authorities demand it for safety or regulatory purposes.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  <!-- While L'Oreal maintained no animal testing was carried out either directly by them or on their behalf anywhere in the world (except for rare instances where it was legally required), the image was clearly unrelated to the brand irrespective of their policy. Before making its way to English-speaking social media, the photograph was widely linked with an unrelated controversy over animal testing in Brazil. The laboratory widely blamed for the beagle's injuries maintained that it followed all regulatory laws, it was in no way exclusively (or even primarily) linked to cosmetic testing, and has since shut down due to repeated clashes with animal rights protesters. Moreover, the possibility remained that the injured beagle was neither linked with that earlier dispute, and was even then injured in an entirely separate manner unrelated to the Brazilian beagle controversy. -->
