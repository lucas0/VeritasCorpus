  911 first responders found George Zimmerman’s lifeless body at a Florida gun range after responding to an emergency call that he shot himself while loading his weapon.

  “I’m not saying we took our time getting there, but we’ve shown up faster to black neighborhoods.” According to a first responder, they stopped at every light, didn’t use a siren and drove behind an elderly woman all before finally arriving on the scene. “If he was a rapper he’d be more famous now that he’s dead, but nope! Everybody just glad he’s dead.”
