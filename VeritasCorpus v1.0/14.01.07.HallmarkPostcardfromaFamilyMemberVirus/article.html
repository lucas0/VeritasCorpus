  <p>
   PLEASE FORWARD THIS WARNING AMONG FRIENDS, FAMILY AND CONTACTS!
  </p>
  <p>
   You should be alert during the next few days. Do not open any message with an attachment entitled *POSTCARD FROM HALLMARK*, regardless of who sent it to you.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is a virus which opens *A POSTCARD IMAGE,* which ‘burns’ the whole hard disc C of your computer.
  </p>
  <p>
   This virus will be received from someone who has your e-mail address in his/her contact list.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is the reason you need to send this e-mail to all your contacts. It is better to receive this message 25 times than to receive the virus and open it.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you receive an email entitled *”POSTCARD,”* even though it was sent to you by a friend, do not open it! Shut down your computer immediately. This is the worst virus announced by CNN.
  </p>
  <p>
   It has been classified by Microsoft as the most destructive virus ever.
  </p>
  <p>
   This virus was discovered by McAfee yesterday, and there is no repair yet for this kind of Virus.
  </p>
  <p>
   This virus simply destroys the Zero Sector of the Hard Disc, where the vital information is kept.

    Synopsis:
   </b>
  </span>
  Computer viruses have been distributed through e-postcard notifications in the past, but current warnings of such viruses are generally outdated or outright hoaxes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="color: #008000;">
   <b>
    Origins:
   </b>
  </span>
  Many web sites offer a service that allows a user to send a customized “greeting card” (or “postcard”) to a relative, friend, or acquaintance, delivered as an e-mail message containing a hyperlink which the recipient follows to visit the originating site and view the card. Sending out phony e-card notifications is therefore an effective method of camouflaging viruses and inducing unwitting recipients into clicking on links that install malicious programs onto their computers.
 </p>
 <p>
  A wave of malicious messages (like the one reproduced above) sent out in June 2007 employed that very technique, arriving in inboxes bearing subject lines such as “You’ve received a postcard from a family member!” The messages contained URLs that recipients were supposed to visit to retrieve their e-cards, but those URLs actually pointed to servers hosting a variety of malware (including a variant of the
  <a href="/computer/virus/storm.asp" target="storm">
   Storm
  </a>
  Trojan, “an aggressive piece of malware that has been hijacking computers to serve as attacker bots” since early 2007) that was furtively installed onto victims’ PCs. (Generally, only
  <a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">
   unpatched
  </a>
  Windows-based systems were vulnerable.)
 </p>
 <p>
  However, although the fake greeting card or postcard lure for delivering viruses may be used again in the future, warnings like the ones referenced above are several years old and no longer pose any threat to computer users who have relatively up-to-date anti-virus software. For the most part, messages currently forwarded by well-intended people to warn others about the Postcard virus merely contribute to confusion by including hoax elements within them, as well as links to our
  <a href="/computer/virus/virtualcard.asp" target="virtual">
   article
  </a>
  about the “Virtual Card for You” hoax. Other versions of the postcard virus warning erroneously combine it with elements of the

 <p>
  Although the Postcard virus was real at one time, it isn’t now a “BIG VIRUS COMING”, it will not “burn the whole hard disc” of your computer, CNN didn’t classify it as the “worst virus” ever, and it doesn’t arrive in messages bearing a subject line of ‘Invitation.’
 </p>
 <p>
  Since many of these types of malicious messages imitated notifications from legitimate e-card sites, cautious recipients might want to avoid clicking on links contained within e-card notification e-mails. Instead, go directly to the web site of the card company, find the card pickup page within that site, and enter the ID code included in the e-mail. (If the message was a fake, the worst that will happen is that you won’t get a card.)
