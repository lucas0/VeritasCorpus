  White House insiders are leaking news left and right today about a shakeup to the 2020 Trump re-election campaign. According to two different White House general staffers and a mid-level aide in the West Wing, Trey Gowdy sat with both President Trump and Vice-President Pence for several hours today to discuss the “future of the 2020 ticket.”

  Rumors have been swirling around the Executive Mansion for weeks that Mike Pence may feel like he could be more beneficial delivering the state of Indiana and running for Senate to fill the seat of Kelly MaCadoo, who has decided to join the ranks of the RINO and retire in 2020. Pence is the best option to keep that seat and it still put him in a good position to run in 2024.
