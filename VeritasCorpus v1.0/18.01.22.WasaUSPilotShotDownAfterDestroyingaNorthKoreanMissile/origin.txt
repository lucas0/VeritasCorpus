 <p>
  US Air Force Captain Bob Marchand is alive but missing in action after his F-22 Raptor was shot down in what may be North Korean waters. Captain Marchand, whose call-sign is “Fricken Choad,” sent word to his wife from a fishing vessel off the coast of Pyongyang.
 </p>
 <p>
  Captain Marchand had no choice but to contact his wife after the United States military officially declined to acknowledge his existence.
