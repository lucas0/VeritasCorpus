  A friend’s dad is a desk sergeant in the West Midlands Constabulary. Although his job these days is a long way from the frontline in the fight against crime, in his younger days he pounded the beat around Handsworth.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was well before the days of joyriders, ramraiders and serial killers; criminals in those days were an altogether nicer breed. At the time one of his colleagues had an interesting experience. The copper was patrolling a particularly ill-lit street. With his torch blazing, he flashed into each doorway and ginnel, weeding out the homeless and stopping every black BMW he saw, and generally keeping ’em peeled.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was just as well, because his vigilance soon paid off. The flashlight illuminated the front of a cosy old tobacconist’s with the door slightly ajar.
 </p>
 <p>
  Steeling himself for possible violent confrontation, he slowly pushed open the door. Nothing appeared to be amiss, so radioing the station the flatfoot poked around the shop. Then he checked no one was looking and helped himself to 200 cigarettes, which he hid under his helmet.
 </p>
 <p>
  The flustered shopowner arrived shortly, bursting with gratitude, and after checking his goods he praised the policeman’s diligence and dedication to the job. Then he insisted on giving the officer a little ‘thank you’ for his trouble. ‘Here, take these two hundred ciggies,’ he offered.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘No, no, sir, that really won’t be necessary. I’m only doing my job,’ the bobby protested uncomfortably. ‘Anyway, I don’t have anywhere to put them.’
 </p>
 <p>
  ‘Nonsense,’ replied the shopkeeper, reaching up. ‘You can hide them under your helmet.’
