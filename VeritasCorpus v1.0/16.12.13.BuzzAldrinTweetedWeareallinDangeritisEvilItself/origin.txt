  Mr. Aldrin seems to be referring to this object, as seen in an serial photo from Google Earth … As has been reported by worldwide media, US Secretary of State John Kerry recently traveled to the South Pole, allegedly to become better informed about “Climate Change.” Kerry was the highest ranking US government official ever to visit the South Pole, and his visit struck many as unusual.

  Now, with Buzz Aldrin’s tweet, and its strange deletion, folks are wondering if sending America’s top Diplomat to no-man’s land, perhaps had something to do with Diplomacy after all. Is there some entity there with which we need Diplomatic contact? … If so, why did Buzz Aldrin warn that we are all in danger? Why did he call it “Evil itself?”
