   The shamelessness of President-elect Donald Trump and his family is limitless and without boundaries. They do not care about the appearance of impropriety or actual impropriety. That is why Trump’s sons, Eric and Donald Jr., founded a non-profit organization to funnel money through when they sell access to Trump once he is inaugurated. Indeed, Fascism has come to America in the form of an orange failed businessman with a penchant for using racial slurs.

   The non-profit the Trump offspring founded is named the “Opening Day Foundation“, and they are offering Trump’s richest supporters the grand opportunity of private access. However, the access comes with a price tag of a cool one million dollars. Individuals who are rich, but not rich enough to attempt to buy a favor from the president, can also purchase time with either of the Trump boys for as little as $25,000. What does one purchase besides time with Trump? Certain packages include pictures and a private reception with the president. Others include a multi-day hunting trip, or a fishing trip with Eric or Donald Jr.

The unofficial invitation featured several packages which donors could buy, such as the $1 million “Bald Eagle” package (which included a photo opportunity with the president-elect) or the $500,000 “Grizzly Bear” package (which included a hunting trip with Donald Jr. and Eric Trump):
