  A photograph purportedly showing Ronald Reagan meeting with the Taliban at the White House has been shared for many years, along with a quote about the group supposedly from the former President:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “These Gentlemen are the moral equivalents of America’s Founding Fathers.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  This enduring meme is wrong on more than one account. The group pictured is not the Taliban, the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Reagan_meets_Afghan_Mujahideen.jpg" target="_blank">
   photograph
  </a>
  was not taken in 1985, and Reagan did not compare the pictured group to the Founding Fathers. (In this particular meme, even the name “Reagan” is misspelled.) According to the Ronald Reagan Library, the above-displayed photo was

  </a>
  in Afghanistan (and rebel groups elsewhere) so that they could fight against the Soviet occupation, it is inaccurate to say that the former president met with the

   Taliban
  </a>
  , as at that point they did not exist:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   This photograph is from 1983, when Reagan and the CIA were dancing around the idea of arming Mujahadin fighters in order to fight back against Soviet incursion in Afghanistan. The result was a well-armed, well-trained group of jihadis who resisted (some say defeated) the onslaught of superior Soviet weaponry.
  </p>
  <p>
   Once the Soviets retreated, the U.S. lost interest and pulled the funding. Osama bin Laden took interest, and filled the vacuum, later fathering the Taliban.
  </p>
  <p>
   The rest, as they say, is history.

  The quote frequently attached to this photo is indeed a paraphrased version of something said by President Reagan, but he was not speaking about either the Taliban or Afghan opposition groups at the time. He made the comment about

  in 1985:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   They are our brothers, these freedom fighters, and we owe them our help. I’ve spoken recently of the freedom fighters of Nicaragua. You know the truth about them. You know who they’re fighting and why. They are the moral equal of our Founding Fathers and the brave men and women of the French Resistance. We cannot turn away from them, for the struggle here is not right versus left; it is right versus wrong.
