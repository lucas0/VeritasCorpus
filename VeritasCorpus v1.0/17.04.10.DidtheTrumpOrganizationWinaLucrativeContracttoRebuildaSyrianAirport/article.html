  In April 2017, not long after a Syrian military airfield was bombed by the United States, the entertainment web site
  <em>
   Breaking Burgh
  </em>
  published a hoax news
  <a href="https://archive.is/Lmwse" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  reporting that the Trump Organization (Donald Trump’s privately owned development and real estate
  <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-the-trump-organization-2016-12" target="_blank">
   company
  </a>
  ) had won a lucrative contract to rebuild it:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Donald Trump Jr, eldest son of the President and trustee of his business empire, has announced that the Trump Organization has won a lucrative contract to refurbish an airport in the Middle East. He was quick to emphasize this was done without the involvement of the White House.
  </p>
  <p>
   “I can state with one-hundred percent certainty that my father played no role in the negotiation of this contract which was conducted solely by me over the past 24 hours.”
  </p>
  <p>
   The airport, called the Shayrat airbase near the Syrian city of Homs, primarily plays host to a domestic carrier called the 50th Air Brigade. Though still a functioning airport, a number of buildings had fallen into disrepair over the course of the past 72 hours.

  This is not a genuine news article; it is actually a piece of satire from
  <em>

  </em>
  , a web site that identifies itself as a satire blog in its tagline on the front page (“A Satirical Blog Serving Western Pennsylvania and Beyond”) as well as on its “

  This is not the first piece of misinformation to circulate in the wake of the missile strike against Syria in April 2017.  A rumor circulated that the White House had announced that the attack was simply a publicity stunt (which was
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/white-house-syria-publicity/" target="_blank">
   false
  </a>
  ), and another claimed that President Trump owned stock in Raytheon, the company that produced the missiles used in the attack, and personally profited from the incident (which we rated
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/trump-raytheon-stock/" target="_blank">
   unproven
  </a>
  ).
