  On 5 October 2016,
  <em>
   Politico
  </em>
  reported that presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton had been edged out of the news cycle in the final weeks leading up to the November 2016 election by Hurricane Matthew, which (at the time the story was posted) was headed into Florida as a powerful Category 4

   storm
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The story, citing an unnamed source “monitoring TV ad buys,” also reported that the Clinton campaign had spent $63,000 for ad time on the Weather Channel to coincide with the brunt of the hurricane’s hitting Florida.

 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Earlier in the week, we made changes to our TV ad reservations across hundreds of stations in several battleground states including Florida. Less than 1% of those changes included The Weather Channel. We have requested that stations in Florida delay any of those ads on the Weather Channel until after the storm passes.
