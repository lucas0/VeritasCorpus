 <p>
  A narcotics traffic stop on the Downtown Connector turned deadly Saturday afternoon when a man climbed over the interstate railing, fell about
  <nobr>
   35 feet
  </nobr>
  and was decapitated on a wrought-iron fence, Atlanta police said.
 </p>
 <p>
  Officers in a marked car stopped the man about
  <nobr>
   4:30 p.m.,
  </nobr>
  as he drove south on the interstate above Auburn Avenue. The man, who has not been identified, stopped his vehicle and tried to flee by climbing over the railing,
  <nobr>
   Lt. Danny
  </nobr>
  Agan said.
 </p>
 <p>
  Police still are investigating whether the man jumped or fell off the raised interstate.
 </p>
 <p>
  “This is a new one for me in 29 years,” Agan said.
 </p>
 <p>
  The decapitation shocked people who work in the neighborhood. Gary White, an income tax preparer, came out of his office when he heard the commotion. “It’s surreal,” White said.
 </p>
 <p>
  Agan said narcotics officers had been trailing the man for much of the day.
 </p>
 <p>
  Agan did not know if the officers who tried to arrest the man would be placed on administrative leave. “This is not something normally covered under the [standard operating procedure] of the department,” he said.
