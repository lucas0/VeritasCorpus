  On 25 August 2014, the
  <em>
   National Report
  </em>
  published an article positing that the creator of the popular AMC TV drama
  <em>
   Breaking Bad
  </em>
  had announced the series would be returning for a sixth season of new episodes:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Breaking Bad fans around the world are celebrating the stunning, glorious and amazing news announced today: Walter White is not dead, and there will indeed be a sixth season of the wildly-popular, award-winning AMC drama.
  </p>
  <p>
   This shocking and exciting news comes not from an internet message board or the rumor mill but from series creator Vince Gilligan. In an exclusive CNN interview late Sunday evening, Gilligan dropped the bombshell.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Walter White is not dead, and neither is Breaking Bad,” said the 47-year-old writer, director, and executive producer of the groundbreaking show.
