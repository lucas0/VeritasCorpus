  On 23 February 2016, satirical web site
  <em>
   The Hamilton Mare
  </em>
  published a fake news article claiming that Sony Pictures had announced plans to remake the movie
  <em>
   Mrs. Doubtfire
  </em>
  with American actor and comedian
  <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/jonah_hill/" target="_blank">
   Jonah Hill
  </a>
  :
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Sony Pictures, one of the biggest film producers in Hollywood detailed this morning their plans to release a remake of the 1993 comedy Mrs. Doubtfire. This announcement was made 23 years after the release of the original. With many critics viewing the original as one of the funniest films of the early 1990s.
  </p>
  <p>
   News of the person to act as Mrs. Doubtfire’s character was also given today. Taking over from Robin Williams will be no other then the incredibly talented and funnyman Jonah Hill.

  Sony Pictures has not announced any plans to remake
  <em>
   Mrs. Doubtfire,
  </em>
  with or without Jonah Hill. This rumor originated with a web site that states in a disclaimer that its articles are completely fabricated:
