  , a rumor started circulating that Rolling Stones’ guitarist Keith Richards had passed away.
 </p>
 <p>
  This untrue rumor stemmed from a misunderstanding of two literary components: reading comprehension and satire. On 13 January 2016, an entertainment web site called the
  <em>
   Nevada County Scooper
  </em>
  <i>
  </i>
  published a fake news article claiming that Keith Richards had
  <em>
   <strong>
    not
   </strong>
  </em>
  been found dead:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Keith Richards
   <strong>
    Found Not Dead
   </strong>
   in San Francisco Hotel
  </p>
  <p>
   “With a very heavy heart, I am sad to announce that sometime early this morning, Rolling Stones guitarist,
   <strong>
    Keith Richards was found still alive
   </strong>
   .” said  Ms. D’lune choking back tears, “He was found in his suite, sitting in a chair, watching Jamie Oliver reruns on the tele. Emergency personnel were summoned and exhaustive attempts were made to revive him, but since
   <strong>
    Mr. Richards was not dead
   </strong>
   , that was deemed unnecessary.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The
  <em>
   Nevada County Scooper
  </em>
  penned the above-quoted article in a manner reminiscent of a news story reporting on the death of a celebrity. While the entertainment site never wrote that Richards had been found dead, the manner in which the above-quoted article was written fooled some people into believing that the iconic guitarist had passed away.
 </p>
 <p>
  The above-quoted article is a work of fiction. While the
  <em>
   Nevada County Scooper
  </em>
  correctly (although confusedly) wrote that Keith Richards had not passed away, the story about medics being called to the hotel only to be surprised by a living, breathing musician is completely made up.
