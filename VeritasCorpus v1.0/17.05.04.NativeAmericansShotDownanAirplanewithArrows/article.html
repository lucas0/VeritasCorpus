 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Someone sent me this as the natives are protesting all the pipelines being built. Greenpeace supplied all the arrows since they are more environmentally friendly than bullets.

  the same image along with test holding that it depicted President Obama’s plane after he undertook a flight over a reservation in Oklahoma:

   Obama took a private plane flight over an Indian reservation in Oklahoma. This is what happened …

  This photograph does not show a plane that was attacked by Native Americans. Rather, it captures an installation that was created by the art collective

   The exhibition presented in the Molinos Room at the Faena Arts Center consists of the works Avião (Plane), El Barrio (The Neighbourhood) and the site specific instillation Alumbrado Público (Street Lighting). These three works, realized with completely different techniques, are unified by the same question: how far is it good to be civilized?
  </p>
  <p>
   Through an economy of improvisation and precariousness, the artist’s work utilizes industrial objects to ironically challenge the notions of civilization and the mechanisms of perception by juxtaposing affluent western society against a rationed society with minimal consumption.
  </p>
  <p>
   An imposing Piper Comanche aircraft pierced by wooden arrows makes up Avião, a large-scale installation alluding to the development and conquest of space, and symbolizing the cultural shock caused by technological progress in various different civilizations.
