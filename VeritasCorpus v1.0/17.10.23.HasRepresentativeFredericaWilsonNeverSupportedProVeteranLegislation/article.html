  Amid an ongoing public dispute between President Donald Trump and Rep. Frederica Wilson over the contents of a phone conversation Trump had with Myeshia Johnson, the widow of Sergeant La David Johnson, some conservatives have turned their attention to Wilson’s past policies on military veterans.
 </p>
 <p>
  On 21 October 2017, the conservative
  <a href="http://archive.is/W1O7j" target="_blank">
   Western Journalism
  </a>
  web site reported:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Rep. Frederica Wilson has cast herself as the champion of veterans and their families with her recent attacks on President Donald Trump over comments he denies making to a Gold Star family.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, when it was time to cast a vote for veterans, the record shows that the Florida Democrat has not supported key legislation — or any legislation supporting veterans at all, for that matter.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  <span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;">
   The article goes on to accurately describe parts of Wilson’s voting pattern on veterans-related legislation but also fails to mention other bills that she has co-sponsored and voted for, which were intended to assist veterans. Thus, the article gives a woefully incomplete and misleading picture of Wilson’s legislative history in regards to military veterans.

 </p>
 <p>
  The claim, in the Western Journalism article’s headline, that Wilson has “never supported a pro-Veteran bill” is utterly and demonstrably false.

  The VoteSmart.org web site—cited by Western Journalism, and in an earlier

  report—does not exhaustively list every bill which was in any way related to veterans, or had implications, but rather selects “
