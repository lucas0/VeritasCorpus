  As long as we reward people who break laws, they will continue to break laws. We do need a continual flow of immigrants, but choosers need not be beggars. We make decisions based on our needs. People who refuse to comply with the rules must forfeit chances of legalization in the future.
  <strong>
   Anyone caught involved in voter fraud should be immediately deported and have his citizenship revoked.
  </strong>
  The point is this: We must create a system that disincentivizes illegal immigration and upholds the rule of law while providing us with a steady stream of immigrants from other nations who will strengthen our society. Letâ€™s solve the problem and stop playing political football.
