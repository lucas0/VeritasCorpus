  ban, an image appeared purporting to show a #WelcomeRefugees promotion from the company:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Say yes to hiring refugees.
  </p>
  <p>
   Enjoy a COMPLIMENTARY UPSIZE for your handcrafted beverage purchase when you provide the name “Aloha Snackbar” to your barista.
  </p>
  <p>
   #refugeeswelcome

  The image was also

  to the r/The_Donald section of Reddit on 31 January 2017, along with messages encouraging other members to spread it on social media to see if people would fall for it:

   advertisement

  The biggest mistake in the hoax advertisement is that the letter “y” in the word “say” is missing its lower half:

  Providing the name “Aloha Snackbar” to your barista will not net you a free upsize, nor will it do anything to help refugees anywhere in the world.
