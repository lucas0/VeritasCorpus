  Disgusted with Oath Keepers at Woodland Mall. I took my 4-year-old son to the mall for the arcade and a movie with his father. Upon leaving the theater Oath Keepers “security” stopped us and said they needed to radio for approval for us to walk from the theater to the main entrance. When my child’s father stated that we were leaving and did not require anyone’s permission to do so, we were followed across the food court by “security” the entire time, and he was giving our descriptions over his radio.
