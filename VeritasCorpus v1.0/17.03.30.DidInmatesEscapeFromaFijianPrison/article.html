  In March 2017, an undated story from Meganews360.com made the rounds, detailing an alleged prison break in Fij. The headline reads, “BREAKING: Twenty Dead After 85 Criminals Escaped From Cells In ‘Armed Prison Break’ In Fiji.”

  Yet the story begins with an entirely different description, contradicting itself from the outset:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Ten people have died after a “violent prison break”, with 244 criminals escaping from their cells and fleeing the area in what officials have called a “mutiny”.
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  According to Meganews360.com, the Fijian government “condemned” the incident via tweet (it has

  ). A spokesperson for the Fiji Corrections Centre in Suva, where the story was set, confirmed to us that no such escape had taken place. Some aspects of the story, though, appear to be lifted from an October 2016
