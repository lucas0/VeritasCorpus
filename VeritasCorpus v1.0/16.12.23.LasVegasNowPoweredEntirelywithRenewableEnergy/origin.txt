 <p>
  Mayor Carolyn G. Goodman and NV Energy Senior Vice President of Customer Operations Pat Egan announced that we are the first large city in the country and one of the first major customers in Nevada to be served exclusively with renewable energy. We are now one of the few cities of the world that can say all the power we use comes from a green source. In partnership with NV Energy, every streetlight, city park, community center, fire station, service yard and public building owned by the city, totaling 140 facilities, will be 100 percent powered by renewable energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  This announcement comes a year after our partnership with NV Energy was created. The NV GreenEnergy Rider program, our renewable initiatives and the operation of the Boulder Solar 1 plant near Boulder City contributed to helping us reach the goal of 100% green energy.
