  [T]he U.S. government, in accordance with a long-standing but discretionary policy, will hold the evacuees’ passports as collateral until it gets its money.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Consular Affairs:
 </p>
 <p>
  “Anyone evacuated on U.S.-government coordinated transport, including charter and military flights, must sign an Evacuee Manifest and Promissory Note (Form DS-5528) note prior to departure.”
  <br>
   “The promissory note obligates an evacuated person to repay the cost of the transportation to the U.S. government.”
  </br>
 </p>
 <p>
  The cost of the “promissory loan” is based on “the price of the last commercial one-way, full-fare (not discounted) economy ticket prior to the crisis.” In other words, the loan isn’t based on the discounted economy fare that many visitors probably found online to get to Puerto Rico.That’s not all:
 </p>
 <p>
  “Upon evacuation, a Department of State official must limit an evacuee’s passport. In order to obtain a new passport, an evacuee must arrange payment as agreed upon via the promissory note.”
