 <p>
  Stephanie Smith, a 23-year old woman who works as a sex-worker decided to take her job to a whole new level: Becoming a sex robot, being sold and seeing how it plays out. She did it back in December, because she wanted to try it in a month where people “buy a lot of stuff”.
 </p>
 <p>
  The woman got pregnant, and she wants to have the kid. But she doesn’t have enough money or resources to raise the child, so she is filing for child support.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand, the father of the child claims that “He didn’t know it was a real woman” and that he “avoids having sex with real women for this exact reason”.
