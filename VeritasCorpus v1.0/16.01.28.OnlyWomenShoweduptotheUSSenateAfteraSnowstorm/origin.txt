  “As we convene this morning, you look around the chamber, the presiding officer is female. All of our parliamentarians are female. Our floor managers are female. All of our pages are female. This was not orchestrated in any way, shape, or form. We came in this morning, looked around and thought ‘something is different this morning.’ Different in a good way, I might add. But something is genuinely different and I think it’s genuinely fabulous.

  Perhaps it speaks to the hardiness of women who put on your boots and your hat on and slug through the mess that is out there.”
