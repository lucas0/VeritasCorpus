  , you might get the impression that the Fox Broadcasting Company employs fortune tellers and time-travelers to pen the long-running animated show. However, many of these rumors have a pretty simple explanation: The show was spoofing a previous event, not predicting one that had yet to occur.

  That was the case in June 2017 when an image purportedly comparing a screenshot from a 15-year-old episode of “The Simpsons” with a May 2017 photograph of President Trump touching a glowing orb was
