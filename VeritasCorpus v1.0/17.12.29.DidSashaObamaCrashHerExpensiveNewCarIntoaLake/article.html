  a fake news article claiming that Sasha Obama had crashed a Bugatti Veyron into a lake:

   When Barack Obama bought his daughter Sasha a used Bugatti Veyron for Christmas, she apparently loved the new car so much that she immediately took it for a spin. Unfortunately, that car didn’t last long.
  </p>
  <p>
   The former President* put his “hard-earned” speaking fees to work getting the car for his daughter, but it quickly became a $1.1 million piece of fish food when she picked up her friends and promptly crashed it into a lake.

 <p>
  There is no truth to this story. We found no credible reports of Sasha Obama receiving a Bugatti Veyron for Christmas, let alone crashing it into a lake.
 </p>
 <p>
  The DefenseUSA.site does not appear to carry a readily available disclaimer labeling its content fiction. However, there were several ways to tell that this story was just another piece of fake news (besides the dodgy URL).
 </p>
 <p>
  For one, the web site claimed that Sasha Obama had crashed her car into “Lake Hope, about 32 miles outside of Washington, D.C.” This lake does not exist. There is a Lake Hope in Ohio, but we couldn’t find any body of water with that name in the D.C. area.
 </p>
 <p>
  The article linked to a credible news outlet (though it failed to point to a D.C. paper, choosing instead an Indiana publication, the
  <em>
   <a href="http://www.washtimesherald.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
    Washington Times Herald
   </a>
  </em>
  ) to give the impression that the information about Sasha Obama’s alleged crash came from a genuine news report. However, the link led to the
  <em>
   Washington Times Herald’s
  </em>
  front
  <a href="http://www.washtimesherald.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

  </a>
  , rather than a specific article, and the (giant, all-caps) quoted material is nowhere to be found on the paper’s web site:

  Lastly, the story’s featured photograph actually shows a Bugati Veyron that a man drove into a lake in October 2009 as part of an
