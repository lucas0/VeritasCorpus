  The rumor was nearly identical to a cluster of rumors that circulated in mid-2015. In May 2015, a Facebook user asserted she was subject to a similar “near miss” at an Oklahoma Hobby Lobby

  Like the above-linked rumors, the Great Lakes Crossing human trafficking claim resembled many long-circulating urban legends, right down to originating “from a friend of a friend.” The use of gifts to lure potential victims at a mall mirrored the similar (false) story about carjackers using $100

  as bait; another element present in widely-circulated (old) rumors involved ill-intentioned criminals stalking public spaces with laced

  We contacted the
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AuburnHillsPolice/" target="_blank">
   Auburn Hills Police Department
  </a>
  to inquire about whether they’d heard the claim; the individual to whom we spoke confirmed that the rumor was “three years old” and had indeed reached their offices. She stated that police investigated the claim to its source and determined it was “completely false,” adding that information indicating as such was posted to the department’s above-linked, highly informative Facebook page.
