  In mid-November 2016, social media users spread — and political conspiracy-mongering sites such as InfoWars picked up on — a claim that anti-Trump protesters had blocked roads and delayed an ambulance from reaching a hospital, resulting in the death of a man:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The father of a 4-year-old girl died after anti-Trump protesters blocked roads and delayed an ambulance from reaching the hospital, according to an anguished message posted on Facebook.
  </p>
  <p>
   “I have to unfacebook for a few days. I had a patient die during a transfer last night because our ambulance was stopped by protesters and had to drive an extra 45 minutes around the blocked roads,” the anonymous post reads.
  </p>
  <p>
   “I can’t today. They can give their f**king safety pins to my patient’s fatherless 4 year old daughter,” the post concludes.
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  We have to note that the trope of derided protesters selfishly killing an innocent victim by blocking an ambulance is a common one in recent years — it popped up in

  in reference to Black Lives Matter protesters, and it typically follows the familiar pattern of an anonymous social media report lacking in detail claiming that a highly sympathetic victim (e.g., a child in need of a transplant or the parent of a young child) was killed by the actions of uncaring protesters, all accompanied by an unrelated image of a protest in some unidentified location:
 </p>
 <p>
  Back in mid-2016, a similar (and false) report took this form:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Protest in Memphis…Will blow your mind….Just learned that a little 12 year old girl was waiting for a heart transplant-time being very crucial. But the interstate was closed down due to the protest.
  </p>
  <p>
   Her timeline was at a critical state and minutes totally mattered. She had a 45 minute window to receive the transplant, which would have undoubtedly saved her life. But with the interstate being closed down, “Black Lives Matter”, she tragically expired.
  </p>
  <p>
   Very sad. The protest completely shut down the interstate and gave her no hope to live. Oh, forgot to mention, she was African-American.
  </p>
  <p>
   So, tell me, do you think her life mattered????
  </p>

 <p>
  We also point out that even InfoWars isn’t claiming this most recent alleged blocked ambulance death actually occurred; they only opined that it’s “not unlikely” it did:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The report of anti-Trump protesters blocking an ambulance has not been verified, but it’s not unlikely given that anti-Trump demonstrators have blocked roads in numerous cities and states, including the I-94 in Minneapolis, the I-5 in Portland, numerous freeways in Los Angeles, a major highway in Phoenix, and the I-95 in Miami.

  We’ve found no corresponding news reports of any such death occurring (in conjunction with anti-Trump protests or otherwise) in the United States since the 8 November 2016 election.
