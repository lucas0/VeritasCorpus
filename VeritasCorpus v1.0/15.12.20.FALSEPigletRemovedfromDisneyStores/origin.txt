 <p>
  The usually inseparable literary duo of Winnie the Pooh and Piglet will be spending this Christmas apart in Disney’s Retail Store, to respect devout Muslim parents.
 </p>
 <p>
  Disney Stores throughout the United States have reported a number of demands for Pooh products to be sold without piglet to avoid problems over pigs’ unclean status in Islam.
 </p>
 <p>
  Disney has made a decision to appease Muslim complaints by removing all piglet items in it’s [sic] retail stores outside of the theme parks according to a employee speaking on the condition of anonymity.
