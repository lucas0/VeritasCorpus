  If you’re a Muslim living in the state of Texas you can now legally beat your wife for looking at another man, crush the fingers of those who steal from you and defend your sacred Moon God with “the same resolve as if you were defending your person.” This comes after an Obama-appointed Federal Judge ruled in favor of a man convicted of doing all of those things.

  The judge stated in his ruling that a man who had just come from war-torn Syria couldn’t possibly have known that the things that are common and typical to him are against the law in America. Unfortunately, this particular judge has no idea what he’s just done. By overturning the conviction and not just dismissing the case, he set precedent. That precedent, until lawmakers can change it, says that Muslims are allowed to do these things under Texas law.
