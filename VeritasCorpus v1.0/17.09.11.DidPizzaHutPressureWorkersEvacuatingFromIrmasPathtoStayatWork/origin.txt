  <li>
   If evacuating, you will have a 24-hour period before storm “grace period” to not be scheduled. You cannot evacuate Friday for a Tuesday storm event!
  </li>
  <li>
   Failure to show for these shifts, regardless of reason, will be considered a no call/no show and documentation will be issued.
  </li>
  <li>
   Expectation is that all TM’s work their schedule until store related storm closure (unless evacuating), then a 24 hour period will be given.
  </li>
  <li>
   Again, failure to show for these shifts, regardless of reason, will be considered a no call/no show and documentation will be issued.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    In the event of an evacuation, you MUST return within 72 hours.
