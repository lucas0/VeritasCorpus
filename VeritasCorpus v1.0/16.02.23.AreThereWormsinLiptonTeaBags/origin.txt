  In response to the video of Lipton’s Lemon Green Tea bags, there are no “worms” in our tea bags. These are small lemon flavor pieces which have been mistaken for worms. If you put these lemon flavor pieces in hot water they will dissolve as you can see from this video. The tea is of the highest quality standard and is absolutely safe to consume. If you have any questions, please contact us at 1-888-547-8668 or consumer.services@unilever.com
