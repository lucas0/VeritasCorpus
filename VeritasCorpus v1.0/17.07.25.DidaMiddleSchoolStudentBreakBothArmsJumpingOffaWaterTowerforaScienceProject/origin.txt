 <p>
  Grade 8 student Kaitlyn Homan researched water towers for her project, which included a replica of the Ingersoll water tower.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was kind of interested on how water towers work, so I decided to do that for my science fair project,” she said. “I studied a bit on it and I built a model to show other people how it works.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Homan was surprised to discover how water towers work.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I thought they would be used on a pump, but I guess it’s by how high they are up in the air,” she said. “They work by pressure, so that pressure brings the water up it, but it does have an additional pump to help it.”
 </p>
 <p>
  She had no idea about water towers before she started the project, but Homan was eager to learn about something new.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I was just driving by one when we had to think about what we had to do our project on, so I thought ‘I’m going to learn how it works,’ ” she said.
