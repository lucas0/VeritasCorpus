   President Barack Obama shocked the country this morning with news that he is running for a third term.
  </p>
  <p>
   “I can’t abandon the American people now when they need me more than ever,” Obama told reporters at a press conference this morning. “We’ve come this far as a nation, now is not the time to do something different. This is the change you wanted and this is the change you’re getting.”
