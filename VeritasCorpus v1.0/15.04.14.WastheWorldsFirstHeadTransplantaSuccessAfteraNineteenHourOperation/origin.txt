  A 36-year-old man has undergone the world’s first successful head transplant. The ground-breaking operation took a team of surgeons nineteen hours to complete and has allowed the patient to be cancer-free.Paul Horner, who was diagnosed with bone cancer five years ago, was on the verge of death when he was approved for the controversial and possibly deadly operation.

  Doctor Tom Downey, who was part of the South African team who carried out the operation, told CNN he is thrilled about the results.

  “It’s a massive breakthrough,” Downey said. “We’ve proved that it can be done — we can give someone a brand new body that is just as good, or better, than their previous one. The success of this operation leads to infinite possibilities.”
