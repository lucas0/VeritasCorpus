  The changes were made by H.B. 1774. The provisions in that bill hamper your ability to challenge your insurance company if they slow pay, low pay, or deny your claim.

Again, this law makes it harder for you to get the insurance companies to pay what they are supposed to pay when they are supposed to pay it.
