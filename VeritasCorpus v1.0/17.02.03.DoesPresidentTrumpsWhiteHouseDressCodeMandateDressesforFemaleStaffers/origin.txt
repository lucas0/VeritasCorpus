  As a former owner of beauty pageants, President Donald Trump is known to be very critical of one’s physical appearances, and he has apparently taken that trait with him into the White House.

  The former “Celebrity Apprentice” host also judges women’s appearances, an anonymous Trump campaign source said. Even if they wear jeans, they “need to look neat and orderly,” the source added. In most cases, Trump wants women who work for him “to dress like women.”
