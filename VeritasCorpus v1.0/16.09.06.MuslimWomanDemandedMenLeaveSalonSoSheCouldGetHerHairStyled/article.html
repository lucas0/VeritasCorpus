  On 5 September 2016, the web site
  <em>
   MadWorldNews
  </em>
  posted a story about an incident in a Norwegian hair salon that began as follows:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   A Muslim woman [named Malika Bayan’] walked into a hair salon for men and women and immediately demanded that she be served without men around so that she can remove her headscarf. Unfortunately for her, she quickly realized that she brought her entitlement to the wrong hairdresser.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The story went on to praise the hairstylist, Merete Hodne, for refusing to “bow” to Sharia law by accommodating Bayan’s alleged demand:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Thanks to political correctness that gives Muslim special privilege, Hodne has already been fined over $1,000 by the police, however, she’s sticking to her beliefs by refusing to pay the fine, according to RT. She is due in court for the violation and faces a possible 6-month jail sentence. Still, she says she will never cave.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  According to Norwegian news reports, the original incident happened in October 2015, when Bayan was in the town of Bryne, Norway, comparing salon prices. Neither Bayan nor Hodne were quoted in news accounts as claiming that Bayan had demanded Hodne’s male customers vacate the premises so she could have her hair done. Rather, Bayan asserted that Hodne had discriminated against her by preemptively refusing service to her, while Hodne

   said
  </a>
  that she didn’t want Bayan in her shop and asked her to leave because she believes Islam is evil:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   … 23 year old Malika Bayan was wearing a hijab when she entered the salon and asked what it cost for  highlights. Hodne told her to get out and find somewhere else to get her hair done.
  </p>
  <p>
   “It can not possibly be evil just to open a door to a salon to ask for the price of highlights. I feel deeply offended when I am treated in this manner in public in my own country. And just because I wear a scarf on my head,” [Bayan said].
  </p>
  <p>
   “I do not want evil coming through my doors if I have any choice.  Islamic ideology is evil, and the hijab is the symbol of this ideology, just as the swastika is for Nazism,” said Hodne.
