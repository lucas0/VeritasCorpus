  In early January 2016, a 25 August 2015
  <em>
   The Portly Gazelle
  </em>
  article titled “Scarface Remake Starring Leonardo DiCaprio Announced For 2016” began recirculating on social media; it claimed:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Universal Studios, one of the biggest players in Hollywood made a huge announcement this morning that will no doubt drive film fans into a frenzy – 32 years after it’s release,  the legendary crime-drama Scarface is getting a remake – and what’s more, the flick is starring none other than Leonardo DiCaprio himself.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the press release, Universal Studios revealed that they had been planning a remake since 2002, but that they had not been able to find anyone who they thought could live up to Al Pacino’s august performance in the original.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  However, no such press release was issued in August 2015, or in the intervening months. A disclaimer at the bottom of every
  <em>
   The Portly Gazelle
  </em>
  page explained:
 </p>
 <blockquote>

  While

  isn’t one of the better-known fake news
  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2016/01/14/fake-news-sites/" target="_blank">
   sites

  , the site similarly took in social media users with claims of a

   remake

  in September 2015. Around the same time, Facebook and Twitter users inadvertently got their hopes up for a
