   Huma Abedin

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Weiner, in a sworn federal affidavit, claimed that the emails were put there by Abedin to protect Clinton and that if he didn’t keep his mouth shut he would be “joining Vince Foster.” Clinton is expected to be charged with corruption, murder and perjury at some point in 2017.
