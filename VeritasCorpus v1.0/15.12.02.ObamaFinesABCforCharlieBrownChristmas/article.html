   article

  titled “Obama Fines ABC For Broadcasting Charlie Brown Christmas; FCC Cites Christian Bias,” which claimed:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The Federal Communications Commission, acting on an executive order issued by Barack Obama, fined the ABC television network for airing A Charlie Brown Christmas, because several overtly Christian references were found to be “potentially damaging, offensive and exclusionary” to non-Christians, according to a Commission spokesperson.
  </p>
  <p>
   Speaking on behalf of the FCC, legal counsel Khalid Soetoro wrote:
  </p>
  <p>
   We respectfully submit a request to halt future network-based airings of the referenced work A Charlie Brown Christmas unless and until equal time is granted for non-Christian and/or secular programming.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
