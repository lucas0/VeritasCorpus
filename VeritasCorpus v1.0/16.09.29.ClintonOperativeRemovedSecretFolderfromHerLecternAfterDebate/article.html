  The 2016 major party presidential candidates squared off one-on-one for the first time on 26 September at Hofstra University in New York in the first of three debates. While voters mulled over what Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump had said about the issues (and each other), Internet conspiracy theorists and fake news web sites honed in on the implausible notion that Clinton had been

  with the debate questions ahead of time, giving her an unfair advantage over her opponent.
 </p>
 <p>
  For instance, the clickbait web site MadWorldNews.com, which is dedicated to spreading Islamophobic stories and other bizarre yarns with headlines such as “U.N. Sides with U.S. Black Lives Matter, Orders Whites Do Sick Thing for Blacks” shared a story claiming that a man seen in television footage taking a papers off Clinton’s lectern just after the conclusion of the first debate was a “cleaner,” or a Clinton operative, who was tasked with removing evidence of some illicit activity:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   It’s just a few seconds of video, but it is a few seconds that changes everything. A Hillary staffer, who is called the “Cleaner,” swooped in after she walked away from her podium, and he took all the papers that were on her podium. He put her notes in a file and carried them under his arm as he looked over at moderator Lester Holt.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Cleaner then walked to the side of the stage, not sure of where to go. He waited for a moment until Holt got up, and then the “Cleaner” started to walk toward Holt. They met at mid-stage as the “Cleaner” looked intently at Holt.
  </p>
  <p>
   Holt’s face cannot be seen in the clip, but as they brushed past each other, the “Cleaner” seemed like he wanted to hand over the notes to Holt, but then he just nods. Again, it’s just a few seconds, but when you watch it from the time the “Cleaner” swoops in and clears Hillary’s podium to when he walks over to Holt, it is evident that something fishy is going on.

  A bespectacled, white-haired man can be seen entering the frame at the end of the debate, but what can also be seen in the same camera angle is that both Clinton and Trump had papers on their lecterns, most likely notes they were taking during the debate. At the 1:35:20 mark in the below shown video, papers are visible on both Clinton’s and Trump’s lecterns:

  The “cleaner” can be seen collecting the contents of Clinton’s lectern (which look like a notepad) then walking in the direction of Trump’s:
