  On 15 June 2016, the entertainment web site
  <em>
   Political Garbage Chute
  </em>
  <em>
  </em>
  published a satirical article reporting that a woman performed her own abortion with a “U-Abort It™” attachment for her AR-15 assault rifle:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   “Once I found out that I had more rights to a firearm than I did to control my own biological bodily functions,” Ms. Sampson told us, “I knew exactly what I had to do. So I went down to Liberty Gun and Ammo and bought myself a Bushmaster AR-15. I was going to end this pregnancy one way or another.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Given that the AR-15 is a high-powered rifle, Sampson knew it would take some modification to use in her own abortion. Luckily for Jane, Bushmaster has a special line of U-Abort It™ rifle accessories that can be added to the AR-15, allowing it to be used with surgical precision.

  This article is a work of fiction by the entertainment web site
  <em>
   Political Garbage Chute.
  </em>
  While the web site does not have a readily available disclaimer, the “about us” section on its
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThePoliticalGarbageChute/info/?entry_point=page_nav_about_item&amp;tab=page_info" target="_blank">
   Facebook
  </a>
  page states that the web site is intended as satire:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Devoted to political satire, humor and commentary. Rated “Most Trustworthless and Ackurate Web-Sight” by Snopes.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  (We didn’t rate it that way.)
 </p>
 <p>
  While the quoted article was originally published on the entertainment web site
  <em>
   Political Garbage Chute,
  </em>
  many readers didn’t encounter this story until it was
  <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-schlarmann/florida-rape-victim-skirt_b_10489358.html" target="_blank">
   republished
  </a>
  on
  <em>
   Huffington Post.
  </em>
  This confused some readers, as
  <em>
   Huffington Post
  </em>
  is not generally known to publish satire and humor.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the article was posted in the web site’s entertainment section, and was preceded by a note directing readers to
  <em>
   Political Garbage Chute
  </em>
  for more satire and fake news.
