  In March 2015, the entertainment web site
  <em>
   National Report
  </em>
  published an article reporting that former First Lady Nancy Reagan had endorsed Hillary Clinton for president:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Last week, during a promotional press conference for The History Channel’s upcoming series “First Ladies in Their Own Words,” series’ host Ron Reagan shared clips of his interviews with all living former First Ladies of the United States. In a brief video clip with his mother Nancy Reagan, she offered her endorsement of Hillary Clinton as President saying, “The time for a woman to serve as our President has come – really, now is the time – and I think the idea of having a former First Lady as the leader of the free world is really quite a marvelous notion. I want Hillary to win. Even though I admire two of the current potential Republican nominees, I have no interest in seeing either of them lead this country.”

  While most fake news articles have a relatively short life cycle, this piece continued to fool readers months after its original publication. In February 2016, it was frequently shared on social media:
