  </em>
  tweeted a video titled “5 Things to Know About Sean Spicer,” with the text of the tweet spoofing the White House press secretary by asserting that his “role in the Trump administration will be to provide the American public with robust and clearly articulated misinformation”:

  In an unusual development, Spicer himself retweeted

  ‘s tweet, adding:

  The popularity of Sean Spicer’s retweet as a screenshot on social media and blogs, coupled with the prevalence of spoofed or fabricated tweets, led to some confusion about its legitimacy. Spicer did indeed retweet The Onion item, although his intent in sharing and commenting on it is unclear.
