  On 14 February 2017, the Facebook group “MediaTakeout” published a
  <a href="https://archive.is/7nsIH" target="_blank">
   video
  </a>
  that purportedly showed federal troops in an armored tank patrolling areas of Chicago at President Donald Trump’s behest:

 <blockquote>

  Within a few days of its initial posting, the
  <em>
   MediaTakeout
  </em>
  video was viewed more than two million times, but it does not show federal troops. Instead, this appears to be a SWAT vehicle called a Lenco
  <a href="http://www.lencoarmor.com/law-enforcement/" target="_blank">
   BearCat
  </a>
  that is owned and operated by the city of Chicago.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, the words “Chicago Police” can clearly be glimpsed on the side of the vehicle as it passes by the camera at around the 15 second mark:

   While we have not been able to track down the exact date this video was published, Chicago started using the BearCat long before Trump became president. The city has been using similar armored vehicles since at least
