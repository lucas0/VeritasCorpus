  UPS lost a bank draft containing a Canadian family’s $846,000 inheritance, and then initially tried making things right by offering to refund a mere $32 shipping fee.

 <p>
  The drama began in February, when, Louis Paul Herbert told CBC, his family was going over his father’s will and dividing money between family members. Herbert said he went to a UPS store near Cornwall, Ontario, to pick up a package his sister, Lorette Taylor, had sent him containing a bank check with his part of the fortune.

  But the check never arrived.

  “I’m waiting at the UPS store, around 3 p.m. because that’s when they said the guys came in — nothing shows up,” Herbert told CBC News. “I came back in the evening. Nothing shows up…and I’m wondering, ‘What’s happened to my inheritance?’”
