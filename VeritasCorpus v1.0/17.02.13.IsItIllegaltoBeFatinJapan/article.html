  In January 2008, Japan passed the “Metabo Law” in an effort to curb obesity in that country. While the law does require men and women between the ages of 45 and 74 to have their waistlines examined once a year and potentially seek medical treatment if their measurements fall outside established ranges, it did not establish obesity as a criminal offense.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Metabo Law was named after
  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/metabolic-syndrome/basics/definition/con-20027243" target="_blank">
   metabolic syndrome
  </a>
  , a group of conditions, including high blood pressure and excess body fat, that can increase the risk of serious medical ailments:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of
   <nobr>
    conditions — increased
   </nobr>
   blood pressure, a high blood sugar level, excess body fat around the waist and abnormal cholesterol
   <nobr>
    levels — that
   </nobr>
   occur together, increasing your risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Having just one of these conditions doesn’t mean you have metabolic syndrome. However, any of these conditions increase your risk of serious disease. If more than one of these conditions occur in combination, your risk is even greater.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you have metabolic syndrome or any of the components of metabolic syndrome, aggressive lifestyle changes can delay or even prevent the development of serious health problems.

Unlike individuals, however, companies and local governments can be assessed financial penalties if the citizens in their charge do not meet government standards:
