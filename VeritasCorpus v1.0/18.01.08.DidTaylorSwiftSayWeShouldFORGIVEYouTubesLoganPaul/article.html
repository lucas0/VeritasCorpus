  The footage of Paul’s Tokyo visit has brought about criticism against not only him but
  <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/logan-paul-video-youtube-reckoning/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   YouTube
  </a>
  itself for continuing to allow Paul to make money off of his off-kilter and often ill-mannered content. Paul has taken a hiatus from broadcasting after releasing written and video apologies for his actions.

 <p>
  E! News (which is actually

  on Twitter) did not comment on the fabricated story. We also contacted police in the Yamanashi Prefecture of Japan concerning

  that they are seeking to question Paul.

  The fake E! account also posted a

   tweet

  made up of fake statements attributed to another singer, Mariah Carey:

 <p>
  Mariah Carey on Woody Allen: ‘He’s made mistakes, sure… But so have we all, it’s time for forgiveness.’
