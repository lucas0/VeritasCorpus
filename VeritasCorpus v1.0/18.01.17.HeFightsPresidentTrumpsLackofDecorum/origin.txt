  Trump has been criticized for his bluntness and sometimes crude remarks. But Marshall Kamena provides the reader with something to think about. Read on …..
 </p>
 <p>
  Marshall Kamena is a registered democrat and was elected mayor of Livermore, CA. He ran on the democratic ticket as he knew a Bay Area city would never vote for a republican. He is as conservative as they come. He wrote the following and it is a good read:

  Trump’s lack of decorum, dignity, and statesmanship
 </p>
 <p>
  My Leftist friends (as well as many ardent #NeverTrumpers) constantly ask me if I’m not bothered by Donald Trump’s lack of decorum. They ask if I don’t think his tweets are beneath the dignity of the office.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Here’s my answer:
 </p>
 <p>
  We Right-thinking people have tried dignity. There could not have been a man of more quiet dignity than George W. Bush as he suffered the outrageous lies and politically motivated hatreds that undermined his presidency.
 </p>
 <p>
  We tried statesmanship. Could there be another human being on this earth who so desperately prized collegiality as John McCain?
 </p>
 <p>
  We tried propriety has there been a nicer human being ever than Mitt Romney?
 </p>
 <p>
  And the results were always the same. This is because, while we were playing by the rules of dignity, collegiality and propriety, the Left has been, for the past 60 years, engaged in a knife fight where the only rules are those of Saul Alinsky and the Chicago mob.
 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t find anything dignified, collegial or proper about Barack Obama’s lying about what went down on the streets of Ferguson in order to ramp up racial hatreds because racial hatreds serve the Democratic Party. I don’t see anything dignified in lying about the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi and imprisoning an innocent filmmaker to cover your tracks. I don’t see anything statesman-like in weaponizing the IRS to be used to destroy your political opponents and any dissent. Yes, Obama was articulate and polished but in no way was he in the least bit dignified, collegial or proper.”
