  PSA:Â Christian-Owned Airline Companies change the lights on the wings to celebrate Christmas, without considering whether the passengers on the plane celebrate Christmas. If you are flying this season, please let the gate agent know you do not celebrate Christmas and they will swap the bulbs out for you[!] Please SHARE SHARE SHARE[!]
