  Here’s a guy walking on the beach at surf breaking on the sand and he gets snatched in an instant. No blood no
  <nobr>
   struggle …
  </nobr>
  just gone!
 </p>
 <p>
  Very graphic! He happened to be waving at a friend taking a film of him, and it was his last wave!

 <p>
  If his friend hadn’t been filming, or even looking in that direction there would have been no proof. He was just gone in less than a heartbeat. Too scary …
