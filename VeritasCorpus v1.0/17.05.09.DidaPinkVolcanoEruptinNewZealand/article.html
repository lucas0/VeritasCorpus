   social media
  </a>
  , along with a claim that it shows an actual “pink volcano” erupting in New Zealand:

  The video does not explain what chemical process might turn smoke or steam this particular shade (although with the proper dyes, it is possible to turn smoke into a veritable

  The “pink volcano” video was created by artist
  <a href="https://www.behance.net/Filiphds" target="_blank">
   Filip Hodas
  </a>
  , and was originally
  <a href="https://archive.is/n7Ga7" target="_blank">
   shared
  </a>
  to his

   Facebook

  page in December 2016. Hodas posted the video to
  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BNdJ84NAJ4o/?taken-by=hoodass" target="_blank">
   Instagram
  </a>
  (with tags such as #3D, #photoshop, #render, and #animation), and provided extra insight into how the video was created in response to a query on Facebook:

   pretty much! depends on what I need. In this case I layered few planes with wm maps on top of each other and added a lot of zdepth fog to blend it in.

  No records of volcanos emitting bright pink smoke exist, except those created by digital artists.
