  CAUTION! 🛑 We want to share a warning with everyone. ⚠️ We had a patient come in today. He had used Crayola Bathtub Fingerpaint Soap and it BURNED his hands. Luckily only his hands. We’re talking layers of skin gone! We have permission to share. She has attempted to contact the company 3 times with no reply. She purchased it at Wal-Mart but it’s sold everywhere. Most Amazon reviews are great but we found a ton of bad ones with kids having terrible rashes or more burns.
