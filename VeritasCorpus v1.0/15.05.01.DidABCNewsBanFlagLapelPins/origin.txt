   Dear friend,
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Yesterday, the brass at ABC News issued orders forbidding reporters to wear lapel pin American flags or other patriotic insignia. Their reasoning was that ABC should remain neutral about “causes”. Since when is support for preventing our death &amp; destruction some sort of a cause? Since when is patriotism to be discouraged. I urge you to boycott ABC and its sponsors and affiliates.

 <p>
  Please forward this to as many as you can.

  Goodbye to ABC.
  <br>
   ABC News Joins Obama and Bans American Flag Lapel Pins!
   <br/>
   ABC NEWS BANS FLAG LAPEL PINS
   <br/>
   This is what we get from the present attitudes in Washington.
   <br/>
   Barbara Walters said that this was going to hurt ABC bad. And she works
   <br/>
   for ABC.
   <br/>
   YESTERDAY THE BRASS AT ABC NEWS ISSUED ORDERS FORBIDDING REPORTERS TO WEAR
   <br/>
   LAPEL PIN AMERICAN FLAGS OR OTHER PATRIOTIC INSIGNIA.
   <br/>
   THEIR REASONING WAS THAT ABC SHOULD REMAIN NEUTRAL ABOUT ‘CAUSES’.
   <br/>
   SINCE WHEN IS PATRIOTISM TO BE DISCOURAGED?
   <br/>
   I URGE YOU TO BOYCOTT ABC AND ITS SPONSORS AND AFFILIATES.
   <br/>
   WE ARE SLOWLY LOSING EVERYTHING OUR COUNTRY STANDS FOR AND EVERYTHING OUR
   <br/>
   MEN AND WOMEN FOUGHT AND DIED TO PRESERVE!
   <br/>
   PLEASE FORWARD THIS TO AS MANY AS YOU CAN.
  </br>
 </p>
 <p>
  THIS ONE NEEDS TO BE CIRCULATED…QUICKLY
 </p>
