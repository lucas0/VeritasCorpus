  President Obama quickly papered over the fact that he gave Iran $400,000,000 to release hostages, but it appears that now Hillary Clinton may have given ISIS $400,000,000 accidently.

 <p>
  So everyone can agree that the $400 million sent to Iran by President Obama can be viewed as skeptical. Yes we received hostages back, but at the same time Iran got all this money and who knows what they are going to do with it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The White House tried to frame the money sent as anything but a ransom. They instead claimed it was the “first installment of the $1.7 billion in the United States seized in 1979 after an arms deal with the Shah of Iran was halted following the Islamic revolution.”
 </p>
 <p>
  But everyone can assume that it was really a ransom. No matter which way you frame it, people are going to suspect it was a ransom payment.
