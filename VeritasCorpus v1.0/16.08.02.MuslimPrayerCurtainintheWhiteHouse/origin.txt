  For a long time, I have noticed that the decor at the White House has changed since BHO moved in. The Oval Office is now stripped of the traditional red, white, and blue, and replaced with middle eastern wallpaper, drapes, and decor. The hallway that he walks out of to talk to the press now has middle eastern chairs, drapes, etc. And the thing that has bothered me the most is the bright yellow drape behind him every time he speaks from the white house. It’s a Muslim prayer curtain with Arabic symbols on it and has been there from the beginning.

  What is missing at Barack Hussein Obama’s press conference?

  No it is not the teleprompters. See the other president’s pics for a clue.

 <p>
  And I don’t believe it was just an accident! It is intentional. So I ask, why is it intentional? He told you he would change America, didn’t he?
