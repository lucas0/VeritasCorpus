  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  series of books and films were circulated on social media in March 2017:

  The photographs were published by the web site
  <em>
   Zambian Observer
  </em>
  in an
  <a href="https://archive.is/GVPPr" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  reporting that this strange figure had been spotted in the skies above a shopping mall in Zambia. The article asserted that some locals ran away in fear, believing the figure was a manifestation of God, while others stayed to worship it. An alleged eye-witness was even quoted in the account account:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   There was drama today in Kitwe at mukuba mall when a strange image that look like a human appeared in the clouds.
  </p>
  <p>
   According to eye witnesses say the strange image that looked like a human was in the sky for over 30 minutes while looking down at the mall.
  </p>
  <p>
   This forced people who were shopping scampering in different directions thinking that God had finally come.
  </p>
  <p>
   “we were shocked to see images that looked like a human in the clouds for close to 30 minutes, others started worshiping but others ran away. It was so strange” said an eye witness.

  and

  aggregated the story, adding some appeal by stating that the figure resembled a Dementor from the
  <em>
   Harry Potter
  </em>
  literary franchise:
