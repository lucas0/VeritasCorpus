  The man in the image is not Donald Trump. This photograph was taken by Alison Jackson, an artist known for using celebrity lookalikes to create staged paparazzi-style images. A description of Jackson’s work

  on her web site:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Alison Jackson is renowned for her explorations into how photography and the cult of the celebrity have transformed our relationship to what is ‘real’. Her notorious photographic portraits, life-like sculptures, films and videos are startlingly realistically staged affairs that cast uncannily styled actors into an entirely fathomable projection of a future that could have been; or the intimate, often salacious, imagined private moments of media icons such as Diana Princess of Wales, the Queen of England, Marilyn Monroe, George Bush, Brad and Angelina, and David Beckham. Jackson’s productions stress-test the implicit belief that a photograph can capture a frozen moment of ‘truth’.
