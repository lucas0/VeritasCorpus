 <blockquote>
  <p>
   A Newark woman died from getting a maggot infested weave sewn into her hair. According to authorities, Banks’ died from an infestation of maggots in her head.

   Sharonda Banks, 28, of Newark was found dead in her apartment on the 200 block of S. 17th Street.

  The article text was copied almost word-for-word from another fake news site, EmpireHerald.com, where it had been posted approximately five months earlier.

  The maggot-infested weave tale is essentially a rehash of an
