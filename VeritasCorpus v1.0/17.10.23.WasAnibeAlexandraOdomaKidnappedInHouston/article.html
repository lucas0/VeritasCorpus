  A child’s kidnapping in Nigeria in late 2016 was erroneously said to have occurred in Houston, Texas, in posts that began circulating
  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BUx6RS6FRxm/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   online
  </a>
  in May 2017.
 </p>
 <p>
  The post featured a picture of a child identified as five-year-old Anibe Alexandra Odoma and stated:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>

   <br>
    She’s from Houston Texas
    <br/>

   </br>
  </p>
  <p>
   Forwarded as received
  </p>
  <p>
   This happened last night.
   <br/>
   Pls help anyway you can
   <br/>

   <br/>

   <br/>

  Neither the Houston Police Department nor the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children have a record matching Anibe’s description. However, the same picture also circulated in December 2016 attached to a story about an abduction in the Nigerian city of Abuja on 11 December 2016, which also included two phone numbers for people to call if they had information:

  Two days later the news web site CKN Nigeria
  <a href="http://www.cknnigeria.com/2016/12/kidnapped-girl-rescued-in-abuja.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   reported
  </a>
  that the girl had been rescued. We called one of the phone numbers seen in the original post concerning her disappearance and a man identifying himself as her father told us that she was safe.
