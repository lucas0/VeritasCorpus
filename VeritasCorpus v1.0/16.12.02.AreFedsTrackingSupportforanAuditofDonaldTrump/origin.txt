  To what extent have Mr. Trump’s conflicts of interest affected his presidential transition? What is the impact and potential impact of his refusal to set up a qualified blind trust to prevent conflicts of interest? Has Mr. Trump conducted Trump Organization business during the transition? Is there transparency with regard to his activity with his business interests? Have his conflicts potentially affected the policy positions of his new Administration? Have his family members maintained appropriate distance between the business of the Trump Organization and the presidential transition? How have Mr. Trump’s actions to prevent conflicts compared to actions taken by previous presidents?
