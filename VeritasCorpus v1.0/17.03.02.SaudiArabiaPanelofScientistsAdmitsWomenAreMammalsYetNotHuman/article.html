  (WNDR) web site published an article reporting that “a panel of Saudi scientists” had concluded women were mammals, but not humans:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   In an unprecedented ruling, a panel of Saudi scientists has concluded that women are actually mammals, granting them the same rights as other mammal species such as camels, dromedaries and even goats.
  </p>
  <p>
   The verdict, which fell just hours before the International Women’s Day, is considered “historic” by some experts and advocacy groups for women’s rights.
  </p>
  <p>
   “This is a great leap forward for women’s rights in Saudi Arabia,” concludes Jane Austin, spokeswoman for the Women’s Liberation Action Network. “It may seem too little, too late, but it is truly a milestone event for all women in the region,” she says, visibly excited. “From now on, women will be considered as members of the mammal class, whereas before women shared the legal status of an object, similar to that of a home appliance,” she admits.

  The large visible logo visible in the accompanying photograph purportedly showing the panel of Saudi scientists indicates that it was taken at the

   World Government Summit

  , a yearly event held in Dubai as a “global platform dedicated to shaping the future of government worldwide.”

  The

  for the World Government Summit 2016 did not include any Saudi scientists listed among the event’s

  touching on the biological classification of women.

  Not surprisingly, this unusual news about a ruling from “a panel of Saudi scientists” was reported exclusively by
