  The above-displayed photographs have been circulating on the Internet since at least 2004, usually in

  These pictures originated with the Iranian news site

  , who (along with persons who have witnessed similar scenes in other countries) confirmed that what the photographs actually depict is performers hustling money from onlookers by staging a common street act, one in which a subject seemingly allows himself to be run over by a heavy vehicle and then emerges unscathed.  This a common act, variations of which are performed by many magicians and accomplished through a variety of means, with no lasting harm done. That the subject is a small boy who grimaces his way through the stunt is all part of the act, intended to elicit sympathy and extra cash from onlookers.  (Despite his contorted facial expressions, the boy is not seriously or permanently injured by the process.)

  It’s difficult to make any definitive statement about Sharia/Islamic law since customs and enforcement can vary from region to region, but although the cutting off  hands may sometimes be the prescribed maximum

   penalty

  for cases of theft under the strictest interpretations of Sharia, Islamic law resources consistently note that such punishments shall not be applied to children who have not yet reached

  by the hungry:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The maximum sentence of any violation of law is not applied in every case. In the robbery and theft cases for example, the maximum penalty of hand-cutting applies after the consideration of many factors such as track record and whether the theft was made for profit. In some cases, such as stealing food because of severe hunger or to prevent death, there may not be a penalty.

   A person’s hand is not amputated when he steals less than the equivalent of 4.374 grams of gold [or] something that is useless.  The penalty for the one who steals (when the above conditions are met) is that his/her right arm is amputated.

  The above photographs do

  arm which goes under the wheels.  Moreover, there are no police, judges, religious authorities, or other officials evident in any of the pictures, just a huckster with a hand-held microphone who drums up business and describes the action for the onlookers visible in the background of the first photo. (Also note the blanket placed under the boy’s arm: something that is useful for a staged stunt but is unlikely to be provided or allowed by those intent on severely punishing a lawbreaker.)
