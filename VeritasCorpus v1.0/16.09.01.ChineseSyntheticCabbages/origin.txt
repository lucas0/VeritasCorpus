  At many Japanese restaurants, there is plastic food out front. The fake meals function as supplements to the menu so people can see what the meals actually look like. And the way this phoney food is made is fascinating.

  As previously posted, plastic food is called “shokuhin sample” (食品サンプル) or “food sample” in Japanese. Many restaurants work closely with the phoney food craftsmen, with the actual meals being molded to ensure the sample accurately represents the real deal.
