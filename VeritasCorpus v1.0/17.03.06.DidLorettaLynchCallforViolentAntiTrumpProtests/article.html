  On 28 February 2017, Senate Democrats posted a short
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/USSenateDemocrats/videos/?ref=page_internal" target="_blank">
   video
  </a>
  statement from former U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch (who held that position during the last two years of President Obama’s second term) which has been cited to accuse her of encouraging violent protests against President Donald Trump’s administration.
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   I know that this is a time of great fear and uncertainty for so many people. I know it’s a time of concern for people who see our rights being assailed, being trampled on, and even being rolled back. I know that this is difficult, but I remind you that this has never been easy. We have always had to work to move this country forward to achieve the great ideals of our Founding Fathers.
  </p>
  <p>
   It has been people, individuals who have banded together, ordinary people who simply saw what needed to be done and came together and supported those ideals who have made the difference. They’ve marched, they’ve bled and yes, some of them died. This is hard. Every good thing is. We have done this before. We can do this again.
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  Conservative news sites subsequently
  <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2017/03/loretta-lynch-need-more-marching-blood-death-on-streets/" target="_blank">
   asserted
  </a>
  that Lynch was calling for “blood [and] death in the streets,” or of
  <a href="http://video.foxnews.com/v/5349033961001/?#sp=show-clips" target="_blank">
   encouraging
  </a>
  “anti-Trump chaos.”
 </p>
 <p>
  We reached out both to Lynch’s representatives and the Senate Democratic Caucus seeking comment, but Lynch’s wording that “They’ve marched, they’ve bled, and yes, some of them died” appears to be a reference to the

  of activists who took part in the Civil Rights movement and not an exhortation that dissenters should engage in extreme violence to oppose current administration actions.
