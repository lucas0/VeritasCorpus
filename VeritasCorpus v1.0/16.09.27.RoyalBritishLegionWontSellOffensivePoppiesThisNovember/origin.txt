  Thanks for alerting us to a message youâ€™ve seen on Facebook, which states the poppy is not being offered in certain areas of the country.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is untrue. We have always offered the poppy in every community in the UK and we will continue to do so.
 </p>
 <p>
  We would like you to know that the Poppy is universally respected as the symbol of Remembrance and hope. It is offered to, and worn by, all communities in Britain. The money raised by the Poppy Appeal supports all members of the Armed Forces, veterans and their families.
 </p>
 <p>
  We value your support.
