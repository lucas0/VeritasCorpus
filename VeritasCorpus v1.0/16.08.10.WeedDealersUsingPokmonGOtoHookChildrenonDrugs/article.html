  A meme generated by a satirical

   Facebook page
  </a>
  called “Christians Against Drugs” claims that the popular Pokémon GO augmented reality game app is being used by children to buy “weed needles” from marijuana dealers. The meme reads:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Since the release of ‘Pokeman GO’
   <em>
    [sic]
   </em>
   more than 40 billion children have used the app to ‘catch weedles’, slang for buying weed needles.  Stop dealers selling marijuanas to your children! Ban Pokeman GO now!!
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Aside from the fact there are only about 7 billion people living on the planet, marijuana is not

   injected
  </a>
  :  it’s taken orally, sublingually or by way of inhalation. It can also be used topically. The text accompanying the meme makes it clear it’s intended as satire:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   After overhearing my embarrassment of a grandson, Craig, tell his friend he had just “caught a weedle” using the highly dangerous “Pokeman Go” app, I was naturally horrified! After detaining my grandson in my contemplation chamber to undergo 72 hours of self-flagellation and prayer, I decided to find out just how easily children were able to get their hands on drugs using this so-called “game”.
  </p>
  <p>
   My hands trembling with fear, I “downloaded” the app and my research began. After being bombarded with images of various satanic creatures, occultist symbols and words, I set off in search of the dreaded “weedle”, my crucifix clutched tightly to my chest.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The author of the post concludes by claiming to have performed an “emergency baptism” on a virtual Pokemon creature.
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   HALLELUJAH ! Christian parents, heed my call ! SAVE your children from injecting Satan’s Spinach ! BAN Pokeman Go in your family NOW !!
  </p>
