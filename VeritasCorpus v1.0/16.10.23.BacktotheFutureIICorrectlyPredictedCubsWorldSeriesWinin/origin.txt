  [T]he 1989 movie “Back to the Future Part II” predicted the Cubs would win the 2015 World Series, and the man who wrote the screenplay and imagined this unlikely scenario is Bob Gale, a lifelong St. Louis Cardinals fan. In a sport where players and fans believe in curses, jinxes and superstitions, maybe it’s not so crazy to think a movie has somehow spurred the Cubs to the brink of history.

  “Back to the Future” screenwriter Bob Gale predicted the Cubs would win the 2015 World Series but is a lifelong Cardinals fan. Gale said the prediction grew out of the plotline in which primary character Marty McFly, famously played by Michael J. Fox, gets the idea from another character of going back in time to make money on sports betting.

  “What better way to give him the idea than with a really outrageous scenario, which is the Cubs win the World Series?” Gale said. “It’s a double joke because they win the World Series against Miami — which [didn’t have] major league baseball in 1989.”
