  Attention Criminals &amp; Terrorists
 </p>
 <p>
  Over 170,000 Idaho residents have a permit to legally carry a concealed weapon, about 60% of the rest of the population is armed but have not bothered to purchase the license as it is not a requirement to carry a firearm. Understand, a substantial portion of the population is armed and prepared to defend themselves and others against acts of criminal violence.
 </p>
 <p>
  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
 </p>
 <p>
  However, California, New York and Illinois have disarmed their citizens for your convenience.
