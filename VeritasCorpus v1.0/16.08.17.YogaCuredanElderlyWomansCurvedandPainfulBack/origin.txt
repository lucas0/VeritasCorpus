 <p>
  [Yoga instructor Rachel] Jesien visited Pesce in her home once a week, teaching her restorative poses and stretches such as childâ€™s pose and chair savasana, in which Pesce would rest her lower legs on a chair while lying on the floor with her knees slightly bent and a strap around her thighs. After one month of sessions, Pesce was able to walk again.
