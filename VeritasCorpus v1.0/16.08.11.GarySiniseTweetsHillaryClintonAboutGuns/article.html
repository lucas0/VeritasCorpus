  On 9 August 2016, the Facebook page “American Proud” posted an image purportedly showing a tweet by Hillary Clinton concerning gun control followed by a witty retort from Gary Sinise (a politically conservative actor):
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Hillary Clinton: If Republicans put so much faith in the Hand of God, why do they need guns?
  </p>
  <p>
   Gary Sinise: Because we don’t trust Democrats.
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  Neither of the above-quoted comments is real. Hillary Clinton did not question on Twitter why Republicans need guns when they have God, and Gary Sinise did not assert that the reason was because they don’t trust Democrats.

  Furthermore, this purported Twitter conversation matched an image macro posted to Twitter two months earlier:
