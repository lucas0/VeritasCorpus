 <p>
  Extreme ‘ sex roulette ‘ parties – where one person secretly has HIV and no one is allowed to wear a condom – are on the rise, doctors have warned.
 </p>
 <p>
  The risky orgies are usually attended by gay men and offer the so-called ‘thrill’ of not knowing whether or not you will be infected .
 </p>
 <p>
  Doctors in Barcelona have seen a rise in the number of such parties, which they claim is a sign that people have “lost respect” for HIV.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dr Josep Mallolas of Hospital Clinic Barcelona told el Periodico : “There is everything: sex roulette parties, or sex parties you can only attend if you already have HIV.”
 </p>
 <p>
  He added that some of the events are known as ‘blue’ parties because attendees take anti-viral drugs to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus.
 </p>
 <p>
  Last year, a Serbian stripper called Tijana claimed the parties originated in Serbia – and were named Serbian sex roulette, after Russian roulette, Metro reported.
 </p>
 <p>
  Speaking last year, she told Serbian newspaper Telegraf: “I can see that everyone is talking about sex parties now, but in fact they have been common for a long time even here in Serbia.
