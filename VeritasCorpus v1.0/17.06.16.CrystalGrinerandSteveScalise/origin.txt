  As it turns out, Steve Scalise and countless other Republicans were saved yesterday by a DC law enforcement officer named Crystal Griner. She and her partner David Bailey were the cops that took down yesterday’s shooter.
 </p>
 <p>
  She was shot in the ankle for her troubles.
 </p>
 <p>
  Officer Bailey is her professional partner. Ms Griner’s life’s partner and married companion is Tiffany Dyer.

  That’s right, haters of LGBTQ rights, a lesbian saved your fucking lives. Steve Scalise — vocal proponent of bans on same sex marriage — alive today courtesy of a woman who loves a woman.”
