  I work for Little Debbie and can tell you this has to be a very old cake our cakes that come off the line do not look like that. If you have a problem them call them directly and stop slamming a great company.

  I watched this several times and noticed the sealing of the package is different on both ends. One end has ridges and the other doesn’t. I’m thinking this was opened then re sealed just for publicity. This is just my opinion.

  The seal looks weird. One end was ridges and the other end looked like it had a clean cut like scissors and sealed back. Not taking up for little Debbie because I don’t eat them but something is not right.

  Someone has opened that up and resealed it. Both ends are the same when they come out of the plant. This one has been opened and sealed back up.

  I can tell you right now as an avid Little Debbie snack cake eater, the Oatmeal Creme Pie packaging is not that thick and doesn’t make that much noise. Stop buying off brand Creme pies.
