  for the penthouse. Lorber tried to put a bargain-minded spin on things by pointing out that that’s only $2,000/square foot, and “today you start saying to yourself, why is it only $2,000/foot?” given other prices in the area.

That penthouse comes with 27,000 square feet of air rights, which a buyer could choose to use or — and we’re not sure whether to be worried or intrigued by this — to resell.
