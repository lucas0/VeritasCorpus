 <p>
  Eileen Gunderson of Piedmont, North Dakota was arrested and charged with unlawful use of “biological waste” and misconduct after she took “an entire trash bag.” full of aborted baby parts.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to reports, Gunderson had everything from arms, legs and heads to full fetal position infants on display, which disgusted and concerned her neighbor, Bethania Sky. It was Sky’s reports that brought the police, who had to research whether or not a crime was committed. Once they figured it out, they shut down the party, took Gunderson into custody and declared the entire building a biohazard. She faces up to a year in jail and fines of $10K if convicted.
