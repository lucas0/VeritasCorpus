  Hi. My name is Dwayne Johnson. Many of you may know me better as The Rock.
 </p>
 <p>
  I am running for the President of the United States.
 </p>
 <p>
  I know that this may sound like a joke to many of you. But itâ€™s not. I am throwing my hat in the ring for 2020. I am not running against Donald Trump. I am not running against whatever candidate the Democrats field. I am not running against anyone. I am running for the country. As an independent. I am running on a simple platform of compassion and civility.
