  That meme is incorrect with just about every assertion it makes. There are 32 teams, but rosters are only limited to 53 players for part of the year, and even then, each team has an additional practice squad and players on injured reserve.

  The database goes back to 2000, and many or most of the players in the database are no longer in the league.  They were in the NFL when they were arrested, but many are no longer in the league.

  As we’ve reported, based on our data, the NFL has a lower arrest rate than the general population.
