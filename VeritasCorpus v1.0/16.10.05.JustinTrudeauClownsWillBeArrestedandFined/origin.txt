  There have been many clown-related killings around the world and including Canada recently. Just yesterday there were a reported 23 Canadians killed by clowns.
 </p>
 <p>
  Justin Trudeau has taken matter into his own hands to address this situation and find a solution — arrest and fine clowns. Justin Trudeau held a conference on behalf of the Liberal Party to announce the new law that has been passed that states “
  <em>
   Any person of any age dressed in a clown costume in public will be arrested and charged $10,000
  </em>
  ”.
 </p>
 <p>
  Justin Trudeau believes that this is the best approach to getting rid of these clowns on the street.
