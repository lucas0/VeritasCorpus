<blockquote>
 <p>
  Residents of multiple states will be asked to surrender their ‘third pet’ to the Humane Society to remain in compliance with a newly passed ordinance.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ordinance was officially passed this week by state politicians in Texas, Arizona, and Missouri. According to statistics gathered and published by The Humane Society of the United States, abandoned pet rates have sky-rocketed in Texas, Arizona, and Missouri over the past 2 years.
 </p>
 <p>
  State representatives from Texas, Arizona, and Missouri are hopeful that this new ordinance will drastically reduce the amount of abandoned pets within their respective states.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the September 3rd 2017 compliance date approaches, state officials are asking impacted pet owners to begin thinking about which 2 animals they wish to continue housing.
