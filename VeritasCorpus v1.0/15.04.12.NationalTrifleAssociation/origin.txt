  If you would believe the logic the NRA has used to justify guns everywhere from inside capitol buildings to bars to schools, more guns equal more safety. With that premise, one would think an NRA
  <nobr>
   convention — a
  </nobr>
  place where thousands of gun-owners congregate to buy, sell, and talk
  <nobr>
   weaponry — would
  </nobr>
  be the safest place in the world. The NRA disagrees. In fact, they’d rather you kept your guns at home, please.

  Oddly, the NRA has decided that it wouldn’t feel safe allowing 70,000 people packing heat to mill about. According to local paper
  <em>
   The Tennessean
  </em>
  , the organization put together a plan that they say will keep people
  <nobr>
   safe — namely,
  </nobr>
  “no guns.”
