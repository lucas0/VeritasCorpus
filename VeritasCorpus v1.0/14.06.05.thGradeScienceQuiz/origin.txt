  I didn’t know that this was being taught to her until we heard a radio commercial together about the
  <a href="http://www.discoverthedinosaurs.com/" target="_blank">
   Discover the Dinosaurs
  </a>
  exhibit was coming to the TD Convention Center [in Greenville, South Carolina].
 </p>
 <p>
  The Commercial starts out, “After 65 million years, the dinosaurs have returned …” She commented immediately that it was only four thousand years ago.  When I corrected her, she snapped back, “Were you there?” I have since taught my daughter differently, but I am sure she is confused now and plan to make sure she understands that teachers are people too and can be factually wrong.

  The test showed up [at] home a day later to my disgust.

 <p>
  It’s a great school for Reading, Writing and Math.  She is ahead of most of her peers and also is taking Latin there. But I now know to be vigilant for the rest of the year about her science teachings.
 </p>
 <p>
  She will not be attending the school next year …
