  In March 2015 a message began to circulate on social media sites claiming that texting the word “HUNGER” to the number 35350 would prompt the Sam’s Club chain of membership-only retail warehouse stores to donate meals to local food banks. According to several versions of the claim, each donation would provide twelve meals to a nearby food pantry once a donor’s location was confirmed.
 </p>
 <p>
  A few aspects of the “text HUNGER to 35350” campaign gave potential donors pause, however. For one thing, Facebook and Twitter pages maintained by Sam’s Club didn’t prominently publish any material confirming the campaign around the time it became popular in March 2015. Users who posted to the retailer’s Facebook wall to inquire about the legitimacy of the campaign were directed to a website prompting them to enter barcodes from General Mills products to generate donations under a program called “Outnumber Hunger”:

  On that page, information about a separate (and not clearly linked) aspect of the campaign was published:

  Although the blurb confirmed a Sam’s Club campaign was slated to continue until
  <nobr>
   31 January
  </nobr>
  2016 (or until a $225,000 donation cap was reached), no mention of text-triggered donations was included. A Facebook

   link

  at the top of that page led to an Outnumber Hunger campaign page that hadn’t been updated for several months, which a number of Facebook members used to inquire about the legitimacy of the 35350 donation message.

  Outnumber Hunger referenced another page, Feeding America, in their “about” section. On that page, a status

  According to the status update, texts would generate a donation to local or national food banks until
  <nobr>
   31 March
  </nobr>
  2015 (or until a cap of $225,000 was reached). If the fundraising maximum wasn’t met by that date, General Mills customers would be given until

   12 March

  2015 Sam’s Club had reached the stated cap for text-based donations, so texts sent to 35350 after that date no longer triggered food bank contributions.
