  On 20 April 2016, the entertainment web site
  <em>
   NC Scooper
  </em>
  published a fake news article claiming that Cher and Robert Plant were planning a July wedding at Westminster Abbey:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Pop-Rock fusion. No, it’s not the bubbly candy. Liz Rosenberg, Cher’s longtime publicist, announced this morning that the Pop star and the Rock icon Robert Plant have reserved the Westminster Abbey for their wedding on July 17th.
  </p>
  <p>
   “I’m happy to inform everyone that Cher and Robert have set a date for their nuptials,” Ms. Rosenberg grinned. “We know this news may come as a big shock to a lot of people.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  However, as with all stories from the
  <em>
   NC Scooper,
  </em>
  there is absolutely no factual basis for this article.
  <em>
   NC Scooper
  </em>
  is an entertainment site that does not publish factual stories:
 </p>
 <blockquote>

   The Scooper is a satirical

   is in scope and intent. Sometimes it’s funny; often it is not. We provide fake news and social criticism in a satirical setting. Our intention is not to fool or trick anyone, but obviously it happens. We firmly believe that you can soften a person’s willingness to listen by injecting irony, and yes sometimes humor, into the conversation.

  intended by posting a story about Cher and Robert Plant getting married remains unclear.
