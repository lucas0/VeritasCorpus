   I had in my hand a copy of the Dallas News, with its black-bordered anti-Kennedy tirade, but I hesitated to show it to the President because I was reluctant to dampen his cheerful mood.

  Then I handed him the newspaper. He said he had seen it, and he showed the black-bordered advertisement to Jackie. That night on the way back to Washington, she and I talked about what he said to her while she was reading the ad. “We’re heading into nut country today,” he said. “But Jackie, if somebody wants to shoot me from a window with a rifle, nobody can stop it, so why worry about it?”
