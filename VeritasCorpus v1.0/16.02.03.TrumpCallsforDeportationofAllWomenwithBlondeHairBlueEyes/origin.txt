  Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump announced today his latest initiative to “Make America Great Again!”: Deport all women who have blonde hair and blue eyes.

 <p>
  Speaking to a crowd of over 10,000, Trump declared: “Seriously, folks! We’re talking about these women, with their blonde hair and their blue eyes, and they’re biased — they’re twisted — the worst people our country has.”

  While there was initially no response from his audience (many of whom were looking at each other, waiting to see what the general reaction would be), the majority ultimately ended up erupting in thunderous applause, with a small rebel minority who began booing Trump’s remarks.
