  When Police outside of Hollister, Kentucky raided the property listed as “Apex Salvage and Used Auto Parts,” they found a small shop that was buying and selling parts online and for about 30 hours a week to the public, turning a small but fairly insignificant profit. That business, however, was confined to one small building on a nearly 150-acre property.

  Somewhere in the back corner, hidden under carefully placed canopies between huge Douglas firs, they found a laboratory capable of producing more than a pound of methamphetamine per day and a stockpile of nearly 14 pounds of street-ready dope.

  The owner of the property, US Representative Jacob Gillstroff (D-Tennessee), has been under investigation by the DEA for nearly a year. Shortly after he won his bid for Congress when his opponent died under suspicious circumstances, Gillstroff bought the old salvage yard and moved the online business in, calling it a “worthy investment” for his family.
