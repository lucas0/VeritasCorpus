  On 18 April 2017, the entertainment web site
  <em>
   World News Daily Report
  </em>
  <a href="https://archive.is/V3fc5" target="_blank">
   published
  </a>
  a fake news article claiming that Bruce Franklin, a Philadelphia man, killed and ate his wife after being stuck in an elevator for 71 hours:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   44-year old Bruce Franklin was arrested this morning, after he confessed to killing his wife and eating her flesh while he was stuck with her in an elevator.
  </p>
  <p>
   According to the Philadelphia Police Department, the partially devoured corpse of his wife was lying next to him when he was rescued after being stuck for three days in an elevator.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  There is no truth to this story.

  As with many of its fake news stories,

  used photographs from unrelated events in order to lend credence to its claims:
