  One of the more controversial aspects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) health care reform legislation (commonly known as “Obamacare”) passed by the
  <nobr>
   U.S. Congress
  </nobr>
  in 2010 is its requirement mandating that all Americans obtain health insurance or pay a monthly fine.  One rumor which has grown out of this aspect of the PPACA is the claim that some religious groups, particularly Muslims (but also including Scientologists, Amish, and Christian Scientists), are specifically exempted from health insurance requirements of the PPACA.

 <p>
  The fact is that the PPACA legislation does not specifically exclude any particular religious groups from its provisions.  The bill contains a general “religious conscience” section which sets forth guidelines under which religious groups who have established conscientious objections to certain forms of insurance may seek exemption from its health insurance requirements:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   RELIGIOUS CONSCIENCE EXEMPTION — Such term shall not include any individual for any month if such individual has in effect an exemption under section 1311(d)(4)(H) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which certifies that such individual is a member of a recognized religious sect or division thereof described in section 1402(g)(1) and an adherent of established tenets or teachings of such sect or division as described in such section.
