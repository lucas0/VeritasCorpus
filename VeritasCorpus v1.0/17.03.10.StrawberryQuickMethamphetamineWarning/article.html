  In early 2007, warnings began to circulate about sweetened and flavored forms of methamphetamine known as “Strawberry Quick” (or “Strawberry Quik,” named after strawberry

  , a powder used to make flavored milk drinks). Various news accounts about Strawberry Quick first reported it appearing in western states in January 2007 and described it as resembling rock candy or Pop Rocks (a kid-favored confection that fizzles in the mouth), prompting fears that it might fool children and teens into mistakenly perceiving it as candy (or perceiving it as a drug far less dangerous and addictive than it actually is):
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Drug Warning – Beware and please inform your children
  </p>
  <p>
   I have been alerted by one of our EMT’s for our volunteer fire department that they have received emails from emergency responder organizations to be on the lookout for a new form of Crystalized Meth that is targeted at children and to be aware of this new form if called to an emergency involving a child that may have symptoms of drug induction or overdose.
  </p>
  <p>
   They are calling this new form of meth “Strawberry Quick” and it looks like the “Pop Rocks” candy that sizzle in your mouth. In it’s current form, it is dark pink in color and has a strawberry scent to it.
  </p>
  <p>
   Please advise your children and their friends and other students not to accept candy from strangers as this is obviously an attempt to seduce children into drug use. They also need to be cautious in accepting candy from even friends that may have received it from someone else, thinking it is just candy.
  </p>

  As of September 2017 versions of the warning still circulated on social media, some appended with a new image of the purported “strawberry quick”:

  However, after those early warnings about Strawberry Quick worked their way to the public through police, schools, and the news media, federal drug enforcement officials began issuing corrections that described such rumors as unfounded. While
  <u>
   colored
  </u>
  versions of methamphetamine that somewhat resemble candy may have been found, the notion that drug dealers are deliberately targeting children by producing
  <u>
   flavored
  </u>
  versions of the drug intended to mimic the appearance and taste of candy appears to have been based on mistaken assumptions: When colored versions of meth turn up, the coloring of the drug is likely incidental to the manufacturing process (rather than a quality deliberately introduced to increase the appeal of meth), and since police labs don’t generally test drugs for flavoring ingredients, statements about seizures of flavored meth have probably been based solely on the drug’s brightly hued appearance and not on its actual taste.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a DEA spokesman observed in 2010, the rumor about “strawberry quick” had “nothing to it”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   An e-mail is circulating — forwarded from one worried parent to the next — claiming that drug dealers are targeting children with a pink, berry-flavored methamphetamine known as “strawberry quick.” While the e-mail is composed of unnerving details, pleading with recipients to pass it along, authorities said its claims are little more than “urban legend.””We checked with all of our labs, and there’s nothing to it,” U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Michael Sanders said. “It’s not a trend or a real problem; I think that this was maybe someone with good intentions but jumped the gun.”
  </p>
  <p>
   The e-mail scare started circulating around 2007, making its way from community to community, and eventually was picked up by newspapers and television stations across the nation. Even law enforcement bulletins and school officials ran with it.
  </p>
  <p>
   Still, Sanders said, the DEA has never heard of anyone adding strawberry flavoring to meth, and are not aware of any children admitted to hospitals in dire condition because of it. He noted that on at least one occasion they found colored meth, but determined that the person cooking it added the dye to skirt law enforcement rather than lure kids.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The Partnership at
  <a href="http://www.drugfree.org/join-together/addiction/meth-ado-about-nothing" target="_blank">
   Drugfree.org
  </a>
  received similar responses from the DEA when they attempted to run the “strawberry quick” rumors to ground:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Both the DEA and the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy told Join Together that they have not been able to identify a single confirmed seizure of flavored meth.”There are a lot of people in prevention and law enforcement talking about it, but in terms of actual seizures we haven’t seen much,” said Tom Riley, a spokesperson for ONDCP. Rojean White, a spokesperson for the DEA, told Join Together that while local DEA agents have heard stories about flavored meth from local law-enforcement colleagues, they “haven’t had any” seizures themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
   Experts say that there’s a real possibility that local police are confusing colored meth — which is relatively common — with flavored meth. Tom McNamara, a meth trainer and special-projects coordinator for the Southern Illinois Drug Task Force Group, told Join Together that meth made from Sudafed or some generic versions of the drug will have a light-pink color because of the dye used in the pills. Moreover, he said, meth made from anhydrous ammonia treated with GloTell — a chemical marker designed to discourage thefts — will be bright pink. The drug also can appear greenish or blue.
  </p>
  <p>
   “We’ve had that forever,” said McNamara of colored meth, whereas his inquiries about flavored meth have yielded nothing.
  </p>
  <p>
   “The warnings are well-intended, but they have no substance,” he said.
  </p>
 </blockquote>

Moreover, evidence that either coloring or flavoring is being added to meth for the express purpose of making the drug appeal to children is hard to come by. (It seems more likely that such factors, if present, are manufacturing errors, qualities incidentally inherited from ingredients used in manufacturing meth, or attempts at creating superficial 'brand' distinctions).  Police reports of both aspects continue to appear, though, as in this October 2007 news article from North Carolina:

<FONT FACE="" class="quote_font" SIZE=2>

<DIV STYLE="" class="quote_style">
It sounds like an urban legend. But Sheriff James Williams has held it in his hand, and says it smells just like strawberries.

Crystal methamphetamine that looks like candy was found in the course of an arrest outside Lansing in September. "The methamphetamine seized in this case is a pink ice-looking substance and smells like strawberries," said Sheriff James Williams. "The Ashe County Sheriff’s Office has received intelligence information on this type of methamphetamine from the D.E.A. stating that it is being made to look like and smell like a strawberry candy, specifically to entice young teenagers."

  And, as many others have noted, rumors of
  <a href="/horrors/drugs/bluestar.asp" target="drug">
   illegal drugs
  </a>
  produced in a form intended to appeal to young children have been circulating for several decades and make little sense, as young children do not generally have the disposable income necessary to purchase such products.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nonetheless, in April 2007, U.S. Senators Feinstein and Grassley responded to the “strawberry quick” rumors by introducing
  <a href="http://feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=NewsRoom.PressReleases&amp;ContentRecord_id=2a23db2e-dffd-dee7-3504-5bf193466681" target="_blank">
   legislation
  </a>
  aimed at increasing the criminal penalties for anyone who markets or makes candy-flavored drugs by imposing upon them the same enhanced criminal sentences handed down to drug dealers who knowingly sell to minors.
 </p>
 <p>
  <!--
The <I>Saving Kids from Dangerous Drugs Act</I> sought to alter federal law from its current state of requiring doubled (or tripled for a repeat offense) sentences for those caught selling illegal drugs to those under the age of 21 to imposing doubled or tripled sentences on anyone who "manufactures, creates, distributes, or possesses with intent to distribute a controlled substance that is flavored, colored, packaged or otherwise altered in a way that is designed to make it more appealing to a person under <NOBR>21 years</NOBR> of age, or who attempts or conspires to do so." No longer would a dealer have to be caught red-handed in the act of selling to an <NOBR>under 21</NOBR> for the doubled or tripled sentences to kick in; under the proposed refinement to current law, simply possessing flavored versions of street drugs would be enough. Also, by the lights of this rewriting of the law, manufacturers of flavored drugs would also be subject to doubled or tripled sentences.

There is one bit of good news in all this: In 2007 methamphetamine use was down for much of the country for the second year running. Researchers say it appears the latest meth epidemic reached its peak in 2004 and 2005, and data from the federal government shows the number of first-time meth users has steadily declined in recent years.<A NAME="update"></A>

In <B>June 2007</B> this version of the "strawberry meth" rumor began landing in our inbox:

<FONT FACE="" class="quote_font" SIZE=2>

<DIV STYLE="" class="quote_style">
Checked this on Snopes and it is true

http://www.snopes.com/horrors/drugs/candymeth.asp

There is a very scary thing going on in the schools right now that all need to be aware of. There is a type of crystal meth going around that looks like strawberry pop rocks. It smells like strawberry also and it is being handed out to kids in school yards in AR. I'm sure it will make its way around the country if it hasn't already. Kids are ingesting this thinking that it is candy and being rushed off to the E.R. in dire condition.

It also comes in chocolate, peanut butter, cola, cherry, grape and orange &mdash; it looks just like pop rocks.

Please instruct your children to not accept candy that looks like this even from a friend and to take any that they may have to a teacher, principal, etc.

Please pass this around it could save some family a lot of heartache!

That is what they are calling strawberry meth or strawberry quick.

Thought you'd want to know.
</DIV></FONT>

The unknown author of that alert has it wrong: nothing we encountered in our research supported that person's allegations about the drug's "being handed out to kids in school yards" in Arkansas (or anywhere else) or that "kids are ingesting this thinking that it is candy and being rushed off to the E.R. in dire condition." In all our research, we didn't come across a single news story about children who had ingested the substance because they mistook it for candy, whether they were subsequently treated at a hospital or not. Likewise, we have consistently failed to find anything that would support the claim that Strawberry Quick is being handed out in schoolyards. Both those claims appear to be the product of the <NOBR>e-mail</NOBR> writer's imagination.

In <B>October 2007</B> the "updated" version was once again updated, this time dropping the "Checked this on Snopes and it is true" claim and adding in its place a "Halloween Warning for Parents" and the signature of a Homeland Security officer. But other than that, nothing changed: there were still no news stories about actual incidents supporting the updated version's claims of kids' being given the drug in school yards and being rushed to emergency rooms:
