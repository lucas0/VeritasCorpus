 <p>
  Authorities in Mexico have seized a massive shipment of cocaine that was headed towards a U.S. government facility in America.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mexican Soldiers have now detained three men who were inside of the vehicle, claiming that they were employees of the Social Security Institute which has yet to be confirmed by the agency.
 </p>
 <p>
  The truck originated in the Tamaulipas state capital of Ciudad Victoria bound for Reynosa, across the border from McAllen, Texas; and it remains unseen if it belongs to a Cartel or how they acquired the vehicle if that were the case.
 </p>
 <p>
  There will be an ongoing investigation involving both United States Federal Agencies and Mexican authorities to determine whether anyone from inside either nationâ€™s disaster programs was involved in the trafficking or even the theft of the vehicle.
