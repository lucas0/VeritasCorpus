  falsely reported that the singer Katy Perry had admitted her preference for human meat in an interview with French radio:

  The article also referenced a long-standing conspiracy theory about Satanist/Illuminati infiltration of Hollywood which includes associated occult rituals, falsely asserting Perry told a French radio station that “There is a group of old Hollywood guys who have an annual dinner party where the main dish is human.”

  Perry famously grew up in a devout Christian family and initially emerged as a gospel singer in her teenage years. Her subsequent career as a mainstream, secular pop artist and sex symbol, whose lyrics and music videos are often laced with irony and humor, has made her a particular
