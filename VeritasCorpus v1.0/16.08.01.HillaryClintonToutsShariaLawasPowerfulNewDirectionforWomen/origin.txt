  HILLARY: “I think Sharia Law will be a powerful new direction of freedom &amp; democracy for the women of Libya. All my life I’ve fought for women’s equality &amp; NOW THAT I’M THE MOST POWERFUL WOMAN IN AMERICA, I’m proud to have brought about this change to the repressive Khadaffy regime in Libya….”
  <strong>
   When reminded that Sharia law means complete &amp; barbaric oppression &amp; enslavement of women, Clinton responded “Isn’t that the other one, the shiite thing?”
