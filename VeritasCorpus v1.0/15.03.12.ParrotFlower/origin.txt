 <p>
  Recently there has been some controversy on the Internet regarding an
  <em>
   Impatiens
  </em>
  picture published on certain web sites, bearing a resemblance to a parrot in flight. Many people have suggested that the plant did not exist and the picture was a fake, computer-generated from parts of other pictures. It has been referred to as the parrot plant. The plant, however, does indeed exist, and is
  <em>
   Impatiens psittacina
  </em>
  , which can be found growing in northern Thailand, northern India and Myanmar (formerly Burma).
 </p>
 <p>
  It was described by JD Hooker in 1901, and the specific epithet
  <em>
   psittacina
  </em>
  means parrot-like. The flowers, which do resemble a parrot in flight, are shades of pale lilac, reddish purple, and white.
