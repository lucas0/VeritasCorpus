  It was our Democratic party that pushed open the opportunities for me and millions of children across this great country. It was our party that fought for head start and good schools. And made college affordable and championed affirmative actions and school desegregation, that passed Social Security and Medicare, that fought for veterans back home, that fought for the rights of workers and made the dream of home ownership possible for millions of american families. Yes, it still is our Democratic party. Civil rights and voting rights — and voting rights. As we democrats — it is we Democrats who fully understand when you take away a person’s right to vote, you take away their ability to shape their own destiny. And it was and it is our democratic party that fights for women’s rights, gay rights, the LGBTQ rights. Our party understands that black lives matter.
