  The difference between butter and margarine?
 </p>
 <p>
  Both have the same amount of calories, butter is slightly higher in saturated fats at
  <nobr>
   8 grams
  </nobr>
  compared to
  <nobr>
   5 grams.
  </nobr>
  Eating margarine can increase heart disease in women by 53% over eating the same amount of butter according to a recent Harvard Medical Study.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eating butter increases the absorption of many other nutrients in other foods, butter has many nutritional benefits where margarine has a few only because they are added! Butter tastes much better than margarine and it can enhance the flavors of other foods. Butter has been around for centuries where margarine has been around for less than
  <nobr>
   100 years.

 <p>
  Now for Margarine, very high in trans fatty acids triple risk of Coronary Heart Disease, Increases total and LDL ( This is the bad Cholesterol), Lowers HDL cholesterol and this is the good one, Increases the risk of cancers by up to five fold, lowers quality of breast milk, decreases immune response, and decreases insulin response.
 </p>
 <p>
  And here is the most disturbing fact……
 </p>
 <p>
  Margarine is but one molecule from being PLASTIC….. (This fact alone was enough to have me avoiding margarine for life and anything else that is hydrogenated, this means hydrogen is added changing the molecular structure of the food.)
 </p>
 <p>
  You can try this for yourself, purchase a tub of margarine and leave it in your garage or shaded area, within a couple of days you will note a couple of things, no flies, not even those pesky fruit flies will go near it, (that should tell you something) it does not rot, smell differently… Because it has no nutritional value, nothing will grow on it, even those teeny weeny microorganisms will not find a home to grow… Why?
 </p>
 <p>
  Because it is nearly plastic. Would you melt your Tupperware and spread that on your toast?
