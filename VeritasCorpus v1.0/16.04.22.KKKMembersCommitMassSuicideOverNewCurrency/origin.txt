 <p>
  Atleast 60 Klu Klux Klan Members have reportedly committed suicide after finding out Harriet Tubman will be replacing Andrew Jackson on the $20 Dollar Bill.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Mass suicide took place in Charleston, South Carolina where they all took cyanide together after praying. The bodies are all of white males between the ages of 40 and 65. They feel like the blacks and the Jewish folks have stole America and since they canâ€™t have their country back they decided to leave permanently in a mass suicide.
