  On 8 March 2016, the web site
  <em>
   Fox3News
  </em>
  published an article claiming chicken nuggets at several popular chain restaurants were being recalled due to contamination by human remains:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   A cease-and-desist letter has been issued to the corporate office of popular fast food chain’s chicken nugget’s supplier after an investigation led to recovering the remains of 6 people involved in a large drug smuggling operation. Mills Poultry distribution center in Iowa city, Iowa was issued a search warrant after authorities received tips that the manager of the farm had covered up several murders he had committed over the last six months at the facility.
  </p>
  <p>
   The search, which was conducted over the weekend, revealed the remains of several human bones hidden underneath the tile flooring in the corporate offices … investigations, revealed on Monday, confirm the remains match those of 6 individuals whom the FBI had been searching for related to border drug smuggling … the chicken which was ground for nuggets served at several popular fast food chain restaurants, also tested positive for 5 out of the 6 victim’s DNA. They also found human hair and skin sample remains in the meat grinders used to produce the chicken nuggets

   fake news

  . The site’s tactic (posing as a legitimate local news affiliate) was similar to that of

  , and as with items published to those web sites, there was no truth to the claim about human remains in chicken nuggets.
