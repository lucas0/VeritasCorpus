  Who knew you could take a farm-fresh ear of corn and generate your own homemade popcorn?!

  I literally could not believe my eyes and EARS as I listened to the popping going on in this man’s microwave.  He explains and illustrates how to do it, with a really soothing “Mr. Rogers” tone in his voice.  All you need is lunch-sized brown paper bags and a fresh ear of corn … I’m trying this fresh popcorn snack while corn on the cob is still available.  Let us know if you think you will try this healthy alternative, to store-bought popcorn.
