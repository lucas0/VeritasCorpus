  The NFL squashed Titans starting linebacker Avery Williamson’s plan to use fancy footwear to honor those who died on Sept. 11, 2001.

 <p>
  Williamson was going to wear custom patriotic cleats during the Titans’ home opener against the Vikings on the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but those plans changed when a league representative called to inform him about a looming fine for violating uniform code.

  “I don’t want to draw negative attention, so I’m just going to focus on playing the game,” Williamson told The Tennessean. “Once I heard from them, I didn’t even try to argue anything. I just left it alone. I didn’t want to press the issue.”

  The star-spangled blue cleats with red- and white-striped Nike swooshes were airbrushed by True Blue Customs in Lexington, Ky. They feature the words “Never Forget” and “9/11” on the back of each shoe, with the “11” representing the Twin Towers. The NFL mandates all teammates wear the same color scheme on their shoes.
