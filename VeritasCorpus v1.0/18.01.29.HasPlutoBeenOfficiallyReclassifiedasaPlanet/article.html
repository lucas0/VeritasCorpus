 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Today is a historic day—one that will bring joy to the hundreds of millions of Pluto lovers around the globe. The International Astronomical Union (IAU), the body that is responsible for naming and classifying objects in the cosmos, has just announced that Pluto has been reclassified as a major planet.
  </p>
  <p>
   […]
  </p>
  <p>
   After years of deliberation, the IAU announced in a press release that they have reclassified the icy world—they upgraded Pluto back to its proper standing as a planet. “We simply underestimated the public’s attachment to Pluto.
  </p>
  <p>

  Although Untold Universe listed no source for the claim (which no other outlets reported), the text was taken nearly word-for-word from a 1 April 2017

  published by Futurism.com. Missing from the republished version were these important final words:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   <em>
    … Hopefully, the new class of planet will be created without a hitch, and Pluto will be added as the first member. It’s only fair.”
   </em>
  </p>
  <p>
   Say it with me now, “Yay!” …
   <strong>
    also, have a happy April Fool’s.

  Futurism.com’s link to the IAU’s “press release” announcing Pluto’s reclassification actually lead to the Google results for “April Fool’s Day.”
