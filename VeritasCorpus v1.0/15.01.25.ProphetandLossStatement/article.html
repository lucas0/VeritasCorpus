  a quote from a speech given by President Obama back in 2012:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The quote comes from a speech that President Obama delivered to the United Nations General Assembly on

   25 September

  2012 about the death of
  <nobr>
   U.S. ambassador

  Chris Stevens and three others in an attack on the

   U.S. consulate

   2012, Obama spoke out, not in defense of free speech, but in offense at the YouTube video.

  During President Obama’s address to the UN General Assembly in

   September 2012,
  </nobr>
  he listed groups, ideas, and people whom “the future does not belong to.” Among those listed were people who bully women, those who target coptic Christians in Egypt, dictators who massacre their country’s citizens, and those who turn their backs on peace.

  , and the relevant section is reproduced below:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   It is time to leave the call of violence and the politics of division behind.  On so many issues, we face a choice between the promise of the future, or the prisons of the past.  And we cannot afford to get it wrong.  We must seize this moment.  And America stands ready to work with all who are willing to embrace a better future.
  </p>
  <p>
   The future must not belong to those who target Coptic Christians in
   <nobr>
    Egypt — it
   </nobr>
   must be claimed by those in Tahrir Square who chanted, “Muslims, Christians, we are one.”  The future must not belong to those who bully
   <nobr>
    women —
   </nobr>
   it must be shaped by girls who go to school, and those who stand for a world where our daughters can live their dreams just like our sons.
  </p>
  <p>
   The future must not belong to those corrupt few who steal a country’s
   <nobr>
    resources — it
   </nobr>
   must be won by the students and entrepreneurs, the workers and business owners who seek a broader prosperity for all people.  Those are the women and men that America stands with; theirs is the vision we will support.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam
   </strong>
   . But to be credible, those who condemn that slander must also condemn the hate we see in the images of Jesus Christ that are desecrated, or churches that are destroyed, or the Holocaust that is denied.
  </p>
  <p>
   Let us condemn incitement against Sufi Muslims and Shiite pilgrims.  It’s time to heed the words of Gandhi:  “Intolerance is itself a form of violence and an obstacle to the growth of a true democratic spirit.”  Together, we must work towards a world where we are strengthened by our differences, and not defined by them.  That is what America embodies, that’s the vision we will support.

  Of course, we don’t have to read a 2012 speech to understand Obama’s perspective on the
