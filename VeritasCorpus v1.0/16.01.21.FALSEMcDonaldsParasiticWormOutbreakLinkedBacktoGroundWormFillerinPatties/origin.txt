  The Center for Disease Control and Prevention announced Monday that it is looking into 183 more cases of parasitic roundworm disease linked to the McDonald’s restaurant chain. This is in addition to the 5 original cases that happened in Chicago in late December. However, the parasites that caused these new illnesses appears to be a bit different from the DNA fingerprint that involved the smaller outbreak last month.

  According to the CDC, this new case is a result of the filler used in McDonald’s so-called “all beef patties.” Testing revealed the beef patties contain 23% ground worm filler. Further investigation showed purchases made from Roger Lee’s Worm Farm by the fast food giant as far back as 2008.
