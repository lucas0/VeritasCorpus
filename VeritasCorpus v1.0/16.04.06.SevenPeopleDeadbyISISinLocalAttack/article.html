  In April 2016, social media rumors began spreading that involved headlines which partially read “Dead by ISIS”. However, the location of the purported attacks (and number of people allegedly killed) varied tremendously. One version involved Eugene, Oregon, and reported that 27 people were killed by ISIS militants:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Eugene – Islamic State group militants reportedly attacked city killing 27 people. According to police, the militants — also known as ISIS or ISIL — also claimed they posted photos online of their fighters standing in the city’s main government complex.
  </p>
  <p>
   “They used six suicide vehicles followed by a commando of fighters wearing explosive belts,” an unidentified military source told police. “They managed to take control of the base when the army had to pull out because it suffered casualties. … Our forces have since counter-attacked and retaken control, with aerial coalition backing.”
  </p>
  <p>
   Local police were working to clear the city of explosives and break up pockets of resistance. About 700 ISIS fighters were thought to be hiding in the city.
  </p>
  <p>
   Details about ISIS attack (or attacks) were scarce and often contradictory. police reported that ISIS said it captured 11 army bases, which the Iraqi army has said is false.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  It didn’t take much skepticism to observe such a development would immediately become a focal point in national news, no matter where in the United States it happened. However, the only news of the purported ISIS attacks came from one web site:
  <em>
   World Current Events
  </em>
  . The page’s sidebar listed nearly identical headlines for claims involving similar ISIS attacks in a number of locations, suggesting that the site’s sole purpose was to spread fake stories about mass murders.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the claims escalated in popularity in April 2016, they appeared on social media as early as 1 February 2016:
