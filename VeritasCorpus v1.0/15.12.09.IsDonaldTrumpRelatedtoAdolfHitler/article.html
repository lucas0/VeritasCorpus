  On 8 December 2015, the entertainment website
  <em>
   The Good Lord Above
  </em>
  published an article claiming that Donald Trump was related to Adolf Hitler:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   A new report released today proves that billionaire presidential candidate Donald Trump is a not-so-distant relative of Adolph Hitler.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Trump is related to Hitler on his paternal grandmother’s side,” said Charles Perry, director of the National Genealogical Society, which released the study. “She lived in Bavaria and married Adolph Hitler’s grand uncle from Austria-Hungary, Johann Schicklgruber.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  There is no truth the above-quoted story. The National Genealogical Society has not released a study connecting Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. Its director is not named Charles Perry, and in fact, there does not

   appear
  </a>
  to be a Charles Perry working there at all.
