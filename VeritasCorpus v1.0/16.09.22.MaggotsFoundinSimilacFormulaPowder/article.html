   I am not a social media person but this time I have to, I dont want any babies to go throught this. I’ve been feeding my baby #Similac Sensitive since he was born 6/22/16, this morning I opened a can I bought on Monday at #Walmart I made a bottle in the car, when he was done with it I noticed something inside his bottle, it was a MAGGOT!!! I couldnt beileve it, I made another bottle and it also had a maggot in it. I checked the bag with the formula and found another one, first thing I did when I came home was to checked the rest of the can…i found 3 more inside the can. I dont have words to explain the way I feel!!! I talked to my babys pediatrician, she said he should be fine since the acids from his stomach can destroys those things…I hope that she is right! Please help me and other moms by sharing this!!!

   The post was shared hundreds of thousands of times, and the video received more than ten million views. The volume of interactions on the status update made it difficult to determine whether the original poster shared any updates; no further information was available on her wall. We contacted her about the claim but have not yet received a reply.
