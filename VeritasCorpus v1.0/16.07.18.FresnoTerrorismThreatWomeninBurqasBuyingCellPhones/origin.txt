  This is a viral e-mail that went out from a fellow named Earl Wright following my Eagle Eyes presentation to the Clovis Rotary Club in December. It has gone around the world several times and I have heard back from folks who know me all over the place. The purpose of the Eagle Eyes program is to familiarize military and civilian folks with the eight observable steps leading up to a terrorist event and to encourage them to call the phone numbers I provided to the FBI, Fresno Police or Air Force OSI if they see something that doesn’t look right. That way the appropriate agencies can intervene and stop an attack from taking place.

  Our program has been very effective and has been cited as the best in the Air Guard for two years in a row. I’ve given this presentation hundreds of times to military and civilian organizations, and this is the first time something like this has happened. The quotes apparently attributed to me are false. I never refer to people as “ragheads” or f***ers, although I do stress that we don’t profile. The examples cited in this

  have been distorted,
  <nobr>
   mis-represented

  and inaccurately reported and attributed to me. If you or your agency would ever like to see the real presentation, I’ll be happy to come and give it at your convenience.
