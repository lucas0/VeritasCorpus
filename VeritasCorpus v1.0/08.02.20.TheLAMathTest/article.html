  The Internet humor piece variously entitled “The L.A. Math Proficiency Test” or “The City of
  <nobr>
   Los Angeles
  </nobr>
  High School Math Proficiency Exam” has been part of online lore since at least 1993, and some of our readers recall having seen photocopied versions of it as far back as the
  <nobr>
   mid-1980s
  </nobr>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Over time it has gone through some changes, notably the inclusion of
  <nobr>
   questions 9
  </nobr>
  and 10 (which were not part of the earlier versions). Its humor is obvious: it simultaneously deplores the state of education in large urban centers and furthers the myth that teens from such regions are thoroughly steeped in a drugs, guns, gangs, and promiscuity culture by asserting that even the math questions directed towards them have to be framed in that context to be relevant to their lives. None of the Norman Rockwellian “Johnny has three apples; if he sells two to Ben, then Becky gives him five, how many does he now have?” innocence appears
  <nobr>
   here — even
  </nobr>
  the test’s header furthers the jape by asking for the student’s name and gang affiliation, presenting the casual presumption that all the high schoolers being given the test are gang members.
 </p>
 <p>
  Obvious humor or not, the “test” has landed a number of educators into trouble over the years. The Canadian
  <em>
   National Post
  </em>
  reported that a teacher at the Juniper School in Thompson, Manitoba, was suspended from her duties in
  <nobr>
   June 2002
  </nobr>
  for distributing this test to students:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   A Manitoba school district has barred a Grade 8 instructor from classroom teaching for a year after she distributed a math quiz that used pimps and cocaine trafficking to illustrate questions of arithmetic.
  </p>
  <p>
   The 10-question quiz asked how much Willie would make for stealing a number of luxury cars, the distance a thief could travel on a stolen skateboard before he gets “whacked,” and how many “tricks” a day three prostitutes must turn to support their pimp Rufus’s cocaine habit.
  </p>
  <p>
   The School District of Mystery Lake in Thompson, Man., suspended the veteran Juniper School teacher on June 5, two days after irate parents brought the “joke” test to the district’s attention. This week the district disciplined her further by assigning her to non-classroom teaching until June, 2003. The teacher has not been identified.

   “I don’t know where she got the idea to give this to kids. We were outraged,” one student’s father, who asked not to be identified, told The Winnipeg Sun. The father saw the “Juniper School Math Proficiency Exam” after his young son brought his copy home from school.
