  The doctors dealing with this special case informed the parents of the child that they would conduct an operation on the hands of their baby girl. Their little one would also be given an antistatic.

  The operation went smoothly – with no complications whatsoever because it seemed like the little girl’s hands were simply glued together by a single layer of light skin. Nothing prepared the medical team for what was hidden in the baby girl’s hands. As her hands were separated, it is claimed that the message ‘JESUS IS COMING BACK!’ was written on the inside of her hands.
