  In a bold move, President Donald Trump has purchased the MDI estate of David Rockefeller, according to filings at the Hancock County, Maine deed registry. The palatial Seal Harbor home, named The Eyrie, has been a fixture of the Mount Desert Island landscape for decades. According to sources, Trump plans to use the estate as a “Summer White House”, hosting influential business leaders and heads of state. Some local residents are angry, citing increased traffic congestion and their general hatred of the President. No official comment from the White House as to when the President plans his first visit.
