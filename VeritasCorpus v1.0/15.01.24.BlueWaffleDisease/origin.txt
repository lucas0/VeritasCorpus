  There is a rumor going around about a new STD called “Blue Waffle.”

 <p>
  “A ‘waffle’ is a slang term for a vagina. A ‘blue waffle’ is a slang term for a severe vaginal infection. It’s basically a slang term for an extremely nasty or severe vaginal infection/STD on the vagina. The infection could cause lesions on the outside of the vagina, as well as bruising, which causes it to look blue in color.”

  Much discussion ensured about whether the photograph was real or a digital manipulation, and, if the former, whether it really pictured an infection (rather than, say, bruising resulting from rape or some other form of trauma).
