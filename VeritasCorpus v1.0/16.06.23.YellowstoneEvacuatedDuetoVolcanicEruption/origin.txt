  Yellowstone National Park has been hastily evacuated as fear of the Yellowstone Calderaâ€™s eruption is deemed to be approaching sooner than previously expected. Researchers on-site claim that the 640,000 year-old super volcano has exhibited a sudden spike of activity which indicates that it could erupt in as little as two weeks.
