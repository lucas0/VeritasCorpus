  On 9 November 2016, the Global Sun web site posted a story playing off the unexpected victory of Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election, reporting that Canada had received millions of applications from Americans seeking to immigrate to their northern neighbor:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Justin Trudeau made a shocking announcement this morning saying that the Canadian government so far has received about 11.5 million immigration applications from American residents wishing to move into the cold north (we’re sure you can guess why). He then proceeded to say that ‘although Canada as a nation sadly will not be able to accept all applications, we will most likely ease our immigration rules to assist our fellow Americans’.
  </p>
  <p>
   Trudeau then follows by outlining Canada’s strongest morals, reflecting on the diversity and acceptance for all people, no matter their background. What do you think about this? Should the Canadian government ease up on the immigration rules for their fellow Americans?
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  Trudeau has made no such statement on record that we could locate, and a quick look at the Global Sun’s web site clarifies that it is a fake news publication. Other headlines on the page include: “Donald Trump Drops Out of Campaign, Claims ‘Joke Has Gone Too Far'” and “Flying Drone with Chainsaw Attacks Children at Park.”

   reported

  , however, that the official Canadian government web site explaining how to move to that country crashed due to a traffic overload upon news that Donald Trump had won the 8 November 2016 U.S. presidential election.
