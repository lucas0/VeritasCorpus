  Justin Trudeau made a shocking announcement this morning saying that the Canadian government so far has received about 11.5 million immigration applications from American residents wishing to move into the cold north (we’re sure you can guess why). He then proceeded to say that ‘although Canada as a nation sadly will not be able to accept all applications, we will most likely ease our immigration rules to assist our fellow Americans’.

  Trudeau then follows by outlining Canada’s strongest morals, reflecting on the diversity and acceptance for all people, no matter their background. What do you think about this? Should the Canadian government ease up on the immigration rules for their fellow Americans?
