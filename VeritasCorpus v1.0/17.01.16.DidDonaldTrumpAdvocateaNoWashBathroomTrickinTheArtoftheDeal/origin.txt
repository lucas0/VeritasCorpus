    Another one of my personal favorite power plays is quite simple, but very effective: The “no-wash” trick. And this is really so easy, I’ve been doing it myself since the 3rd grade. Stop washing your hands. After going to the bathroom, don’t wash your hands. Think about it: Your handling your junk, you leave the men’s room, go back to your meeting and shake hands with people. They don’t know, but YOU know they’re basically touching your junk. And the leverage you feel after that kind of play could be the advantage that you need to land a big contract, or negotiate a lower settlement if a real estate deal goes kaputskies.
