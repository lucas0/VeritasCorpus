  Perhaps luckily for the rappers’ families and fans still seeking closure, [former Los Angeles Police Department Detective Greg] Kading made copies of nearly every investigative report and taped confession before he left LAPD. His explosive book details the behind-the-scenes failure by LAPD to bring Shakur’s and Smalls’ killers to justice.

  In a taped confession fully reviewed by L.A. Weekly, Keffe D says, “[Combs] took me downstairs and he’s like, ‘Man, I want to get rid of them dudes.’ … I was like, ‘We’ll wipe their *** out, quick. It’s nothing.’ … We wanted a million.”

  In another stunning confession, detailed in LAPD documents reviewed by the Weekly, the mother of one of Knight’s children, identified in Kading’s book as “Theresa Swann,” breaks down in tears, stating that the former Death Row boss gave her the money to pay Wardell “Poochie” Fouse, Knight’s close associate and a fellow member of the Mob Piru Bloods, to kill Smalls.
