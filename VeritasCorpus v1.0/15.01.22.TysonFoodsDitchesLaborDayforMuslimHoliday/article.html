  In August 2008, the Shelbyville, Tennessee,
  <em>
   Times-Gazette
  </em>
  reported that beginning in
  <nobr>
   Fall 2008
  </nobr>
  workers at the local Tyson Foods’ poultry processing plant would no longer have a paid day off on Labor Day but would instead be given a paid day off in conjunction with the Muslim holiday of
  <nobr>
   Eid al-Fitr.
  </nobr>
  (The three-day
  <nobr>
   <a href="/politics/religion/eidstamp.asp" target="eid">
    Eid al-Fitr
   </a>
  </nobr>
  festival celebrates the end of the fasting Muslims observe during the preceding Islamic month of Ramadan.)  An estimated 1,100 Somali refugees (most of them Muslims) live in the Shelbyville-Bedford County area, and according to Tyson’s Director of Media Relations, Gary Mickelson, approximately 250 of the 1,200 workers currently employed at that Tyson Foods plant were Somalis.  (A press release issued by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which represents workers at that Tyson plant, stated the plant had as many as
  <nobr>
   700 Muslim
  </nobr>
  workers.)
 </p>
 <p>
  Tyson Foods issued a press release about the issue, which noted that the change in holidays applied only to a single processing plant and was accommodated as part of a union-initiated contract demand:

 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Contrary to recent reports, Labor Day is still a holiday at Tyson Foods.  This issue concerns only the plant at Shelbyville, TN.  The majority of employees at the Tyson plant in Shelbyville, TN, are represented by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Stores Union (RWDSU), an American union that asked for and received
   <nobr>
    Eid al-Fitr
   </nobr>
   as one of their eight paid holidays in place of Labor Day.  This applies only to the Shelbyville plant and resulted as part of the union contract negotiated last fall. This change does not apply to Tyson Foods’ other
   <nobr>
    118 plants.
   </nobr>
   This is not a religious accommodation, rather, it is part of a union-initiated contract demand.
  </p>
  <p>
   This change came about as a result of union demands brought to the negotiating table, and was agreed upon by Tyson in an effort to reach a contractual agreement with the union.  The contract that calls for this change was unanimously recommended by the
   <nobr>
    12-person
   </nobr>
   union bargaining committee, which included three Somali employees. The contract was then overwhelmingly agreed to by
   <nobr>
    80 percent
   </nobr>
   of the rank and file membership of the union at the Shelbyville plant.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Muslim population at the Shelbyville plant is primarily composed of approximately
   <nobr>
    250 Somali
   </nobr>
   employees, who are political refugees, most of whom came to the plant as a result of refugee resettlement efforts based in Nashville.  They were employed at the plant through the Tennessee Department of Employment Security office.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Shelbyville complex employs approximately 1,200 people.  Approximately 1,000 workers are covered by the union agreement at Shelbyville.
