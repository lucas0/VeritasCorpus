  After [
  <em>
   Fantasia
  </em>
  ‘s] 1969 rerelease proved a cult hit among college-age kids looking for a hallucinogenic experience, conservative groups began picketing movie theaters for screening Disney’s animated “drug fantasies.” Hippie-era moviegoers liked to sit in the front row, even on top of each other, smoking pot and offering advice to Mickey.

  The company asked the theaters to promote the film not as typical Disney fare, but “now you sell
  <em>
   Fantasia
  </em>
  as you did
  <nobr>
   <em>
    Easy Rider
   </em>
   .
  </nobr>
  Hip youngsters come to see it as a special kind of trip.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Disney didn’t exactly discourage the connotation. Psychedelic posters and other ad materials featuring Chernobog and the dancing mushrooms called it “The Ultimate Experience,” while the promotional kit quoted one underground review: “Disney’s
  <em>
   Fantasia
  </em>
  : A Head Classic: Representation of sound as color does resemble tripping on STD, LSD, THC and various other letters of the alphabet.”

  Long afterwards, fans continued to ask the animators if they were “on something” when they made [
  <em>
   Alice in Wonderland
  </em>
  ]. It’s not such an odd question, considering that all the things in the book and movie that suggest drugs: Alice ingests potions, wafers and mushrooms that change her size or alter her consciousness, her perspective constantly changes, she loses track of time, space and her own identity. There’s the hookah-smoking caterpillar. In fact, the entire story, a dream framed by the “real world,” might be seen as a hallucination or trip.

 <p>
  So, it wasn’t surprising that in 1971
  <em>
   Alice in Wonderland
  </em>
  was the top renting 16mm film in every college town across the country, playing to capacity crowds in heavy smoke-filled fraternity houses, university theaters, discos and private homes, where it sometimes ran over and over again for an entire weekend.
 </p>
 <p>
  After the smash cult revival of
  <em>
   Fantasia
  </em>
  , Disney withdrew the 16mm prints of
  <em>
   Alice
  </em>
  and targeted a 1974 theater rerelease. The studio prepared ads with copy such as “Down the rabbit hole and through the talking door lies a world where vibrant colors merge into shapes of fantasy, and music radiates from flowers,” “Nine out of ten Dormice recommend Walt Disney’s
  <em>
   Alice in Wonderland
  </em>
  for visual euphoria and good, clean nonsense,” and “Should you see it? Go ask Alice,” a reference to Jefferson Airplane’s song “White Rabbit.”
