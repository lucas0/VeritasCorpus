  These machines are manufactured by Samsung to ripped the hair off dogs while they are still alive in the machine as it spins!
 </p>
 <p>
  Samsung supplies these machines to vendors and dog meat traders. Not only is Samsung actively helping the barbaric practice of dog eating to continue but are also contributing to the suffering of thousands of dogs that are being tortured and killed, by being boiled, blow torched or skinned alive, the most horrific brutal methods possible by the dog meat butchers.

 <p>
  Samsung does not care! Their interest is only in profit.
