  On 14 April 2016, the
  <em>
   New Yorker
  </em>
  published an
  <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/ben-carson-says-he-has-no-memory-of-running-for-president" target="_blank">
   article
  </a>
  by Andy Borowitz reporting that former Republican candidate Dr. Ben Carson, previously a renowned pediatric neurosurgeon, had no memory of running for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon, stirred controversy by saying in a televised interview that he had no recollection of running for President of the United States.
  </p>
  <p>
   Appearing on the Fox News Channel, Dr. Carson responded to host Sean Hannity’s question about his ten-month-long candidacy by saying, “I do not recall any of that occurring.”
  </p>
  <p>
   “I’ve been told that I did it, but I find it impossible to believe,” he said. “I don’t think I’d forget a thing like that.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>

  Although many readers who encountered the story via social media believed it to be a genuine news report, is was nothing more than a spoof by comedian Andy Borowitz, who regularly pens satirical items for his “Borowitz Report” column in
  <em>
   The New Yorker
  </em>
