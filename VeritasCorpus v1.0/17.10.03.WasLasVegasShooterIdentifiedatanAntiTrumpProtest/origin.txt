  If you told me an asteroid fell into Earth, it would mean the same to me. There’s absolutely no sense, no reason he did this . . . He’s just a guy who played video poker and took cruises and ate burritos at Taco Bell. There’s no political affiliation that we know of. There’s no religious affiliation that we know of.
