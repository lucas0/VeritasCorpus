   CHUCK TODD: You said something the other day that caught me off-guard. You said you’re not a masochist. And if you start falling in the poll you’ll go back to your business. What does that mean? Are you not in this for the long haul?

  DONALD TRUMP: If I was dropping in the polls where I saw that I wasn’t gonna win, why would I continue?  I believe in polls. How many elections do you see where the polls were wrong? Not that many. Okay. You see ’em, but not that many. If I were doing poorly, if I saw myself going down, if you would stop calling me ’cause you no longer have any interest in Trump because “he has no chance,” I’d go back to my business. I have no problem with that.
