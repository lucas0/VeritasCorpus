  I know time is short. I will not waste words. You have seen my comments on the so-called “PizzaGate” scandal. I can tell you that yes, it is completely true. This is common knowledge among those in power. The pedophile ring in Washington D.C. is the biggest in the world, with London’s probably coming in second.

  While I have never participated in these heinous acts, I know people who have and I know many who escaped prosecution. Time is to short to explain why I have remained silent for so long, but I will say that I would have never become Mayor of New York City if I did not “play ball,” as it were.
