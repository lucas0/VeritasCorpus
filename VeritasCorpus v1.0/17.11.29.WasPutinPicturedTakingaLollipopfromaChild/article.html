  President Putin did not steal a lollipop from this child.

   Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a Christmas service in a church in Sochi early on January 7, 2013. Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas on January 7 in the Middle East, Russia and other Orthodox churches that use the old Julian calendar instead of the 17th-century Gregorian calendar adopted by Catholics, Protestants, Greek Orthodox and commonly used in secular life around the world.

  The genuine images went viral shortly after their publication as internet users noticed that the little boy looked scared in one of the photographs. When they were posted to

  Although the images of Putin and the scared-looking child are real, we aren’t positive that they were taken in the order displayed above, or if they show the child’s reaction to something Putin said or did.
