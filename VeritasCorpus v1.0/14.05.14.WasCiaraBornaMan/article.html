  Back in 2005, Ciara Harris was an 18-year-old  who performed under the stage name of Ciara and was dubbed the First Lady of
  <nobr>
   “Crunk &amp; B,”
  </nobr>
  a genre of music described as a grinding, dance floor-friendly alternative to R&amp;B. Her 2004 album, “Goodies,” topped the charts, and she was nominated at the
  <nobr>
   19th annual
  </nobr>
  Soul Train Music Awards in four categories, including best R&amp;B/soul single, female (“Goodies”) and best R&amp;B/soul or rap new artist.

  She was beautiful and talented. And around that time someone tied a salacious rumor to her — that she was born male but had been altered through surgical means to have the appearance of a female:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   I have been hearing from many people that the hip-hop artist Ciara used to be a man and had to have a sex change. Even more, I heard that she stated it on national televison!

   There has been rumor around the internet that hip-hop artist, Ciara, was once a hermaphrodite until the age of 11, when she had surgery to remove her male “appendages.”

   I have heard a rumor that the R&amp;B star, Ciara, was born male. That he/she decided that he wanted to be a female at the age of 5, and his mother let him grow his hair out.  I was told that he had surgery, so he no longer has a penis. And apparently he/she was on Oprah having an in depth conversation about it, along with discussing it in a magazine article.

  This rumor hit our inbox in a number of forms:
 </p>
 <p>
  <ul type="DISC">
   <br>
    <li>
     Ciara came into the world as a male, but somewhere along the way either she or her parents decided she should become a girl, with surgery performed on her to bring about this transformation.
    </li>
   </br>
  </ul>
 </p>
 <p>
  <li>
   She was born male but a botched circumcision did irreparable harm to her manly parts, so her parents opted to have what was left of her gentialia converted to feminine form.
  </li>
 </p>
 <p>
  <li>
   She started life as an intersexual, a person of mixed genders. A surgical solution was sought on her behalf to correct her body to being wholly one gender rather than a mixture of the two.
  </li>
