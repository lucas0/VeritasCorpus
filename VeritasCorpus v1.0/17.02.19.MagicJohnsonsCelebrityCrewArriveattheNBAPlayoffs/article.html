   about a proposed one-on-one match between NBA legends Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan. Although this match never happened, one could imagine that Johnson would have walked into Caesar’s Palace with a similar crew at his side:
  </br>
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="fr-tag">
   <strong>
    Thee made-for-TV court
   </strong>
   at Caesars Palace could have been empty except for one basketball and two of the game’s most illustrious players ever. They would’ve been free of teammates, facing each other head-on in
   <em>
    The King of the Court,
   </em>
   to finally answer a question that remained unanswered for so long: Who’s better—Michael Jordan or Magic Johnson?
  </p>
  <p class="fr-tag">
   The game was to consist of two halves—one-on-one, 15 minutes each—in a heavyweight matchup: a pay-per-view special, maybe on HBO, but certainly not NBC, because this wasn’t going to be some regular Sunday afternoon NBA game. This was meant to be a stunt of the highest order, under the bright lights of Las Vegas, the winner set to take home $1 million, with many,
   <em>
    many
   </em>
   more millions at stake.
  </p>
  <p class="fr-tag">
   […]
  </p>
  <p class="fr-tag">
   You’d still be talking about the original
   <em>
    King of the Court
   </em>
   right now if the TV executives had their way, because it could have been the pilot of an annual series: Duncan vs. Garnett, Kobe vs. LeBron, Westbrook vs. Curry, you name it. Instead, Jordan vs. Magic remains lost to memory of what may be the greatest basketball game never played.
