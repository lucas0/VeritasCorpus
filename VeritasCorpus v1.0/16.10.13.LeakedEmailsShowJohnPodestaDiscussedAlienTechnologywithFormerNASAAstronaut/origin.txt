  Subject: email for John Podesta (c/o Eryn) from Edgar Mitchel re meeting ASAP
 </p>
 <p>
  Dear John,
 </p>
 <p>
  As 2015 unfolds, I understand you are leaving the Administration in February.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is urgent that we agree on a date and time to meet to discuss Disclosure and Zero Point Energy, at your earliest available after your departure.
 </p>
 <p>
  My Catholic colleague Terri Mansfield will be there too, to bring us up to date on the Vatican’s awareness of ETI [extraterrestrial intelligence].
 </p>
 <p>
  Another colleague is working on a new Space Treaty, citing involvement with Russia and China. However with Russia’s extreme interference in Ukraine, I believe we must pursue another route for peace in space and ZPE on Earth.
 </p>
 <p>
  I met with President Obama’s Honolulu childhood friend, US Ambassador Pamela Hamamoto on July 4 at the US Mission in Geneva, when I was able to tell her briefly about zero point energy.
 </p>
 <p>
  I believe we can enlist her as a confidante and resource in our presentation for President Obama.
 </p>
 <p>
  I appreciate Eryn’s assistance in working with Terri to set up our meeting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Best regards,
  <br>
   Edgar D. Mitchell, ScD
