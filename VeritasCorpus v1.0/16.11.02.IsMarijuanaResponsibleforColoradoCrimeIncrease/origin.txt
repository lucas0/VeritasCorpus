  <strong>
   Driving Under the Influence of Drugs (DUID):
  </strong>
  DUID could include alcohol in combination with drugs. This is an important measurement since the driver’s ability to operate a vehicle was sufficiently impaired that it brought his or her driving to the attention of law enforcement. Not only the erratic driving but the subsequent evidence that the subject was under the influence of marijuana helps confirm the causation factor.

  <strong>
   Marijuana Related:
  </strong>
  Also called “marijuana mentions,” is any time marijuana shows up in the toxicology report. It could be marijuana only or marijuana with other drugs and/or alcohol.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Marijuana Only:
  </strong>
  When toxicology results show marijuana and no other drugs or alcohol.
