  Just one hour after the seven-hour-long terrorist attacks upon the U.S. consulate in Benghazi began, our commander-in-chief, vice president, secretary of defense and their national security team gathered together in the Oval Office listening to phone calls from American defenders desperately under siege and watching real-time video of developments from a drone circling over the site.  Yet they sent no military aid that might have intervened in time to save lives.

  Reports have just surfaced from a former Navy Seal present in Benghazi that those on the ground in Benghazi sent an urgent request from the CIA annex for military
  <nobr>
   back-up
  </nobr>
  during the attack on the U.S. consulate. Those requests were denied by U.S.
  <nobr>
   officials — who
  </nobr>
  told the CIA operators twice to “stand down” rather than help the ambassador’s team. They were told to “stand down,” according to sources familiar with the exchange. Soon after, they were again told to “stand down.” Thankfully, that former Seal and at least two others ignored those orders and made their way to the consulate which at that point was on fire.

  The information I heard today was that General Ham as head of Africom received the same
  <nobr>
   e-mails
  </nobr>
  the White House received requesting help/support as the attack was taking place. General Ham immediately had a rapid response unit ready and communicated to the Pentagon that he had a unit ready.
 </p>
 <p>
  General Ham then received the order to stand down. His response was to screw it, he was going to help anyhow. Within
  <nobr>
   30 seconds
  </nobr>
  to a minute after making the move to respond, his second in command apprehended General Ham and told him that he was now relieved of his command.
 </p>
 <p>
  Navy Rear Admiral, former commander of the USS John Stennis Strike Group, Rear Admiral Charles Gaouette was also mysteriously relieved of duty, and all the brass will say is he is “under investigation” for, get this, “inappropriate leadership judgment.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Just another way of saying that the admiral dared differ with the Administration’s Libya policy and perhaps openly defied Defense Secretary Leon Panetta.
