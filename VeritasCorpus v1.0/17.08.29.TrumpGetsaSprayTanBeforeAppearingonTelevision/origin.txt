  The inauguration is still a few days away, but this “Donald Trump” has already moved into the Oval Office.

  Madame Tussauds in London, famous for immortalizing the famous in wax, unveiled their figure of the president-elect on Wednesday, who stands proudly in a replica of the Oval Office. Unlike the Barack Obama figure revealed in 2009, who was depicted smiling, Trump appears resolute and quite serious.
