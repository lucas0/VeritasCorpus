  American, French and British military forces, convinced that [Libyan leader Muammar] Gadhafi was not adhering to a United Nations-mandated cease-fire, hammered Libyan military positions with missiles and fighter jets in the first phase of an operation that will include enforcement of a no-fly zone.

  More than 110 Tomahawk missiles fired from American and British ships and submarines hit about 20 Libyan air and missile defense targets in western portions of the country, U.S. Vice Adm. William Gortney said at a Pentagon briefing.

  The salvo, in an operation dubbed “Odyssey Dawn,” was meant “to deny the Libyan regime from using force against its own people,” said Gortney … Earlier, French fighter jets deployed over Libya fired at a military vehicle Saturday, the first strike against Gadhafi’s military forces, which earlier attacked the rebel stronghold of Benghazi.

  Prime Minister David Cameron said that British forces also are in action over Libya. “What we are doing is necessary, it is legal and it is right,” he said. “I believe we should not stand aside while this dictator murders his own people.”
