 <p>
  Urban garbage seems to be everywhere, except when you really need It.
 </p>
 <p>
  Director Sonny Grosso, in town to film episodes of CBSâ€™
  <em>
   Night Heat,
  </em>
  ordered a massive pile of garbage to make Toronto look more like New York.
 </p>
 <p>
  But when the film crew came back from a coffee break, they found the trash had been cleaned up. Filming had to be halted while Grosso ordered more garbage.
 </p>
 <p>
  The incident was reported in the American magazine
  <em>
   This World,
  </em>
  and a delighted city works commissioner Ray Bremner proudly showed off copies to aldermen at a recent meeting.
