  <em>
   Lou Lavely, Travelers Rest High School Principal, continues to power trip and strip young Americans the right to proudly boast this Nation’s flag.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Last night I picked my brother up from the TRHS Football game and he told me that Lavely had denied entry to a couple of young men with Americans flag. I can’t deny the rage I felt as this is the third incident I’ve had involving Lavely and the flag I love.
 </p>
 <p>
  Third, last night as I took the flag and attempted to enter myself he stated, “he has the authority to tell anyone they can’t bring it on the property.” Unfortunately the cops were not helpful and sided with Lavely even after stating “you’d probably win if you took it to the school district.” I’m no expert and don’t know the laws in and out. But.. if he has the power to strip Americans the right to boast the American flag after being pumped up about our Olympic run there is a much bigger problem. A problem that need to be resolved.

 <p>
  I’m sick of this political correctness. We need to do something about it because it’s not getting any better.
