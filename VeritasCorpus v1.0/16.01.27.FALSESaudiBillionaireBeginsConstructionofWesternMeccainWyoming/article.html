  On 18 November 2015, the entertainment web site
  <em>
   Real News Right Now
  </em>
  published a fake news article claiming that a Saudi billionaire had purchased Buford, Wyoming and was planning on building “the Mecca of the west”:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   When Sheikh Mohammed Kamel Alsaud purchased the small town of Buford, Wyoming from a Vietnamese entrepreneur last year for $1.8 million, his lifelong dream of bringing Islam to America was one step closer to becoming a reality.
  </p>
  <p>
   “I have fond memories of spending summers on the Mediterranean aboard my father’s yacht. On occasion we’d visit the Gulf [of Mexico] to entertain his American clients,” Alsaud told Forbes magazine. “Even as a child, I was always struck by the distinct lack of mosques in the U.S., but they say what America lacks in mosques, it makes up tenfold in prisons.”
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The above-quoted story didn’t gain much traction when it was first published, but on 25 January 2016, web sites such as
  <em>
   Liveleak and TapWires
  </em>
  republished the dubious article with the addition of unrelated photos, managing to convince Twitter users that the plans to build a “Mecca of the West” were real. A video purportedly showing the construction site was also

   published
  </a>
  to YouTube.
 </p>
 <p>
  These claims, however, are completely fabricated. The story about the Saudi billionaire purchasing Buford, Wyoming originated on a fake news web site. While
  <em>
   Real News Right Now
  </em>
  does not specifically label itself as a satire publication, its “About” section is full of lies and exaggerations about its (likely completely fictional) fictional founder, R. Hobbus J.D.
 </p>
 <p>
  The clearest nod to the site’s humorous intent is the claim that Hobbus was awarded the “
  <span style="line-height: 1.6471;">
   prestigious Stephen Glass Distinction in Journalistic Integrity,” a non-
  </span>
  existent
  <span style="line-height: 1.6471;">
   award named after a journalist best

    known
   </a>
   for completely making up news stories.

 <p>
  However, the reality does mirror the fake story to a certain degree. While Buford, Wyoming (population: 1) will not be turned into the “Mecca of the West,” the town actually was

  by Pham Dinh Nguyen in 2013 for $900,000, and then renamed PhinDeli Town Buford.
