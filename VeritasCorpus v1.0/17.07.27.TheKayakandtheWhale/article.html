  Often photographers who have posted their work online will find that one of their pictures has been grabbed by someone else, combined with elements from a different photo (or otherwise digitally altered) to make it more compelling or salacious, and sent winging around the Internet to spread virally from inbox to inbox. In many cases these manipulated photographs depict people in imminent danger from large, dangerous, scary animals, such as widely-circulated images of a hapless

  </p>
  <p>
   Yep, that is me in the picture. Yep that is a whale that was just around the corner from the ferry terminal.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Paddle really fast” is the only thing I could think of at the time.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also thinking that I don’t look like a herring, don’t smell like a herring but with the same herring instinct of “get the hell out of the way of that big mouth!!”

   Still living to tell yet another story…

  Like many such images, this is a manufactured phony, a jape created by merging two photographs taken at different times and places:
