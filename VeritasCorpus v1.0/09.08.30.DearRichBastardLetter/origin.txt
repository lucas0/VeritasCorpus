  The National Westminster Bank in England admitted last month that it keeps personal information about its customers — such as their political affiliation — on computer. But now
  <em>

  reveals that a financial institution, sadly unnamed, has gone one better and moved into the realm of personal abuse.
 </p>
 <p>
  The institution decided to mass-mail 2000 of its richest customers, inviting them to buy extra services. One of its computer programmers wrote a program to search through the databases and select its customers automatically. He tested the program with an imaginary customer called Rich Bastard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unfortunately, an error resulted in all 2000 letters being addressed “Dear Rich Bastard”. The luckless programmer was subsequently fired.
