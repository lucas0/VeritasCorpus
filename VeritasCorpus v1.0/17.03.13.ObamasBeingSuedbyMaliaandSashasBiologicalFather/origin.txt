  A man named Ezekiel Wilekenmeyer Williams has filed a case in federal court against Barack and Michelle Obama for intentionally cutting his children from his life. In the claim, Williams says he’s the biological father of both girls, hired by Dunstrom Pharmaceuticals to provide sperm for the former first couple nearly twenty years ago.

  Williams, who has 4 PhDs from MIT and Oxford, sits first chair violin in the London Philharmonic Orchestra and is a world champion chess and Texas Hold ‘Em player, says the original agreement was that if his offspring became famous, he would receive recognition for being their father.
