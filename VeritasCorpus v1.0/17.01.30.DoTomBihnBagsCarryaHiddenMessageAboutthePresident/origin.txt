  Tom Bihn, president of the eponymous company, said he doesn’t know which of his
  <nobr>
   10 employees
  </nobr>
  are responsible. “They know my French is so bad they could sneak it past me,” he said. But he doesn’t appear to be too determined to root out the guilty party and said he’s “not opposed to the sentiments” about
  <nobr>
   Mr. Bush.
  </nobr>
 </p>

  “We haven’t looked really hard to find out who did it because it’s good for us. When we find them, we’ll give them a raise,” said
  <nobr>
   Mr. Bihn,
  </nobr>
  who insists the “president” mentioned on the tag is a reference to himself as the company’s president and not to
  <nobr>
   Mr. Bush.
  </nobr>
 </p>
 <p>
  The tag has “hit a resonating chord” all over the world, including France, where some customers believe the reference is to their president, Jacques Chirac. “People out there think a number of presidents are idiots,” said
  <nobr>
   Mr. Bihn.
  </nobr>
  “It’s a universal message.”
