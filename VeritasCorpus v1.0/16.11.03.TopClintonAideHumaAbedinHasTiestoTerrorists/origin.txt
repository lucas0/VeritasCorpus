  The facts that explain Huma Abedin’s Saudi Arabia terrorism ties- Simplified to understand! Hillary winning is a security threat to us all.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her history and alarming connections are mostly unknown to the American people.
 </p>
 <p>
  Who is Huma Abedin? What do we know about Hillary Clinton’s number #1 aide and side-kick for 20 years? Hillary spoke at Huma’s wedding, saying “if I had a second daughter, it would be Huma.’’
 </p>
 <p>
  This presidential election decides who gets to run the most powerful country on earth- so it’s obviously very important to understand the facts about Huma Abedin, as she may very soon become Chief of Staff in The White House.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’ll be simplifying a very intricate web of people and events that unfolded over many years, all of this information and more is available online for anyone with access to Google- Anyway, here is the biggest story of this election that you definitely won’t see on CNN – condensed so that even a child can understand.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are four main players in this:
 </p>
 <p>
  1) Hillary Clinton 2) Huma Abedin 3) Abdullah Omar Naseef 4) Saudi Arabia
 </p>
 <p>
  Huma was born in the USA (1976), then when she was two years old her family moved to Saudi Arabia (1978). They lived in Saudi Arabia for 16 years. Huma returned to the USA (1994) when she was 18 to study at George Washington University. Only after two years in the country she became an intern for Hillary Clinton (1996) and soon after started working full-time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Also from 1996, Huma was working at her family’s business – A journal called The Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs. The Abedin family’s business is owned by the Muslim World League, Saudi Arabia’s organisation that promotes Wahhabi Islam around the world. They even share an office at 46 Goodge St, London – Saleha Abedin, Huma’s mother and Hassan Abedin, Huma’s brother, currently work there still.
 </p>
 <p>
  Abdullah Omar Naseef, a high-ranking leader in the Muslim World League and the Saudi Kingdom council, funded the creation of Huma’s family business. He also funded Al-Qaeda, along with other Saudi Arabia officials, for many years. His organisation was declared guilty of funding terrorism by the USA State Department.
