  Frequent internet users have likely come across at least one story about the generosity of actor Keanu Reeves.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps it was the video of the
  <em>
   Speed
  </em>
  star giving up his
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMB1EOnUwX8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   seat
  </a>
  on the subway, or maybe it was a report about his involvement with

   charitable

  causes such as
  <a href="https://www.looktothestars.org/charity/peta" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

  , or his

   donations
  </a>
  to fund children’s hospital and cancer research. Or maybe it was the story of how Keanu bought motorcycles for the stuntmen after filming
  <em>
   The Matrix.
  </em>
  Or, most likely, it was the (

   exaggerated
  </a>
  ) tale of how the actor gave away a portion of his
  <em>
   Matrix
  </em>
  salary to the crew.
 </p>
 <p>
  Stories of Reeves’ generosity became so prevalent that by February 2018 they had morphed into a bit of an internet joke. Internet users started sharing outlandish and imaginary tales about how he had come to their unlikely rescue.
 </p>
 <p>
  The following
  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Be9X4KklsaG/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   meme

  , for instance, claimed that Reeves randomly gave an envelope full of cash to a stranger after learning that the man’s son needed a kidney transplant:

   Today Keanu Reeves pulled up at my place of work so we started talking then I mentioned that my son needed a kidney transplant surgery and I couldn’t afford it at the moment he stood silent for a few minutes then went to this car and came back and gave me this envelope full of money.

  This is not a true story.

  Both of these images predate this meme and are not related to one another.

  The photograph of Reeves and a fan was taken in January 2018. The original photographs have been deleted from Facebook but a Keanu Reeves fan page stated that it was taken by “Mar Felipe” somewhere in Los Angeles. When these images first circulated they were not attached to any claims about a kidney transplant:

  We haven’t been able to locate the exact origins of the photograph featuring an envelope full of cash, but this image has been circulating since at least

  Keanu Reeves’ off-screen life has proven to be a popular subject on the internet. In December 2016, for instance, a viral (and
