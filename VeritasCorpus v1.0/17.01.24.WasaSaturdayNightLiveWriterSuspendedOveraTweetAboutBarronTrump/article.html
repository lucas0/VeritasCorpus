  A writer for weekly NBC sketch comedy show “Saturday Night Live” was indefinitely suspended after backlash over a tweet she wrote on 20 January 2017 about President Donald Trump’s youngest child, Barron.
 </p>
 <p>
  Katie Rich, who writes jokes for the show’s mock news segment, “Weekend Update,” posted a tweet during the 45th president’s inauguration that 10-year-old Barron Trump “will be this country’s first homeschool shooter.” On 23 January 2017, Rich tweeted an apology:
 </p>
 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
  <p dir="ltr" lang="en">
   I sincerely apologize for the insensitive tweet. I deeply regret my actions &amp; offensive words. It was inexcusable &amp; I’m so sorry.
  </p>
