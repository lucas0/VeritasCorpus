It was fitting that the quarterback capped off the weeks demonstrations, seeing as he was the one who launched the largest social justice protest the NFL has ever seen.But he was far from alone. Seventeen other players across the league joined him by kneeling or raising their fists during the playing of the national anthem before their games to draw attention to police brutality against minorities and spur conversations about social justice. The Seahawks Jeremy Lane opted to sit during the preseason, but joined in his teams demonstration of locking arms on Sunday instead.Here are a few striking photos that captured the moments.1.

The incident took place in the 6000 block of N. Ventura Canyon Avenue around 3:20 p.m. Friday, authorities said. Officials trying to determine if the man was electrocuted did not rule out the possibility of it being an unrelated medical event. Later, they seemed to indicate electricity may have played a factor in the worker’s demise. The man has not been identified by a neighbor said the man got out of an AT&T truck. The coroner will determine the man’s official cause of death.

During her meeting with the kittens, she made the sign for cat followed by baby  telling her trainers the kittens were now her adopted children. She also asked in sign language for one of the kittens to be placed on her head.Despite her huge hands being the size of the young cats, Koko was gentle with the tiny balls of fluff when they arrived in a cardboard box, carefully flicking a finger out to stroke them.   Maternal instinct: Koko is filmed signing 'cat' during the encounter. The gorilla's maternal and play instincts have apparently 'kicked in'   Communicating: This cradling motion is how Koko signifies the word baby, which she often signs, and carries her gorilla dolls the way gorilla mothers carry their babiesKoko was filmed being presented with a cardboard box containing the kittens, and taking a peek inside it, at the foundation's   base at Woodside, CaliforniaDespite her huge hands being the size of the animals, she was gentle with the tiny balls of fluff, carefully flicking a finger out to stroke them.Footage shows Koko taking her time before attempting to pick one of the kittens up - as if allowing them the chance to acclimatize to her first.She then scoops up a little grey kitten in her hand.After bringing the cat up to her face to take a closer look, the gorilla strokes its belly with her index finger before tucking it under her arm for a cuddle.RELATED ARTICLESPrevious12NextHeart-warming moment toddler giggles uncontrollably after...Artist creates the most amazing silhouettes you will ever...Dancing on air!

Koko has adopted these two kittens into her family, and it has energized her world.'Not only have Koko's maternal and play instincts kicked in, but she is signing more to her caregivers and generating new content every day that can be used by The Gorilla Foundation to create empathy for great apes.'The foundation noted that new content can have significant benefits to both endangered free-living great apes and those in captive environments.And that it encourages the development of two-way communication with their caregivers, something that Koko has had since she was a baby.Koko, who was born at San Francisco Zoo, has spent most of her life at The Gorilla Foundation in Woodside. According to the foundation's website, she spent a lot of her time with two male gorillas  - but did not initiate mating with either. She formed a 'sibling relationship' with one, which died in 2000, and is yet to show interest in mating with the other, despite getting along with them 'very well'.She is also living in an unnatural social situation - and attempts to bring other female gorillas into the family have apparently failed.

'We've known this for years, as she often signs the word BABY  and carries her gorilla dolls the way gorilla mothers carry their babies. 'She even pretends that her baby dolls can sign by molding their arms and hands in play or in response to questions.'Koko has also previously expressed a love for kittens, asking foundation workers for a cat for Christmas in 1984 via her 'sign language'. The gorilla's vocal and breathing behaviours associated with the ability to talk were thought to be impossible in her species.In the 1930s and 40s, a number of psychologists attempted to raise chimpanzees alongside human children, attempting and failing to teach them to speak. Since then it has been generally accepted that apes are not able to voluntarily control the sounds they produce or even their breathing.Experts also believed the vocal repertoire of each ape species to be fixed, so that they are unable to learn new sounds and breathing patterns.This would suggest the human ability to speak is unique. Postdoctoral researcher Marcus Perlman said: 'This idea says there's nothing that apes can do that is remotely similar to speech. 'And therefore, speech essentially evolved - completely new - along the human line since our last common ancestor with chimpanzees.' Dr Perlman, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, started research work at The Gorilla Foundation in 2010, where Koko has spent more than 40 years living immersed with humans and interacting for hours a day with psychologist Penny Patterson and biologist Ron Cohn.'I went there with the idea of studying Koko's gestures, but as I got into watching videos of her, I saw her performing all these amazing vocal behaviours,' he said. The vocal and breathing behaviours he saw were thought to be impossible, he said.Together with Nathaniel Clark of the University of California, Santa Cruz, he sifted 71 hours of video of Koko interacting and found repeated examples of her performing nine different voluntary behaviours that required control over her vocalisation and breathing.These were learned behaviours and not part of the typical gorilla repertoire, seemingly disproving previous theories.The researchers observed Koko blowing a 'raspberry' when she wanted a treat, blowing her nose into a tissue, playing wind instruments, blowing on a pair of glasses before wiping them with a cloth and mimicking phone conversations by chattering wordlessly into a telephone cradled between her ear and the crook of an elbow.'She doesn't produce a pretty, periodic sound when she performs these behaviours, like we do when we speak,' Dr Perlman says.'But she can control her larynx enough to produce a controlled grunting sound.' KOKO THE GORILLA WAS MOVED BY ROBIN WILLIAMS' DEATHNews of Robin Williams's untimely death last year hit Koko hard.The gorilla's handlers said she was moved nearly to tears by the news that her friend had passed away.In 2001, Williams visited the Gorilla Foundation centre and quickly befriended Koko, making her laugh for the first time in six months.When her carers explained to Koko, who is fluent in American Sign Language, that a friend of the center had died, she soon became sad and was pictured sitting hunched over with a quivering lip. In 2001, Robin Williams visited the Gorilla Foundation  and quickly befriended Koko, making her laugh for the first time in six monthsKoko even signed the words 'cry lip' - lip being her word for woman - as she watched staff reacting to the news.'She became extremely sad, Dr Penny Patterson wrote on Koko.org.Footage from the day Koko and Williams met is as uplifting as his suicide is tragic.The actor arrived there as a stranger to the gorilla with a personal interest in ape conservation. He left as Koko's friend. """

Every guest is allowed to bring a plus one. A few years ago, when I was new in town, I got invited by a good friend, I shouldn’t say his name I guess,” said Perry, who also explained that “each year a new host is selected for the following year by drawing straws, you know? It is the new host’s responsibility to provide the main course, and it has to be human. If he can’t find a suitable person to serve as the meal… Well the joke, I think it’s a joke, is that the host will be eaten instead!““I was a bit squeamish about the idea of going to this dinner party, but when I heard who else was going I jumped at the chance. I was like, ‘People die all the time and their bodies just go to waste. If we can use their organs for medical purposes why shouldn’t we eat their meat?'”Asked what happened at the dinner party, Perry explained, “It was a huge, lavish feast. Oh my god. The featured dish was what they called Foie Humaine. You guys should appreciate that, being French. It’s a pun on foie gras, get it? But instead of force-feeding a duck and then eating it’s liver, this was the liver of a human who had force-fed themselves on junk food.”“A fatty liver fit for the kings of Hollywood.”Describing herself as “not terribly fond of organ meats,” Perry passed on the liver dish, but did enjoy sampling human flesh during the multiple course Bacchanalian feast.“It tastes like pork,” the singer explained of human meat. “But a little bit bitter, stronger.”Katy Perry promoting Illuminati symbolism.Katy Perry’s cannibalistic confession is merely the latest in a long line of public dalliances the singer has shared with the dark side. After starting her career as a Christian country singer, the she reinvented her image as a raunchy pop star, flashing Satanic hand gestures and promoting Illuminati symbolism as she rode to the top of the charts.Since establishing herself in the global consciousness as a Devil-worshipping entertainer, Katy Perry has attempted to sugar coat her image, however the disturbing conversation she held with the French radio host suggests she is far from a reformed character, and she has openly embraced the darkest forces in our society.The incident has also sparked fears around the world that the Illuminati have moved onto the next phase of the masterplan, and have begun openly promoting dark spirituality as a viable religious choice for those seeking guidance.

https://www.snopes.com/trump-rolls-back-rules-protecting-elderly/	Did President Trump Roll Back Rules Protecting Elderly at Nursing Homes?	true	['elderly', ' nursing homes', ' obama administration', ' trump administration']	https://www.nytimes.com/	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/24/business/trump-administration-nursing-home-penalties.html	2017/12/28	Trump Administration Eases Nursing Home Fines in Victory for IndustryBy JORDAN RAUContinue reading the main storyPhotoSeema Verma, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has said that the agency’s regulations were “taking doctors away from what matters most: patients.” Credit Al Drago for The New York TimesThe Trump administration is scaling back the use of fines against nursing homes that harm residents or place them in grave risk of injury, part of a broader relaxation of regulations under the president.The shift in the Medicare program’s penalty protocols was requested by the nursing home industry. The American Health Care Association, the industry’s main trade group, has complained that under President Barack Obama, federal inspectors focused excessively on catching wrongdoing rather than helping nursing homes improve.“It is critical that we have relief,” Mark Parkinson, the group’s president, wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump in December 2016.Since 2013, nearly 6,500 nursing homes — four of every 10 — have been cited at least once for a serious violation, federal records show. Medicare has fined two-thirds of those homes. Common citations include failing to protect residents from avoidable accidents, neglect, mistreatment and bedsores.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe change in policy aligns with Mr. Trump’s promise to reduce bureaucracy, regulation and government intervention in business.Dr. Kate Goodrich, director of clinical standards and quality at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in a statement that unnecessary regulation was the main concern that health care providers raised with officials.“Rather than spending quality time with their patients, the providers are spending time complying with regulations that get in the way of caring for their patients and doesn’t increase the quality of care they provide,” Dr. Goodrich said.But advocates for nursing-home residents say the revised penalties are weakening a valuable patient-safety tool.“They’ve pretty much emasculated enforcement, which was already weak,” said Toby Edelman, a senior attorney at the Center for Medicare Advocacy.Medicare has different ways of applying penalties. It can impose a specific fine for a particular violation. It can assess a fine for each day that a nursing home was in violation. Or it can deny payments for new admissions.The average fine in recent years has been $33,453, but 531 nursing homes amassed combined federal fines above $100,000, records show. In 2016, Congress increased the fines to factor in several years of inflation that had not been accounted for previously.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe new rules have been instituted gradually throughout the year.In October, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services discouraged its regional offices from levying fines, even in the most serious health violations, if the error was a “one-time mistake.” The centers said that intentional disregard for residents’ health and safety or systemic errors should still merit fines.A July memo from the centers discouraged the directors of state agencies that survey nursing homes from issuing daily fines for violations that began before an inspection, favoring one-time fines instead. Daily fines remain the recommended approach for major violations discovered during an inspection.Newsletter Sign UpPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Please try again later.You are already subscribed to this email.Opt out or contact us anytimeDavid Gifford, the American Health Care Association’s senior vice president for quality, said daily fines were intended to prompt quick remedies but were pointless when applied to past errors that had already been fixed by the time inspectors discovered them.“What was happening is you were seeing massive fines accumulating because they were applying them on a per-day basis retrospectively,” Mr. Gifford said.But the change means that some nursing homes could be sheltered from fines above the maximum per-instance fine of $20,965 even for egregious mistakes.In September 2016, for instance, health inspectors faulted Lincoln Manor, a nursing home in Decatur, Ill., for failing to monitor and treat the wound of a patient whose implanted pain-medication pump gradually slipped over eight days through a ruptured suture and protruded from her abdomen. The patient died.The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services fined Lincoln Manor $282,954, including $10,091 a day for 28 days, from the time the nursing home noticed the problem with the wound until supervisors had retrained nurses to avoid similar errors. An administrative law judge called the penalties “quite modest” given the “appalling” care.The fines were issued before the new guidelines took effect; if the agency had issued a one-time fine, the maximum would have been less than $21,000.Lincoln Manor closed in September. Its owner could not be reached for comment, and his lawyer did not respond to an interview request.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAdvocates for nursing home residents say that relaxing penalties threatens to undo progress at deterring wrongdoing. Janet Wells, a consultant for California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform, said the changes come as “some egregious violations and injuries to residents are being penalized — finally — at a level that gets the industry’s attention and isn’t just the cost of doing business.”In November, the Trump administration exempted nursing homes that violate eight new safety rules from penalties for 18 months. Homes must still follow the rules, which are intended, among other things, to reduce the overuse of psychotropic drugs and to ensure that every home has adequate resources to assist residents with major psychological problems.In June , the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services rescinded another Obama administration action that banned nursing homes from pre-emptively requiring residents to submit to arbitration to settle disputes rather than going to court.“We publish nearly 11,000 pages of regulation every year,” the agency’s administrator, Seema Verma, said in a speech in October. That paperwork is “taking doctors away from what matters most: patients.”Janine Finck-Boyle, director of health regulations and policy at LeadingAge, a group of nonprofit nursing homes and other entities that care for older people, said the group’s members had been struggling to cope with regulations.“If you’re a 50-bed rural facility out West or in the Dakotas,” she said, “you don’t have the resources to get everything done from A to Z.”Jordan Rau is a senior correspondent for Kaiser Health News , a nonprofit news service covering health issues that is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation and not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.A version of this article appears in print on December 25, 2017, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Nursing Home Industry Wins As Penalties Are Relaxed.

While there was no confirmation, it was being tossed around that it was Barack looking to dump Michelle. This morning, a filing in the District Court of Cook County, Illinois confirmed that the couple is seeking divorce and that Barack is, in fact, the plaintiff.According to county docket D4610968L86, Barack Hussein Obama seeks dissolution of marriage from Michelle Obama on grounds of infidelity and irreconcilable differences. The infidelity, according to the Obama’s longtime housekeeper, Analita Consuelo Gonsales, isn’t recent but rather the revelation through a recent DNA test that Obama isn’t the biological father of Sasha or Malia.Gonsales said that it wasn’t really a surprise, because during an argument in 2003 Barack admitted to Michelle that he had faked all of his orgasms. Michelle, in turn, admitted that she had an affair with a biolab and that the children were actually the product of advanced genetic engineering. Apparently, Malia is secretly one of the most talented dulcimer musicians in the world and Sasha’s IQ is so high she’s a single lab accident away from being a supervillain and taking over the world.Obama, who suddenly feels like an outcast in a family of such amazing people, will step aside and even back Michelle’s 2020 run for president, but he will not agree to paying any form of support for Sasha, who is still a minor, mostly because she makes more money playing Texas Hold ’em in a month than he makes in a year.It’s lucky for us that we don’t have to have this kind of craziness in our White House anymore. Having a great, stable family like the Trumps is doing wonders for America.Join The Resistance And Share This Article Now!4.3k

While the concept of a child marrying an older man is creepy, isn’t it strange that these same people have nothing to say about Christian child marriages in the United States?On Friday, the New York Times published the heartbreaking story of Sherry Johnson.Subscribe to our Youtube ChannelJohnson was raped by a 20-year-old member of her church and became pregnant in Florida and learned very quickly that Christianity can be very cruel to its adherents.“It was forced on me,” she told the Times. See, authorities had begun sniffing around because she was pregnant with a 20-year-old’s child, so church official made the decision that the best way to avoid embarrassment was to marry her off to her rapist.Unfortunately, her parents were just devout enough to go along with this horrible plan:My mom asked me if I wanted to get married, and I said, ‘I don’t know, what is marriage, how do I act like a wife?’” Johnson remembers today, many years later. “She said, ‘Well, I guess you’re just going to get married.’”So she was. A government clerk in Tampa, Fla., refused to marry an 11-year-old, even though this was legal in the state, so the wedding party went to nearby Pinellas County, where the clerk issued a marriage license. The license (which I’ve examined) lists her birth date, so officials were aware of her age.Johnson was raped by both a minister and a parishioner, and the judge approved the marriage to the rapist who caused her to give birth at the age of 10 so that the investigation would end.“What we want is for you to get married,” the judge told her.“It was a terrible life,” Johnson says, noting that she missed school and spent her time changing diapers for what would eventually be nine children. Her husband would occasionally disappear and leave her to deal with everything.“They took the handcuffs from handcuffing him,” she says. How can this happen? Because it’s perfectly legal. In most states, it is perfectly legal for a man to marry a child. While some have at least passed laws limiting the age to 16 or 17 and above, most have no limit whatsoever.But Republicans are oddly resistant to progress. New Jersey lawmakers overwhelmingly passed a bill that would raise the age to 18, for instance. the bill made it to Gov. Chris Christie’s desk, but he vetoed it in the name of “religious freedom.”Child marriage, which the United States condemned in other countries as a “human rights abuse that contributes to economic hardship” in a State Department document last year, is a practice that must end.Featured image via The IndependentRelatedApparently the standard punishment is 'too harsh,' even though this man's actions are depraved beyond words.04/20/2017

The left isn’t that happy about the way he introduced the campaign, and told everyone that he dreams of big and safe America. Hillary’s supporters and the media came up with everything they could ever think of in order to get Trump out of the game. Not so fast, people! Your audio doesn’t mean a thing.Even Graham told everyone how he sees things, and that brought joy to everyone who cares about this country. Unlike people who hate Trump, he said a few good words that surprised us all. In a good way, of course. In your face, haters!Via Patriot JournalThey are epitome of hypocrisy. Most of the people decrying Trump give a pass to Bill Clinton, when as president he committed adultery with an intern. They continue to give a pass to Hillary, who protects her husband despite allegations of rape.And they ignore serious crimes Hillary committed when secretary of state.On the other hand, conservatives, who believe in such virtues as forgiveness, have been willing to look passed Trump’s remarks. We have enough common sense and decency to know everyone messes up, now and again, and needs our understanding and forgiveness.From Conservative Tribune:While the media couldn’t understand why, Rev. Franklin Graham did. He wrote a stirring Facebook post that moved Trump so much that he re-posted it on his Facebook account.“A lot of people are slamming evangelicals for supposedly giving Donald J. Trump a pass,” Graham began. “That’s simply not true. No one is giving him a pass. I’m certainly not, and I’ve not met an evangelical yet who condones his language or inexcusable behavior from over a decade ago.“However, he has apologized to his wife, his family, and to the American people for this. He has taken full responsibility. This election isn’t about Donald Trump’s behavior from 11 years ago or Hillary Clinton’s recent missing emails, lies, and false statements,” Graham continued.“This election is about the Supreme Court and the justices that the next president will nominate. Evangelicals are going to have to decide which candidate they trust to nominate men and women to the court who will defend the constitution and support religious freedoms.“My prayer is that Christians will not be deceived by the liberal media about what is at stake for future generations,” Graham added.The left don’t understand this, because they are mostly secular humanists. They are unable to appreciate such a powerful virtue as forgiveness, because they don’t believe in a God who can forgive our every trespass.They are under the delusion that you must be perfect or else. Either you live up to their warped standards or they’ll throw you under the bus. That’s what happened to Alec Baldwin a few years ago, when TMZ accused him of a homophobic remark. All his liberal buddies were quick to disown him, despite any real evidence.The left will never be able to understand, because they refuse to. They simply have their own agenda to protect, at all costs, and cannot conceive the ability to grow or change.Pro-Hillary Americans can’t understand that Trump is what this country needs. They are aware of his potential, but still refuse to admit it. Well, we know that, and we support Trump. Nobody cares about your opinion, Dems!What do you think about this?

Mary Lou Marzian, a Democrat from Louisville, proposed House Bill 369 in Feb. 2016 as a pointed statement to anti-abortion advocates, according to CBS News.The bill would have also required a man be married and make a sworn statement with his hand on a Bible that he will only use a prescription for a drug for erectile dysfunction when having sexual relations with his current spouse.My point is to illustrate how intrusive and ridiculous it is for elected officials to be inserting themselves into private and personal medical decisions, Marzian told Reuters.The proposal came days after Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican, signed an informed consent law requiring women to receive counsel from a doctor 24 hours before having an abortion.Marzian told the Louisville Courier-Journal that the bill was a form of protest against the intervention into womens health by a predominantly male General Assembly.'

https://www.snopes.com/trump-order-popular-vote-winner/	Did President Trump Sign an Executive Order Naming Himself the Popular Vote Winner?	false	['donald trump', ' political garbage chute', ' politicalgarbagechute.com', ' satire', ' voter fraud']	https://www.nytimes.com/	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/politics/trump-voting-fraud-false-claim-investigation.html?_r=0	2017/02/02	“All available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake,” Mr. Trump’s lawyers wrote in their response to recount petitions by Jill Stein, the Green Party presidential candidate. Mr. Spicer said the lawyers were referring only to states where Mr. Trump campaigned extensively. In Ohio, Secretary of State Jon A. Husted, a Republican, said Wednesday in an interview that there was “no evidence” that voter fraud was happening on a large scale. Edgardo Cortés, Virginia’s election chief, a Democrat, said there was “no basis” for the claims. And California’s Democratic secretary of state lashed out at the president for undermining confidence in the election system. “Free and fair elections are the bedrock of our democracy, and he’s taken a jackhammer to it with his irresponsible tweets,” said Alex Padilla, the state’s top election official. “Whatever proof or evidence he said he had, he clearly didn’t have.

An error has occurred. Please try again later. You are already subscribed to this email. Mr. Trump has repeatedly shifted his view of the election system. As a candidate, he frequently railed against what he called a “rigged” election. When he became president-elect, he complained about “serious voter fraud,” but later reversed himself and mocked Ms. Stein’s recount efforts as “a scam” and a waste of time and money. This week, he flip-flopped again, telling lawmakers at a White House reception that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote because millions of immigrants in the country illegally voted for her. Mr. Spicer declined to elaborate on what Mr. Trump meant but did not back away from the assertion. “The president does believe that,” Mr. Spicer said. “It’s a belief that he’s maintained for a while, a concern that he has about voter fraud. It remains unclear what form a federal investigation may take. While the F.B.I. has the authority to look into voter fraud, that appears not to be what the president has in mind. Mr. Spicer said it was too early to know, but mentioned the possibility of a task force or commission. He cited studies that he said showed that voter rolls contained the names of millions of people who should not be there because they had moved, were not citizens or had since died. But the author of one of those major studies said Wednesday that Mr. Spicer and the president appeared to be misunderstanding the numbers. David Becker, who for six years was in charge of the election initiative for the Pew Center on the States, said that voter rolls often had out-of-date information, but that there was virtually no evidence that many of those names were used to vote illegally. “It does exist, but it happens in very, very small numbers and nothing like what is claimed by the president,” Mr. Becker said. He said systems across the country to prevent voter fraud would have caught any huge effort to vote illegally. “We would have seen that well before the election,” he said. In Ohio, for example, a review of the state’s elections in 2012 and 2014 found that out of millions of votes cast, there were 667 allegations of fraud, of which just 149 were referred to law enforcement for investigation, Mr. Husted said. The Ohio review, which happens after every election, also found that 436 unauthorized immigrants were registered to vote and that 44 had voted. “Voter fraud exists. It’s not widespread or systemic,” said Mr. Husted, who said he had voted for Mr. Trump. Mr. Husted said he would be happy to share Ohio’s review of the 2016 election with the federal government when it was completed. And he said Mr. Trump could aid states by sharing government databases that could help them clean their voter rolls. In his Twitter message Wednesday, Mr. Trump suggested that a federal review could lead to improvements in voting procedures. But Democrats and voting experts criticized the president for focusing his allegations on voter fraud while resisting the intelligence community’s conclusions involving Russian hacking of the Democratic National Commitee and officials connected to Mrs. Clinton during last year’s election. “It’s more important that we investigate the known instances of election fraud, rather than imagined ones,” said Kim Alexander, the president of the California Voter Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to improving the voting process. “We have had an election that was compromised by foreign interests. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said the president should “knock this off” and move on. “This is going to erode his ability to govern this country if he does not stop it,” he said on CNN. And several Democratic lawmakers and state election officials said they suspected that Mr. Trump’s allegations were part of a plan by Republicans looking for reasons to justify new restrictions on voting to benefit their party, particularly targeting immigrants and African-Americans. “There has been a sustained effort across the country, rooted in similar conspiracies about voter fraud, to make it harder for Americans to vote,” Senator Dianne Feinstein of California said in a statement. Mr. Padilla, the California secretary of state, said he also worried that Mr. Trump’s repeated allegations about fraud would undermine the confidence that Americans had in the integrity of the voting system. “Stoking fear and concern is undermining people’s faith in our elections,” he said.

https://www.snopes.com/pacu-testicle-biting-fish/	Pacu of Lies — On the Trail of the Testicle-Biting Fish	mfalse	['lethal lurkers', ' pacu', ' piranha']	http://www.seriouslyfish.com/	http://www.seriouslyfish.com/species/piaractus-brachypomus/	2016/08/15	Characidae. Subfamily: SerrasalminaeDistributionNative to the Rio Orinoco and Amazon basins in Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil. Introduced populations are thriving in various parts of the world, mainly in Far Eastern countries such as China and Taiwan where it’s farmed for eating.HabitatInhabits main river channels and flood plains, moving into flooded forests during the rainy season. It tends to prefer shallow, slow-moving areas with overhanging or floating vegetation. Juveniles spend the first few months of life in the flood plains, where food is plentiful and predation is less of a danger.Maximum Standard LengthThe biggest wild fish recorded measured 35.2″ (88cm). Captive specimens tend to be a bit smaller than this, but expect it to reach at least 24″ (60cm).Aquarium Size Top ↑Sadly adults are all too often seen living in cramped conditions. If you want to house one of these for life you’re going to need an enormous tank measuring at least 120″ x 36″ x 36 (300cm x 90cm x 90cm) – 2550 litres, preferably larger. Youngsters can be grown on in smaller tanks but will grow quickly when well-fed.MaintenanceThe size of the tank and filtration used are much more important than the choice of decor. Strictly speaking, decor isn’t necessary for a tank containing an adult as it’s a very active species . At any rate try not to clutter up the tank space too much. There’s also little point adding plants as they’ll be eaten immediately. Opt for a few water-worn boulders and perhaps some large chunks of driftwood or beech branches. Ensure that any such furnishings are too heavy to be moved around or secured to the tank in some way.A large and efficient biological filter is needed to cope with the amounts of waste produced by a fish of this size. If possible choose a sump – type arrangement, as this allows most of the equipment to be located outside the tank . A large specimen can easily destroy glass heaterstats, thermometers etc. as it charges around. Otherwise, buy the biggest filter you can afford (pond filters are worth considering) and perform regular large water changes.Water ConditionsTemperature: 73 to 82°F (23 to 28°C)pH: It's an adaptable species provided extremes are avoided. Somewhere within the range 4.8 to 7.5 is ok.Hardness: 0 to 15°HDietStomach analyses of wild specimens show it to be primarily a herbivorous species , feeding on fruits, nuts and seeds. It is an opportunist, though, and also takes insects, zooplankton and small fish. In the aquarium offer it a varied diet consisting of quality dried pellets or floating sticks, along with plenty of fruit and vegetables. Spinach, lettuce leaves, and fruit and vegetables such as apple, banana, peach, grapes, courgette, peas, cabbage and carrot all work well.Behaviour and Compatibility Top ↑Small fish will likely be eaten but in general it’s quite peaceful with bigger species . It can bother sedentary or shy companions with its constant activity, though. Obviously a truly enormous tank is needed to incorporate it into a community . If this kind of space is available suitable tankmates include Arowana, other similarly-sized characins, big cichlids, and large catfish from the Pimelodid, Doradid and Loricariid groups.It’s a shoaling species when juvenile , becoming more solitary as it matures. It can be kept in a group in the aquarium , but again, this is largely dependant on the amount of space available. In smaller quarters adults can become a bit of a nuisance, chasing and nipping the fins of both its own kind and other species .Sexual DimorphismMature females are a little rounder-bellied than males.ReproductionNot achieved in the hobby, although it’s being bred in some numbers for food in both South America and various Far Eastern countries. The fish are often induced to spawn via the use of hormones.Notes Top ↑Know as the pirapitinga in its native countries, this is the one of the largest species of scaled fish found in the Amazon basin . This alone should tell you much of what you need to know about its suitability as an aquarium inhabitant. In reality it’s debatable as to whether the species should be considered an aquarium subject at all. While pacu rarely reach their maximum size in captivity, they’re still easily capable of growing to a couple of feet in length. The myth that fish will only grow to match the size of the tank they’re kept in is just that – a myth.Unfortunately it’s regularly offered for sale as a cute 2-3″ fish, often labeled with enticing names such as “vegetarian piranha” or even “red-bellied piranha” (pacu are included in the same subfamily as piranha and resemble them superficially). Juveniles of P. brachypomus are in fact patterned to mimic the real red-bellied piranha, Pygocentrus nattereri as a deterrent to potential predators.As a result many public aquaria have large displays of adult specimens that have been “donated” by fishkeepers, often to the extent where they refuse to accept any more. A more depressing, but equally common scenario is that the fish are dumped into rivers and ponds when they outgrow their tank . In colder climates they will obviously not survive, but populations exist in various states of the USA and several other countries as a result of releases by irresponsible aquarists. The species has subsequently been banned from sale by many wildlife authorities in the US.Pacu have developed amazing dentition to allow them to crush fruit, nuts and seeds. Their teeth are cusped and resemble human molars, and they also have very powerful jaws. Although they are rarely aggressive they can inflict a really nasty bite, so take care when performing tank maintenance.The species is widely used in aquaculture projects in South America. It’s ideally suited for the purpose, being tolerant of a wide range of water chemistry and possessing the ability to survive in oxygen-depleted conditions. Much research is being undertaken to find the most ecologically sound way of farming it, as it’s suffering from gross overfishing in many of its native waters. If wild stocks become further depleted, there could be serious implications not only for the species itself, but also entire ecosystems. The seeds of many of the fruits eaten by pacu are indigestible, and are excreted intact. Some experts believe the fish play a significant role in seed dispersal of plants from areas of flooded forest. Sustainable commercial farming of pacu is therefore considered a priority. Not only will this prevent further depletion of wild stocks, but it will provide an alternative source of income for farmers. The hope is that it may also encourage them to take up aquaculture instead of agriculture, which is having a devastating effect on many parts of the Amazon rainforest.As a food fish pacu is apparently very tasty. Its natural diet of fruit and nuts is said to enhance the flavour of the flesh. As the fish is so large cuts are often sold on the bone in a similar way to pork ribs. One further commercial use of the species is as a sport fish , both in its natural environment and artificially-stocked lakes. It’s been introduced into several Far Eastern countries for this purpose, including Thailand and Malaysia.No Responses to “Piaractus brachypomus (Red-bellied Pacu)”Leave a Reply

Will it be pre-empted by action of the DEA? June 28, 2016""Hey guys, soon we won't be raiding pot clinics!""Drug Enforcement Agents from the DEA conducting a raid in Los Angeles. The Federal Government will make Marijuana a Schedule Two drug on August 1, 2016, effectively legalizing weed throughout the US.The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration will reclassify marijuana as a ""Schedule Two"" drug on August 1, 2016, essentially legalizing medicinal cannabis in all 50 states with a doctor's prescription, said a DEA lawyer with knowledge of the matter.Update 6/28: The Recreational Marijuana Initiative qualifies for the California's November Ballot. Will it be pre-empted by action of the DEA?http://www.smobserved.com/story/2016/07/04/news/dea-source-confirms-schedule-ii-medical-marijuana-is-in-the-works/1562.htmlThe DEA Lawyer had told the lawyer representing a DEA informant of the DEA's plan to legalize medicinal cannibis nationwide on August 1, 2016. When questioned by our reporter, the DEA lawyer felt compelled to admit the truth to him as well.""Whatever the law may be in California, Arizona or Utah or any other State, because of Federal preemption this will have the effect of making THC products legal with a prescription, in all 50 states,"" the DEA attorney told the Observer. Federal Preemption is a legal doctrine that where the US Government regulates a particular field, State and local laws are overridden and of no effect.He explained that ""there are five DEA schedules. Nothing on Schedule One is ever legal, and that is where Cannabis is today. Schedule Two drugs are available with a prescription.""On Schedule Two, marijuana will join drugs like Percocet, Aderall, Oxycontin, Hydrocodone and other drugs that are legal, even common, with a prescription. There are also other drugs that are not on any schedules but that are illegal on a federal level, he said. Drugs like aspirin and ibuprofen are available over-the-counter.He opined that the 135 medicinal cannabis clinic owners in Los Angeles will no doubt oppose this move by the Federal government, because the rule change will eliminate any reason for people to visit medical marijuana clinics. But they needn't worry. ""In my opinion, CVS pharmacy, Rite-Aid and Walgreens will sell Schedule Two THC products similar to what users call ""edibles,"" but will not sell smokable weed because of the health risk smoking anything entails,"" said the DEA lawyer.The Los Angeles based DEA Attorney who spoke to us, asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to the press about the matter. He speculated that this action will be taken in the closing days of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, so as to motivate the Democratic base to turn out and vote for Hillary Clinton, and other down ballot candidates. She will certainly not reverse this policy decision taken in the waning days of the Barack Obama administration, he said. But Donald Trump might.""Marijuana enforcement is a big drain on DEA resources,"" he said was another reason for the change, noting that 75% of the American public favor the legalization of marijuana for medical use.Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson is in favor of legalizing marijuana and in fact owns a business which peddles pot in New Mexico.California will vote on November 7th, 2016, whether to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. Because of Federal preemption, the DEA's reclassification of cannabis as a Schedule Two drug, will have the legal effect of requiring a prescription in California--i.e., it will continue the status quo.Since the Golden State legalized medical marijuana almost 20 years ago, Federal authorities have occasionally raided medical marijuana clinics here. They have forced major banks, like Bank of America, to close clinic bank accounts. The Feds have even seized real estate belonging to landlords who rent space to pot clinics. The Federal war on medicinal marijuana will abruptly end on August 1, 2016.UPDATE 6/19 9 a.m. PDT: The Denver Post is now reporting that the DEA could reclassify Marijuana as a Schedule II drug, as early as July 1, 2016. https://www.denverpost.com/2016/06/17/how-the-dea-should-classify-marijuana/UPDATE 6/22: The DEA wants to remove the barriers to cannabis research, a spokesman told aNewDomain in a lengthy interview. http://anewdomain.net/2016/06/21/on-cannabis-rescheduling-questions-the-dea-responds-exclusive/8/01 is the new 4/20!Medical cannabis, or medical marijuana, can refer to the use of cannabis and its cannabinoids to treat disease or improve symptoms; However, there is no single agreed upon definition, says Wikipedia. The use of cannabis as a medicine has not been rigorously scientifically tested, often due to production restrictions and other governmental regulations. There is limited evidence suggesting cannabis can be used to reduce nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy, to improve appetite in people with HIV/AIDS, and to treat chronic pain and muscle spasms. Its use for other medical applications, however, is insufficient for conclusions about safety or effects.In California, there are ""weed doctors"" who will write a prescription for cannabis to anyone claiming to suffer from anxiety, which means they passout prescriptions for pot like chocolate bars at a Halloween party. As with so many other trends that started in California, expect to see medicinal marijuana sold in your town soon!Medical cannabis can be administered using a variety of methods, including liquid tinctures, vaporizing or smoking dried buds, eating cannabis edibles, taking capsules, using lozenges, dermal patches or oral/dermal sprays. Synthetic cannabinoids are available as prescription drugs in some countries; examples include: dronabinol and nabilone.Recreational use of cannabis is illegal in most parts of the world, but the medical use of cannabis is legal in certain countries, including Austria, Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands (where it is also legal recreationally), Portugal and Spain.In the United States, federal law outlaws all cannabis use, while 25 states and the District of Columbia no longer prosecute individuals for the possession or sale of medical marijuana, as long as the individuals are in compliance with the state's medical marijuana sale regulations.The DEA lawyer gave us his legal opinion that if you happen to live where recreational marijuana is now legal, i.e. Colorado or Washington State; after August 1, you will need a prescription, as you would need throughout the U.S.However, an appeals court ruled in January 2014 that a 2007 Ninth Circuit ruling remains binding in relation to the ongoing illegality, in federal legislative terms, of Californian cannabis dispensaries, reaffirming the impact of the federal Controlled Substances Act.The Federal Government will make Marijuana a Schedule Two drug on August 1, 2016, effectively legalizing weed throughout the US. You may be able to buy pot at Rite Aid in Santa Monica by the end of the year.As explained above, moving marijuana from Schedule One to Schedule Two, would have the effect of legalizing medicinal marijuana, throughout all 50 States, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories. This action may be taken by the DEA unilaterally--i.e., without specific Congressional authorization -- because Congress has previously granted the DEA rule-making authority over what drugs are on which schedules.The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is a United States federal law enforcement agency under the U.S. Department of Justice, tasked with combating drug smuggling and use within the United States. Not only is the DEA the lead agency for domestic enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act, sharing concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), it also has sole responsibility for coordinating and pursuing U.S. drug investigations abroad.Update: DEA Source Confirms Story, 7/04/2016. http://www.smobserved.com/story/2016/07/04/news/dea-source-confirms-that-schedule-ii-marijuana-is-in-the-works/1562.htmlYou might be interested in:"

This is certain.Read our great constitution.In it, it states:— That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. —We can overturn the status quo, and create a country that offers hope rather than hate.
https://www.snopes.com/joakim-noah-west-point/	Joakim Noah Gives U.S. Soldiers the Finger, Refuses to Eat With Them?	mixture	['joakim noah', ' military', ' new york knicks', ' west point']	https://archive.is/	https://archive.is/ZWPs1	2017/05/09	NY NBA Star Gives US Soldiers The FINGER, Refuses To Eat With Them While Training At Military Camp1.2KSharesxSponsored by RevcontentWhat kind of asshat does this? Joakim Noah was training at West Point and then refused to eat with the rest of the New York Knicks with the cadets because he’s anti-war. Really? That’s about as rude as it gets. Those cadets are not the ones instigating war and if war comes, they will willingly serve to protect our country. You know, the one that makes it possible for this moron to earn $72 million over the next four years. What a jerk.I’m really getting sick to death of all these athletes taking their supposed political stances against the heroes of our country. These teams could step in and put a stop to this. Noah had the full support of his coach when he pulled this stunt. All of them are going to wind up getting boycotted and it serves them right. Saying that he “absolutely” understood Noah’s point of view, Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek explained:“Jo’s done, in all his stuff that he does against gun violence and all that, he just didn’t feel comfortable, so that’s plenty fine with us.”Do tell. Well, then the Knicks shouldn’t mind if their fans and the rest of America take a hike and take their money with them.From the New York Daily News:Joakim Noah violated one of the basic rules of guest etiquette this week by boycotting a team dinner with West Point cadets that featured a speech from a retired Army Colonel.As we all know, it’s never polite to insult your host.Noah is anti-war, which is great. Most right minded adults oppose war and that would include the young men and women at the U.S. Military Academy. You can still be a conscientious objector while earning $72 million over the next four years and still spend quality time with the people who are dedicated to serving and protecting the country.This could not have gone over well at the NBA league office where almost one year ago to the day Adam Silver announced that Gen. Martin Dempsey, the recently retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was appointed as a special adviser to the NBA Commissioner.For the last several years, Knicks players — who hold their training camp at West Point — have traditionally dined with cadets, listening to speeches from military officers and signing autographs. If you are in someone’s house, you honor them. Someone might want to tell this Noah idiot that.It figures this guy is a big fan of Barack Obama. Why am I not surprised? Noah’s stance has not prevented him from spending time with President Obama. In 2011, during Obama’s re-election campaign, Noah even joined several of his fellow NBA players at a fundraiser for the incumbent president. So, he’s a Marxist as well as anti-war. He’s the whole liberal package.Noah also applauded his fellow athletes who “are taking a stand,” saying that “this country’s out of control” and “there are things that need to be fixed.” Here’s a thought… if he can’t honor those at West Point, he should take his sorry ass and leave. He won’t be missed and at least one thing will be ‘fixed’.Sponsored by RevcontentTrending Today

In The NetherlandsDEA / L. ROMANO / Contributor / Getty ImagesJanuary 15, 2018    viewsThe mainstream media in the Netherlands reported last week that ""Noah"" was the most popular baby name for boys in the small European nation.""Noah and Emma were the most popular children's names in the past year,"" reported Nos.nl. ""This is evident from the annual list of names of the Social Insurance Bank, which pays out the child benefit. Boys were named Noah 635 times, while 755 girls went through life as Emma since last year."" The year before, ""Daan"" and ""Anna"" were the most popular names, the site said.But a journalist at Powned.tv did a little research on the report and found something completely different. Checking for ""Mohammed"" — and all its alternative spellings — the writer found that 636 babies had been given that name last year.""Mohammed (221 times) and all possible conjugations like Mohamed (211 times), Muhammed (110 times), Mohammad (51 times), Muhammad (43 times), Mohamad (unknown), Muhamed (unknown), Muhammet (not known), Mouhamed (not known), Muhamad (not known), Mahamuud (not known),"" wrote the reporter.The 636 variants of the name put it one ahead of ""Noah."" That makes ""Mohammed"" and its alternate spellings the most popular name in the Netherlands for the second straight year. In 2016, ""724 boys received the name (or one of the conjugations) from their parents,"" the site reported.And then there was this:""By the way, how do you think about the statistics in Great Britain and Wales? The British claim that Oliver is the name given most to newborn boys . In reality, this is ... Right, Mohammed or one of his conjugations,"" the reporter wrote, citing this article .The UK’s national statistics office recently released the latest data on baby names in England and Wales. It says the following: “Oliver remains as the most popular first name given to baby boys in England and Wales in 2016.” But that’s not really true. In fact, the most common name by far is Muhammad.So apparently you can't trust the mainstream media in the Netherlands, either.By Amanda PrestigiacomoWhat's Your Reaction?This page is forcing your browser to use legacy mode, which is not compatible with Disqus.

You may opt out at anytime. You also agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .The state’s health education glossary  defines gender as “A social construct based on emotional, behavioral, and cultural characteristics attached to a person’s assigned biological sex.” Gender expression, meanwhile, is defined as “The way someone outwardly expresses their gender.”These definitions differ from the state’s definition of “biological sex”: “Based on chromosomes, hormones, and internal and external anatomy.”Nathan Olson, a communications manager for the statewide Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI), told The Daily Caller that the glossary “was developed to support classroom instruction.” The new standards were finalized in March but OSPI has yet to issue a press release  informing the public of the changes.As part of an aspect of sexual health titled “Healthy Relationships,” kindergarteners will learn to distinguish between “safe and unwanted touch.” They will also learn to “Recognize people have the right to refuse giving or receiving unwanted touch.” OSPI did not answer a question from TheDC about whether this lesson plan amounts to teaching consent to kindergarteners.By third grade, students will be expected to “Explain that gender roles can vary considerably” and “Understand [the] importance of treating others with respect regarding gender identity,” as part of the “Self-Identity” component of sexual health.Gender identity is defined by the state as “Someone’s inner sense of their gender.”“The standards don’t define ‘gender spectrum.’ But self-identity is a key component,” Olson said when TheDC asked whether learning that gender is a “spectrum” is considered part of learning about “gender identity.” Last month, Fox News’ Todd Starnes described a Virginia county’s lesson plans on gender spectrum as “the idea that there’s no such thing as 100 percent boys or 100 percent girls.”That lesson plan– which was met with outrage from parents –was designed for middle and high school students.By fourth grade, Washington students will learn to “Identify how friends and family can influence ideas regarding gender roles, identity, and expression” and define sexual orientation. The state defines “gender roles” as “Social expectations about how people should act, think, or feel based on their assigned biological sex.”In fifth grade, students will learn to “Describe how media, society, and culture can influence ideas regarding gender roles, identity, and expression.” Under the guidance of school employees, fifth graders will also “Identify trusted adults to ask questions about gender identity and sexual orientation.” It’s not clear if parents are automatically considered “trusted adults.”By the end of elementary school (typically around age 11 or 12), students will be expected to “Understand the range of gender roles, identity, and expression across cultures.”In seventh grade, students will learn to “Distinguish between biological sex, gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation.” By eighth grade, students will be expected to “Recognize external influences that shape attitudes about gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation.”This education continues through high school where students will “Evaluate how culture, media, society, and other people influence our perceptions of gender roles, sexuality, relationships, and sexual orientation.”OSPI denied that the state intends to force a set of beliefs upon its students.“Standards help students become familiar with concepts that education experts feel are essential for all students to know,” Olson said. “Standards are not used to impose belief systems.”In response to a question from TheDC about whether a student who rejects the idea that “gender identity” is distinct from “biological sex” could end up failing a course on account of their beliefs, Olson said: “That would be handled at the district/school level.”He later admitted that “we don’t exactly know what a school would do if a student failed to complete an assignment because he/she opposed the materials being taught.”Olson said that the decision to implement specific “learning outcomes” lies with individual districts. Districts can craft their own curriculums, he said, as long as they “align with state learning standards.”The full health and fitness standards can be read here .Follow Peter Hasson on Twitter @PeterJHasson

The bill would require the committee to report to the Legislature on its activities at the close of each legislative session. The bill would require the committee, by November 30, 2020, to develop a plan to implement the framework by January 1, 2024, and to identify and propose comprehensive tax reform solutions to increase revenue predictability and ensure sufficiency of revenues adequate to support the implementation of the framework, as specified.This bill would make the provisions relating to the committee inoperative on November 30, 2024, and would repeal them as of January 1, 2025.Digest KeyVote: MAJORITY   Appropriation: NO   Fiscal Committee: NO   Local Program: NO  Bill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. Chapter 12.88 (commencing with Section 18987.80) is added to Part 6 of Division 9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, to read:CHAPTER         12.88. Committee on Children and Youth18987.80. The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:(a) California has the sixth largest economy in the world and leads the country in innovation and diversity, and yet California’s children rank 47th in terms of their economic well-being.(b) Accessible child care, early learning, quality educational and job training opportunities, comprehensive health care, and well-supported families are necessary to ensure the productive potential of all Californians, yet there has been no comprehensive effort to ensure that California’s children and youth have access to those necessities and opportunities.(c) California’s tax structure         was designed during the Great Depression and is outdated, unfair, and unreliable, with newer economic sectors escaping tax obligations.(d) According to the Legislative Analyst’s Office, the total value of taxable sales has grown more slowly than the economy, necessitating higher sales tax rates to generate comparable revenue.(e) The increasing volatility of the state’s economy, and the stock market, has translated into greater unpredictability of state tax revenue, presenting challenges for budget forecasts.(f) According to the California State Library, the Legislature considered 4,600 tax proposals in the past two decades, the vast majority of which were directed at a single tax or group of taxpayers rather than to achieve comprehensive reform, demonstrating that fiscal necessity, rather than overarching policy         considerations, has prompted most recent major tax changes.(g) It is necessary to increase revenue predictability and to ensure sufficiency of revenues adequate to meet the needs of California’s children and youth.18987.81. (a) The Joint Legislative Committee on Children and Youth is hereby created.(b) The committee shall be composed of a total of 18 members, as follows:(1) Nine Members of the Senate, appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules.(2) Nine Members of the Assembly, appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly.(c) The committee and its members shall have and exercise all of the rights, duties, and powers conferred upon investigating committees and their members by the Joint Rules of the Senate and the Assembly as they are adopted and amended from time to         time.(d) The committee is authorized to act only until November 30, 2024, and on that date the committee’s existence shall terminate.18987.82. (a) The Senate Committee on Rules may make money available from the Senate Operating Fund, as it deems necessary, for the expenses of the committee and its members.

""You guys are misunderstanding again. Thats not how it is.""However, after speaking to her daughters teacher, she realized the statement was accurate.The teacher said she cant. She has to say yes. She has to accept and I said, \'Excuse me, Richard tells Fox 13.Richard took her concerns to the school principal.He basically just said theyve had this dance set up this way for a long time and theyve never had any concern before, she said of his response.Lane Findlay with the Weber School District confirms its a rule, but he said its meant to teach students how to be inclusive.Please be respectful, be polite,"" Findlay said. ""We want to promote kindness, and so we want you to say yes when someone asks you to dance.""I do see it from their perspective when it comes to that, but there are many other ways to teach children how to be accepting than with a social dance, Richard counters.Richard says forcing students not to say no teaches them the wrong lesson.Sends a bad message to girls that girls have to say \'yes\'; sends a bad message to boys that girls cant say \'no,\'"" Richard said.Prior to the dance, which is voluntary, students are told to fill out a card by selecting five people they want to dance with. The administration says if theres someone on the card you feel uncomfortable with, the student is encouraged to speak up.If there is an issue, if theres students that are uncomfortable or have a problem with another student, I mean: thats certainly something that can be addressed with that student and parents, Findlay said.However, Richard says rejection is part of life and at the end of the day, this policy is sending impressionable children the wrong message.Psychologically, my daughter keeps coming to me and saying I cant say \'no\' to a boy,"" she said. ""Thats the message kids are getting.""One of the concerns that Richard addressed with the principal at Kanesville Elementary is that parents werent aware of this policy. She recommended he send out a permission slip, detailing the instructions given to students, and he agreed. As of now, the rule remains in place.41.208160-112.062004'"
https://www.snopes.com/harriet-tubman-gun-republican/	Harriet Tubman: Gun-Toting Republican	false	['harriet tubman', ' history']	http://www.pbs.org/	http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p1535.html	2016/04/22	"Resource Bank ContentsHarriet Tubman is perhaps the most well-known of all the Underground Railroad's ""conductors."" During a ten-year span she made 19 trips into the South and escorted over 300 slaves to freedom. And, as she once proudly pointed out to Frederick Douglass, in all of her journeys she ""never lost a single passenger.""Tubman was born a slave in Maryland's Dorchester County around 1820. At age five or six, she began to work as a house servant. Seven years later she was sent to work in the fields. While she was still in her early teens, she suffered an injury that would follow her for the rest of her life. Always ready to stand up for someone else, Tubman blocked a doorway to protect another field hand from an angry overseer. The overseer picked up and threw a two-pound weight at the field hand. It fell short, striking Tubman on the head. She never fully recovered from the blow, which subjected her to spells in which she would fall into a deep sleep.Around 1844 she married a free black named John Tubman and took his last name. (She was born Araminta Ross; she later changed her first name to Harriet, after her mother.) In 1849, in fear that she, along with the other slaves on the plantation, was to be sold, Tubman resolved to run away. She set out one night on foot. With some assistance from a friendly white woman, Tubman was on her way. She followed the North Star by night, making her way to Pennsylvania and soon after to Philadelphia, where she found work and saved her money. The following year she returned to Maryland and escorted her sister and her sister's two children to freedom. She made the dangerous trip back to the South soon after to rescue her brother and two other men. On her third return, she went after her husband, only to find he had taken another wife. Undeterred, she found other slaves seeking freedom and escorted them to the North.Tubman returned to the South again and again. She devised clever techniques that helped make her ""forays"" successful, including using the master's horse and buggy for the first leg of the journey; leaving on a Saturday night, since runaway notices couldn't be placed in newspapers until Monday morning; turning about and heading south if she encountered possible slave hunters; and carrying a drug to use on a baby if its crying might put the fugitives in danger. Tubman even carried a gun which she used to threaten the fugitives if they became too tired or decided to turn back, telling them, ""You'll be free or die.""By 1856, Tubman's capture would have brought a $40,000 reward from the South. On one occasion, she overheard some men reading her wanted poster, which stated that she was illiterate. She promptly pulled out a book and feigned reading it. The ploy was enough to fool the men.Tubman had made the perilous trip to slave country 19 times by 1860, including one especially challenging journey in which she rescued her 70-year-old parents. Of the famed heroine, who became known as ""Moses,"" Frederick Douglass said, ""Excepting John Brown -- of sacred memory -- I know of no one who has willingly encountered more perils and hardships to serve our enslaved people than [Harriet Tubman].""And John Brown, who conferred with ""General Tubman"" about his plans to raid Harpers Ferry, once said that she was ""one of the bravest persons on this continent.""Becoming friends with the leading abolitionists of the day, Tubman took part in antislavery meetings. On the way to such a meeting in Boston in 1860, in an incident in Troy, New York, she helped a fugitive slave who had been captured.During the Civil War Harriet Tubman worked for the Union as a cook, a nurse, and even a spy. After the war she settled in Auburn, New York, where she would spend the rest of her long life. She died in 1913.Image Credit: Moorland-Spingarn Research Center"
https://www.snopes.com/the-amish-dont-get-autism/	The Amish Don’t Get Autism?	false	['amish', ' anti-vaccine', ' autism', ' vaccines']	http://blogs.plos.org/	http://blogs.plos.org/thepanicvirus/2011/06/28/anecdotal-amish-dont-vaccinate-claims-disproved-by-fact-based-study/	2016/10/28	Posted June 28, 2011 by Seth Mnookin in Autism , Public health , VaccinesThe various vaccine manufactroversies that have spread in the wake of the Andrew Wakefield’s bogus claims that the measles component of the MMR vaccine might be linked to autism are too numerous to unpack in one brief blog post. One of the most persistent has been the Amish fallacy: Most Amish don’t vaccinate; there’s almost no record of autism in Amish communities; ergo, vaccines cause autism. (This argument has also been used, time and time and time again, to illustrate the efficacy of a proposed vaccinated-versus-unvaccinated study.)Not surprisingly, no part of the Amish fallacy — which has been kicking around for over a decade and gained new prominence and attention with this, purely anecdotal 2005 dispatch * — is true. Over the years, Ken Reibel at Autism News Beat has documented the problems with the Amish report , although the myth still persists.Yesterday, Reuters Health reported on a recent study in Pediatrics titled “ Underimmunization in Ohio’s Amish: Parental Fears Are a Greater Obstacle Than Access to Care .” The study found that majority of Amish parents do, in fact, vaccinate their children…and among the minority that don’t, the most common reasons cited were the same anti-vaccine fueled fears that have infected people around the country.Unlike the theories propagated by anti-vaccine activists, this study was definitely not anecdotal: It was based on surveys sent to hundreds of families in Holmes County, which has a large number of Amish families. As Reuters reports, “Of 359 households that responded to the survey, 85 percent said that at  least some of their children had received at least one vaccine. Forty-nine families refused all vaccines for their children, mostly  because they worried the vaccines could cause harm and were not worth  the risk.”The study’s conclusions summarize the issue quite succinctly:The reasons that Amish parents resist  immunizations mirror reasons that non-Amish parents resist  immunizations. Even in America’s                         closed religious communities, the major barrier  to vaccination is concern over adverse effects of vaccinations. If 85%  of                         Amish parents surveyed accept some  immunizations, they are a dynamic group that may be influenced to accept  preventative care.                         Underimmunization in the Amish population must  be approached with emphasis on changing parental perceptions of vaccines  in                         addition to ensuring access to vaccines.It’ll be interesting to see how this plays out in the days to come…and what objections will be raised to invalidate this latest piece of evidence.* Correction: In the first iteration of this post, I attributed the Amish-don’t-vaccinate myth to the 2005 UPI dispatch linked to above; as was pointed out in the comments, it has been kicking around since at least 2000.Post navigation

https://www.snopes.com/photographs-show-dozens-dead-dogs-kuwait/	Bomb-Sniffing Dogs Killed in Kuwait?	mixture	['kuwait']	https://sofrep.com/	https://sofrep.com/57282/dead-working-dogs-piled-like-trash-contract-terminated-kuwait/	2017/08/22	By Desiree Huitt 06.23.2016 #Featured Email Share TweetThere are no happy stories of handlers being reunited with their working dogs in this article.Instead, there are only the deaths of at least 24 to 40 working dogs and the possibility of 90 additional dogs.  Eastern Securities or E Sec  was awarded a contract with Kuwait National Petroleum Company (KNPC) to provide explosive detection dogs for their oil rigs. When KNPC canceled the contract with Eastern Securities, they were left with 140+ dogs that no longer had a job and were costing them money to feed and house them. Instead of being responsible with the working dogs and finding them homes, Eastern Securities chose the most cost-effective way of dealing with the unemployed working dogs, euthanasia. It is unknown at this time exactly how the dogs were killed or even if the remaining 90 are still alive.Little to nothing can be done legally, the only thing that can come from this is a warning to companies that supply working dogs to security companies like Eastern Securities. Like many overseas security contractors, Eastern Securities purchased the trained dogs from a US company called  USK9 Unlimited, Inc .According to Mike Ritland, former Navy SEAL and owner of  Trikos International ,“The US is a major supplier of working dogs due to superior K9 training and quality of dogs found in the US. Once the dogs are sold, their fate is up to their new owners. That is why it is very important to check where and who the dogs will end up with. I have denied several dog requests from celebrities, security companies, and foreign governments in the past because I know that I cannot guarantee that the animals welfare and best interest are in mind.”In the featured image, you can see emaciated dogs. Mike Ritland, said,“It is not uncommon to have lean working dogs especially in a hot climate, but some of the dogs appear to be a little too lean. This does not happen overnight and could show further evidence of maltreatment and stressful living conditions.”USK9 Unlimited, Inc., released a statement on Facebook :“As President and CEO of USK9, due to many questions and statements regarding a Facebook post showing the massacre of dogs over in Kuwait, (a post shared on my personal Facebook page by a friend over in Kuwait), I felt obligated to post on behalf of USK9 in an effort to clear up any misunderstandings. Let me first state USK9 HAD NO PART OF SUCH AN INHUMANE ACT, if this alleged incident is in fact true, and has NOT done any business with nor been affiliated with this company “Eastern Security” for several years now.The original post shared on my timeline and some subsequent postings thereafter allege that someone intentionally killed multiple dogs and further blame “Eastern Security” (a security company operated in the country of Kuwait). According to these posts (and others) the alleged dog massacre occurred after “Eastern Security” allegedly loss a contract for security service in that country. Although I/we (USK9) have not made any such accusation(s), if these accusation(s) are proved to be true and accurate, USK9’s position shall be one of absolute condemnation of such a gross and vile act against defenseless animals. At USK9, we are true animal lovers and have always believed and treated each and every dog as “man’s best friend”. To see these type pictures simply makes all of us here sick to our stomachs.For the record, many years ago a successful and respected local business man (name withheld) here in Lafayette, La. reached out to USK9 with the prospect of he and his brother (“Bill Baisey residing in Kuwait”) starting a K9 security company to service the large refineries in Kuwait, using explosive detection dogs. Subsequently, USK9 entered into a contractual agreement with “Eastern Security” to sell trained explosive detector dogs and to help set up and train K9 teams for the “Kuwait Project”. In 2008, dogs were procured and trained by USK9 and sold to “Eastern Security”. Handlers employed by “Eastern Security” were sent here to Kaplan Louisiana (USK9) for certification for the “Project Kuwait”. The handlers for the “Kuwait Project” graduated in 2009. After a very long process, the Kuwait Project was completed and “Eastern Security” began operating as a stand-alone security company providing a K9 based security service to one or more oil refineries in Kuwait.USK9 ended up terminating the contract with “Eastern Security” shortly after it was up and running in Kuwait, due to what USK9 believed to be a breach of contract by “Eastern Security” on many issues to include but not limited to failing to make payments owed to USK9 for services rendered and other issues of conflict where one or more Kennel Master(s) and handler(s) that were employed by “Eastern Security”, began to raise questions about working hours, unfair wages, housing accommodations, delayed payroll issues etc.. USK9 was NOT aware of any abuse of animals during this time, otherwise would have reported such.USK9 has not had any dealings with or dog sales to “Eastern Security” in a few years now, ever since USK9 decided to terminate the contract and sever all ties with “Eastern Security”, which in light of this most recent alleged event, if true, will prove to have been a very wise decision. USK9 will monitor the developments of these allegations and will defend itself vigorously on anyone attempting to defame our impeccable reputation as a world leader in K9 training solutions.Respectfully,President/CEOUSK9 Unlimited, Inc.”SOFREP reached out to both Eastern Securities and USK9 Unlimited, Inc. but neither have responded yet. There has been a Facebook page created regarding this incident as the organizers of the page are trying to find vet care and homes for the 90 remaining dogs. Eastern Securities has not responded to their requests and inquiries of the remaining dogs as well.The Facebook page dedicated to helping the dogs also released a statement from a person who claimed to have worked for E Sec. In their statement they allege that not only does E Sec treat the dogs poorly but also might be involved in human trafficking:This is my story: I worked for this company for about 5 months in 2014 as an assistant program manager. Eastern Securities, a Kuwaiti contract company with an American owner, has killed the dogs left in their kennel upon losing the contract they had with the Kuwait National Petroleum Company. I can not get exact numbers, but the only witness that has exposed this says about 40 dogs. The owner of the company is Bill Baisey and his Program Manager is Tony Touchet . Both were aware of the murders of the dogs. The K9s were contract working dogs trained by a US company to do explosive detection at the oil drilling sites in Kuwait. The witness of this massacre is scared to come forward due to fear of being arrested in Kuwait. You see, in addition to killing these dogs, I believe Eastern Securities was also involved with human trafficking. I started to see the evidence of this when I worked there. In fact, Bill Baisey has been under investigation with his other company, Najlaa, and also with KBR for human trafficking charges. While I worked in Kuwait, many of the ES employees were not allowed to return to their home countries. Some had been away for many years. The company took their passports, held the sponsorships to their visas, and refused to let them go. If an employee went to the embassy, the company would lay a false charge or claim against them to get them arrested or “blacklisted”. Some handlers’ passports expired and they actually were thrown into a Kuwaiti jail for illegally being in the country when they finally got their passports back and tried to go home. While what happened to these dogs is sick and disgusting and inexcusable, what goes on in Kuwait regarding human trafficking is far worse. The public must understand that the employees who can testify for these dogs are all scared to death of their own fates at this moment. I started to pry into this issue while I was working there, but soon myself and the female office manager were being spied on. We were told that charges would be laid against us for bogus issues such as “having male visitors in our home” which is illegal and highly punishable for women in Kuwait. I left suddenly and quietly before I could be implicated or blacklisted or arrested. I stayed in touch with the handlers, and advised them as I could. Some have told me that a lawyer is working on this case for them. I am not sure what else can be done… As both Tony and Bill hold US passports, I would like to believe there is something the US government can do, but I am not sure what or who to contact. However, please believe… The story about the deaths of these CWD’s is true. This is the dirty, grungy side of animals for business. Even the “good” companies eventually have to sell their dogs to someone when their contracts are over, and then low-bidding companies like ES end up with the final say in their fate.Eastern Securities wants this issue to die, however, by sharing this article hopefully they will not win anymore contracts nor will companies be willing to sell them dogs.Image courtesy of Kuwait TimesIf you liked this article, tell someone about itAbout the AuthorDesiree Huitt Desiree Huitt is an Army Veteran serving 11 years as a Military Intelligence officer and prior to OCS as a combat medic.

https://www.snopes.com/the-coming-ice-age/	Did a 1977 ‘Time’ Story Offer Tips on ‘How to Survive the Coming Ice Age’?	false	['climate change', ' global cooling', ' time']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/ZK49j	2017/05/18	"Posted by Matt Dempsey Matt_Dempsey@epw.senate.govIn Case You Missed It... The Daily CallerSenators spar during hearing over alleged 1970s global cooling consensusBy Amanda CareyLink to Article Senate Environment and Public Works Committee members sparred Wednesday over whether there existed a consensus in the 1970s that the earth was cooling.During the hearing, Republican Sens. James Inhofe of Oklahoma and John Barrasso of Wyoming questioned the supposed need to enact policies to combat global warming by pointing to similar predictions in the 1970s of a global cooling phenomenon.The exchange started with Barrasso addressing the committee's witness, Environmental Protection Agency Director Lisa Jackson.""Forty years ago, the same scientists that are predicting the end of the world now from global warming were predicting the end of the world from global cooling,"" said Barrasso. ""So if we had committed the same amount of taxpayer resources and government manpower that the administration now wants us to commit to prevent global warming - if we'd done that prevent global cooling, we wouldn't be the most prosperous nation on earth.""He continued: ""The fact is that the same doomsday predictions we were getting 40 years is the exact same thing this agency and this administration today. Only now...the problem is man-made global warming.""Shortly thereafter, Democratic Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado responded to Barrasso by citing an article which he said proved the ""supposed global cooling consensus among scientists in the 1970s is a myth.""""Would you put that in the record then,"" committee chair Sen. Barbara Boxer of California eagerly interrupted.Still later, Inhofe got into the science debate by citing a 1971 study by Dr. John Holdren, who just so happens to be President Obama's advisor on science technology. In that study Holdren wrote, ""The effects of a new ice age on agriculture and the supportability of large human populations scarcely need elaboration here."" Holdren went on to write that the effects could ""generate a tidal wave of proportions unprecedented in recorded history.""A visibly satisfied Inhofe then turned to Boxer, and stated, ""So even the president's people are agreed with me, Madam Chairwoman!""###"

The lady pictured with her ""burnt"" ear in a bandage (Nora Kirkpatrick, an actress) was pictured using her phone next to the same ear. Her hair and clothes were totally unmarked.4.

She did it back in December, because she wanted to try it in a month where people “buy a lot of stuff”.Before becoming a sex-worker, she was an actress. But because she couldn’t find any good opportunity working as an actress, she decided to try this. But it went wrong.The woman got pregnant, and she wants to have the kid. But she doesn’t have enough money or resources to raise the chil, so she is filing for child support.“After all, this is HIS child. He has to take care of his child, even though he didn’t want to have it.”, the woman said to our reporter Gary Cockburn. She was very upset and angry, and refused to say anything else.On the other hand, the father of the child claims that “He didn’t know it was a real woman” and that he “avoids having sex with real women for this exact reason”.The case will be taken to court, as the man states that he is innocent and doesn’t want to have the child.“It was the most realistic sexual robot I had ever tried, until it wasn’t.”, said the man, disappointed.You can now write your own articles!

Upon conviction, the suspect is subject to up to 20 years in federal prison.The move passed the House with a historic unanimous vote of 435-0, skated through the Senate with another unprecedented vote of 100-0, and finally was signed into law in the very same day by President Trump.“At long last, we can all unite around our hatred for being forced to listen to sappy Christmas standards months before December 25,” a Congressional representative said. “While we may all disagree on just about every other social issue of our day, at least we can come together on this.”It’s great that our country can finally agree on something during these tumultuous times!SHARE

https://www.snopes.com/trump-sons-fundraiser/	Trump Sons Sell Access to Father for Hunting Trip Fundraiser	mixture	['donald trump', ' donald trump jr.', ' eric trump', ' hunting', ' opening day 45', ' trump sons']	https://exposingthebiggame.wordpress.com/	https://exposingthebiggame.wordpress.com/2016/12/18/hunt-with-the-trumps-for-1million/	2016/12/21	Donald Trump’s sons are looking to start the President-elect’s first full day in office with a bang. Following his inauguration, wealthy donors have the chance to go on a shooting excursion with Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump in a fundraiser, entitled ‘Opening Day’, honoring their father. For $1million, the top package offers a photo opportunity with President Trump for up to 16 people and a multi-day hunting or fishing trip with one or both of the Trump sons. Donald Trump Jr (left) and Eric Trump (right) are the stars of Opening Day, a fundraiser held in their father’s honor. Along with the event full of rich donors, Toby Keith, Alabama and other ‘surprise entertainers’ will be performing at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington DC onÂ Saturday, January 21. The attire for the fundraiser isÂ described as ‘camouflage and cufflinks… jeans, boots and hats are welcome’ and all proceeds will go to conservation charities. This isn’t the first time Donald Jr and Eric have shown their fondness for hunting, both domestically and internationally. In the past the two sons have come under fire for big-game hunting and posing with their kills, including Donald Jr smiling next a dead buffalo and in another holding up a tail of an elephant. Eric is pictured sitting on top of a water buffalo, with his hat hanging off its horn and three rifles propped up against the animal’s body. The two also have a photo that sparked outrage on social media where they proudly hold up a dead cheetah. In the past the two sons have come under fire for big-game hunting and posing with their kills. Trump turned to his children to boost support for his campaign and many political analysts think they aided to his win. Daughter Ivanka Trump played a large role in his campaign and was seen at her father’s side at conventions, rallies and debates. The 35-year-old is now the star of her own fundraiser, where a lucky bidder can have a 45 minute coffee break with the mother-of-three. The sit-down is estimated at $50,000 and once the bidder forks over the money to Eric Trump’s foundation and vetted by a background check, the two can chat about politics and life.

https://www.snopes.com/oklahoma-representative-god/	Did an Oklahoma State Representative Say Rape and Incest are the ‘Will of God’?	mtrue	['abortion', ' incest', ' oklahoma', ' rape']	http://www.patheos.com/	http://www.patheos.com/blogs/progressivesecularhumanist/2017/03/oklahoma-lawmaker-rape-incest-will-god/	2017/07/13	0 Comments{COUNT}Oklahoma State Rep. George Faught argues that rape and incest are the will of God while defending anti-abortion legislation.Tuesday the Oklahoma House approved House Bill 1549, also called the Prenatal Nondiscrimination act of 2017. The controversial legislation would prohibit abortion when the fetus is diagnosed with Down syndrome or any other birth defect.Discussing the legislation before Tuesday’s vote, Faught, the bill’s author, said when it comes to abortion, people are being allowed to play God.While discussing Faught’s legislation on the House floor Rep. Regina Goodwin asked :At what point did you decide that that’s within your ability to decide for all women in Oklahoma?Faught replied:One of the things that I campaigned on was to protect life, and I believe life begins at conception.At one point Rep. Cory Williams (D) asked Faught if rape is the “will of God.”Faught responded :Well, you know, if you read the Bible, there’s actually a couple circumstances where that happened. The Lord uses all circumstances. I mean, you can go down that path, but it’s a reality unfortunately.Williams followed up, asking if incest is the “will of God.”Faught said:Same answer. Doesn’t deal with this bill.Williams continued, asking why the bill does not include exceptions for rape and incest which are allowed in most anti-abortion legislation:You won’t make any exceptions for rape. You won’t make any exceptions for incest, and you are proffering divine intervention as a reason why you won’t do that.Williams Continued:I think it is very important (to know), do you believe rape and incest are actually the will of God?After a brief pause, Faught replied:You know it’s a great question to ask. And obviously if it happens in someone’s life, it may not be the best thing that ever happened, but — so you’re saying that God is not sovereign with every activity that happens in someone’s life and can’t use anything and everything in someone’s life and I disagree with that.Bottom line: For Rep. Faught, God is sovereign, and everything that happens is part of God’s plan – even rape and incest. Sounds like Faught’s God is a moral monster. Good thing God doesn’t exist, but it is terrifying that legislators like Faught are making laws based on their ridiculous and dangerous religious superstitions.(H/T Raw Story – Watch a video clip of the exchange between Faught and Williams below)Oklahoma State Rep.

She has allowed me to share her story. If you feel led, you can do the same<3""Hello, my name is Brianna, and this is my story.""Love is not the little things. It is not the phone calls, the dates, or even the memories. Love is knowing you would sacrifice things that you didn't even know you could sacrifice. Love is selfless.Have you ever felt your life shake ? Have you ever been hit with so much emotional turmoil to the point where everything around you becomes fuzzy and shaken? Your lungs feel tight and for a brief second you can't do anything. You are unable to move, unable to think, unable to even react. I have. I experienced something I never thought I would experience...all while nine months pregnant with my first child.Being pregnant is supposed to be one of the most amazing journeys you will ever embark on . You're creating a new life. You are experiencing unconditional love for someone you have not even met. Austin and I were so excited to meet our little boy. To bring him home. To be a family. I never imagined as I went to sleep that night, that my whole world would be shattered within hours. I still remember my mother in law waking me up that morning. ""Austin had an accident"" she said. All I knew was that my husband was in the hospital. The worst part? I didn't know why.After a two hour drive to the hospital, I learned that my husband, the father of my child, the person I am so deeply in love with, had had a brain hemorrhage. Why? The doctors concluded (after running his tox screen and ruling out drugs) that this horrible event was due to his recent excessive energy drink consumption (a habit he had built when he started working longer hours and commuting). Surgery was already in motion... and after an agonizing 5 hour wait, we got to see him. But while everyone was focused on the almost unrecognizable face hooked up to all sorts of machines and tubes, all I could see was his parents. I saw the light leave his mother's eyes as she saw her motionless son laying in that hospital bed. I saw his father break down crying as he held onto his wife. They didn't know if the life they created together would even wake up. Watching this family- my new family, who I have grown to love and be a part of, be so shattered and broken...that is the worst feeling I have ever felt.The next day was round two of brain surgery. Following this were strokes, seizures, swelling, and more things we weren't prepared for. There was a moment, sitting by his hospital bed, just praying he would be okay, that I knew I would never give up on him. No matter how messy our life would become. I was going to be by his side through all of it. After two weeks of living in a hospital, wondering if he would survive or be taken from us, we made our way back home. The time had come for me to deliver our baby.I'm not going to lie to anyone, it was so hard. I had planned on Austin being a part of this huge moment. Being by my side. Holding my hand. Being there to cut the cord. Being there to welcome our son into the world. It didn't feel right... But a beautiful miracle happened as I delivered our son. Austin woke up. I went about a week without seeing him. I thought about him every day. I cried as I looked at my child who looked just like his daddy. When the baby was only a week old, I left him with my in-laws. I knew I needed to see Austin. I needed to tell him that our baby was here. To tell him how much we needed him. Weeks went by. We chased him all over the state as more operations and procedures were ordered. I saw him every chance I got. At a little over 2 months old, our son finally met his dad. A day I wasn't sure I would ever see. That was the day that my heart gained some of its happiness back. Some time after that he could finally come home to me. Our life isn't normal. There are doctors visits and hospital trips- so many that I loose count. But we are here. Fighting. I wake up every day to take care of our beautiful little boy and my husband. I prepare the meals, do physical therapy, speech therapy, and occupational therapy. I help him with personal hygiene. I help him walk. I help him with every aspect of his life. And in between these tasks I take care of our very busy eight month old. It is hard, and I am tired, but we make the most of it. He isn't the same man I fell in love with, but I still fall further everyday, We are fighting to help him recover. To make his life better. One day we will get there. Until then, I will never give up on him. Because love is selfless, and I love him more than life itself.Photos courtesy of https://www.facebook.com/Endresphotography/"

It’s a shame that a state so well-known for social liberalism and true blue policy is also host to this kind of racism and hate.A convoy of douchebags traveling from Wrentham to Foxboro consisted of every piece of trash the area had to offer. The Massachusetts redneck is no different from anywhere else, with the exception that only a few are stupid enough to carry a confederate flag because of their “heritage.” Anticipating the ignorance that was about to happen, a recording session was planned and executed that can be used anytime you hear  Trump supporters say, “We’re not racists, we just aren’t politically correct.” Here’s what they mean by that:Subscribe to our Youtube Channel“Lynch all the f*cking n*ggers” is definitely NOT politically correct. It’s not correct in any way. None of what these imbeciles said is correct in any way.It would be nice to think that Trump supporters, once seeing and hearing how their comrades in idiocy truly behave, would have an epiphany of some sort and come to their senses. The problem is, they’re Trump supporters. They’re the ones driving those trucks.Featured image via screen captureRelated

They were shot either in head or heart in cold blood. Only very few incidents or events like this post were imitated in the movie Kingdom of Ants' though it doesn't reflect the true genocide at all. So, the incident in the post is not fake, illustrated or falsehood. The spirit is absolutely true. Every day thousand of fake, illustrated or false post are published and nobody cares at all. But here the fact is, the post has got more than 10,000 likes and share and a universal brotherhood has risen against the Israeli genocide. That's why some Israeli agents and brokers are scared of the post. They are afraid of this universal spirit and union against Israel. They are afraid that this post might create another impact like Tahrir Square or Arab revolution. That is why they are trying to divert the spirit by mentioning a movie reference.First they offered me handsome amount of money then they threatened me to remove the post. Every day I am being threatened in my cell phone, text message, mail inbox and Facebook inbox to remove the post. I will not remove it till my last breath.

While criminal investigations have increasingly included evidence from social media posts, live broadcasting a crime in progress is exceedingly rare  let alone an allegedly racially motivated attack.""I can\'t understand why anybody put anything on Facebook,"" Near North Area Commander Kevin Duffin said when asked about the video at an afternoon news conference at Chicago police headquarters.Chicago police speak to the news media about the attack of a man with special needs that was captured in a Facebook Live video and the resulting charges filed against four people suspected of the attack.

""Whether it\'s tensions between police and communities, (or) hate crimes of the despicable sort that has just now recently surfaced on Facebook.""Charged in the attack were Jordan Hill, 18, of Carpentersville; Tesfaye Cooper, 18, of Chicago; and sisters Brittany Covington, 18, and Tanishia Covington, 24, who lived in an apartment in the 3300 block of West Lexington Street where the assault allegedly took place.The four  who are all African-American  were each charged with aggravated kidnapping, hate crime, aggravated unlawful restraint and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, according to police. Hill also was charged with robbery, possession of a stolen motor vehicle and residential burglary, while both Covingtons were charged with residential burglary, police said.Police said all four have given statements admitting to their roles in the alleged attack. They\'re scheduled to appear for a bond hearing Friday at the Leighton Criminal Court Building.Late Thursday, David Boyd, who identified himself as the victim\'s brother-in-law, said in a brief statement to reporters that the family was grateful for ""all the prayers and efforts"" that led to his safe return.""He\'s doing well, as well as he could be at this time,"" Boyd said. He said ""everyone has seen the video"" but declined to comment on what he thought of it.""We appreciate all the support from everyone,"" Boyd said, adding they were focused on ""trying to stick together as a family.""Facebook Live video posted on Jan. 3, 2017, shows the verbal and physical attack of a mentally disabled man.

The victim appeared ""injured"" and ""confused"" and was wearing little clothing despite the freezing temperatures, police said.""I observed him wearing a tank top, inside-out, backwards, jean shorts and sandals on,"" Harrison District Officer Michael Donnelly said at the news conference. ""He was bloodied. He was battered. He was very discombobulated.""Police ran his name and discovered he\'d been reported missing Monday by his parents, who said he disappeared after they dropped him off at a McDonald\'s in suburban Streamwood to meet up with Hill on Saturday. Police said Hill knew the victim because they had attended the same school in Aurora.According to police, Hill had stolen a van in Streamwood before picking up the victim and passed it off as his own. He and the victim then drove to Chicago\'s West Side, visiting with friends for two days. The victim slept in the van before being brought to the Covington sisters\' apartment on West Lexington on Tuesday, police said.Hours into the visit, the victim and Hill got into a ""play fight"" that got out of hand, police said. The sisters got angry and tied the victim up, according to police.""That\'s when the attack begins,"" said Duffin, the police commander.The chilling Facebook video shows the victim crouched in a corner and mostly motionless with an expression of fear on his face. His mouth is taped shut and his hands and feet appear to be bound with orange electrical tape.Kim JanssenA depraved attack on a mentally disabled white teen broadcast live on Facebook allegedly by four black Chicago-area residents became a national rallying cry Thursday for conservative pundits who tried to pin the blame for the attack  without evidence  on the Black Lives Matter movement.

Shown... (Kim Janssen)The 28-minute video is recorded by and focuses mostly on the face of Brittany Covington, who smokes what appears to be a blunt  a cigar emptied and stuffed with marijuana  while narrating some of the action. Liquor bottles appear to be sitting on a windowsill of the sparsely decorated apartment, along with a crumpled bag of chips.As the group laughs and music plays in the background, Covington pans from her face to the victim and back. The two men can be seen cutting the victim\'s shirt with knives, then taking turns punching him and kicking his head. One of the men cuts the victim\'s hair and scalp with a knife, and the victim\'s head appears to be bleeding. Later, they pretend to tap ashes in the wound while Covington laughs.As the attack continues, someone off camera shouts ""F--- Donald Trump"" and ""F--- white people."" About 15 minutes into the video, one of the men says the victim ""represents Trump,"" and threatens to put him in the trunk of a car and ""put a brick on the gas.""A later clip shows the victim kneeling over a toilet while his assailants force his head into the water and order him to drink.At one point in the video, Covington can be heard telling the rest of the group that her little sister doesn\'t ""think it\'s funny."" She also expresses mock disappointment in the attention the live feed is getting on Facebook.""Y\'all ain\'t even commenting on my s---, man!"" she says into the camera.Duffin said police believe the victim was tied up for four or five hours. He said the attackers became distracted after a downstairs neighbor complained about the noise and threatened to call 911, prompting a confrontation.""They booted her door and they actually grabbed something on their way out,"" Duffin said.During their absence, the victim managed to leave the apartment and was later found wandering the street with Hill.CBS 2 Special Contributor Jay Levine interviews President Barack Obama at the White House.

About the same time, officers found signs of a struggle and property damage at the apartment on West Lexington that they linked to the attack, according to police.Streamwood police, meanwhile, said the victim\'s parents had reported getting text messages from someone claiming to be holding their son captive. As Streamwood officers investigated the texts, they discovered the Facebook video.Before the charges were announced Thursday, the video had became a national rallying cry for conservative pundits who tried to pin the blame for the attack on the Black Lives Matters movement. Debate also raged on social media and cable news stations about whether the police would consider the black-on-white assault a hate crime.""If this had been done to an African-American by four whites, every liberal in the country would be outraged, and there\'d be no question but that it\'s a hate crime,"" former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Thursday on Fox News.Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said there ""was never a question"" whether the case would be investigated as a hate crime, but police wanted to check all the facts before deciding anything based on emotion. He said the racial comments of the attackers and the disabilities of the victim both played a role in the decision.""Let me be very clear, the actions in that video are reprehensible,"" Johnson said. ""That, along with racism, have absolutely no place in the city of Chicago. Or anywhere else for that matter.""At a separate event Thursday, Mayor Rahm Emanuel called the acts on the video ""sickening,"" adding that anyone who views it is ""sickened by it.""John KassThere\'s a lot to unpack from Chicago\'s latest racial outrage, the Facebook Torture Case, and it\'s ugly, so let\'s get to it.

Four African-Americans were charged Thursday with hate crimes in the alleged kidnapping and torture of a bound, white and mentally disabled young man. Police... (John Kass)He declined further comment, citing the criminal charges, but also said ""there is more to our city than that.""Records show that the two sisters have previous arrests but only Tanishia Covington has been convicted, and of only one misdemeanor. She was arrested in the 1300 block of West Touhy Avenue on March 26 while riding in a car that had been reported stolen, records show. She pleaded guilty in April to misdemeanor criminal trespass to a vehicle and was sentenced to a year of court supervision.While the other charges filed against the four defendants Thursday have much more serious consequences  aggravated battery with a deadly weapon carries up to 15 years behind bars  it was the hate crime count that garnered the most attention.Illinois\' law, passed in 1991, states that a hate crime is committed if the offender launches an attack ""by reason of"" the person\'s race, religion, sexual orientation, nationality or physical or mental disability. A first-time offense is punishable by one to three years in prison, with probation also an option. Under the law, a judge can also consider the hate crime component after conviction on other counts to enhance whatever sentence is given.A spokeswoman for the Cook County state\'s attorney\'s office said Thursday the office did not have updated figures available for how many hate crime prosecutions it has brought in recent years. The office told the Tribune in 2014 that it had brought 44 cases in the previous three years.Most hate crime cases escape public notice, but several have made recent headlines. Last summer, a Cook County judge acquitted an Edgewater man of a hate crime and all other charges in an alleged attack on an elderly African-American judge outside the Daley Center. David Nicosia had been accused of spitting on and slapping the jurist and calling her ""Rosa Parks"" after becoming annoyed with her cigarette smoke.Police say an apartment on Chicago\'s West Side was the scene of a brutal attack captured on Facebook Live that led to hate crime charges being filed against four people.

The former freshmen, one of whom is the son of the Massachusetts Appeals Court\'s chief justice, had been charged with a felony hate crime.There have also been felony convictions. Norwood Park resident Tom Diamond was found guilty by a judge of a hate crime and sentenced to a year in prison for yelling racial slurs at an African-American woman walking by his porch in 2013. According to the woman\'s testimony, Diamond threatened to kill, rape and hang her from a tree if he saw her in his neighborhood again.In 2014, Terry Glover pleaded guilty to hate crime and aggravated battery charges after taking part in the beating of a lesbian couple walking home from a West Side liquor store, according to court records.Josh Kutnick, a longtime criminal-defense attorney who has represented several people charged in Cook County with hate crimes, said such cases are often difficult for prosecutors to prove.""It\'s hard to prove that something was done \'by reason of,\'"" Kutnick said.

https://www.snopes.com/woman-attacked-on-camera-for-wearing-a-trump-hat-in-hollywood/	Was a Woman Attacked on Camera for Wearing a ‘Make America Great Again’ Hat in Hollywood?	mixture	['alex jones', ' blaire white', ' hollywood', ' trump administration']	https://rationalwiki.org/	https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Blaire_White	2017/11/14	"“”I lost subscribers today for saying that children shouldn't be sterilized. Imagine that.—Blaire White, discussing trans children [6]White is a trans woman undergoing transition. As a result, her views on GSM issues often get extra respect despite being contradicted by science. Indeed, White routinely holds views contrary to those of scientific professionals on trans issues:Mental disorder: White asserts that ""transgenderism is a mental disorder,"" [7] which is false according to the American Psychological Association, [8] American Psychiatric Association, [9] and the World Health Organization. [10] [11] Indeed, in what was probably shocking news to exactly no trans person other than Blaire White, trans children were found to have normal rates of anxiety and depression when accepted by their families and communities. [12] [13]Transitioning: In the same video, she states her belief that transitioning is a ""faulty"" response to gender dysphoria and ""not for everyone"", and that there should be a ""cure for transgenderism"" , which is again denied by the American Psychological Association. [14]Gender binary: White firmly believes that there are only two genders [15] [16] and calls non-binary gender identities ""trans-retarded"". [17] This has no basis in any academic field of study, whether you want to look at biology , psychiatry, [note 1] or anthropology .There is no definition of gender under which it is true. It is first-grade bullshit that merely appeals to the worldview of right-wingers in the United States.Childhood transition: Ironically for someone who denounces ""transtrenders,"" a term that is usually a snarl word for people who reject transmedicalism , White believes that childhood transition is literally ""child abuse"". [18] Replace transgender with any other medical condition and the contradiction becomes obvious; this is, however, resolved when you view her not as making reasonable arguments but as pandering to a conservative audience that is looking for every pseudo-rational reason to justify their transphobia. Also, despite grabbing her a lot of attention the term ""child abuse"" for childhood transition is, again, rejected by the American Psychological Association, which extensively discusses trans youth, though it does conclude ""consensus does not exist regarding best practice with prepubertal children."" [8] In addition, trans YouTuber Zinnia Jones has two citation-heavy response blogs. [19] [20]Politics: White also believes that ""the left is fighting a fight transgender people don’t want"", [21] apparently unaware of modern polling. [note 2]Bigotry[ edit ]“”Respect is earned, and the transgender community does very little in the public eye that deserves respect. [22]White ""doesn't like the LGBT community"". [23] In her video series ""Triggering Trannies"" (later renamed to ""Upset Trans People"" [24] ) White freely admits that the LGBT community opposes her views, though she blows it off as ""just the SJW branch"". [25] [26] [27] Fittingly, White also holds numerous views that appear to be based not on reason but bigotry:White only supports straight trans women (i.e. those attracted exclusively to men). She believes that trans lesbians are really just straight men, taking the liberty to call one ""he"" and ""heterosexual."" Despite (at the time) being a non-op herself, Blaire criticizes said lesbian for still having a penis. [28]White thinks that trans women who don't pass shouldn't use the bathroom of their preferred gender. [29]White doesn't care much about preferred pronouns, referring to it as ""policing someone's behavior"" and ""being sensitive"". [30]White describes the label ""queer"" as ""brainwashing children"". [31]In short: White is against youth transition and simultaneously makes fun of people for not passing . She has also ""not bullied"" several specific leftist trans YouTubers:White dedicates five videos solely to attacking Riley Dennis , a trans female YouTuber. [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] She also misgenders Dennis, [28] [37] [38] [39] perhaps because she doesn't think Dennis is truly trans. [40] However, she has since apologized for said misgendering, when Riley Dennis revealed that she had been receiving hormones and laser hair removal, which is like apologizing to an Italian person for beating them up because you thought they were speaking Spanish. [41]White writes that ""I DONT WANT TO BE A BULLY but Milo Stewart is actually transitioning into a lawn gnome now, as I predicted. :X [image of Milo Stewart as lawn gnome]"" [42]Gender issues[ edit ]“”So now that we're all in agreement that feminism is indeed cancer, let's look at the ways feminism is like a virus.—Blaire White, prominent biologist [43]“”I can't explain why I don't need feminism, I'm too busy prospering without it. —Blaire White, professional tapeworm in the gut of feminism [44]White is an antifeminist . [45] [46] White frequently creates clickbait content of the ""REKT FEMINIST"" type. [32] [34] [35] [47] [48]White thinks rape culture doesn't exist. [49] Fittingly, she describes the feminist view of rape as follows: [50]Rape: Anything. No, seriously, like, they've butchered the definition so bad anything can be rape now.White denies the existence of the gender pay gap . [51] Her reasoning leaves a lot to be desired: [52]The wage gap is in great part due to women taking more time off than men.What will the Women's March do to help? They'll refuse to go to work. Amazing.White believes female privilege exists and is a strong argument for antifeminism. [45]In short: White is indistinguishable from your typical YouTube ""anti-SJW"" clickbait producer.Other stances[ edit ]“”I recently tried a tanning lotion out and I really regret it, it's not a good look. But on the bright side, I'm only a cornrowsaway from being able to demand reparations from you guys. [53]“”I tried on self tanner that I mistook for lotion in the store and my left hand has been African American for the past 4 days. [54]"

The dogs are faced off against one another, running ""at"" each other but prevented from touching one another, which is a stressful and frustrating experience for animals trained to fight. The dogs get wearier and wearier, their muscles more and more prominent, and their mouths increasingly salivate. At this live 2003 ""performance"" in China, a video was recorded, complete with close-up shots of the dogs' frantic, foaming faces. This 7-minute video will be on display at the Guggenheim exhibit (information from NY Times article ""Where the Wild Things Are: China’s Art Dreamers at the Guggenheim"").In another example, artist Xu Bing stamped meaningless characters all over the bodies of two pigs, a boar and a sow, who were put on display, mating, in a museum exhibit in Beijing in 1994. The Guggenheim will feature the video of that ""performance"" as well.Finally, this exhibit will feature live animals (reptiles, amphibians, insects) that are trapped in a glass enclosure for attendee viewing. According to the NY Times article, ""During the three-month exhibition some creatures will be devoured; others may die of fatigue. The big ones will survive. From time to time, a New York City pet shop will replenish the menagerie with new bugs.""Help us send a message to the Guggenheim by signing this petition. Let them know that animal cruelty holds no place in art in the United States, nor should it anywhere in the world. This assault on animals in the name of art will not be tolerated or supported.Guggenheim - please do what you know in your heart is right. Take a stand with our animal cohabitants of this planet, and pull the pieces employing these cruel methods from your upcoming show. Guggenheim - tell the world what you stand for: bold, controversial art that breaks barriers and challenges social norms, which does NOT include the promotion of cruelty against innocent beings.Start a petition of your ownThis petition starter stood up and took action. Will you do the same?"

He then retweeted a third titled: ""Islamist mob pushes teenage boy off roof and beats him to death!""Jayda Fransen, acting leader of the far-right organization Britain First, marches in central London on April 1. Getty ImagesKeep up with this story and more by subscribing nowFransen's Britain First is an anti-Islam, anti-immigration and nationalist political party. It is known for its anti-Islam political stunts, including ""invading"" mosques and launching ""Christian patrols."" The group has used social media to disseminate its message, posting anti-Islam and anti-immigrant propaganda on Twitter and videos of provocative stunts designed to antagonize Muslims on YouTube and Facebook. It has unsuccessfully contested elections for the House of Commons and the European Parliament, as well as the London mayoral elections. Fransen's tweets came days after she was arrested for comments made in a speech at a rally in Belfast, Northern Ireland, this summer. Fransen was in Belfast on August 6 for a demonstration by around 50 people calling themselves Northern Ireland Against Terrorism. Fransen  was found guilty of religiously aggravated harassment in November 2016 after making comments to a stranger during a ""Christian patrol"" in Bury Park, Luton, in January 2016. Fransen admitted telling Sumayyah Sharpe that Muslim men force women to cover up to avoid being raped ""because they cannot control their sexual urges,"" adding ""that's why they are coming into my country raping women across the continent.""Sharpe was with her four young children at the time. Fransen was fined nearly £2,000 ($2,680) for the incident. In August that year, Fransen and Britain First leader Paul Golding were banned  from the city of Luton and from entering any mosque in England and Wales for three years following an injunction from police who accused them of inciting ""community tensions.""In January they had marched through a part of Luton with a large Muslim community holding Christian crosses and handing out anti-Muslim pamphlets.  U.S. President Donald Trump answers questions about his response to the violence, injuries and deaths at the ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, as he talks to the media in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York City on August 15. REUTERS/Kevin LamarqueIn June 2016, Tommy Mair shouted “Britain First” before shooting dead British Parliamentarian Jo Cox near Leeds in West Yorkshire. Britain First denied any connection to Mair, and Golding condemned the killing. Cox’s husband, Brendan Cox, criticized Trump Wednesday morning for what he said was legitimizing far-right politics.Television presenter and Celebrity Apprentice winner Piers Morgan, who has defended the president following past controversies and who Trump follows on Twitter, called for Trump to remove the retweets.British charity Hope not Hate, which monitors extremist organizations, said it ""beggars belief"" that Trump would retweet the material. ""Anyone with half a brain knows that Britain First is an extreme right movement that has had links to Loyalism, claims to 'invade' mosques, used murdered British soldier Lee Rigby’s name against the wishes of his family to help it campaign in elections, and has bought many of its supposed followers on social media,"" a spokesperson told Newsweek.  Fransen celebrated the president’s apparent show of support. According to social media monitoring site SocialBlade, Fransen had 52,700 followers before Trump's retweets. At the time of writing, this had risen to 54,100, an increase of almost 1,500 in less than an hour.Trump faced widespread criticism after August's white supremacist Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, when he blamed ""both sides"" for unrest which saw anti-racism protester Heather Heyer killed. The Trump administration has attempted to impose a ban on residents from several Muslim majority countries entering the U.S., citing security concerns. The Southern Poverty Law Center has attributed a threefold increase in the number of Islamophobic crimes in the U.S. in 2016 to Trump's anti-Muslim rhetoric on the campaign trail. Trump has a record of disseminating information from dubious sources which have trafficked far-right conspiracies, on Saturday praising the Magapill website for an article lauding his achievements. The site had previously tweeted a ""flow chart"" which claimed Jews and the Vatican control the world.  "

Do you support Americans for Prosperity? Are you a member of the California Republican Party, which has a platform approving of all forms of energy, including fossil fuel (oil)? Do you work for a gas station, an oil company, have your written a letter to the editor in favor of oil drilling?” asked Mr. Frank in a May 31 post.“If so, you could find yourself with being charged in a court of law, thanks to SB 1161,” Mr. Frank said.California Attorney General Kamala Harris belongs to a coalition of 17 state attorneys general that joined forces in March to pursue climate-change skeptics, starting with ExxonMobil.The bill declares that there is no legitimate disagreement on the causes and extent of climate change, stating that, “There is broad scientific consensus that anthropogenic global warming is occurring and changing the world’s climate patterns, and that the primary cause is the emission of greenhouse gases from the production and combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas.” Read the whole thing...

Let us explain.Thirty years ago, Pat Nixon caught Donald Trump on Phil Donahue’s TV show — because of course she did — and she was very impressed with what she saw. So impressed that her husband, the former president, went out of his way to write the young tycoon a note .In 1987, the Nixons predicted @realDonaldTrump would win whenever he ran for office. Photo courtesy @nixonfoundation #PresidentElectTrump pic.twitter.com/hICGWZL6MJ— Archives Foundation (@archivesfdn) November 9, 2016In typical Nixon fashion, he begins by saying that he didn’t actually see anything.“I did not see the program,” wrote Nixon. “But Mrs. Nixon told me you were great.”Then a bit of friendly encouragement:As you can imagine, she is an expert on politics and she predicts that whenever you decide to run for office, you will be a winner!In a Trumpian flourish, Nixon underlines “great” with a pen — though come to think of it, Trump might have done that one himself.At least now we can stop blaming Obama and his White House Correspondents’ Dinner speech for spurring on Trump to run.Sources

Similarly, the population of those whose families came from Africa stands at around 750,000, a 46 percent increase since 2011.TRENDING: Former Today Show Staffer Comes Clean on Disturbing Lauer EncounterAbout 1 million of those migrants from the Middle East or Africa arrived in Germany as part of the wave of refugees in 2015 and 2016.Meanwhile, and potentially entirely unrelated … the U.K. Daily Mail just reported on a substantial rise in cases of bestiality within Germany over the same time period, so much so that “animal brothels” have actually become a thing.Advertisement - story continues belowYes, you read that correctly — bestiality , also known as zoophilia, the practice of humans having sexual relations with animals, is a growing trend and “lifestyle choice” in the prominent central European nation.A livestock protection and animal welfare officer named Madeleine Martin is now warning government officials that laws must be put in place to stop the rapid spread of these brothels that allow and encourage people to have sex with animals.As an example of the growing trend, Martin pointed to a particular farmer with a flock of sheep who noticed that his animals had become increasingly skittish around people.The farmer had surveillance cameras installed on his property, and lo and behold, caught several men entering his barn at night to engage sexually with his flock.Advertisement - story continues belowMartin stressed that this was but one example of many similar cases she has compiled all across the country, and she wants the government to do something about it.It is worth noting that bestiality was once illegal in Germany, but the law banning it was dropped from the books in 1969.RELATED: Student Kneels for Pledge…Then Gets First-Hand Lesson in CivicsThere had been talk in 2016 of reinstating the ban, but Martin is done with mere talking and is demanding that changes be made to the national Animal Protection Code to do just that — protect the animals from abuse by sexually deviant people.The chairman of the agricultural committee, Hans Michael-Goldman, said changes could be made in the laws to forbid the use of animals “for individual sexual acts and to outlaw people ‘pimping’ creatures to others for sexual use,” which would effectively ban the “animal brothels” or “erotic zoos,” as some call them.Advertisement - story continues belowViolation of the newly proposed ban would likely result in a fine equivalent to more than $30,000 for a first offense, increasing thereafter. Of course, proponents of bestiality have vowed to fight any ban with legal challenges of their own, so we will have see how that plays out in court.H/T DangerousPlease share this story on Facebook and Twitter to spread the word about the significant increase in bestiality and “animal brothels” in Germany — occurring at the same time the country has seen a vast influx of migrants and refugees.What do you think of the rise of bestiality in Germany?

https://www.snopes.com/federal-judge-rule-police-can-legally-shoot-kill-dogs/	Did a Federal Judge Rule Police Can Legally Shoot and Kill Dogs?	mixture	['cops shooting dogs', ' dogington post', ' fourth amendent', ' legal for cops to shoot dogs']	http://www.dogingtonpost.com/	http://www.dogingtonpost.com/federal-court-ruling-police-can-shoot-a-dog-if-it-moves-or-barks-when-officers-enter-a-home/	2016/12/28	b'19749SHARESFacebookTwitterSubscribeA ruling by the 6th Circuit Federal Court in Michigan last week gave police nationwide the authority to shoot a dog if it moves or barks when officers enter a home.The decision stems from a 2013 incident in Michigan where police shot and killed two dogs while executing a search warrant looking for drugs inside the home of Mark and Cheryl Brown. Following the incident, the Browns filed a petition with the court to hold the officers and city of Battle Creek responsible for the deaths of their dogs.One officer testified that he shot the first dog after it had only moved a few inches in a movement that he considered to be a lunge. The dog then ran away from the officer to the basement, where it was shot again and killed.The second dog was shot in the Browns basement after it was simply barking at the police, court documents said. The officer testified that after he shot and killed the first dog, he noticed the second dog standing about halfway across the basement, the courts opinion explained. The second dog was not moving towards the officers when they discovered her in the basement, but rather she was just standing there, barking and was turned sideways to the officers. The same officer shot the dog twice before a second officer didnt want to see it suffer, so he put her out of her misery and fired the last shot, killing her.Given the totality of the circumstances and viewed from the perspective of an objectively reasonable officer, the dog poses an imminent threat to the officers safety, Judge Eric Clay wrote in the decision.  The standard we set out today is that a police officers use of deadly force against a dog while executing a search warrant to search a home for illegal drug activity is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment when...the dog poses an imminent threat to the officers safety.According to court documents (below), the ruling allows for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments.View the court documents here:Court documents noted that the officers were aware, by a Beware of Dogs sign posted outside the home, verbally from the dogs owner, and by personally witnessing the dogs through a window before entering, that at least two dogs were present inside the home.According to court documents, federal courts have also ruled that the unreasonable killing of a dog does constitute a destruction of property under the Fourth Amendment.Still, in this case, the court sided with the officers.19749SHARESFacebookTwitterSubscribeRelated Items:battle creek police vs. mark brown, cops shooting dogs, featured, federal court rules police can shoot dogs that barkRecommended for you  Kids Playing with Phone Dial 911, Marinette Police Officer Shows Up & Shoots Their Dog  Deputy Shot Family Dog While Delivering Protection Order to Wrong Address  Police Shoot, Kill Puppy While Serving Warrant at Neighbors House 39 Comments39 Comments Pingback: Two Dogs Shot - This is Terrible... - PupBuzz Karen Wainwright Jan 17, 2017 at 9:30 pm Nine year dog bite study results:**Lethal dog bites count for 1/1000th of 1% of deaths.(There are roughly 70-80 million dogs in the USA and about 320 million people.

Is this the new acceptable Police brutality, now that theyve been called out too much for their treatment of minorities?These officers are the type of trigger happy guys that escalate situations and put everyone at risk.

Its a dogs nature to protect. What dog ISNT going to move it bark when a stranger comes into their home? This needs to be challenged. I understand the safety of the police is important but this is absurd. Police killing pets that arent even aggressive has gotten out of control.Reply kathy Dec 31, 2016 at 12:47 am maybe officer training needs to include something on learning the body language of dogs to determine if the dog is just barking or means to attack. And what would happen if a 5/6 yr. old kid grabbed a pair of scissors and ran at the officers yelling at them? would the officer shoot the kid? After all its a threatReply Kathy P Dec 30, 2016 at 3:19 pm This is WRONG and a crime! To me, this amounts to the murder of a family member. That would be like saying a citizen could shoot a K9 officer, if he/she barked. Both the furry family member and the K9 officer are doing what they would do naturally. Surely this ruling can be retracted. Who would come up with such a heinous idea?Reply Natasha Dec 30, 2016 at 2:05 pm Absolutely despicable! Id like to shoot the officers who did that!Reply Melissa Glenn Dec 30, 2016 at 1:52 pm These kind of killings of dogs is outrageous. If cops are so afraid to deal with dogs non-lethally then they should call animal control before entering the premises. This is just bad training on the police forces part and there are many other ways a police officer could have dealt with this. These kind of killings show what these types of police officers are ... SAVAGES!!! Just because they hold a badge doesnt make them any different than felony animal abusers.Reply Joan Dec 30, 2016 at 12:02 pm Another example of complete broken society! Every time an officer is called to action there should be an officer with skills to keep within the the law using common sense to protect all involved. Killing dogs just to relieve any obstacle is so wrong. Children may be in the home and if so, they will be trying to protect thier pet. And the pet is there to protect the fsmily. This law is inhumane and stupid. Using the word STUPID is the only word that describes this law. Dumb would be another word to use!!!!Reply Ken Burritt Dec 30, 2016 at 10:35 am That just enabled every evil, trigger happy cop to needlessly execute non threatening dogs. What a travesty of justice.Reply Tammy Wellock Dec 30, 2016 at 8:40 am Tjis cant happen again. A petition needs started and signed by the masses against this action, the judges decision and that animals have rights! They were murdered in their own home with plenty of knowkwedgr the dogs were in the house before entering and liking them. This is a classic example of cops who love to kill and give good cops a bad name. They are dangerous men who have no business wearing a badge and carrying a gun!!Reply Susan Dec 29, 2016 at 11:36 am I have registered my dogs because they are service dogs with my local police department . If they come to my house I can guarantee its my accident or for a medical emergency . None the less if its a police offficer, fireman, or EMT I do not want them to have a fear of my ver large dogs I want them to know they may bark but they are friendly and will take your commands . And most importantly will go to a room were they can close them into a room where all will be safe.. I go out at every chance for the fireman, EMT and the Policeman to meet my guys at all community activities.Reply JP Dec 29, 2016 at 9:56 am This is absolutely the most ridiculous law! Dogs get excited and protective when people they dont know enter their house. To say its ok for an office to shoot a dog for barking, is saying its ok to shoot a dog for simply being a dog. The broad sense of this law pretty much gives police the ability to shoot a dog at will after entering anyones house because a normal dog will likely bark and/or run to see who it is. This needs to be changed immediately!ReplyPingback: Did a Federal Judge Rule Police Can Legally Shoot and Kill Dogs?  snopes.com Robelle Dec 28, 2016 at 8:58 pm My dog has 2 teeth left and is barely two inches off of the floor. He barks at everyone he doesnt know. To him, he is just protecting me and the home he lives in when his previous owners neglected him and left him alone. By the time we got him, he was terrified of everybody and was skin and bone. Any stranger who appears as a threat to him would be barked at. This is a ridiculous court ruling.Reply Sandie Abel Dec 29, 2016 at 8:45 am Cops are supposed to serve and respect. Most of them do.

My dog is family and I would not want her shot simply by barking, she is just doing her job by alerting me that someone is near.Reply Dee Dec 27, 2016 at 11:47 pm I am a law abiding citizen. How does this happen? We have lost control. For one judge to put this into law, says a great deal. The only thing a law like this will lead to is anger and civil unrest. Its not just the lack of common sense, its the shear arrogance. Whats next?Reply Nancy Sellars Dec 27, 2016 at 10:30 pm This new law is so wrong. I am completely dumbfounded by it. All the officers have to do is use common sense. If there is a sign saying Beware of dog then proceed at your own risk OR call out, announcing your presence. If a dog rushes at you, again call out. And killing a dog on a leash or tether is just plain stupid! Why would you do that? Use COMMON SENSE! Stop murdering our dogs.Reply Dustina Dec 27, 2016 at 4:27 pm I am blind and my dog is a guide dog and he cost $60,000. If the place where the sheriff come to my house to issue divorce papers and my dog barks nearly to alert me that there is someone at the door and I opened it with the police officer shoot my Dog? Please officers arrest people who shoot their service dog and issues jail sentences up to 40 years, can I have them arrested and them sentenced to prison for 40 years for shooting my service dog?Reply K9 Dec 27, 2016 at 12:13 pm Your all right this entire thing is Bullshit, it is bey6ond me when animal have been elevated to the same level as humans and in some cases beyond. Were there children in the house, how about older people who were being neglected? Nobody even considered that there was a legal search warrant to drug issued. Everyone said that dogs just bark, can you tie the two together. Dogs in a suspect drug house, wonder why, while it isnt the dogs fault that they were there it certainly isnt outside of the realm of possibility the dogs were there as a warning for those who were strongly suspected of doing illegal activities, strongly enough for a search warrant to issued. I am amazed that people are willing to even consider dying, and leaving, leaving all the people who love them and that they love to saw and animal or to even consider the though of killing another human because they have killed an animal. If police had said lets just have open season on dogs and start shooting them randomly then that is one thing. However I am willing to bet that these were not lap dogs, they were in a house that was a suspected drug den people, I am will to bet that they were not golden retrievers or a St. Bernard, for those of you who didnt read the entire court ruling they were pit bulls, and belonged to a know gang member. While pit bulls can be a highly faithful and family friendly breed when purchased from a reputable breeder, I highly doubt that these were of that pedigreed. Common sense should tell you that these dogs were not family pets. The were there for one thing and that isnt to protect that family, they were there to protect drugs. All the dogs in the world are not worth one human life. Dogs can be great companions and add a lot to the lives of their owners but dont kid yourself into thinking that that was the reasons these dogs were around. Also consider that these dogs were shot in the LAWFUL search of a know gang members/drug dealers house. If you dont put YOUR dogs in a criminal situation then YOU wont have to worry about police shooting them.Reply Cheryl Dec 27, 2016 at 2:47 pm That is basically what this IS. SHOOT FIRST ask questions later. You can taze a charging dog just like an unarmed person.You come into my house and murder my dog, Im shooting back.Reply Linda Dec 27, 2016 at 5:36 pm K9- what about the family dog that was killed when the police entered the house with a search warrant- BUT IT WAS THE WRONG HOUSE! (It has happened.) Police officers need to use common sense. A dog will bark- as everyone has said and police should know that. I am also pro-police, but I am not for murdering animals because they bark. This is one of the reasons police get a bad rap by so many people- their indiscriminate shooting of living things.Reply diana Dec 28, 2016 at 12:04 am From my understanding thus was a wrong addressReply Ash Dec 27, 2016 at 10:44 am Dont worry everyone. As humans we are going to be extinct soon because of law makers like these judges. Soon there will be a law that if you fart or even make a micro expression on your face for a fart, in front of a cop then you will be shot in your head. So take care with your dog and also the fart. Stupid and ridiculous law.Reply James Snow Dec 26, 2016 at 11:18 pm If a police officer shot my dog no matter what the reason, he best find a new home off planet earth, because I am not resting in this life until i do the same to him. I would not think twice, I would not even think about it, I would do him in the same manner. No remorse no way would I ever let that go on answered.Reply Paul and Ella Craddock Dec 27, 2016 at 3:58 pm I feel the same toward this stupid shit. I (Ella) retired Police Officer wouldnt want this Bullshit law. They are only trying to get more Police Officers killed. President Trump needs to get this reversed. Probably Obama stirring more problems before he goes out or he wouldnt have let this happen.Ella CReply Mike Dec 26, 2016 at 8:33 pm Ask some Law Enforcement K-9 units to see this as an acceptable procedure.Every year pet owners, worldwide, spend billions of dollars. This judge should consider the revenue from taxes, jobs created, license fees, and veterinarian services. Add to it service dogs for the blind, emotionally, physically handicapped. Rescue K-9 units, drug sniffers, bomb sniffersWhat we need is, less decision makers like this judge and some sensible use of deadly force protocols.To expect any dog, which most responsible pet owners consider a family member, to be still and not bark when a stranger enters their residence is ridiculous. It goes against the very nature of canine behavior.Reply Brenda Dec 26, 2016 at 4:46 pm Are they frigging kidding me my dogs bark if someone comes near my house or comes in...this law is redicilous. Oh my a dog barking scares the big bad cops with guns. Watch how many family pets die now. If these dogs dont attack why are the big bad cops afraid . Any excuse for them to pull the trigger.Reply Shana Hendrickson Dec 26, 2016 at 2:46 pm What is wrong with these people??? Whoever pulls a trigger in the direction of my dogs better be prepared to do the same to me. I would protect them to the same extent they would for me, and if TPB do not understand that, we need people making decisions who have some level of humanity.

https://www.snopes.com/putting-coin-top-cup-ice-accurately-tell-freezer-lost-power/	Does a Coin in a Cup of Ice Accurately Tell You If Your Freezer Lost Power?	mfalse	['freezer', ' home remedies', ' ice', ' life hacks', ' power outage', ' questionable life hacks']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/YvIlX	2017/10/19	..For those of you that are evacuating from the coast, I just heard a great tip. It's called the one cup tip. You put a cup of water in your freezer. Freeze it solid and then put a quarter on top of it and leave it in your freezer. That way when you come back after you've been evacuated you can tell if your food went completely bad and just refroze or if it stayed Frozen while you were gone. If the quarter has fallen to the bottom of the cup that means all the food defrosted and you should throw it out. But if the quarter is either on the top or in the middle of the cup then your food may still be ok. It would also be a great idea to leave this in your freezer all the time and if you lose power for any reason you will have this tip to fall back on. If you don't feel good about your food, just throw it out. The main thing is for all to be safe. Please SHARE this on your page.

https://www.snopes.com/united-airlines-begin-charging-use-overhead-storage/	United Airlines to Begin Charging for Use of Overhead Storage?	mfalse	['baggage fees', ' misleading', ' overhead bins', ' travel', ' united airlines']	https://www.washingtonpost.com/	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/12/06/no-more-free-overhead-bin-on-united-is-a-fee-for-oxygen-next/?utm_term=.c27871aafcf6	2016/12/07	By Samantha Schmidt By Samantha Schmidt Email the author December 6, 2016 Email the author Follow @schmidtsam7(iStock)Gone are the days of the free sandwiches, the complimentary pillows, the headphones that didn’t cost $5. The in-flight comforts that were once a given are now nothing more than a nostalgic reminder of decades past.Out went the free checked bag, in came the fees for those few extra inches of leg room. Want to make sure you sit next to your children on a flight? On some airlines, there’s a fee for that.Now, on United Airlines, you won’t necessarily get the use of an overhead bin without paying more money.The overhead bin: “one of the last sacred conveniences of air travel,” as an angry Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) put it Sunday as he denounced the move.Of course, the airlines, when they come up with a new fee for something that was once free, always say that’s not what they’re doing. They’re just creating a fare tier that does not include it.As part of the company’s new pricing tier, Basic Economy , passengers who purchase the airline’s cheapest fares will only be allowed one personal item that must fit under a seat. Additionally, customers will not be assigned seats until the day of departure, meaning people on the same ticket could be separated.The move marks the first time a large U.S. airline limits low-fare customers to one carry-on bag that fits under a seat, Reuters reported. The company expects such fare initiatives to add $1 billion to its annual operating income by 2020, as more customers pay to check luggage or select higher fares for two carry-on bags.Of course, next to cable providers, airlines are the companies Americans love the most to hate. Many on Twitter saw United’s new tier as a mere invention.And the constant nickel-and-diming has led passengers to ask: What will airlines begin to charge for next? Cushions? Oxygen masks?“Maybe it will be extra for sitting soon,” tweeted one disgruntled flyer.“Seriously!?! When will it end?” said Sandra Cochrane. “Which airline will join next?”From  WHO radio:  “How long before we have to pay for oxygen? Discuss.”United Airlines to charge to use overhead bins on flights. How long before we have to pay for oxygen? Discuss. https://t.co/mRfcvn6O1b— WHO Radio (@WHORadio) November 21, 2016“We need to boycott United Airlines,” tweeted a woman identifying herself as Sandra Lespinasse.Schumer called the proposed fare structure “one of the most restrictive policies on airline passengers we have seen in a long time.”“The overhead bin is one of the last sacred conveniences of air travel and the fact that United Airlines — and potentially others — plan to take that convenience away unless you pay up is really troubling,” Schumer wrote. “It seems like each year, airlines devise a new, ill-conceived plan to hit consumers and it has simply got to stop.”@united Airlines will charge for use of overhead bins? Also counting fillings and dentures as personal items (JK). https://t.co/KHqv8zBXge— Carl Hegelman (@Wmboot) November 18, 2016So United Airlines will be charging for overhead bins. Hope they charge for restroom passes and library fees 4 reading SkyMall catalog too.— James Thomsen (@JamesBThomsen) November 17, 2016The clamor sent United Airlines marketers into a frenzy, responding to frustrated customers on Twitter to clarify the policy. The phrase “We are not charging a fee for overhead bin space” was repeated dozens of times on the airline’s account in response to complaints.@daliacapellan No. Again, we are not charging a fee for overhead bin space for Basic Economy. If you'd like overheads, purchase regular. ^TY— United (@united) December 6, 2016United explained that this is all for the benefit of passengers. United’s President Scott Kirby told Reuters that surveys indicated travelers and employees do not like scrambling to store carry-on bags in the limited overhead bins.The purpose of the new fare structure is to create more options for customers, according to the company’s website. The new fares, which will be comparable to the low fares the airline now charges for economy cabin, will begin selling in the first quarter of 2017 for travel starting in the second quarter, according to Reuters.It was not immediately clear whether United’s announcement would prompt rivals to make similar moves. Airlines have previously copied each other on pricing strategies, such as adding fees for checked luggage.For some, the announcement called for a new approach to flying: Wear plenty of layers.I will be wearing everything for the trip … 4 pairs of socks lots of underware 3 pairs of pants shirts… https://t.co/RcVy0iOHzU— Rich Miller (@MillerTimeCars) December 6, 2016More from Morning Mix

https://www.snopes.com/holistic-doctor-death-conspiracy/	Have Sixty Holistic Doctors Died Suspicious Deaths in the Past Year?	false	['']	https://web.archive.org/	https://web.archive.org/web/20141203112241/http://drbradstreet.org/2012/05/17/a-real-life-changing-experience-for-a-child-with-autism/	2017/05/03	May 17, 2012 4 CommentsI am in the process of preparing the data on the first several hundred children I have observed with GcMAF therapy for elevated nagalase activity.  The preliminary data is extraordinary. But not everyone who thinks they understand GcMAF therapy gets it. Many are using hugely too much and hurting children in the process. Please don’t overdose the children – if you are using the right GcMAF it takes very little to help. Our process involves homeopathic activation using classical techniques.  And when our techniques are used properly this is what we are hearing from the families so often.Dear Dr. Bradstreet,What has happened to my child? Could it be that it was only a few months ago that my little boy preferred sitting alone at the computer or lining up toy cars and planets in his room? It seems like it’s been a lifetime. Now, I look at my happy, interactive, responsive, 6 year-old child with amazement.“J” began using GcMAF since 27 weeks ago and we noticed changes for the better almost out of the starting gate. Only 3 weeks in, my son asked to ride his bike. My husband and I looked at each other with dread. Unfortunately, in the recent past it took all three of us to make that bike go. My husband and I would use our hands to push his feet on the pedals while one of us attempted to steer. It was a backbreaking ordeal. Our son just couldn’t coordinate the mechanics of it. But, not this time…he jumped on that bike and rode all over the neighborhood. We couldn’t believe our eyes. Could it be the GcMAF? We just weren’t sure.The IEP meeting was scheduled. We were just 4 weeks into the new school year and 4 weeks into using GcMAF. The teacher presented me with written work from the beginning of the year, then placed Jayden’s most recent work alongside it. Surely, it was from two different children. The earlier writing was erratic, with one letter written over top of the other, it was disproportionate, and trailed sloppily down the edge of the page. His recent work was neat, orderly, and consistently sized. It was even on the line. The teacher started gushing about his performance. He was starting to read and was learning full curriculum kindergarten academics. He was specifically excelling in math. Everyone around the conference table verbally gave each other a high-five for their achievement. “Now hold on,” I interrupted, “the success must primarily be attributed to the biomedical approach and the diet that we’ve implemented.” I gave them a brief explanation and we left the meeting feeling excited for what the future might hold.It was not a steady climb up the staircase, however. We experienced some regression following dental surgery, but quickly got back on track (by resuming GcMAF).Previously, I had a difficult time getting my son to respond when I called out his name. He would run out into the street without looking, if I didn’t stop him. He was able to parrot back canned answers to rehearsed questions. Now, here we are, 6 months later, and my son’s cognition has exploded. He laughs at jokes and is able to tell his own. He has started to ask and answer questions cognitively. He initiates and organizes the family during playtime activities. Recently, while in the pool, he touched his Dad’s hair and said, “Nice haircut, Dad.” At breakfast, after drinking his juice he asked, “Was that mango juice? I wanted pear juice.” The morning after I went to see a show he awoke and said, “Good morning Mommy. How was the show?” Just 2 months ago, a van from a local karate school brought children to the playground that we were at. My son was excited to play and ran over to a boy and gave him a two-handed chest shove. I apologized and quickly led him away before he got a karate chop. Just last week, we went back to that same playground. I watched nervously as “J” ran over to a group of three boys. I heard him say, “Come on guys, let’s play. Chase me!” And, you know what…they did! My boy led this group of “normal” boys all over that playground. One of the boys asked him what was his name. He told him, “My name is J***.” As I glanced around at the other parents scattered about the playground I wondered if I was the only one there who saw a miracle that day.My son did experience some symptoms while using GcMAF. There was occasional regressive stimming, a rare fever up to 102, a few shooting head pains with sensitivity to light that lasted for only a few seconds, and he was often tired. But, those symptoms were easily lost in the shadows of the exceptional gains that we were experiencing.The best part about GcMAF is that Jayden now frequently and spontaneously speaks those words, that for years, I’d longed to hear, “I love you, Mommy.” And, if that’s not a good enough reason to stick your kid with a needle 27 times, I don’t know what is.Dr. Bradstreet, there are no words adequate enough to express my sincere and heartfelt appreciation for everything that you’ve done for “J”. Thank you for including us in your personal journey of discovery and healing. God bless you and your family.Sincerely,Dr. Bradstreet’s #1 FanShare this:
https://www.snopes.com/mothman-returns-to-point-pleasant-west-virginia/	‘Mothman’ Returns to Point Pleasant, West Virginia?	unproven	['mothman', ' point pleasant', ' unidentified flying objects', ' west virginia']	http://urbanlegendsonline.com/	http://urbanlegendsonline.com/mothman/	2016/11/25	Mothmanby storyteller · August 8, 2012Mothman is described as a man sized, or larger, creature with glowing red eyes and wings of a moth. It may have eyes set in his chest. It is described as a 7-foot-tall (2.1 m) creature, with long wings and huge red eyes. It possesses an unusual shriek.On November 15, 1966, two young couples from Point Pleasant, Roger and Linda Scarberry, and Steve and Mary Mallette, along with their young cousin, Lonnie Button, were traveling late at night in the Scarberrys’ car. They were passing the West Virginia Ordnance Works, an abandoned World War II TNT factory, about seven miles north of Point Pleasant, in the 2,500 acre (10 km²) McClintic Wildlife Management Area, when they noticed two red lights in the shadows by an old generator plant near the factory gate. They stopped the car, and reportedly discovered that the lights were the glowing red eyes of a large animal, “shaped like a man, but bigger, maybe six and a half or seven feet tall, with big win gs folded against its back,” according to Roger Scarberry. Terrified, they drove toward Route 62, where the creature supposedly chased them at speeds exceeding 100 miles per hour.A Mothman sighting was again reported on January 11, 1967, hovering over the town’s bridge, and several other times that same year. Fewer sightings of the Mothman were reported after the collapse of the town’s bridge, the Silver Bridge, when 46 people died. The Silver Bridge, so named for its aluminium paint, was an eyebar chain suspension bridge that connected the cities of Point Pleasant, West Virginia, and Gallipolis, Ohio, over the Ohio River. The bridge was built in 1928, and it collapsed on December 15, 1967. Investigation of the bridge wreckage pointed to the failure of a single eye-bar in a suspension chain due to a small manufacturing flaw. There are rumors that the Mothman appears before upcoming disasters and seems to try to warn people of them. Mothman was never again seen in Point Pleasant after the demolition of the Silver Bridge.John Lepper from New YorkAnother VersionOriginal PostThe Mothman is a creature reported in the Charleston and Point Pleasant areas of West Virginia between November 12, 1966, and December 1967. It’s described as a winged, man-sized creature with large reflective red eyes and large moth-like wings. Sometimes it appeared to have no head, with its eyes set into its chest.On November 15, 1966, two young, married couples from Point Pleasant, David and Linda Scarberry and Steve and Mary Mallette, were traveling late at night in the Scarberrys’ car. They were passing the West Virginia Ordnance Works, an abandoned World War II TNT factory, about seven miles north from Point Pleasant, in the 2,500 acre  McClintic Wildlife Station, when they noticed two red lights in the shadows by an old generator plant near the factory gate. They stopped the car, and reportedly discovered that the lights were the glowing red eyes of a large animal, “shaped like a man, but bigger, maybe six and a half or seven feet tall, with big wings folded against its back”, according to Roger Scarberry. Terrified, they drove toward Route 62, where the creature supposedly chased them at speeds exceeding 100 miles per hour. However, as quoted in Keel’s The Mothman Prophecies, the Scarberrys, despite driving more than 100 miles per hour, claimed to have noticed a dead dog on the side of the road, and in fact made such accurate note of its location that they claimed to have gone back the very next day and looked for it. Explanations for how they were able to make so accurate a mental note at a time of such great distress, or why they would go back to look for the dead dog, are not included in Keel’s book.The following night, on November 16, several armed townspeople combed the area around the TNT plant for signs of Mothman. Mr. and Mrs. Raymond Wamsley, and Mrs. Marcella Bennett, with her infant daughter Teena in tow, were in a car en-route to visit their friends, Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Thomas, who lived in a bungalow among the “igloos” (concrete dome-shaped dynamite storage structures erected during WW-II) near the TNT plant. The igloos were now empty, some owned by the county, others by companies intending to use them for storage. They were heading back to their car when a figure appeared behind their parked vehicle. Mrs. Bennett said that it seemed like it had been lying down, slowly rising up from the ground, large and gray, with glowing red eyes. While Wamsley phoned the police, the creature walked onto the porch and peered in at them through the window.On November 24, four people allegedly saw the creature flying over the TNT area. On the morning of November 25, Thomas Ury, who was driving along Route 62 just north of the TNT, claimed to have seen the creature standing in a field, and then it spread its wings and flew alongside his car as he sped toward the Point Pleasant sheriff’s office.On November 26, Mrs. Ruth Foster of Charleston, West Virginia reportedly saw Mothman standing on her front lawn, but the creature was gone by the time her brother-in-law went out to investigate. Further, on the morning of November 27, the creature allegedly pursued a young woman near Mason, West Virginia, and was reported again in St. Albans the same night, by two children.A Mothman sighting was again reported on January 11, 1967, and several other times that same year. Fewer sightings of the Mothman were reported after the collapse of the Silver Bridge, when 46 people died. The Silver Bridge, so named for its aluminumn paint, was an eyebar chain suspension bridge that connected the cities of Point Pleasant, West Virginia and Kanauga, Ohio over the Ohio River. The bridge was built in 1928, and it collapsed on December 15, 1967. Investigation of the bridge wreckage pointed to the failure of a single eye-bar in a suspension chain due to a small manufacturing flaw. There are rumors that the Mothman appears before upcoming disasters, or that the Mothman causes disasters.Share this:

USA TODAYFernley City Council is discussing allowing a medical marijuana dispensary in the city.(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORETwo poison control doctors claim to have documented the first known case of death by marijuana overdose , sparking a medical debate over what killed an 11-month-old baby in Colorado two years ago.The case report was published in the journal Clinical Practice and Cases in Emergency Medicine and is co-authored by a pair of doctors at the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center, which is housed at Denver Health.The doctors behind the case report, Doctors Thomas Nappe and Christopher Hoyte, worked on the baby’s care as part of their duties at the regional poison control center. They claim that damage to the child’s heart muscle, which was listed as the boy’s cause of death, was brought on by ingesting marijuana. This is the first news story in which either of the doctors publicly discussed the case that was published in a medical journal in March of this year.More: Nevada pot sales reach $32.4M in August, higher than July“The only thing that we found was marijuana. High concentrations of marijuana in his blood. And that’s the only thing we found,” Hoyte said. “The kid never really got better. And just one thing led to another and the kid ended up with a heart stopped. And the kid stopped breathing and died.”The case report makes what amounts to a very bold statement in the scientific world, “As of this writing, this is the first reported pediatric death associated with cannabis exposure.”If correct, the phenomenon Dr. Hoyte claims to have documented would remain the only time a marijuana overdose is known to have caused a human death.Other doctors are deeply skeptical of the strong language used in the report.CLOSESince Nevada legalized recreational marijuana, anyone 21 and over can possess up to 1 ounce in-state. How many people actually could look at an ounce and identify it, though? We're here to help educate you. Jenny Kane/RGJ“That statement is too much. It’s too much as far as I’m concerned,” said Dr. Noah Kaufman, an emergency medicine specialist based in Northern Colorado. “Because that is saying confidently that this is the first case. ‘We’ve got one!’ And I still disagree with that.”It’s widely accepted as fact that marijuana overdoses are not fatal. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration fact sheet on pot says simply that “no death from overdose of marijuana has been reported” and the National Institutes of Health says there is “insufficient evidence” to link THC overdose to fatalities.The claim that an overdose death happened in Colorado has the potential to change the way people think about the steady march toward marijuana legalization in the U.S.The controversyBoth published accounts of this case clearly state that the autopsy shows that the 11-month-old boy died of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) which caused the heart to fail.The Nappe/Hoyte published case study takes the diagnosis a step further, theorizing that the myocarditis was caused by cannabis overdose, which then caused the baby boy’s heart to fail.That diagnosis of this heart condition is at the core of the medical debate over this case study. Myocarditis is rare in children, and can often be fatal when diagnosed. In children, fatal myocarditis is usually caused by a virus called Coxsackievirus. The authors of the case report say that virus was ruled out in this case.CLOSEA recent poll says Americans believe marijuana is less harmful than opioids in pain relief, but are less comfortable with its use by children and pregnant women for medical conditions. WochitMyocarditis has a long list of other known causes, mostly from infections by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites.“We extensively ruled out almost every other cause that we can think of,” Dr. Hoyte said. “Myself, our team, plus the primary team taking care of the patient, plus the coroner who did the post-mortem on the child. And we found no other reason why this young kid ended up having inflammation on his heart.”Drs. Hoyte and Nappe both worked on the case as physicians on staff at the poison control center.More: New 'Potcast' to dive into how marijuana legalization is changing AmericaWe do not know if this case has led to a criminal investigation. Hoyte and Nappe declined to share the identity of the deceased child or even the name of the hospital in Colorado where the death took place, for fear of revealing his identity. They report finding a “high concentration” of THC (the psychoactive drug found in marijuana) in the child’s urine and blood. Short of that, they have no evidence that explains the child’s death. “We just wanted to make sure that we’re not going to call this a marijuana-related fatality if there was something else that we could point at. And we looked and looked and couldn’t find it,” Hoyte said.Their case report points to other research that shows myocarditis as a symptom associated with THC consumption, but those cases involved the presence of other drugs and do not propose a mechanism by which marijuana might bring on myocarditis.None of those cases involved fatalities.This hints at a scientific limitation of this study. The doctors don’t have a proof-positive way to demonstrate that marijuana caused the death in this 2015 case.What they can do is demonstrate a presence of marijuana in the boy’s system, and that they ruled out a lot of other possible explanations for his death.“The child didn’t leave the house between being normal and being sick. The child had THC in the blood and in the urine and there were marijuana products in the house,” Hoyte said. “I feel very comfortable with the workup that we did and how much we ruled out in this particular case.”This conclusion leaves other doctors curious, but skeptical that this truly is the world’s first documented death by marijuana overdose.This child’s death in 2015 was previously noted in a 2016 paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association — Pediatrics. In that paper, written by Dr. George Wang of Children’s Hospital Colorado, said that marijuana could not be determined as the cause of myocarditis in this case. However, Dr. Wang says that his study focused on a wider review of years of data and not the relationship between this type of heart problem and evidence of marijuana found in that boy’s system.Multiple ER doctors and medical researchers were interviewed for this story. Many praised the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center as a top-tier institution for researching the issue, but none accepted this case as bulletproof evidence of a marijuana overdose death, though some were more open to the idea than others. One spoke on the record.“I’m going to have to call ‘BS’ on this one,” Kaufman said. “I’m not saying that it’s not. But I think it’s a pretty big leap to say that it is.”Other possible causesWhile the study notes that the child tested positive for marijuana and that his case involved “an unstable motel-living situation and parental admission of drug possession, including cannabis,” the doctors admit in their published report, the myocarditis could have been caused by something doctors can’t test for. “A lot of the times [the cause of myocarditis is] infectious. Or unknown,” Hoyte said.Dr. Kaufman agrees about the number of unknown causes of myocarditis.“[Hoyte] may be pretty confident,” Kaufman said, “But I’m not. I think that it’s more likely that there’s not a relationship.” “There’s so many things that cause the problem that this poor baby had, that we’re not even close to saying it was definitively a marijuana overdose,” Kaufman added. “Allergies can cause this. What if the kiddo was allergic to the carnauba wax, or whatever is in the gummy that’s not the marijuana?”Kaufman also points out that there are thousands of known cases of accidental ingestion of marijuana by kids of all ages and while symptoms can be bad, none of those cases have proven fatal. To him, that suggests there may be some other reason that a small segment of the population is more sensitive to overdose on THC than most people. The case report on this death itself is missing some key information.Hoyte and Nappe wrote that the boy ate an “unknown dose of THC,” and said they aren’t sure exactly what product was involved or precisely when he ate it. Based on the blood levels of THC metabolite they found, the doctors estimate that consumption took place 2-6 days before death.Some context and adviceDoctors on both sides of the debate agree on what parents should learn from this case. It’s the same advice they’ve given since marijuana first became legal in Colorado: keep it away from kids. “Even if I’m not convinced that it could kill your kid, you need to be really careful because it could make them really sick,” Dr. Kaufman said. “It needs to be locked up away in a medicine chest because it can cause seizures. It can cause real big problems in kids that can lead to other problems.”Concerned parents can also learn the warning signs for marijuana ingestion, which include lack of balance, unusual and sudden sleepiness, and breathing difficulty, according to Children’s Hospital Colorado.Hoyte and Nappe report that this baby displayed those symptoms for a day or so before he had a seizure and went to the ER.Colorado has taken recent steps aimed at preventing accidental ingestion by children. In the years since legalization, the state has imposed new restrictions on the potency and design of edible marijuana products. New rules that took effect last month ban edibles that resemble existing non-marijuana candies and also bans shaping edibles in the form of people, animals, or fruit. Dr. Hoyte was careful to point out that even though he does believe THC led to this death, there are plenty of more harmful substances parents also need to worry about. “We’re far more concerned about opioids in that case of a kid getting really sick than we are of marijuana,” Hoyte said.Even if Hoyte and Nappe’s determination is confirmed, it’s worth noting that we would have more confirmed deaths from swallowed laundry and dish detergent pods than from marijuana, according to poison control researchers at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.The doctors who spoke agree further study may be warranted, including animal testing, to shed more light on possible links between myocarditis and marijuana. More post-mortem studies of the heart tissue from cannabis users who pass away could also be useful, Hoyte suggested. However, he says that if he’s right, this phenomenon may be extremely rare.Cases of kids ingesting cannabis have increased since Colorado legalized the drug, but Hoyte admits pot may not be causing enough serious health complications to study these issues extensively. “We’re not getting calls from kids getting sick from marijuana or even adults getting sick from marijuana—getting sick to the point of having bad outcomes,” Hoyte said. “We’re not getting these every single day. They’re very few and far between.” Was this a rare case of marijuana death, or something else?“We may never know, really,” Kaufman said. CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://www.rgj.com/story/news/marijuana/2017/11/16/colorado-doctors-claim-baby-boy-first-marijuana-overdose-death/870700001/From The USA TODAY NETWORKThese sites are part of the USA TODAY NETWORK.

When confronted, the two men pushed their way through the crowd and ran.The issue became such a blatant betrayal of our electoral system that now it seems entire precincts could lose their ballots. One poll worker in Birmingham’s 412th told Breitbart :“We were a little bit suspicious of some of the people coming in, but they had what looked like valid IDs. We checked their pictures and signatures and they seemed to match, but let’s be honest…it can be hard to tell them apart.”She also reiterated that the reason there were no Republican poll watchers in their precinct was because they were “too afraid” to come after being told to leave their firearms at home.The FEC getting involved is a serious matter. It also means President Trump isn’t satisfied that this election went off fairly. Early in the reporting, the Moore campaign announced they had broken every voting record ever set in Alabama, yet suddenly they lose? It doesn’t make sense.We’ll keep you updated on this developing story. 
https://www.snopes.com/coil-mattresses-cause-cancer-amplifying-radio-waves/	Do Coil Mattresses Cause Cancer by Amplifying Radio Waves?	false	['joseph mercola']	https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/	https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/left-sided-cancer-blame-your-bed-and-tv/	2016/12/21	"b""Curiously, the cancer rate is 10 percent higher in the left breast than in the right. This left-side bias holds true for both men and women and it also applies to the skin cancer melanoma. Researchers Orjan Hallberg of Hallberg Independent Research in Sweden and Ollie Johansson of The Karolinska Institute in Sweden, writing in the June issue of the journal Pathophysiology, suggest a surprising explanation that not only points to a common cause for both cancers, it may change your sleeping habits.  For unknown reasons the rates of breast cancer and melanoma have both increased steadily in the last 30 years. Exposure to the sun elevates the risk of melanoma, but the sun's intensity has not changed in the last three decades. Stranger still, melanoma most commonly affects the hip, thighs and trunk, which are areas of the body protected from the sun. What is responsible for the left-side dominance and increasing incidence of these cancers?  An intriguing clue comes from the Far East. In Japan there is no correlation between the rates of melanoma and breast cancer as there is in the West, and there is no left-side prevalence for either disease. Moreover, the rate of breast cancer in Japan is significantly lower than in the West; only 3 percent of what is seen in Sweden, for example. The rate of prostate cancer in Japan is only 10 percent of that in the U.K. and U.S.  The researchers suggest an explanation based on differences in sleeping habits in Japan and Western countries. Previous research has shown that both men and women prefer to sleep on their right sides. The reasons for this general preference are unclear, but sleeping on the right side may reduce the weight stress on the heart, and the heartbeat is not as loud as when sleeping on the left. Still, there is no reason to suspect that people in Japan sleep in positions that are any different from those in the West. The beds in Japan, however, are different. The futons used for sleeping in Japan are mattresses placed directly on the bedroom floor, in contrast to the elevated box springs and mattress of beds used in the West. A link between bedroom furniture and cancer seems absurd, but this, the researchers conclude, is the answer.  The first line of evidence they cite comes from a 2007 study in Sweden conducted between 1989 and 1993 that revealed a strong link between the incidence of melanoma and the number of FM and TV transmission towers covering the area where the individuals lived. Despite epidemiological correlations like this one suggesting the possibility that electromagnetic radiation from FM and TV broadcasts stations could suppress the immune system and promote cancer, the strength of these electromagnetic fields is so feeble it has been difficult to imagine any biological basis for the correlation.  Consider, however, that even a TV set cannot respond to broadcast transmissions unless the weak electromagnetic waves are captured and amplified by an appropriately designed antenna. Antennas are simply metal objects of appropriate length sized to match the wavelength of a specific frequency of electromagnetic radiation. Just as saxophones are made in different sizes to resonate with and amplify particular wavelengths of sound, electromagnetic waves are selectively amplified by metal objects that are the same, half or one quarter of the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave of a specific frequency. Electromagnetic waves resonate on a half-wavelength antenna to create a standing wave with a peak at the middle of the antenna and a node at each end, just as when a string stretched between two points is plucked at the center. In the U.S. bed frames and box springs are made of metal, and the length of a bed is exactly half the wavelength of FM and TV transmissions that have been broadcasting since the late 1940s. In Japan most beds are not made of metal, and the TV broadcast system does not use the 87- to 108-megahertz frequency used in Western countries.  Thus, as we sleep on our coil-spring mattresses, we are in effect sleeping on an antenna that amplifies the intensity of the broadcast FM/TV radiation. Asleep on these antennas, our bodies are exposed to the amplified electromagnetic radiation for a third of our life spans. As we slumber on a metal coil-spring mattress, a wave of electromagnetic radiation envelops our bodies so that the maximum strength of the field develops 75 centimeters above the mattress in the middle of our bodies. When sleeping on the right side, the body's left side will thereby be exposed to field strength about twice as strong as what the right side absorbs.  If this study is correct, the solution is simple: Replace the metal in our beds with a nonmetallic mattress or orient your bed, like an antenna, away from the direction of the local FM/TV transmission tower. Call it high-tech feng shui if you like, but if this new study has not identified the cause of left-side cancer, it will, for some, be the cause of insomnia. ABOUT THE AUTHOR  R. Douglas Fields, Ph.

What an A S S!  You never speak to a child like that, no matter how angry or frustrated you may be by your situation or your divorce.  He’s just confirmed that he is the controlling, abusive chauvinist that I always thought he probably was behind closed doors.Do I even need to point out that it sounds like he is having great difficulty figuring out time zones?  If his set time for the call is 11, why is he yelling at her in a voicemail about it at 10:30?  The man doesn’t even make sense.And the whole “I’m going to fly out there and straighten you out” rant – sounds menacing.  The poor kid is probably terrified of her father, and with good reason. Any wonder that Kim left him?  The only pig in that family is Alec Baldwin himself.WTFHe needs anger management & parenting classes.  Who the f**k talks like that to a child.  So the kid missed a call?  she’s child you have no idea if she’s a brat or not.Alec is a prick in every situation.  Remember when Cory Lidle’s plane crash closed the street & Baldwin was screaming and ranting that he had to get through?  He’s rude at resturants.  If anyone is fat f**king pig it’s him.tanique33he messed up.  name a parent who doesn’t?  he certainly was out of line a couple of times.  but, a lot of it, was what many people get with an angry parent.  it’s not to excuse, but hopefully they can all move past it.wah!Fug – I think Alec is doing a good job of turning her against him all by himself.PS – your comment has been flagged for the beating comment.  Get some psychiatric help.cheesecakeI really don’t think he has said anything so terrible.He just sounds as if he has been treated really badly and felt really hurt and betrayed.I do think the child should have respected her father enough to answer the phone if it was prearranged.TitoliaI agree with cheesecake.jeopardy!I agree with cheesecake, this is usually what a frustrated parent would tell a child who does not do as he/she is told (as it is a prearranged call, she should know, after all, she is 11, not 5). And if Kim leaked this, then you know it is not only Alec who has issues, Kim has too. Actually, I think both Kim and Alec should never have had any children, they both seem to be using Ireland for their not-so-hidden agendas.MarieIt’s reads as thought he really has Kim Basinger in mind not his daughter. You know, people make mistakes. Why is there such an issue regarding custody of their daughter? Could they possibly hate each other more….that’s really healthy for the daughter.bdjThe transcript of the phone conversation can across as abusive and threatening.  Some celebrities seem to get a free ride or excuses galore,  while others are raked over the coals when their words are taken out of context.  Children at that age are often thoughtless, busy doing different activities or forget to charge or turn a phone on.  It happens.  It is unfortunate that this tape was released because it shows a man that can clearly get out of control.  No matter how angry a parent is, no child should be called a pig or other derogatory names.   Hopefully, Baldwin will get anger management.AlexisI agree that this no way to speak to a child but what kind of mother uses her child this way to get back at her former husband. Ireland is the victim here: her father when speaking to her forgets she’s a child and her mother is manipulative.nastyheroAnd the father (douche-bag) of the year award goes to…Alec Baldwin.  For those of you who are actually trying to rationalize his tirade towards his daughter, remember she’s only 11.  You don’t talk this way to a child ever.  I don’t give a sh*t how bad a day he might of had, his tone towards his daughter is utterly dispicable.[Fug Face [x]]of course kim leaked this, she HATES alacsparrowWhat kind of people are you posting on this board?  Can you honestly think that this kind of tirade can be justified?   The man is an ADULT, he should control his anger better.  You can discipline a child and express your displeasure without threatening the kid or calling her names.    Anyone who talks to an 11 year old this way shouldn’t have one.I don’t care how mad he was,  it’s not about HIS anger, it’s about teaching her something, and you can do that very effectively without ever raising your voice or calling her names.DThe mother is the B#$%& for all I care. She leaked that message on purpose to get back at her ex. He’s still a deranged pig though. Poor kid, she has two delisuional parents who can’t get past their differences and get along for the sake of the child. This type of situation happens all the time with “normal” folks, what’s the big deal, just because they’re famous. When was the last time either one of them did any revelant work in Hollywood. I don’t she’s been in a movie since like the 90′s or early 2000.AddictedtoBAMPZsIf it were not for the calling her a “pig”, and not being real sure how old she is (tweve? eleven?), you might feel some sympathy for Alec if you were only reading these words, not hearing them. However, the amazing power of hearing his tone, the way he surges with furry and hate, the way he repeats and repeats what he is going to do, is straight out of the Abusive Parent/ Spouse Handbook. If this were my daughter this man would not get within five miles of her ever, ever again. I believe this will get him back in court. Think of how many abusive people do this every day to their families but never leave them evidence like this. Repulsive, horrid. I will never see an Alec Baldwin movie again, Oh and Good Luck trying to get a date after this, Alec!MmmmmWOW!  That poor child is being played in their gross game of who hates who more. Guess they never heard the saying “love your child more then you hate your ex” Both parents are incredible selfish and need serious help.AddictedtoBAMPZsDon’t just read the words. Listen to them. Makes a BIG difference….[Fug Face [x]][17] – in actuality alec has been relevant in Hollywood. kim not at all.JamieHow on EARTH can people be defending Alec and saying the child deserved this?! What horrid people you are!!!! Children make mistakes, that’s why they are CHILDREN! They never, ever, ever deserve to be spoken to like this from their own father. Horrifying. I hope that girl never has to seem this douchebag again.JamieBy seem, I of course meant “see”http://GPost Team Lara CroftPigs like that should be restrained rfom being around children.He sounds threatening and should not come near that little girl.I feel so sorry for Ireland.  This can’t make her ever feel good.What a jerk, he is.CaraThis should never have been released.  We don’t know the whole story.AshleyThis constitutes as VERBAL CHILD ABUSE. If Alec wasn’t a celeb, but just a dad who got a divorce, that mother would call the police so fast it wouldn’t be funny. I’m happy the tape was released, just so that Ireland doesn’t feel like she’s personally being victimized. Now this is a much bigger thing and will have much bigger consequences.I wish people would stop saying “he just lost his temper” and things like that. Would you tell a child whose parent hits them that daddy just lost his temper? No, you’d tell them to report his ass.hri agree with sparrow.  although i think raising your voice (as a parent) to get a point across is normal, the name-calling and threats are definitely not.  i think what struck me most was how he kept repeating that he was “INSULTED” by her.  a parent can and should feel disappointed when his child lets him down, but insulted?  i dunno.. there’s just something weird about that.  that’s some very serious pride issues.  it’s really putting yourself and your needs above the child’s well-being… people like that aren’t fit to be parents.sueHe is in an absolute rage over a missed phone call. He scared me and i’m not even at the other end of the phone! Calling her a pig and threatening her with what????He sounds like he wants to beat the crap out of her. If I were his daughter , I wouldn’t call his a s s either!LurkerHow did the media (TMZ) get a hold of the recorded message?mdEvery sicko can have a kid. Sad world.angelina_mmmI think that we don’t really know what is happening there but neither of them sound too healthy. They should go and rent good foster parents for their daughter (with all that money they spend on lawyers…its been 12 years already…let it go).yepThis is So not our business.  Kim’s an ass for releasing it.magnusOh f*ck you people.You have ZERO knowledge of background or context yet you’re so immediately opinionated.VERBAL CHILD ABUSE? are you kidding me? No wonder kids get away with everything these days. WTF is verbal child abuse? Now you can’t even yell at a kid? You guys are pathetic. Your kids will own you. Manipulate you. And NEVER respect you.For all you know this kids been caught snorting blow off her thermos. Mommy doesn’t mind though cause she’s a f*cking airhead. Big bad daddy…well he should be banned from seeing her?Grow up. Seriously grow the f*ck up.This obviously has to do with much more than the missed phone call. He’s trying to parent remotely while his bimbo ex wife neglects her and when she keeps missing the calls what’s he supposed to do?You can’t reason with unformed minds. You can’t command respect through logic.Bah…waste of breathe with your idiots sometimes.NotbusyI can’t understand how any of you can justify what this father said to his “child”.  He called her a pig and some of you can understand how he would say that?  Do you talk to your own children like this?  I hope not.  A child should never be spoken to like that.  I believe he has lost his visitation with the child until a hearing in May.  I heard that on the radio and don’t know if it is true or not.  I don’t blame Kim Basinger if she did leak this tape to the media.  She is protecting her child.  Now people will see why she is fighting him so hard for custody.mindyKim Basinger labeled her ex as a bully and I believe her. Basinger is a gentle soul who wouldn’t hurt a fly. She adores her kid. She’s southern and loves animals and nature. Abusive men go out of their way to look normal and convince outsiders that they are the good guys. That’s why the police often don’t arrest them until they’ve murdered somebody and that’s why some of you are sticking up for him. Don’t be fooled by Alec’s good looks and charm. He broods and has a fiery Irish temper. I can see the aggression in his eyes and his body language. He keeps getting tough-guy roles in film because he’s perfect for them. Ever since her divorce from Alec, Kim seems like a wounded animal. She has shrunk from the public eye. I think things were so bad and he depressed her so much that now she wants to live alone. She’s seemed depressed ever since and her self esteem is much lower than it used to be. It would have been best if Kim hadn’t had a child with Alec because she could get away from him for good. No ties. She has a lot of anger toward him now that they are apart and the full effects of their relationship have hit her. Alec is just mad that she divorced him. He never wanted to divorce Kim. Everyone can see that if it was possible, he would love to have “crazy Kim” back. He has not progressed at all.http://pinstripe-bindi.livejournal.com/ louveciennesHa ha! The best part is how he couldn’t even remember her age. What a jack A S S.http://www.ikwertysho.blogspot.com ikhoI grew up in the same town as this F**ker…he is a Loser…..if you don’t  know what abuse is…listen closely…that is ABUSE!!!! Do yourself a favor Alec (used to be alex like his dad) and get some help! Stop blaming EVERYONE else for your pathetic behavior!amanda“..It’s reads as thought he really has Kim Basinger in mind not his daughter.”Absolutely and there is no excuse whatsoever for behaving like that to his 11 year old daughter, and imo no excuse for making this message public either!HE and her mother is supposed to be the adults here! Poor little girl to be used like this in her parent´s everlasting quarrels and battles! One can´t help feeling sorry for a child who has to grow up with, and depend on irresponsible, capricious, and self-centred people as parents!http://www.ikwertysho.blogspot.com ikhomagnus either you come from an abusive home or you have no idea what you are talking about!!!SandbitchThe mother did the right thing by publicly releasing that verbal attack on a child before he got the chance to carry out the threat to “straighten her out” in person.  What in the hell would that involve?  If that’s how he treats his daughter for merely not answering the phone, he must’ve put his wife through hell.  He must be one scary S.O.A.B. in private.magnusabusive home.Call when after you bail your kids out of jail.If you actually had even met Alec you’d know he’s awesome and his ex wife is a neo-hippie LA lunatic.He just doesn’t his kid winding up like every other California spoiled brat.ikho…you’re a total idiot and a liar.pipiAlec’s a douche but no one knows the whole situation except for those involved.  The name calling’s harsh and people are probably upset because nowadays being tough on your kids is a no no.NotbusyHe said she would never have done that to her mother?  Sounds like she has respect for her mother and I’m sure It’s because her mother would never yell at her and call her a pig.Sophie“She’s southern and loves animals and nature.”Oh Mindy sweetie please spaaaaare me *dies laughing* Kim isn’t 5 and neither are you.I agree with Magnus. And with Pipi.If you don’t know how to parent your child, at least don’t let them totally destroy themselves. If they need a yelling to wake up so be it. I am however against beating/spanking children (but I don’t think he threatend this), and calling them pigs, but you could tell he was reeeeally frustrated, after all he calls her like once a week/month and – it’s arranged for crying out loud?lindsAlec’s just pissed because he showed his ass and got caught. I don’t care how angry you get as a parent – that guy is sick – talking to a child in such a manner. He is controlling and abusive. This person clearly has control issues -he needs to spend less time trying to control his daughter and his ex and get a grip on his damn self. Poor Ireland. I bet Kim Basinger just cringes at the thought that she chose this guy as her child’s father.The most pathetic part of this is that instead of owning up and saying, “I couldn’t get a hold of my daughter, I was worried, I was frustrated, and I was wrong” Alec and his people try to throw it back on Kim Basinger. Sush a sad, impotent little man. Boo.BrandonAlec and Kim are still fighting like little kids in a schoolyard.Alec has no right to flip out on his daughter like that. What did she do to you? If I was a parent, I will respect my kids with “tough love.” Obviously, Alec has “tough” issues to deal with. Once a bully, always a bully.My advice for Kim and Alec is to move on or get help.lindsAnd as for Kim Basinger releasing this tape to the media – KUDOS TO HER!!! It is so hard to get members of law enforcement and the courts to recognize mental abuse because it doesn’t leave bruises / scars like physical abuse. Now she has proof that Anyone reading this who is a parent understands the lengths that a mother will go to protect your child – even if it’s from his/her other parent.http://www.speedmonkey.net/ MonkeyHey, we always knew that Alec Baldwin was a cockbag, but who’s worse. Baldwin or the person who leaked their dirty laundry?KathrynI cannot beleive that some of you are JUSTIFYING this! What kind of people are you!I have a 13 year old daughter who will refuse to take her fathers calls and I have to hound and hound her to call him back, you know why, because in the past many times he has used this same type of verbal abuse on her and she doesn’t like talking to him. I am not at fault becuase of this, i actually try to get her to call him back, to take his calls, but he has scarred her emotionally and she finds it difficult to do this! My ex has said the exact same things about me being the crazy one, which I am not, I encourage their relationship, but no matter what, I am crazy to him. By the way my ex is inflicted with narcissitic personality disorder, and I believe this to be the case with Alec as well.All of you justifying this cowardly action by Alex need to get a clue!http://GPost Team Lara CroftAny friend I’ve had who was terrorized or verbally abused by their parent recounts stories exactly like this one.This sort of thing scars children.It is inappropriate no matter how you look at it.  It is damaging.  It is abuse.  You don’t have to hit a child to damage their sense of self.Poor Ireland.AddictedtoBAMPZsMagnus, Can we please drop the disguise and call you by your real name, Alec? You have unveiled your real motivation with the tone of voice you use, the repeated insults to her mother, the references to your wounded pride and your needs. Not sure of her age? Think it is OK to say she “doesn’t have brains”, isn’t a decent human being, is a pig? You don’t really love this child or want to spend time with her. You don’t like her. You just want to win, to dominate, to outdo the mother, whatever it takes.What you do not realize is  there are millions of fathers who love their children dearly yet are separated by divorce, sometimes divorce they don’t want. They may have no choice but to watch their children live with other men, move away, and even deal with brainwashing and manipulation on the part of the mothers. They deal with it with detemination, love,  respect and sensitivity to what the CHILD has to deal with. They don’t put themselves first. Those are the men whose children will continue to love and respect them. Yours won’t.magnus

According to police, upon asking Pablo for his license and registration, Pablo allegedly reached into his pocket to pull out his wallet, but instead pulled his hand out to reveal the “finger circle”, a very popular hand game that has no clear origin, and is played by making a circle with your thumb and index finger and then placed below the waist like this:If someone looks at the finger circle, you are allowed to hit that person or simply feel the pleasure of having tricked that person into looking at it.After showing the officer the finger circle, the officer punched Pablo in the face and pulled him from inside his vehicle and arrested him for obstruction. “My whole life i’ve been tricked into looking at that thing” said the CPD officer who arrested Pablo, “I was tired of that damn circle. Back in middle school some kid knocked me out because I looked at it”.Pablo will reportedly spend New Year’s day inside jail until his $5000 bail is paid.

Marquez ignored them which prompted calls and shouts that he was a racist.Marquez left the establishment after eating, but allegedly sustained a sudden blow to the back of his head outside the McDonald’s, which knocked him unconscious. When he woke up, his pants were ripped and wallet gone, which contained $400 in cash, three credit cards, his VA medical card, school identification, metro card and driver’s license.“I remember this group of teens harassing me while I was eating, they surrounded my table and kept on asking me ‘Do you believe black lives matter,'” Marquez told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “Then they started calling me a racist. I can’t recall if they were saying anything else to me at this moment because the blow to my head really screwed up my memory.”DeAnthony Mason, manager of the McDonald’s, reviewed security footage and told Marquez in a phone call Saturday that when he left the restaurant a teen with a white shirt struck him on the side of the head, knocking him unconscious. The other teens then converged on his incapacitated body, taking his belongings. The head blow Marquez sustained left his memory dazed, but Mason’s review of security footage helped him piece together what occurred.Upon regaining consciousness, Marquez found a cab driver willing to drive him to his apartment across from American University, where he attends school. Workers in the lobby called the police on his behalf, who took him to George Washington Hospital where he was evaluated for several hours. Medical documents obtained by TheDCNF show Marquez was treated for head trauma and an eye contusion.Credit card transactions reviewed by TheDCNF reveal that the assailants charged over $115 on his various credit cards at a liquor store, Five Guys and Walmart. Mason, the McDonald’s store manager told Marquez that police have been looking for the group of teens for a previous incident.“I believe this was a hate crime and I was targeted because of my skin color,” Marquez told TheDCNF. “Too many of these types of attacks have been happening against white people by members of the black community and the majority of the main stream media refuses to report on it.”Marquez served eight years active duty in the Marines between 2003 and 2011 in Iraq and Afghanistan as a Rifleman and Scout Sniper. He received the Bronze Star for valor during his first deployment after he carried the body of his slain team leader from combat following an ambush during the Battle of Fallujah.“When I was in the Marine Corps, I served with people from many different backgrounds, ethnicities, religions, and races,” Marquez told TheDCNF. “Like all Marines, I fought for the freedom of all Americans and not just one particular group.”Should Democrats Denounce This Black Lives Matter Activist?

The College opposes the use of “conversion,” “reorientation,” or “reparative” therapy for the treatment of LGBT persons.Available research does not support the use of reparative therapy as an effective method in the treatment of LGBT persons. Evidence shows that the practice may actually cause emotional or physical harm to LGBT individuals, particularly adolescents or young persons. Research done at San Francisco State University on the effect of familial attitudes and acceptance found that LGBT youth who were rejected by their families because of their identity were more likely than their LGBT peers who were not rejected or only mildly rejected by their families to attempt suicide, report high levels of depression, use illegal drugs, or be at risk for HIV and sexually transmitted illnesses. The American Psychological Association literature review found that reparative therapy is associated with the loss of sexual feeling, depression, anxiety, and suicidality.”American Counseling Association, Ethical Issues Related to Conversion or Reparative Therapy (2013), available at http://www.counseling.org/news/updates/2013/01/16/ethical-issues-related-to-conversion-or-reparative-therapy .“The belief that same-sex attraction and behavior is abnormal and in need of treatment is in opposition to the position taken by national mental health organizations, including ACA.

In 1999, the Governing Council adopted a statement ‘opposing the promotion of reparative therapy as a cure for individuals who are homosexual.’ . . .[T]he ACA Ethics Committee strongly suggests that ethical professional counselors do not refer clients to someone who engages in conversion therapy or, if they do so, to proceed cautiously only when they are certain that the referral counselor fully informs clients of the unproven nature of the treatment and the potential risks and takes steps to minimize harm to clients. . . . This information also must be included in written informed consent material by those counselors who offer conversion therapy despite ACA’s position and the Ethics Committee’s statement in opposition to the treatment.

Furthermore, anecdotal reports of ‘cures’ are counterbalanced by anecdotal claims of psychological harm. In the last four decades, ‘reparative’ therapists have not produced any rigorous scientific research to substantiate their claims of cure. Until there is such research available, [the American Psychiatric Association] recommends that ethical practitioners refrain from attempts to change individuals’ sexual orientation, keeping in mind the medical dictum to first, do no harm.The potential risks of reparative therapy are great, including depression, anxiety and self-destructive behavior, since therapist alignment with societal prejudices against homosexuality may reinforce self-hatred already experienced by the patient. Many patients who have undergone reparative therapy relate that they were inaccurately told that homosexuals are lonely, unhappy individuals who never achieve acceptance or satisfaction. The possibility that the person might achieve happiness and satisfying interpersonal relationships as a gay man or lesbian is not presented, nor are alternative approaches to dealing with the effects of societal stigmatization discussed.Therefore, the American Psychiatric Association opposes any psychiatric treatment such as reparative or conversion therapy which is based upon the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder or based upon the a priori assumption that a patient should change his/her sexual homosexual orientation.”American Psychoanalytic Association, Position Statement on Attempts to Change Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, or Gender Expression (2012), available at http://www.apsa.org/content/2012-position-statement-attempts-change-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-or-gender .“As with any societal prejudice, bias against individuals based on actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression negatively affects mental health, contributing to an enduring sense of stigma and pervasive self-criticism through the internalization of such prejudice.Psychoanalytic technique does not encompass purposeful attempts to ‘convert,’ “repair,” change or shift an individual’s sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression. Such directed efforts are against fundamental principles of psychoanalytic treatment and often result in substantial psychological pain by reinforcing damaging internalized attitudes.”American Psychological Association, Resolution on Appropriate Affirmative Responses to Sexual Orientation Distress and Change Efforts (2009), available at http://www.apa.org/about/policy/sexual-orientation.pdf .“Therefore be it resolved that the American Psychological Association affirms that same-sex sexual and romantic attractions, feelings, and behaviors are normal and positive variations of human sexuality regardless of sexual orientation identity;Be it further resolved that the American Psychological Association reaffirms its position that homosexuality per se is not a mental disorder and opposes portrayals of sexual minority youths and adults as mentally ill due to their sexual orientation;Be it further resolved that the American Psychological Association concludes that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to change sexual orientation;Be it further resolved that the American Psychological Association encourages mental health professionals to avoid misrepresenting the efficacy of sexual orientation change efforts by promoting or promising change in sexual orientation when providing assistance to individuals distressed by their own or others’ sexual orientation;Be it further resolved that the American Psychological Association concludes that the benefits reported by participants in sexual orientation change efforts can be gained through approaches that do not attempt to change sexual orientation;. . .Be it further resolved that the American Psychological Association advises parents, guardians, young people, and their families to avoid sexual orientation change efforts that portray homosexuality as a mental illness or developmental disorder and to seek psychotherapy, social support and educational services that provide accurate information on sexual orientation and sexuality, increase family and school support, and reduce rejection of sexual minority youth;Be it further resolved that the American Psychological Association encourages practitioners to consider the ethical concerns outlined in the 1997 APA Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Response to Sexual Orientation (American Psychological Association, 1998), in particular the following standards and principles: scientific bases for professional judgments, benefit and harm, justice, and respect for people’s rights and dignity[.]”American School Counselor Association, The Professional School Counselor and LGBTQ Youth (2014), available at http://www.schoolcounselor.org/school-counselors-members/about-asca-%281%29/position-statements .“The professional school counselor works with all students through the stages of identity development and understands this may be more difficult for LGBTQ youth.

That's the one question I am asked most frequently in my practice. My standard answer is ""none."" But let me clarify. There is no government agency setting quality standards and guidelines, so there are no assurances of quality in pet food. I am certain at some time you have noticed a change in your dog after feeding him or her different batches of the same brand of pet food. Your pet may have diarrhea, increased flatulence, a dull hair coat, intermittent vomiting, or may scratch more often. These are the most common symptoms I have observed over the years, and they are all associated with commercial pet foods. In 1981 while Martin Zucker and I wrote the first of my two books, How to Have a Healthier Dog, we discovered the full extent of the negative effects of commercial pet foods of that time. Much more recently, San Francisco Chronicle staff writer John Eckhouse went even further with a two-part exposé entitled ""Pet-Food Labels Baffle Consumers,"" and (a good candidate for a horror movie title) ""How Dogs and Cats Get Recycled Into Pet Food."" In the second article, published on February 19, 1990, Mr. Eckhouse, an investigative reporter, writes: ""Each year, millions of dead American dogs and cats are processed along with billions of pounds of other animal materials by companies known as renderers.

Government health officials, scientists, and pet food executives say such open criticism of commercial pet food is unfounded. James Morris, a professor at the School of Veterinary Medicine at Davis, California, says, ""Any products not fit for human consumption are very well sterilized, so nothing can be transmitted to the animal. And to say products are unwholesome because we Americans don't like to eat them is incorrect. There's nothing wrong with eating spleen, which we don't do, but some Arabs [do]."" In my opinion, it is obvious that individuals who make such statements know nothing of the meat and rendering industries. Hold on to your hats -- I am going to take you on a bumpy ride through the meat-packing industry. For seven years I was a veterinary meat inspector for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the State of California -- in carrying out this office I had to wade through blood, water, pus, and fecal matter; inhale the fetid stench from the killing floor; and listen to the death cries of the animals being slaughtered. Prior to World War II, most slaughterhouses were all-inclusive; that is, the livestock was slaughtered and processed into fresh meat in one location. There was a section for smoking meats, a section for processing meats into sausages, and a section for rendering. During the years after World War II, the meat industry became more specialized. A slaughterhouse just slaughtered and dressed the carcasses; the making of sausages was done in a separate facility; and the rendering of slaughter waste also became a separate specialty -- and no longer within the jurisdiction of government meat inspectors. Now that the rendering companies are entities unto their own they can service many slaughterhouses, plus process any other animal remains that can be rendered. But first, to prevent the condemned meat from being rerouted and used for human consumption, government regulations require that the meat must be ""denatured"" before it is removed from the slaughterhouse. The denatured carcasses and other waste can then be transported to the rendering facility. In my time as a veterinary meat inspector, we denatured with carbolic acid (phenol, a potentially corrosive disinfectant) and/or creosote (used to preserve wood or as a disinfectant). Phenol is derived from the distillation of coal tar, creosote from the distillation of wood. Both substances are very toxic. Creosote was used for many years as a preservative for wood power poles. Its effect on the environment proved to be so negative that it is no longer used for that purpose. According to federal meat inspection regulations, fuel oil, kerosene, crude carbolic acid, and citronella (an insect repellent made from lemon grass) are the approved denaturing materials. The condemned livestock carcasses treated with these toxic chemicals can then become meat and bone meal for the pet food industry. Worse yet, since rendering facilities are not government-controlled, any animal carcasses can be rendered, including those of cats and dogs. Eckhouse quotes Eileen Layne of the California Veterinary Medical Association: ""When you read pet-food labels and it says meat or bone meal, that's what it is -- cooked and converted animals, including some dogs and cats."" Some of these dead pets -- those who were euthanized by veterinarians -- already have sodium pentobarbital in their bodies before being treated with the denaturing substances. In veterinary offices most cats and dogs are put to sleep with this chemical. According to Eckhouse, veterinarians at the University of Minnesota warned that the sodium pentobarbital used to put pets to sleep ""survived rendering without undergoing degradation,"" but they concluded that the residue amount would be too small to cause problems if the carcasses of euthanized pets were mixed with other raw materials during a day's production run. No mention was made of the cumulative effects on a cat or dog from ingesting this small amount daily for years. Thus far we have come across the denaturing chemicals and the sodium pentobarbital, and I have only just begun. In the finished rendered product, a fat stabilizer is introduced to prevent rancidity. The common chemicals used are BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole) and BHT (butylated hydroxytolulene), both known to cause liver and kidney dysfunction. Some European countries prohibit the use and importation of these preservatives. Another fat stabilizer often used is Ethoxyquin, suspected of being a cancer-causing agent. Propylene glycol, first cousin to ethylene glycol (antifreeze), is found in many semimoist dog foods. It causes the destruction of red blood cells. Lead also shows up frequently in pet foods, even if they are made from livestock meat and bone meal, simply as a result of our environment. A paper from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, titled ""Lead in Animal Foods,"" had two frightening conclusions. First, a 9-pound cat is ingesting more lead daily than what is considered potentially toxic for children. Second, since some commercially prepared pet and laboratory animal foods routinely contain lead, feeding these preparations to laboratory animals could add a significant, uncontrolled variable to experiments and may lead to uncertain experimental results (James G. Fox, et al., Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Vol. 1, 1976). You are providing a chemical feast to your pet when you feed it the meat and bone meal in pet foods. In the absence of any government inspection programs or any rules and regulations on standards and origins of the ingredients in these foods, my recommendation would be to feed your pets only food that you would eat, such as scraps from the table or from the butcher. Any veterinary nutritionist, government health official, or scientist who says feeding the aforementioned chemicals daily to our pets will not have a deleterious effect on them is living in a fool's paradise. Just look at the track record of government health officials and scientists over the years. Remember DDT? It took the life of a young boy before it was banned. Thalidomide? It was almost approved for use in America before it was found to cause severe deformities in unborn babies. The use of DES to fatten food-producing animals posed no threat to human life, said the health officials and scientists; but they were wrong. Even today, the government has given its approval to a feline leukemia vaccine which is not giving protection against the virus. In some instances, it is actually causing feline leukemia. I have been practicing small animal medicine for more than 30 years. Every day I have seen the casualties of the propaganda by the pet food industry. Yet the professors in the teaching institutions of veterinary medicine generally support an industry that has little regard for the quality of health in our companion animals. The question has never been whether or not pets are contracting diseases from pet food, but rather, what is the status of our pets' health when they are fed a steady diet of toxic chemicals? One last word of caution, not for pets this time but for their owners:  meat and bone meal from sources not fit for human consumption has found its way into poultry feed. This means that the animal products rendered under questionable conditions are being fed to birds that may wind up on your table. Remember this when you are eating your next piece of chicken or turkey. I have to add, however, that the bone meal sold as a calcium supplement is from carcasses graded for human consumption; it is not from condemned animals. This article was originally published in Let's Live magazine.Another website by Human Dimensions. I am certain at some time you have noticed a change in your dog after feeding him or her different batches of the same brand of pet food. Your pet may have diarrhea, increased flatulence, a dull hair coat, intermittent vomiting, or may scratch more often. These are the most common symptoms I have observed over the years, and they are all associated with commercial pet foods. In 1981 while Martin Zucker and I wrote the first of my two books, How to Have a Healthier Dog, we discovered the full extent of the negative effects of commercial pet foods of that time. Much more recently, San Francisco Chronicle staff writer John Eckhouse went even further with a two-part exposé entitled ""Pet-Food Labels Baffle Consumers,"" and (a good candidate for a horror movie title) ""How Dogs and Cats Get Recycled Into Pet Food.""

The novel—which was written as Adolf Hitler rose to power in Nazi Germany—tells the story of a fascist takeover in America.The main character, Buzz Windrip, appeals to voters with a mix of crass language and nativist ideology. Once elected, he solidifies his power by energizing his base against immigrants, people on welfare, and the liberal press. The novel has been called “frighteningly contemporary ” in the wake of the Trump campaign and election. As Slate wrote in September 2015:With his careful mix of plainspoken honesty and reactionary delusion, Trump is following an old rhetorical playbook, one defined and employed successfully in the 1936 presidential campaign of [Windrip].If you’d like to read the novel, you can still order it through Barnes & Noble , or by checking to see if your local brick-and-mortar bookstore has it in stock (or by going to the library!). You can also place an order for the novel on Amazon and the online retailer will ship it to you once it restocks its copies.

DO YOU SUPPORT THIS ?Posted February 10, 2017 1:51pm UTC by adminLiberals got their eyes on our President since the very first moment he got in office. every step he made was followed with criticism. Liberals used immigrants to bash President Donald Trump. However, nothing goes the way they planned. The latest executive order signed by the President revealed many things, and we bet that liberals won’t like any of that. The latest order will put things in the right place, and illegals won’t be able to get away with everything they did so far.Sponsored by RevcontentxFormer president Barack Obama allowed illegals in America to apply and get on welfare. President Trump doesn’t approve this. You’d all agree that welfare is a privilege. It’s bad how some believe it’s the right that belongs to everyone who comes to this country. Illegals aren’t that fortunate. They will soon learn what’s like to live in a country ruled by Donald Trump. Every illegal who tries to collect a welfare check will feel justice on their back.President Trump signed an executive order according to which any illegal who lives on welfare will be sent home. And that’s not all. America will no longer accept people who come here to live on our expense. These people will no longer be able to enter the country.From Conservative Daily Post:“The administration would be seeking to “deny admission to any alien who is likely to become a public charge” and develop standards for “determining” whether an immigrant can be deported after five years, if that person receives a certain amount of public assistance, including Food Stamps, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and Medicaid.” It was about time that Americans take the matter in their own hands. President Trump will help us in achieving that. We’re finally seeing the light of the day. A beautiful future lies a head of us. The President is already draining the swamp. We’re getting rid of the bad stuff.What do you think about this executive order? Will it make the situation better?Recommended Stories:

The lawmakers asked GAO to examine conflicts of interest related to business holdings of Mr. Trump and his family, potential violations of protocol and national security concerns related to Mr. Trump's communications with foreign leaders, and transparency related to the use of taxpayer funds in the transition. Citing reports of ""disarray"" within a ""chaotic"" transition, Cummings and Warren raised concern about several aspects of the transition. They noted that despite Mr. Trump's claims that he will set up a ""blind trust"" to manage his business interests, ""To date, there has been no information released to the public indicating that Mr. Trump has prepared a blind trust.""  There have been several reports indicating that Mr. Trump or his family have not drawn a clear line between his Presidency and his company. ""At this point, it is not clear if the line between Mr. Trump's Presidency and his and business ventures is blurred-or entirely nonexistent,"" they wrote.Cummings and Warren also asked GAO to assess potential national security concerns associated with Trump's communications with foreign leaders, following reports that the President-elect has held conversations with foreign officials on his personal cell phone and has held diplomatic meetings with no State Department briefings. Noting that $9.5 million in federal funding has been allocated to the GSA to support the transition - in addition to other costs borne by taxpayers such as Secret Service protection - Warren and Cummings wrote, ""Mr. Trump's apparent conflicts of interest-and his behavior during the campaign and after his election-raise questions about the use of taxpayer funds during the transition, and about the decisions made during the transition that will affect federal government policies under the Trump Administration."" The lawmakers requested that the GAO assess a series of questions about these issues.Read a PDF copy of the letter here .###"

In contrast, WalMart is up 3 percent since April, and Kohl’s is down less than one percent.Company officials indirectly acknowledged the consumer boycott. “Our fourth-quarter results reflect the impact of rapidly changing consumer behavior, which drove very strong digital growth but unexpected softness in our stores,” Target CEO Brian Cornell said in a company statement. The company also admitted that it would likely continue to experience losses through the year.Leaders at the American Family Association highlighted the company’s worsening situation. “The American Family Association has called for a boycott of Target since last April after the chain publicized the fact that it would allow men to use the women’s restrooms and fitting rooms in their stores,” said a statement from Tim Wildmon, president of the AFA. He continued:This [policy] is unacceptable for families, and the dangerous and misguided policy continues to put women and children in harm’s way. Men don’t belong in the same bathroom as our wives and daughters.Target shares are at the lowest level since 2014.The company’s earnings and stock prices have experienced a steady downward trajectory since its April 2016 decision to allow men and women to choose whatever bathroom or changing room they want to use at any given time in retail outlets across the nation. In the company’s April 19, 2016, statement , the store said, “we welcome transgender team members and [customer] guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity.”A month later, even in the face of a developing stock crash, Target CEO Cornell insisted that the #BoycottTarget movement mounted after the company’s transgender bathroom decision had nothing to do with the fall in stock prices.The company’s stock price and earnings have never recovered since the 2016 announcement. In fact, the company’s outlook has been so dismal that earlier this month the company abruptly shuttered a pair of high-profile projects that were expected to lead the company into its future of retailing.To read more articles about the unpopular transgender ideology, click here .Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.Read More Stories About:

However, the latest iPhone 7 rumor makes me feel very annoyed. Via 9to5Mac, Japanese Apple blog Macotakara claims that Apple has plans to completely remove the 3.5-millimeter headphone jack from the device. This would mean that the only way to connect headphones to the device in the future would be either via Bluetooth or the Lightning port.DONT MISS: Black Friday rioting and fighting videos from around the webHeres why it wouldnt surprise me if this rumor had some truth to it: Apple showed starting with this years new MacBook that its on a quest to eliminate unnecessary ports. In fact, the new laptop featured just two ports: A USB Type-C port and a headphone jack. Apple is making a bet that all accessories are going to be wireless in the near future, which will eliminate the need to have so many ports on our devices.So I understand why it would do this but I find myself incredibly annoyed that its thinking of dumping the headphone jack all together just to make the iPhone 7 thinner.First of all, the iPhone doesnt need to be any thinner. Im actually very happy with the thickness of the iPhone 6s and was actually relieved to see that its slightly thicker and heavier than the iPhone 6 was. Second, I really dont want to have to buy a new set of headphones just to listen to music through my iPhone.(And I swear, if I have to buy a pair of Beats headphones to listen to music on my device, I will go back to Android. That is not an empty threat.)At any rate, this is still just a rumor but I dont think its a particularly outlandish one. Lets hope Apple decides to keep the 3.5-millimeter audio jack going forward and instead focus on improving the iPhone 7s battery capacity. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: Apple, iPhone 7 '

Trump Won 3,084 out of 3,151 Counties. Hillary Only Won 57DID YOU KNOW? Trump Won 3,084 out of 3,151 Counties. Hillary Only Won 57Politics By Eren Moreno December 1, 2016Are you growing tired of liberals crying over the so-called popular vote, as if Hillary Clinton is some beloved disenfranchised leader?There are rules to the contest, and Trump won fair and square. The rest is just noise and sore loser whining.If she wants, Hillary can go be the governor of California, or President of Saudi Arabia.Aside from her popularity in the ultra-liberal strongholds California and New York, the final election breakdown of the numbers shows what an ass-kickin’ Hillary received from the American people.From Allen West :The keening and caterwauling we’ve been treated to by the left since Hillary Clinton’s defeat has been monumental.Most entertaining has been the snowflake retreat to “safe spaces” with puppies and coloring books to assuage their anguish.Less entertaining were the violent protests whichwere paid foreruptedPutting aside Jill Stein’s quixotic effort to force a recount, the left has been loudest with its demands to dismantle the Electoral College.After all it’s unfair: Hillary Clinton won the “popular vote” so she should win, right?Wrong.Our Founders in their infinite wisdom created the Electoral College to ensure the STATES were fairly represented. Why should one or two densely populated areas speak for the whole of the nation?The following list of statistics has been making the rounds on the Internet and it should finally put an end to the argument as to why the Electoral College makes sense.Share this with as many whiners as you can.There are 3,141 counties in the United States.Trump won 3,084 of them.Clinton won 57.There are 62 counties in New York State.Trump won 46 of them.Clinton won 16.Clinton won the popular vote by approx. 1.5 million votes.In the 5 counties that encompass NYC, (Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Richmond & Queens) Clinton received well over 2 million more votes than Trump. (Clinton only won 4 of these counties; Trump won Richmond)Therefore these 5 counties alone, more than accounted for Clinton winning the popular vote of the entire country.These 5 counties comprise 319 square miles.The United States is comprised of 3, 797,000 square miles.When you have a country that encompasses almost 4 million square miles of territory, it would be ludicrous to even suggest that the vote of those who inhabit a mere 319 square miles should dictate the outcome of a national election.Large, densely populated Democrat cities (NYC, Chicago, LA, etc) don’t and shouldn’t speak for the rest of our country.Support the Trump Presidency and help us fight Liberal Media Bias.

When the CIA released findings that Russia had, in fact, interfered in the 2016 election, Trump was very quick to discredit the Central Intelligence Agency rather than question the integrity of the ruthless leader.The video, broken by the amazing Shawn King , is going viral fast.

https://www.snopes.com/footage-of-destructive-tornadoes-million/	Did National Geographic Purchase Footage of Destructive Tornadoes for $1 Million?	false	['national geographic', ' tornado']	https://www.theverge.com/	https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/12/16295000/extreme-weather-climate-change-wildfires-heat-waves-hurricanes	2017/09/15	NOAA's GOES satellite shows three storms in the Atlantic: Hurricane Irma, Tropical Storm Jose, and Tropical Storm Katia, on September 8th.Photo by NASA/NOAA GOES Project via Getty ImagesThis summer, the US has had several record-smashing natural disasters: over 110 large fires are burning throughout the country, especially in the West ; California recently had a deadly heat wave that set all-time heat records in several towns, including San Francisco; and after Hurricane Harvey brought unprecedented raining and flooding to Texas, Hurricane Irma swept through the Caribbean and Florida — the strongest storm ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside of the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico.Although it’s impossible to attribute any one of these single events to climate change, the signals are clear, scientists say. (That kind of attribution may be possible with certain kinds of modeling studies; those studies have not yet been conducted.) These extreme weather events are very consistent with what climate change is expected to bring in the years ahead: global weirding. Extreme weather events become more extreme, and climate change is “‘loading the dice’ toward more extreme floods, heat waves, droughts, and hurricanes,” says Michael Mann , a climatologist and director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, in an email to The Verge. “We shouldn’t be surprised we’re turning up snake eyes so often now.”“This is going to be the future.”Mann’s not alone in thinking this summer has the shape of things to come. “This is going to be the future,” says David Titley , a meteorologist and director of the Center for Solutions to Weather and Climate Risk at Penn State. The future is going to have stronger heat waves, more wildfires, heavier rain storms, and a greater number of very intense hurricanes, Titley says. “At some point, our luck will run out.”It’s wrong to say that climate change caused this summer’s extreme weather events, scientists say. Hurricanes and fires have occurred in the past, after all. But “undoubtedly climate change is playing a role,” says Kevin Trenberth , a distinguished senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. These extreme weather events “are being exacerbated by the climate change element.”So here’s the role climate change might have played in this summer’s record-breaking heat waves, wildfires, and hurricanes.Heat wavesOver Labor Day weekend, California was broiled by a record-setting heat wave that killed six people. San Francisco reached 106 degrees Fahrenheit , the hottest it’s ever been since record keeping started about 150 years ago. (The previous record was 103 degrees Fahrenheit, set in 2000.) A few other cities broke heat records , as well. In June, Phoenix, Arizona, also hit a daily record , reaching 119 degrees Fahrenheit.Update: One additional all-time record high temp to report from recent heat event + 6 all-time record warm overnight lows. #CAwx #CAheatwave pic.twitter.com/Xdl63XZQUV— NWS Bay Area (@NWSBayArea) September 5, 2017Heat waves are the simplest weather event to attribute to climate change, says Adam Sobel , an atmospheric scientist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and head of Columbia University’s Initiative on Extreme Weather and Climate. A variety of studies have shown that a warming climate increases the chances of heat waves and how severe those heat waves are going to be, Sobel says.The world’s average temperature has increased roughly by 1.53 degrees Fahrenheit from 1880 to 2012, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change . That may not seem like a lot, but if we don’t keep global warming well below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, we could see irreversible changes like melting polar ice caps, extensive flooding, bleached coral reefs, food shortages, and deadly diseases. As temperatures rise, there’s a greater chance of getting more intense heat waves and setting new heat records, says Sobel.WildfiresAll over the US, there are more than 110 large fires , burning through almost 2 million acres of land, including more than 80 wildfires in the western part of the country. These fires are making it hard to breathe all over the Pacific Northwest . “It’s very unusual to have this many fires burning this many acres across such a broad area at this time in September,” National Interagency Fire Center spokeswoman Jennifer Jones told Reuters . So far this year, we’ve had more than 48,000 fires , burning more than 8 million acres of land, 2 million acres over the national yearly average from 2007 to 2016.An image taken on September 4th by the NOAA-NASA's Suomi NPP satellite shows the direct path of the smoke from the West Coast fires that stretches across the entire countryPhoto: NASA image courtesy Jeff Schmaltz LANCE/EOSDIS MODIS Rapid Response Team, GSFCThere are several ingredients required for wildfires — some connected to climate change and some that have nothing to do with it. But dry conditions and extreme heat create good tinder, making wildfires worse in certain areas, says Benjamin Bond-Lamberty , an ecosystem ecologist with the Joint Global Change Research Institute. A warmer planet will cause more water to evaporate off the landscapes, drying trees and grasses — which then burn more easily. “That sets the stage for increased fire,” Bond-Lamberty says.Climate change can also make forests more prone to burning, since some pests can spread more readily in warmer temperatures, Bond-Lamberty says. The mountain pine beetle , for instance, is thriving because warmer winters don’t kill its larvae, allowing the beetles to spread and kill more trees, which serve as fuel. “That really sets up a lot of forest ready for things like a wildfire,” he says.Flames spread on a moonlit night at the La Tuna Fire on September 2nd near Burbank, California. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said at a news conference that officials believe the fire, which is at 5,000 acres and growing, is the largest fire ever in LA.Photo by David McNew/Getty ImagesOf course, climate change alone doesn’t cause wildfires — lightning or people are still required. A Forest Service policy of suppressing fires over much of the 20th century has also made our forests older, and more prone to burning. “We’re still paying the cost of that 20th century policy,” Bond-Lamberty says. “There’s a big accumulation of fuel built up on the landscape.”Still, climate change might already have an effect. A study last year found that in the West, climate change has doubled the area affected by forest fires over the last 30 years. Washington state had its biggest fire in state history in 2015, breaking its 2014 record, says Amy Snover , the director of the University of Washington’s Climate Impacts Group. The fire season has also lengthened, starting a month earlier in Alaska, she writes in an email to The Verge.HurricanesThis hurricane season has been incredibly active, with a number of severe storms. First, Hurricane Harvey barreled into Texas, dumping record rains and causing unprecedented  flooding in cities like Houston. Then, Hurricane Katia struck the east coast of Mexico, and Hurricane Irma — a Category 5 hurricane and one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the Atlantic — wreaked havoc on the Caribbean. ( Irma smashed a bunch of other records .) Another hurricane, called Jose , followed Irma, but now it seems the storm may remain out in the ocean .Floodwaters surround homes on September 7th in Richwood, Texas. Over a week after Hurricane Harvey hit Southern Texas, residents are beginning the long process of recovering from the storm.Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesThe intensity of these hurricanes seem to match what climate scientists are expecting in the future, says Titley. Research shows that strong hurricanes, like Harvey and Irma, will become more frequent as the planet warms, says Suzana Camargo, a professor of ocean and climate physics at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University.Climate change is expected to affect hurricanes in a few ways: warmer ocean waters will provide more energy to these storms, and more moisture in the atmosphere will increase the amount of rain these hurricanes can dump. Rising sea levels will also make storm surge from hurricanes worse, leading to higher floods.Whether climate change is already affecting hurricanes is up for debate, Sobel and Camargo say. It’s true that Harvey was fueled by warmer than usual waters in the Gulf of Mexico , but it was also particularly destructive because it stalled over Texas for a few days, dumping unprecedented amounts of rain. It’s still an open question whether climate change has anything to do with wind patterns, Titley says. And we don’t have enough data on hurricanes to understand whether stronger storms like Harvey and Irma are part of a larger trend, Sobel says.Boats, cars and other debris clog waterways in the Florida Keys two days after Hurricane Irma slammed into the state September 12th, 2017 in Marathon, Florida.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images“The change might be there but it’s hard to prove it,” he says. “It’s like you’re listening to somebody talking quietly in a loud room. You may not be able to hear them but that doesn’t mean they’re not talking.”Whether we can attribute Harvey and Irma directly to climate change, however, kind of misses the point, Titley says. “People can see that these changes are coming and they are very consistent with what the vast majority of climate scientists have told us for decades is going to happen,” he says. “We shouldn't really be surprised.”Climate change is a known threat multiplier: this summer’s extreme weather events are just a taste of what’s about to come — and the sooner we address climate change, the better off we’ll be. That means lowering greenhouse gas emissions and building infrastructure that can survive sea level rise, for instance. “By and large, I think most of us don’t really like the change what we’ve seen,” Titley says, “and the climate system is kind of saying, ‘Hey guys, you ain’t seen nothing yet.’”Next Up In Science
https://www.snopes.com/hillary-clinton-stole-white-house-furniture/	Hillary Clinton Stole $200,000 in White House Furnishings	mfalse	['bill clinton', ' hillary clinton', ' white house furniture']	https://www.washingtonpost.com/	https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2001/01/21/clintons-take-away-190000-in-gifts/36773cf2-8120-4d58-b903-d76d39a6cc3f/	2016/07/26	"Clintons Take Away $190,000 In GiftsBy Thomas B. Edsall By Thomas B. Edsall January 21, 2001Former president Bill Clinton and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.), faced with multimillion-dollar houses to furnish here and in suburban New York, left the White House yesterday with an unprecedented $190,027 worth of gifts received over the last eight years.In their financial disclosure forms, the Clintons reported a variety of assets and receipts, including ""over $1 million"" in a Citibank personal account in New York; blind trusts, insurance policies and some common stock worth more than $1 million; and the payment of $1.05 million in legal fees by the Clinton Legal Expense Trust.Bill Clinton continues to owe ""between $1 million and $5 million"" to each of two law firms, Williams and Connolly and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, resulting primarily from his defense in House and Senate impeachment proceedings, along with a number of other investigations.Many of the gifts the Clintons are taking with them are from Hollywood figures, Democratic donors and a wide array of friends and associates, including his Georgetown University classmates.Most of the gifts are artworks, flatware, furniture, china and rugs for a couple who for nearly two decades have not had a home of their own but now suddenly have two large houses, one in Northwest Washington, the other in Chappaqua, N.Y.The Clintons received, for example, five gifts of china ranging in value from $2,110 from Jill and Ken Iscol, of Pound Ridge, N.Y. -- two of Sen. Clinton's new constituents -- to $5,000 from Mr. and Mrs. Bill Brandt of Winnetka, Ill.Actor-actress couple Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen of Los Angeles spent $4,787 for china, but they didn't quite match the $4,920 that movie director and producer Steven Spielberg and his wife, actress Kate Capshaw, paid for the china they gave the Clintons. Altogether, the Clintons reported receiving $21,819 worth of china.The Clintons will have no problem with silver and flatware for their guests in the future: They received five gifts of flatware worth a total of $17,966, including $4,944 worth of settings from Ghada Irani of Los Angeles and $4,967 worth from Edith Wasserman of Beverly Hills.One of the biggest gifts was from Steve Mittman of New York, who gave the Clintons two sofas, an easy chair and ottoman worth $19,900. That was more than double the value of the china cabinet, travel humidor, chandelier and copy of Abraham Lincoln's Cooper Union speech, together worth $9,683, from Mr. and Mrs. Walter Kaye, of New York.In addition, the Clintons left the White House with $52,021 worth of furniture, $71,650 in artworks and three carpets valued at $12,282.Bill Clinton's 1968 class at Georgetown University gave the former president and new senator a basket by artist Dale Chihuly said to be worth $38,000, and Chihuly gave the couple a $22,000 glass sculpture.In addition to the home furnishings, the most common gift given to the Clintons was golf equipment. Ten people gave drivers, putters and other golf paraphernalia worth $300 to $650. Actor Jack Nicholson gave Clinton a $350 driver.Actor Sylvester Stallone gave the couple boxing gloves.In seven previous years, the most the Clintons had reported receiving in gifts was $23,602 in 1999.Clinton's predecessor in the White House, George Bush, listed $52,853 in gifts in 1992.Researcher Madonna Lebling contributed to this report.politicsGet 2016 Olympics updates by emailOur best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox.post_newsletter333"

Please don't expect me to add a topic unless (a) you're willing    to contribute the entry for that topic; (b) the topic has come up    at least twice in the newsgroup, *or* the entry gives information    that cannot readily be found elsewhere; and (c) if the topic has    been controversial in the newsgroup, your entry attempts to    represent conflicting points of view.

We discuss how particular words, phrases, and syntactic forms are used; how they originated; and where in the English-speaking world they're prevalent.  (All this is called ""description"".)  We also discuss how we think they *should* be used (""prescription""). alt.usage.english is for everyone, *not* only for linguists, native speakers, or descriptivists.  Guidelines for posting ----------------------     Things you may want to consider avoiding when posting here:  (1) re-opening topics (such as singular ""they"" and ""hopefully"") that experience has shown lead to circular debate.  (One function of the FAQ file is to point out topics that have already been discussed ad nauseam.  You can find an archive of articles posted in alt.usage.english and other newsgroups at < http://www.dejanews.com >. Type in a search string in the form "" alt.usage.english AND keyword"". Note that Deja News offers a choice of two databases:  Current or  Old.  ""Current"" contains the most recent few weeks of articles;  ""Old"" goes back to the start of the archive in March 1995.)  (2) questions that can be answered by simple reference to a dictionary.  (3) generalities.  If you make a statement like:  ""Here in the U.S. we NEVER say 'different to'"", ""Retroflex 'r' is ONLY used in North America"", or ""'Eh' ALWAYS rhymes with 'pay'"", chances are that someone will pounce on you with a counterexample.  (4) assertions that one variety of English is ""true English"".  (5) sloppy writing (as distinct from simple slips like typing errors, or errors from someone whose native language is not English).  Keep in mind that the regulars on alt.usage.english are probably less willing than the general population to suffer sloppy writers gladly; and that each article is written by one person, but read perhaps by thousands, so the convenience of the readers really ought to have priority over the convenience of the writer.  Again, this is *not* to discourage non-native speakers from posting; readers will be able to detect that you're writing in a foreign language, and will make allowances for this.  (6) expressions of exasperation.  In the course of debate, you may encounter positions based on premises radically different from yours and perhaps surprisingly novel to you.  Saying things like ""Oh, please"", ""That's absurd"", ""Give me a break"", or ""Go teach your grandmother to suck eggs, my man"" is unlikely to win your opponent over.     You really *are* welcome to post here!  Don't let the impatient tone of this FAQ frighten you off.  Related newsgroups ------------------     There are other newsgroups that also discuss the English language. bit.listserv.words-l (which is a redistribution of a BITNET mailing list -- not all machines on Usenet carry these) is also billed as being for ""English language discussion"", but its participants engage in a lot more socializing and general chitchat than we do.     There is a mailing list for copy-editors.  To subscribe, send e-mail with the text ""SUBSCRIBE COPYEDITING-L Your Name"" to listproc@cornell.edu . sci.lang is where most of the professional linguists hang out. Discussions tend to be about linguistic methodology (rather than about *particular* words and phrases), and prescription is severely frowned upon there.  Newbies post many things there that would better be posted here. alt.flame.spelling (which fewer sites carry than carry alt.usage.english ) is the place to criticize other people's spelling.  We try to avoid doing that here (although some of us do get provoked if you spell language terms wrong.  It's ""consensus"", not ""concensus""; ""diphthong"", not ""dipthong""; ""grammar"", not ""grammer""; ""guttural"", not ""gutteral""; and ""pronunciation"", not ""pronounciation"").     alt.usage.english.neologism is described as being for ""meaningless words coined by psychotics"".  Fewer sites carry it, and it gets little traffic; the people who do post to it are generally not negative about neologisms. rec.puzzles is a better place than here to ask questions like ""What English words end in '-gry' or '-endous'?"", ""What words contain 'vv'?"", ""What words have 'e' pronounced as /I/?"", ""What Pig Latin words are also words?"", or ""How do you punctuate 'John where Bill had had had had had had had had had had had the approval of the teacher' or 'That that is is that that is not is not that that is not is not that that is is that it it is' to get comprehensible text?""  But, before you post such a question there, make sure it's not answered in the rec.puzzles archive, available at < http://xraysgi.ims.uconn.edu:8080/ > The ""-gry"" answer is now also to be found below in this FAQ.     Wordplay for its own sake (anagrams, palindromes, etc.) belongs in alt.anagrams .  There are also long lists of such things in the rec.puzzles archive.  ""The Word Gamer's Paradise"" at < http://fun2play.com/ > may also be of interest. misc.education.language.english is a newsgroup devoted to the teaching of English (especially as a second language). comp.edu.languages.natural is devoted to software for assisting language instruction. misc.writing is devoted to writing, and especially to the concerns of people trying to establish themselves as professional writers. alt.quotations is the place to ask about origins of quotations (although there is no firm dividing line between those and phrase origins, which belong here).  You can access the 1901 edition of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations at: < http://www.columbia.edu/acis/bartleby/bartlett/ > Language features peculiar to the U.K. get discussed in soc.culture.british as well as here.  Before posting to either newsgroup on this subject, you should look at Jeremy Smith's British-American dictionary, available on the WWW at: < http://www.peak.org/~jeremy/dictionary/dict.html > If you have a (language-related or other) peeve that you want to mention but don't particularly want to justify, you can try alt.peeves .  (""What is your pet peeve?"" is *not* a frequently asked question in alt.usage.english , although we frequently get unsolicited answers to it.  If you're new to this group, chances are excellent that your particular pet peeve is something that has already been discussed to death by the regulars.)     If you're interested in the peculiarities of language as used by computer users, get the Jargon File, by anonymous ftp from prep.ai.mit.edu (18.71.0.38) under pub/gnu, or on the WWW: < http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon.html > (also available in paperback form as _The New Hacker's Dictionary_, ed. Eric S. Raymond, 3rd edition, MIT Press, 1996, ISBN 0-262-68092-0).  Words you encounter on the Net that you can't find in general English dictionaries (""automagic"", ""bogon"", ""emoticon"", ""mudding"", the prefix ""Ob-"" as in ""ObAUE"", ""prepend"") you may well find in the Jargon File.  You can discuss hacker language further in the newsgroup alt.folklore.computers , or in the moderated newsgroup comp.society.folklore .     Two newsgroups that don't deal with the English language but that people often need directing to are:  sci.classics (now preferably humanities.classics ), for questions about Latin and ancient Greek; and comp.fonts , for questions about typography.  ====================================================================    RECOMMENDED BOOKS   ----------------- Dictionaries ------------     The Oxford English Dictionary (OED), 2nd ed. (OED2) (Oxford University Press, 1989, 20 vols.; compact edition, 1991 ISBN 0-19-861258-3; additions series, 2 vols., 1993, ISBN 0-19-861292-3 and 0-19-861299-0), has no rivals as a historical dictionary of the English language.  It is too large for the editors to keep all of it up to date, and hence should not be relied on for precise definitions of technical terms, or for consistent usage labels.     Webster's Third New International Dictionary (Merriam-Webster, 1961, ISBN 0-87779-201-1) (W3) is the unabridged dictionary to check for 20th-century U.S. citations of word use, and for precise definitions of technical terms too rare to appear in college dictionaries.  People sometimes cite W3 with a later date.  These later dates refer to the addenda section at the front, *not* to the body of the dictionary, which is unchanged since 1961.  W3 was widely criticized by schoolteachers and others for its lack of usage labels; e.g., it gives ""imply"" as one of the meanings of ""infer"" and ""flout"" as one of the meanings of ""flaunt"", without indicating that these are disputed usage.  Others have defended the lack of usage labels.  An anthology devoted to the controversy is _Dictionaries and THAT Dictionary: A Case Book of the Aims of Lexicographers and the Targets of Reviewers_, ed. James Sledd and Wilma R. Ebbitt (Scott Foresman, 1962); a more recent book, _The Story of Webster's Third : Philip Gove's Controversial Dictionary and Its Critics_ by Herbert C. Morton (Cambridge University Press, 1995, ISBN 0-521-46146-4) is heavily biased in favour of W3.  Merriam-Webster is working on a 4th edition, with completion expected around the year 2000.     Please don't refer to any dictionary simply as ""Webster's"". _Books in Print_ has 5 columns of book titles beginning with ""Webster's"", from many different publishers!     One-volume 8""x10"" dictionaries are popularly known as ""collegiate dictionaries"", but they should be called ""college dictionaries"" or ""quarto dictionaries"", since ""Collegiate"" is a trademark of Merriam- Webster.   The college dictionary most frequently cited here is Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition (Merriam- Webster, 1994, ISBN 0-87779-712-9) (MWCD10).  Merriam-Webster publishes sub-editions of its Collegiate dictionaries, so look at the copyright date to see exactly what you have.  The most comprehensive British college dictionary is Collins English Dictionary (3rd edition, HarperCollins, updated 1994, ISBN 0-00-470678-1).  Our British posters seem to refer more often to The Concise Oxford Dictionary (9th Edition, Oxford University Press, 1995, 0-19-861319-9) (COD9) and The Chambers Dictionary (Chambers, 1994, ISBN 0-550-10256-6).  Some of us believe that the editorial standard of the Concise Oxford has declined since H. W. Fowler and F. G. Fowler brought out the first few editions; some of the partisans of COD9 seem to have bought it COD9 simply because it said ""Oxford"" on the cover, and not compared it with other dictionaries.     If you're interested in etymology, get The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (3rd edition, Houghton Mifflin, 1992, ISBN 0-395-44895-6) (AHD3) or Webster's New World College Dictionary (3rd edition, Macmillan, 1996, ISBN 0-02-860333-8). These are two of the few dictionaries that trace words back to their reconstructed Indo-European (Aryan) roots.  AHD3 is particularly useful because it lists the etyma all together in an appendix. Because the appendix was pared in the third edition, _The American Heritage Dictionary of Indo-European Roots_, by Calvert Watkins (Houghton Mifflin, 1985), although out of print, is not obsolete.     Although AHD3 looks larger than a college dictionary, its word count puts it in the college range.  If you want an up-to-date dictionary that is larger than a college dictionary, get the Random House Unabridged Dictionary (2nd edition, Random House, revised 1993, ISBN 0-679-42917-4) (RHUD2).  Online dictionaries -------------------     You *cannot* access the OED online, unless you or your institution has paid to do so.  The second edition is copyright, and allowing public access to it would be *illegal*.  A public-access version of the first edition is conceivable, but I don't know of one.     The OED is available on CD-ROM for PCs, and server-style for UNIX systems.  For info on obtaining the UNIX version in North America, phone the Open Text Corporation in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada: e-mail "" info@opentext.com "".  Don't ask us where to buy the CD-ROM version:  your local bookshop can order it for you.  If you want to submit citations for the next edition of the OED, you can contact the OED staff directly at "" oed3@oup.co.uk "".     The online OED is encoded with the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), which is ISO 8879:1986 and is discussed in obscure detail on the comp.text.sgml newsgroup.  The funny-looking escape codes beginning with ""&"" are known as ""text entity references"".  The ISO has defined a slew of such for use with SGML:  publishing symbols, math and scientific symbols, and so on.  A good place to start learning about SGML is ""A Gentle Introduction to SGML"" at < http://etext.virginia.edu/bin/tei-tocs?div=DIV1&id=SG >.  There's also the book _Industrial-Strength SGML: An Introduction to Enterprise Publishing_ by Truly Donovan (Prentice Hall, 1996, ISBN 0-13-216243-1).      Merriam-Webster's MWCD10 is publicly accessible at < http://www.m-w.com >.     Project Gutenberg has put out two versions of an unabridged dictionary published early in this century by the company that is now Merriam-Webster.  One version is in HTML format and comes to 45 Mb when unZIPed.  The other is plain text and comes in several ZIP files with names such as pgwXX04.ZIP, where the XX are the initial letters of words included.  All are available in < ftp://uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu/pub/etext/gutenberg/etext96 >.  They're also on the Web at < http://promo.net/pg/ >.     Any ""Webster"" dictionary that you find anywhere else on the Net is probably an out-of-date bootleg.  Keep in mind that any dictionary containing such words as ""beat.nik"" and ""tran.sis.tor"" is too recent to be in the public domain.     The Macquarie dictionary is accessible online at < http://www.dict.mq.edu.au >.     Roget's Thesaurus (1911 version, out of copyright) is available from: < http://web.cs.city.ac.uk/text/roget/thesaurus > The Oxford Text Archive at: < http://sable.ox.ac.uk/ > has Collins English Dictionary (1st edition) converted to a Prolog fact base; the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary; and the MRC Psycholinguistic Database (150,837 word forms, expanded from the headwords in the Shorter Oxford, with info about 26 different linguistic properties).  Read the conditions of use for the Oxford Text Archive materials before using; most texts are available for scholarly use and research only.     The best ""Word of the Day"" service is the one run by Merriam-Webster at < http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/mwwod.pl >; it can also be subscribed to by e-mail.

General reference -----------------     _The Oxford Companion to the English Language_ (ed. Tom McArthur, Oxford University Press, 1992, ISBN 0-19-214183-X) is an encyclopaedia with a wealth of information on various dialects, on lexicography, and almost everything else except individual words and expressions.  _Success With Words_ (Reader's Digest, 1983, ISBN 0-88850-117-X) is especially suitable for beginners.  Books on linguistics --------------------  David Crystal  _The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language_  Cambridge University Press, 1987, ISBN 0-521-26438-3  David Crystal  _A Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics_ Blackwell, 1985, ISBN 0-631-14081-6  William Bright, ed.  _International Encyclopedia of Linguistics_ 4 vols., Oxford University Press, 1992, ISBN 0-19-505196-3  R.

Asher, ed.  _The Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics_ 10 vols., Pergamon, 1994, ISBN 0-08-035943-4  Grammars --------  Randolph Quirk et al.  _A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language_  Longman, 1985, ISBN 0-582-51734-6  Otto Jespersen  _A Modern English Grammar on Historical Principles_ 7 volumes, Heidelberg: Carl Winter, 1909-1949  Books on usage --------------     The best survey of the history of usage disputes and how they correlate with actual usage is Webster's Dictionary of English Usage, Merriam-Webster, 1989 (WDEU -- recently reprinted as _Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage_, ISBN 0-87779-131-7).     Among conservative prescriptivists, the most highly respected usage book is the Dictionary of Modern English Usage, by H. W. Fowler -- 1st edition, 1926 (MEU); a facsimile of the original edition was published by Wordsworth Reference in 1994 (ISBN 1-85326-318-4).  The 2nd edition (MEU2), revised by Sir Ernest Gowers (Oxford University Press, 1965, ISBN 0-19-281389-7) is generally respected, although not idolized, by Fowler's devotees. A ""third edition"", _The New Fowler's Modern English Usage_ (MEU3), by Robert Burchfield (who edited the OED supplement), appeared in 1996 after a long wait (Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-869126-2).  It retains virtually none of Fowler's original text, is a sharp philosophical departure from Fowler, and has many errors, although it does contain some information not to be found elsewhere.  Oxford University Press has announced that it will keep MEU2 in print as a paperback.  (What was initially announced as an independent revision of MEU by the late Sir Kingsley Amis has turned out to be ""not a revision of Fowler in any way, but rather a from-scratch usage book of the discursive-paragraph sort"": _The King's English: A Guide to Modern Usage_, HarperCollins, 1997, ISBN 0-00-255681-2).     _The Elements of Style_ by William Strunk and E. B. White (Macmillan, 3rd ed. 1979, ISBN 0-02-418190-0) and Wilson Follett's _Modern American Usage_ (Hill and Wang, 1966, ISBN 0-8090-0139-X) have their partisans here, although they aren't as *widely* respected as Fowler.     Liberals most often refer to the Dictionary of Contemporary American Usage, by Bergen Evans and Cornelia Evans (Random House, 1957, ISBN 0-8022-0973-4  -- out of print).  Online usage guides -------------------     Jack Lynch ( jlynch@english.upenn.edu ) has a style guide that he originally wrote for business writers and modified for an English Literature course that he teaches at the University of Pennsylvania: < http://www.english.upenn.edu/~jlynch/grammar.html > Some topics that some people expect to be covered in this FAQ file, such as ""affect"" vs ""effect"", ""compose"" vs ""comprise"", and ""i.e."" vs ""e.g."", actually belong in a list of things that writers need to be cautioned about; you'll find them in Jack's guide.     A more comprehensive, but more simple-minded, guide, by the English Department of the University of Victoria, Canada, is at: < http://webserver.maclab.comp.uvic.ca/writersguide/Word/DictionUsageToc.hmtl > Bill Walsh, copy desk chief of the Washington Times, has a ""Curmudgeon's Stylebook"" at < http://www.theslot.com/ >.     Project Bartleby at Columbia has an incomplete copy of the 1918 edition of Strunk's book _The Elements of Style_ (before White got to it), with some simple hypertext markup: < http://www.columbia.edu/acis/bartleby/strunk/ > It also has the second edition of _The King's English_ by H.

From time to time, we get threads in which each post mentions *one* of these differences.  Because such a thread can go on for ever, it's helpful to delimit the topic more narrowly.     The books to get are _The Hutchinson British/American Dictionary_ by Norman Moss (Arrow, 1990, ISBN 0-09-978230-8); _British English, A to Zed_ by Norman W. Schur (Facts on File, 1987, ISBN 0-8160-1635-6); and _Modern American Usage_ by H. W. Horwill (OUP, 2nd ed., 1935).

K. Ogden in 1929. Look at < http://web.marshallnet.com/~manor/basiceng/basiceng.html > if you're interested.  (We're not.)  E-prime -------     E-prime is a subset of standard idiomatic English that eschews all forms of the verb ""to be"" (e.g., you can't say ""You are an ass"" or ""You an ass"", but you can say ""You act like an ass"").  The original reference is D. David Bourland, Jr., ""A linguistic note: write in E-prime"" _General Semantics Bulletin_, 1965/1966, 32 and 33, 60-61.  Albert Ellis wrote a book in E-prime (_Sex and the Liberated Man_).  You can also look at the April 1992 issue of the _Atlantic_ if you're interested.  (We're not.)  The following book contains articles both pro and con on E-Prime:  _To Be or Not: An E-Prime Anthology_, ed. D. David Bourland and Paul D.

The problem with ad hoc methods is that they often wrongly assume your dialect to have certain features in common with the readers' dialect.  You may pronounce ""bother"" to rhyme with ""father""; some of the readers here don't.  You may pronounce ""cot"" and ""caught"" alike; some of the readers here don't.  You may pronounce ""caught"" and ""court"" alike; some of the readers here don't.     The standard way to represent pronunciation (used in the latest British Dictionaries and by linguists worldwide) is the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).  For a complete guide to the IPA, see _Phonetic Symbol Guide_ by Geoffrey K. Pullum and William A. Ladusaw (University of Chicago Press, 1986, ISBN 0-226-68532-2).  IPA uses many special symbols; on the Net, where we're restricted to ASCII symbols, we must find a way to make do.     The following scheme is due to Evan Kirshenbaum ( kirshenbaum@hpl.hp.com ).  The complete scheme can be accessed on the WWW at: < http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Evan_Kirshenbaum/IPA/ > I show here only examples for the sounds most often referred to in this newsgroup.  Where there are two columns, the left column shows British Received Pronunciation (RP), and the right column shows a rhotic pronunciation used by at least some U.S. speakers.  (There's a WWW page that shows what the IPA symbols look like: < http://www.unil.ch/ling/phonetique/api2.html >.) The IPA itself has a home page: < http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/IPA/ipa.html >.  The consonant symbols [b], [d], [f], [h], [k], [l], [m], [n], [p], [r], [s], [t], [v], [w], and [z] have their usual English values.  [A] = [<script a>] as in:  ""ah""   /A:/  /A:/  ""cart""    /kA:t/   /kArt/  ""father""  /'fA:D@/        /'fA:D@r/  ""farther"" /'fA:D@/ /'fArD@r/  and French _bas_ /bA/.  This sound requires opening your  mouth wide and feeling resonance at the back of your mouth. [A.] = [<turned script a>] as in British:  ""bother"" /'bA.D@/  ""cot""  /kA.t/  ""hot""  /hA.t/  ""sorry""  /'sA.rI/  This symbol (for the sound traditionally called ""short o"")  is not much used to transcribe U.S. pronunciation.  [A] or  [O] is used instead, according to which vowels the speaker  merges; but the sound *used* by *many* such speakers will  certainly be *heard* by Britons as [A.].  The sound is  intermediate between [A] and [O], but typically of shorter  duration than either.  Imagine Patrick Stewart saying ""Tea,  Earl Grey, hot."" [a] as in French _ami_ /a'mi/, German _Mann_ /man/, Italian _pasta_  /'pasta/, Chicago ""pop"" /pap/, Boston ""park"" /pa:k/.  Also  in diphthongs: ""dive"" /daIv/ (yes, folks, the sound  traditionally called ""long i"" is actually a diphthong!),  ""out"" /aUt/.  Typically, [a] is not distinguished  phonemically from [A]; but if you use in ""ask"" a vowel  distinct both from the one in ""cat"" and the one in ""father"",  then [a] is what it is. [C] = [<c cedilla>] as in German (Hochdeutsch) _ich_ /IC/ [D] = [<edh>] as in ""this"" /DIs/ [E] = [<epsilon>] as in:  ""end""  /End/  /End/  ""get""  /gEt/  /gEt/  ""Mary""  /'mE@rI/ /'mE@ri/  ""merry""  /'mErI/  /'mEri/  Some U.S. speakers do not distinguish between ""Mary"",  ""merry"", and ""marry"". [e] as in:  ""eight""  /eIt/  /eIt/  ""chaos""  /'keA.s/ /'keAs/ [g] as in ""get"" /gEt/ [I] = [<iota>] as in ""it"" /It/ [I.] = [<small capital y>] as in German _Gl""uck_ /glI.k/.  Round your lips for [U] and try to say [I]. [i] as in ""eat"" /i:t/ [j] as in ""yes"" /jEs/ [N] = [<eng>] as in ""hang"" /h&N/ [O] = [<open o>] as in:  ""all""   /O:l/  /O:l/  ""caught"" /kO:t/  /kO:t/  ""court""  /kO:t/  /kOrt/  ""oil""  /OIl/  /OIl/  The [O] sound requires rounded lips, but lips making a  a bigger circle than for [o].  If you do not use the  same vowel sound in ""caught"" as in ""court"", then you are  one of the North American speakers who use [O] only  before [r]:  you do not round your lips for ""all"" and  ""caught"", and you should use some other symbol, such as  [A] or [a], to transcribe the vowel. [o] as in U.S.:  ""no""    /noU/  ""old""    /oUld/  ""omit""    /oU'mIt/  The pure sound is heard in French _beau_ /bo/.  British  Received Pronunciation does not use this sound,  substituting the diphthong /@U/ (/n@U/, /@Uld/, /@U'mIt/).  If you are one of the few speakers who distinguish such  pairs as ""aural"" and ""oral"", ""for"" and ""four"", ""for"" and  ""fore"", ""horse"" and ""hoarse"", ""or"" and ""oar"", ""or"" and  ""ore"", then you use [O] for the first and [o] for the  second word in each pair; otherwise, you use [O] for both. [R] = [<right-hook schwa>], equivalent to /@r/, /r-/, or even /V""r/ [S] = [<esh>] as in ""ship"" /SIp/ [T] = [<theta>] as in ""thin"" /TIn/ [t!] = [<turned t>] as in ""tsk-tsk"" or ""tut-tut"" /t! t!/ [U] = [<upsilon>] as in ""pull"" /pUl/ [u] as in ""ooze"" /u:z/ [V] = [<turned v>] as in British RP:  ""hurry""  /'hVrI/  ""shun""  /SVn/  ""up""  /Vp/  U.S. speakers tend not to use [V] in words (such as ""hurry"")  where the following sound is [r]:  they would say /'h@ri/.  And some U.S. speakers, especially in the eastern U.S.,  substitute [@] for [V] in all contexts.  If you do not  distinguish ""mention"" /'mEn S@n/ from ""men shun"" /'mEn SVn/,  then you should use [@] and not [V] to transcribe your  speech. [V""] = [<reversed epsilon>] as in:  ""fern""  /fV"":n/  /fV""rn/  ""hurl""  /hV"":l/  /hV""rl/  Many U.S. speakers substitute [@] for [V""], so they would  say /f@rn/, /h@rl/.  Many other U.S. speakers pronounce ""fern""  with no vowel at all:  /fr:n/, /hr:l/.  If you are one of the  few speakers who distinguish such pairs as ""pearl"" and ""purl""  (using a lower, more retracted vowel in ""purl""), then you can  transcribe ""pearl"" /p@rl/ and ""purl"" /pV""rl/. [W] = [<o-e ligature>] as in French _heure_ /Wr/, German _K""opfe_  /'kWpf@/.  Round your lips for [O] and try to say [E]. [x] as in Scots ""loch"" /lA.x/, German _Bach_ /bax/ [Y] = [<slashed o>] as in French _peu_ /pY/, German _sch""on_ /SYn/,  Scots ""guidwillie"" /gYd'wIli/.  Round your lips for [o] and  try to say [e]. [y] as in French _lune_ /lyn/, German _m""ude_ /'myd@/.  Round your  lips for [u] and try to say [i]. [Z] = [<yogh>] as in ""beige"" /beIZ/ [&] = [<ash>] as in:  ""ash""   /&S/  /&S/  ""cat""  /k&t/  /k&t/  ""marry""  /'m&rI/  /'m&ri/ [@] = [<schwa>] as in ""lemon"" /'lEm@n/ [?] = [<glottal>] as in ""uh-oh"" /V?oU/ [*] = [<fish-hook r>], a short tap of the tongue use by some U.S.  speakers in ""pedal"", ""petal"", and by Scots speakers in  ""pearl"":  all /pE*@l/.  If you are a U.S. speaker but  distinguish ""pedal"" from ""petal"", then you do not use this  sound. - previous consonant syllabic as in ""bundle"" /'bVnd@l/ or /'bVndl-/,  ""button"" /bVt@n/ or /bVtn-/ ~ previous sound nasalized : previous sound lengthened ; previous sound palatalized <h> previous sound aspirated ' following syllable has primary stress , following syllable has secondary stress  Here is the scheme compared with the transcriptions in 4 U.S. dictionaries.

Look in ""/user/ai/areas/nlp/corpora/pron"" and ""/user/ai/areas/speech/database/britpron"".  rhotic vs non-rhotic, intrusive ""r"" -----------------------------------     A rhotic speaker is one who pronounces as a consonant postvocalic ""r"", i.e. the ""r"" after a vowel in words like ""world"" /wV""rld/.  A nonrhotic speaker either does not pronounce the ""r"" at all /wV""ld/ or pronounces it as a schwa /wV""@ld/.  British Received Pronunciation (RP) and many other dialects of English are nonrhotic.     Many nonrhotic speakers (including RP speakers, but excluding most nonrhotic speakers in the southern U.S.) use a ""linking r"": they don't pronounce ""r"" in ""for"" by itself /fO:/, but they do pronounce the first ""r"" in ""for ever"" /fO: 'rEv@/.  Linking ""r"" differs from French liaison in that the former happens in any phonetically appropriate context, whereas the latter also needs the right syntactic context.     A further development of ""linking r"" is ""intrusive r"". Intrusive-r speakers, because the vowels in ""law"" (which they pronounce the same as ""lore"") and ""idea"" (which they pronounce to rhyme with ""fear"") are identical for them to vowels spelled with ""r"", intrude an r in such phrases as ""law [r]and order"" and ""The idea [r]of it!""  They do NOT intrude an [r] after vowels that are never spelled with an ""r"".  Some people blanch at intrusive r, but most RP speakers now use it.  How do Americans pronounce ""dog""? ---------------------------------     Those who round their lips when they say it would probably transcribe it /dOg/; those who don't round their lips, /dAg/.     Very few people in North America distinguish all three vowels /A/, /A./, and /O/.  Speakers in Eastern and Southern U.S. merge /A./ and /A/, so that ""bother"" and ""father"" rhyme.  Speakers in Western U.S. and in Canada merge /A./ and /O/, so that ""cot"" and ""caught"", ""Don"" and ""Dawn"" are pronounced alike.  Some speakers merge all three vowels.  The Oxford Companion to the English Language says:  ""The merger of vowels in _tot_ and _taught_ begins in a narrow band in central Pennsylvania and spreads north and south to influence the West, where the merger is universal. [...] In New England, where the merger is beginning to occur, speakers select the first vowel; in the Midland and West, the second vowel is used for both.""  Although /A./ is seldom used to transcribe American pronunciation, the vowel transcribed /O/ may sound like /A./ to non-American speakers, or it may sound like /O/.     There is a further complication with ""dog"":   U.S. dictionaries give the pronunciations /dOg/, /dAg/ in that order (and similarly with some other words ending in ""-og"", although which ones varies from dictionary to dictionary).  ""Dawg"", the name of the family dog in the comic strip ""Hi and Lois"", may be intended to convey the pronunciation /dOg/ to (or from) people who usually pronounce the word /dAg/; or it may be intended as how a child in a community where /A./ and /O/ are merged might misspell ""dog"".  Words pronounced differently according to context -------------------------------------------------     There is a general tendency in English whereby when a word with a stressed final syllable is followed by another word without a pause, the stress moves forward:  ""kangaROO"", but ""KANGaroo court""; ""afterNOON"", but ""AFTernoon nap""; ""above BOARD"", but ""an aBOVEboard deal"".  This happens chiefly in noun phrases, but not exclusively so (""acquiESCE"" versus ""ACquiesce readily"").  Consider also ""Chinese"" and all numbers ending in ""-teen"".     When ""have to"" means ""must"", the [v] in ""have"" becomes an [f]. Similarly, in ""has to"", [z] becomes [s].  When ""used to"" and ""supposed to"" are used in their senses of ""formerly"" and ""ought"", the ""-sed"" is pronounced /st/; when they're used in other senses, it's /zd/.     In many dialects, ""the"" is pronounced /D@/ before a consonant, and /DI/ before a vowel sound.  Many foreigners learning English are taught this rule explicitly.  Native English-speakers are also taught this rule when we sing in choirs.  (We do it instinctively in rapid speech; but in the slower pace of singing, it has to be brought to our conscious attention.)     Words that have different pronunciations for specialized meanings include the noun ""address"" (often stressed on the first syllable when denoting a location, but stressed on the second syllable when denoting an oration) ""contrary"" (often stressed on the second syllable when the meaning is ""perverse""); the verb ""discount"" (stressed on the first syllable when the meaning is ""to reduce in price"", but on the second syllable when the meaning is ""to disbelieve""); the verb ""process"" (stressed on the second syllable when the meaning is ""to go in procession""); the noun ""recess"" (stressed on the first syllable when it means ""a break from working"", but on the second syllable when it means ""a secluded part""); the verb ""relay"" (stressed on the first syllable when it means ""to pass on radio or TV signals"", but on the second syllable when it means ""to pass on something that was said""); and the verb ""second"" (stressed on the first syllable when it means ""to endorse a motion"", but on the second syllable when it means ""to temporarily re-assign an employee"".  ""Offence"" and ""defence"", usually stressed on the second syllable, are often in North America stressed on the first syllable when the context is team sports.  (In the U.S., of course, they are spelled with -se .)  Words whose spelling has influenced their pronunciation -------------------------------------------------------     ""Cocaine"" used to be pronounced /'coU cA: in/ (3 syllables). ""Waistcoat"" used to be pronounced /'wEskIt/.  ""Humble"" and ""human"" were borrowed from French with no [h] in their pronunciation. ""Forte"" in the sense ""strong point"" comes from French _fort_= ""strong, strong point""; the English spelling is what the OED calls an ""ignorant"" substitution of the feminine form of the adjective for the masculine noun.  But even in the French feminine form _forte_, the ""e"" is not pronounced.     ""Zoo"" is an abbreviation of ""zoological garden"".  The (popular but stigmatized) pronunciation of ""zoological"" as /zu:@'lA.dZIk@l/ (as opposed to /zoU@'lA.dZIk@l/) is due to the influence of ""zoo"".     ""Elephant"" was ""olifaunt"" in Middle English, but its spelling was restored to reflect the Latin ""elephantus"".  Similarly, ""crocodile"" was ""cokedrill"".     ""Golf"" is Scots.  The traditional Scots pronunciation is /gof/. ""Ralph"" was traditionally pronounced /reIf/ in Britain -- Gilbert and Sullivan rhymed it with ""waif"" in _H.M.S. Pinafore_; that's how the composer Ralph Vaughan Williams pronounced his name; and even today actor Ralph Fiennes (of _Schindler's List_ fame) is said to pronounce his name /reIf faInz/.     ""Medicine"" and ""regiment"" were two-syllable words in the 19th century:  /'mEdsIn/ and /'rEdZm@nt/.  /'mEdsIn/ can still be heard in RP.  In 19th-century England, ""university"" was pronounced /,ju:nIv'A:sItI/ and ""laundry"" was pronounced /'lA:ndrI/.     King Arthur would have pronounced his name /'artur/.  The h's in ""Arthur"" (now universally reflected in the pronunciation) and ""Anthony"" (reflected in the U.S. pronunciation) were added in the 15th century -- ornamentally or, in the case of ""Anthony"", because of a false connection with Greek _anthos_=""flower"".     The new pronunciations in such cases are called ""spelling pronunciations"".  The ""speak-as-you-spell movement"" is described in the MEU2 article on ""pronunciation"".  ====================================================================    USAGE DISPUTES   --------------  ""acronym"" ---------     Strictly, an acronym is a string of initial letters pronounceable as a word, such as ""NATO"".  Abbreviations like ""NBC"" have been variously designated ""alphabetisms"" and ""initialisms"", although some people do call them acronyms.  WDEU says, ""Dictionaries, however, do not make this distinction [between acronyms and initialisms] because writers in general do not""; but two of the best known books on acronyms are titled _Acronyms, Initialisms and Abbreviations Dictionary_ (19th ed., Gale, 1993) and _Concise Dictionary of Acronyms and Initialisms_ (Facts on File, 1988).    The Network Dictionary of Acronyms is available through World Wide Web (< http://www.ucc.ie/info/net/acronyms/acro.html >) or by e-mail (send the word ""help"" to freetext@iruccvax.ucc.ie ).  ""all ... not"" -------------     ""All ... not"" cannot be condemned on the grounds of novelty, as ""All that glitters is not gold"" and ""All is not lost"" show.  ""All that glitters is not gold"" is from _Parabolae_, a book of poems written circa 1175 by Alanus de Insulis, a French monk:  _Non teneas aurum totum quod splendet ut aurum_ = ""Do not hold as gold all that shines like gold"".  It was Englished by Chaucer in the _Canterbury Tales_ (1389) as:  ""But al thyng which that shyneth as the gold / Nis nat gold, as that I have herd it told.""  (Shakespeare used the wording ""All that glisters is not gold"" in _The Merchant of Venice_; ""glister"", an archaic variant of ""glisten"", is still sometimes heard in allusion to this.)  ""All is not lost"" occurs in Milton's _Paradise Lost_ (1667).     The Oxford Dictionary of English Proverbs gives the proverbs ""All truths are not to be told"" (1350), ""All things fit not all persons"" (1532), ""All feet tread not in one shoe"" (1640), ""All are not saints that go to church"" (1659), and ""All Stuarts are not sib to the king"" (1857).  It gives no proverbs at all beginning ""Not all"".     ""All ... not"" can, however, be condemned on the grounds of potential ambiguity.  When I proposed the sentence ""All the people who used the bathtub did not clean it afterwards"" as ambiguous, many people vigorously disputed that it was ambiguous.  But they were about evenly split on what it did mean!  (John Lawler writes: ""There's a very large literature on quantifier ambiguities.  Guy Carden did the definitive early studies in the '60s and '70s, and many others have contributed since then."")  ""Not all the people who used the bathtub cleaned it afterwards"" (or, if the other meaning is intended, ""None of the people who used the bathtub cleaned it afterwards"") is free of this ambiguity.     (""Not all"" can also be used rhetorically to mean ""not even all"", but only in an exalted style incompatible with bathtubs:  ""Not all the water in the rough rude sea / Can wash the balm from an anointed king"" -- Shakespeare, _Richard II_, 1595.)     Fowler quoted a correspondent who urged him to prescribe ""not all"", and commented:  ""This gentleman has logic on his side, logic has time on its side, and probably the only thing needed for his gratification is that he should live long enough.""  ""alot"" ------     This misspelling of ""a lot"" is frequently mentioned as a pet peeve.  It rarely appears in print, but is often found in the U.S. in informal writing and on Usenet.  There does not seem to be a corresponding ""alittle"".  ""alright"" ---------     The spelling ""alright"" is recorded from 1887.  It was defended by Fowler (in one of the Society for Pure English tracts, not in MEU), on the analogy of ""almighty"" and ""altogether"", and on the grounds that ""The answers are alright"" (= ""The answers are O.K."") is less ambiguous than ""The answers are all right"" (which could mean ""All the answers are right"").  But it is still widely condemned.  ""between you and I"" -------------------     The prescriptive rule is to use ""you and I"" in the same contexts as ""I"" (i.e., as a subject), and ""you and me"" in the same contexts as ""me"" (i.e., as an object).  In ""between you and me"", since ""you and me"" is the object of the preposition ""between"", ""me"" is the only correct form.  But English-speakers have a tendency to regard compounds joined with ""and"" as units, so that some speakers use ""you and me"" exclusively, and others use ""you and I"" exclusively, although such practices ""have no place in modern edited prose"" (WDEU).  ""Between you and I"" was used by Shakespeare in _The Merchant of Venice_.  Since this antedates the teaching of English grammar, it is probably *not* ""hypercorrection"".  (This is mentioned merely to caution against the hypercorrection theory, not to defend the phrase.)  Shakespeare also used ""between you and me"".  ""company is"" vs ""company are"" -----------------------------     Use of a plural verb after a singular noun denoting a group of persons (known as a noun of multitude) is commoner in the U.K. than in the U.S.  Fowler wrote:  ""_The Cabinet _is_ divided_ is better, because in the order of thought a whole must precede division; and _The Cabinet _are_ agreed_ is better, because it takes two or more to agree.""  ""could care less"" -----------------     The idiom ""couldn't care less"", meaning ""doesn't care at all"" (the meaning in full is ""cares so little that he couldn't possibly care less""), originated in Britain around 1940.  ""Could care less"", which is used with the same meaning, developed in the U.S. around 1960.  We get disputes about whether the latter was originally a mis-hearing of the former; whether it was originally ironic; or whether it arose from uses where the negative element was separated from ""could"" (""None of these writers could care less..."").  Henry Churchyard believes that this sentence by Jane Austen may be pertinent:  ""You know nothing and you care less, as people say."" (_Mansfield Park_ (1815), Chapter 29)  Meaning-saving elaborations have also been suggested:  ""As if I could care less!""; ""I could care less, but I'd have to try""; ""If I cared even one iota -- which I don't --, then I could care less.""     Recently encountered has been ""could give a damn"", used in the sense ""couldn't give a damn"".     An earlier transition in which ""not"" was dropped was the one that gave us ""but"" in the sense of ""only"".  ""I will not say but one word"", where ""but"" meant ""(anything) except"", became ""I will say but one word.""     Other idioms that say the opposite of what they mean include: ""head over heels"" (which could mean turning cartwheels, i.e. ""head over heels over head over heels"", but is also used to mean ""upside- down"", i.e. ""heels over head""); ""Don't sneeze more than you can help"" (meaning ""more than you cannot help""; ""help"" here means ""prevent""); ""It's hard to open, much less acknowledge, the letters"" (where ""less"" means ""harder"", i.e. ""more""); ""I shouldn't wonder if it didn't rain""; ""I miss not seeing you""; and ""I turned my life around 360 degrees"" -- not to mention undisputedly ironic phrases such as ""fat chance"", ""Thanks a *lot*"", and ""I should worry"".  ""could of"" ----------     We get frequent complaints about the occurrence of ""of"" in unedited prose where the meaning is ""have"".  ""Have"" contracts to ""'ve"", so ""could've"", ""might've"", ""must've"", ""should've"", ""would've"", etc. (and their negatives, ""couldn't've"", etc.), should be so spelled.  People have testified that it's got beyond a spelling mistake:  they've heard ""would of"" spoken with a clear pause between the words.     WDEU says:  ""The OED Supplement dates the naive (or ignorant) use of _of_ back to 1837.  [...Y]ou had better avoid it in your own writing. [...]  Bernstein 1977 allows that a schoolchild cannot be blamed for _could of_ -- once.""  ""different to"", ""different than"" --------------------------------     ""Different from"" is the construction that no one will object to. ""Different to"" is fairly common informally in the U.K., but rare in the U.S.  ""Different than"" is sometimes used to avoid the cumbersome ""different from that which"", etc. (e.g., ""a very different Pamela than I used to leave all company and pleasure for"" -- Samuel Richardson).  Some U.S. speakers use ""different than"" exclusively. Some people have insisted on ""different from"" on the grounds that ""from"" is required after ""to differ"".  But Fowler points out that there are many other adjectives that do not conform to the construction of their parent verbs (e.g., ""accords with"", but ""according to""; ""derogates from"", but ""derogatory to"").     The Collins Cobuild Bank of English shows choice of preposition after ""different"" to be distributed as follows:                  ""from""  ""to""    ""than""                 -----   ----    ------ U.K. writing    87.6    10.8     1.5 U.K. speech     68.8    27.3     3.9 U.S. writing    92.7     0.3     7.0 U.S. speech     69.3     0.6    30.1  ""done""=""finished"" -----------------     The OED's first citation for ""done"" in the sense of ""finished"" is from 1300, and it has been in continuous use since then.  It was used in the 1549 Book of Common Prayer (""When the Clerkes have dooen syngyng""); by Francis Bacon (""Dinner being done, the Tirsan retireth"", 1611); by John Donne (""And having done that, Thou haste done, I have no more"", 1623); by Dryden (""Now the Chime of Poetry is done"", 1697); and by Dickens (""when the reading of this document is done"", 1859).  According to The Oxford Dictionary of English Proverbs (OUP, 3rd ed., 1970, ISBN 0-19-869118-1), the proverb ""Man's work lasts till set of sun; woman's work is never done"" is first recorded with the words ""is never done"" in 1721.     In the early 20th century, for some reason objections to the use of ""done"" in the sense of ""finished"" arose in the U.S.  It became regarded as colloquial, and in 1969 only 53% of AHD's usage panel approved of it in writing.  Although these objections have now subsided, one should still beware that the two senses of ""done"" may cause ambiguity:  does ""The work will be done next month"" mean ""The work will get done next month"" or ""The work will be done by next month""?     The use of ""be done"" with a personal subject, meaning ""have finished"", is described by the OED as ""chiefly Irish, Sc., U.S., and dial.""  The first citation is dated 1766, and is from Thomas Amory, a British writer of Irish descent:  ""I was done with love for ever."" American users have included Thomas Jefferson (""One farther favor and I am done"", 1771); Mark Twain (""I am done with official life for the present"", 1872); and Robert Frost (""But I am done with apple- picking now"", 1914).   Users in the British Isles have included Robert Louis Stevenson (""We were no sooner done eating than Clumsy brought out an old, thumbed greasy pack of cards"", 1886) and George Bernard Shaw (""You can't be done:  you've eaten nothing"", 1898).     ""Be finished"" is also used in the sense of ""have finished"". Jespersen's first citation is from Oliver Goldsmith (""When we were finished for the day"", 1766).  English-speakers should be careful not to render this construction literally into other languages: Partridge recounts the story of an Englishman who in a French restaurant said _Je suis fini_ to the waiter, who looked at the ""finished"" customer with some concern.     Any of ""be done"", ""be finished"", ""have done"", and ""have finished"" may be followed either with a gerund, or with ""with"" plus any noun phrase.  If ""with"" is not used and the noun phrase is not a gerund, then only ""have finished"" may be used (""have done"" would not have the sense ""have finished"" here).  Use of ""with"" changes the meaning:  ""I have finished construction of the building"" means that the building is fully constructed, whereas ""I have finished with construction of the building"" means merely that *my* part is over.     These uses of ""be done"" and ""be finished"" are examples of what Fowler called the ""intransitive past participle"", where, instead of the more usual transformation:       ""A {transitive verb}s B"" -> ""B is {transitive verb}ed"" we see the transformation:       ""A {intransitive verb}s"" -> ""A is {intransitive verb}ed"" Fowler gives the examples:  fallen angels, the risen sun, a vanished hand, past times, the newly arrived guest, a grown girl, absconded debtors, escaped prisoners, the deceased lady, the dear departed, coalesced stems, a collapsed lorry, we are agreed, a couched lion, an eloped pair, an expired lease.  double ""is"" -----------     Double ""is"", as in ""The reason is, is that..."" is a recent U.S. development, much decried.  According to MEU3, it was first noticed in 1971 and had spread to the U.K. by 1987.  Of course, ""What this is is..."" is undisputedly correct.  ""due to"" --------     ""Due to"" meaning ""caused by"" is undisputedly correct in contexts where ""due"" can be construed as an adjective (e.g., ""failure due to carelessness"").  Its use in contexts where ""due"" is an adverb (""He failed due to carelessness"") has been disputed.  Fowler says that ""_due to_ is often used by the illiterate as though it had passed, like _owing to_, into a mere compound preposition"".  But Fowler was writing in 1926; what hadn't happened then may well have happened by now.  ""functionality"" ---------------     ""Functionality"" is often attacked as a needless long variant of ""function"".   But they are differentiated in meaning.  ""The function of a screwdriver is to turn screws.  Its functionality includes prying open paint cans, stirring paint, scraping paint, and acting as a chisel.  The function is what it is designed to do.  The functionality is what you can do with it."" --  Evan Kirshenbaum. A thing's functionality includes its functions if and only if it does what it was designed to do.  This specialized meaning of ""functionality"" is not yet in most dictionaries.  The earliest citation we have was found by Fred Shapiro in the June 1977 issue of Fortune:  ""The way to grow, an I.B.M. maxim says, is to 'increase the functionality of the system,' or, in plain English, to give the customer the capacity to do more than he wants to do in the knowledge that he inevitably will.""     Mark Odegard suggests a similar distinction between ""mode"" and ""modality"":  ""A 'mode' is a way of doing something.  A 'modality' is doing something according to a protocol.""     Outside technical contexts, the word ""functionality"" may well strike some readers as jargonistic.  Thought may be needed to find a substitute that works in the context.  ""Utility"" is sometimes suggested, but consider:  ""The utility of mainframe computers has declined sharply over the past decade; their functionality has remained the same.""  Here, ""their capabilities have remained the same"" might be the best solution.  Gender-neutral pronouns -----------------------     ""Singular 'they'"" is the name generally given to the use of ""they"", ""them"", ""their"", or ""theirs"" with a singular antecedent such as ""someone"" or ""everyone"", as in ""Everyone was blowing their nose."" (It does not refer to the use of singular verbs in such mock- illiterate sentences as ""Them's the breaks"" and ""Them as has, gets.""  Any verb agreeing with a singular ""they"" is plural: ""Someone killed him, and they are going to pay for it."")     Singular ""they"" has been used in English since the time of Chaucer.  Prescriptive grammarians have traditionally (since 1746, although the actual practice goes right back to 1200) prescribed ""he"":  ""Everyone was blowing his nose.""  In 1926, Fowler wrote that singular ""they"" had an ""old-fashioned sound [...]; few good modern writers would flout the grammarians so conspicuously.""  But in recent decades, singular ""they"" has gained popularity as a result of the move towards gender-neutral language.     For a defence of singular ""they"", with examples from Shakespeare, Jane Austen, and others, see Henry Churchyard's page at < http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~churchh/austheir.html >.  But note that not all of us are as keen on singular ""they"" as Henry is.  Asked to fill in the blank in sentences such as ""A patient who doesn't accurately report ___ sexual history to the doctor runs the risk of misdiagnosis"", only 3% of AHD3's usage panel chose ""their"".  AHD3's usage note says:  ""this solution ignores a persistent intuition that expressions such as _everyone_ and _each student_ should in fact be treated as grammatically singular.""  An example from Fowler wittily demonstrates how singular ""they"" never seems to agree perfectly:  ""Everyone was blowing their nose""?  ""Everyone was blowing their noses""?  ""Everyone were blowing their noses""?     Proposals for other gender-neutral pronouns get made from time to time, and some can be found in actual use (""sie"" and ""hir"" are the ones most frequently found on Usenet).   Cecil Adams, in _Return of the Straight Dope_ (Ballantine, 1994, ISBN 0-345-38111-4), says that some eighty such terms have been proposed, the first of them in the 1850s.  John Chao ( chao@hoss.ee.udel.edu ) was constructing a long FAQ on this topic: < http://www.lumina.net/OLD/gfp/ >.     Discussions about gender-neutral pronouns tend to go round and round and never reach a conclusion.  Please refrain.     (We also get disputes about the use of the word ""gender"" in the sense of ""sex"", i.e., of whether a human being is male or female. This also dates from the 14th century.  By 1900 it was restricted to jocular use, but it has now been revived because of the ""sexual relations"" sense of ""sex"".)  ""God rest you merry, gentlemen"" -------------------------------     First of all, ""God rest you merry, gentlemen"" is correct, not ""God rest you, merry gentlemen.""  The verb ""rest"" is used here in the way now most familiar from the phrase ""rest assured"".  In earlier English it was used with a variety of other complements:  the OED has ""rest thee merry"" from 1400; ""rest you well"" from 1420; ""God rest you merry"", ""rest you fair"", and ""rest you happy"", and ""rest myself content"" from Shakespeare; ""rest thee tranquil"" from Shelley, and ""rest thee sure"" from Tennyson.     The nouns ""rest""=""repose"" and ""rest""=""remainder"" are etymologically unconnected:  the former is from Germanic (whence German _Ruhe_); the latter is from Old French _rester_ from Latin _restare_ from _re-_=""back"" + _stare_=""stand"".  Some dictionaries connect ""rest"" as in ""rest you merry"" with ""rest""=""remainder"" rather than ""rest""=""repose"".  So ""God rest you merry"" would mean ""May God keep you (or make you and keep you) merry.""  Semantic leakage from ""rest""=""repose"" would explain why we never see uses like ""rest agitated"" or ""rest you sad.""     People sometimes wonder whether ""rest you merry"" should be ""rest you merrily"".  Rest assuredly that it shouldn't. :-)     The song is now widely misunderstood as being addressed to ""merry gentlemen"", first because this use of ""rest"" is now obsolete except in the phrases ""rest assured"" and ""rest easy"", and secondly because the familiar tune supports that stress pattern.  A tune ""once ubiquitous in the West Country"" of England and that better supports the stress pattern of ""God rest you merry, gentlemen"" is given in _The Oxford Book of Carols_ (by Percy Darmer et al., Oxford, 1928) and can be heard in _The Carol Album_, conducted by Andrew Parrott (EMI, 1990, 0777-7-49809-2-0).     The other dispute about this phrase is whether the pronoun should be ""you"" or ""ye"".  In the references to the song retrieved by AltaVista, ""ye"" outnumbers ""you"" by 5 to 1.  Traditional grammarians would prefer ""you"", since the pronoun is the object of the verb ""rest"" and hence should be in the accusative.  Although there was some historical use of ""ye"" in the accusative (e.g., Thomas Ford's madrigal ""Since first I saw your face I resolved / To honour and renown ye""), in the prestigious English of the King James Version of the Bible, ""ye"" was always nominative and ""you"" was always accusative.  (This is counter-mnemonic, since ""thou"" was nominative and ""thee"" was accusative.)  The Oxford Book of Carols quotes the words from a broadsheet published circa 1800 as:  ""God rest you merry gentlemen"".  In _A Christmas Carol_ (1843), Charles Dickens wrote:  ""The owner of one scant young nose [...] stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol: but at the first sound of 'God bless you, merry gentleman! May nothing you dismay!' Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action, that the singer fled in terror [...]"".  ""hopefully"", ""thankfully"" -------------------------     The traditional, undisputed senses of these words are active: ""in a hopeful manner"", ""in a thankful manner"".     The OED's first citation for ""hopefully"" in the passive sense (= ""It is to be hoped that"") is from 1932, but no unmistakable citation has been found between then and 1954.  (WDEU has three ambiguous citations dated 1941, 1951, and 1954.)  WDEU's first citation for the passive sense of ""thankfully"" (= ""We can be thankful that"") is from 1963.  These uses became popular in the early '60s, and have been widely criticized on the grounds that they should have been ""hopably"" and ""thankably"" (on the analogy of ""arguably"", ""predictably"", ""regrettably"", ""inexplicably"", etc.), and on the grounds that ""I hope"" is more direct.     The disputed, passive use of ""hopefully"" is often referred to as ""sentence-modifying""; but it can also modify a single word, as is hopefully clear from this example. :-)  Most adverbs that can modify sentences -- including ""apparently"", ""clearly"", ""curiously"", ""evidently"", ""fortunately"", ""ironically"", ""mercifully"", ""sadly"", and the ""-ably"" examples above -- can be converted into ""It is apparent that"", etc.  But a few adverbs are used in a way that instead must be construed with an ellipsis of ""to speak"" or ""speaking"".  These include ""briefly"" (the OED has citations of ""briefly"" used in this way from 1514 on, including one from Shakespeare), ""seriously"" (1644; used by Fowler in his article DIDACTICISM in MEU), ""strictly"" (1680), ""roughly"" (1841), ""frankly"" (1847), ""honestly"" (1898), ""hopefully"", and ""thankfully"".  Acquisition of such a use is far from automatic; for example, no one uses ""fearfully"" in a manner analogous to ""hopefully"".     AHD3 says:  ""It might have been expected that the flurry of objections to _hopefully_ would have subsided once the usage became well established.  Instead, increased currency of the usage appears only to have made the critics more adamant.  In the 1969 Usage Panel survey the usage was acceptable to 44 percent of the Panel; in the most recent survey [1992] it was acceptable to only 27 percent. [...]  Yet the Panel has not shown any signs of becoming generally more conservative:  in the very same survey panelists were disposed to accept once-vilified usages such as the employment of _contact_ and _host_ as verbs.""  AHD3 quotes William Safire as saying:  ""The word 'hopefully' has become the litmus test to determine whether one is a language snob or a language slob.""     Discussions about ""hopefully"" and ""thankfully"" go round and round for ever without reaching a conclusion.  We advise you to refrain.  ""if I was"" vs ""if I were"" -------------------------     See under ""Subjunctive"" below.  The following pair of sentences shows the traditional and useful distinction:  ""If I was a hopeless cad, I apologize."" ""If I were a hopeless cad, I would never apologize.""  ""impact""=""to affect"" --------------------     ""Impact"", which comes from Latin _impactus_, past participle of _impingere_ = ""to push against"", is first recorded in English in 1601 in the form of the past participle, ""impacted"".  The verb ""to impact"", meaning ""to press closely into or in something"", dates from 1791.  The noun ""impact"" dates from 1781.  The (undisputed) expression ""impacted wisdom tooth"" dates from 1876.     There is another English verb derived from Latin _impingere_: ""to impinge"", first recorded in 1605.  ""To impinge on"" shares with ""to impact"" the sense ""to come sharply in contact with"", and some people consider it stylistically preferable.  Unlike ""to impact"", ""to impinge on"" has acquired the figurative sense ""to encroach on"", possibly through confusion with ""to infringe"".  This sense is attested from 1758 on.     The usage dispute centres on the use of the verb ""to impact (on)"" in the sense ""to affect, to have an effect on, to influence"".  The OED's earliest citations where this is clearly the sense are:  for ""impact on"", 1951; and for transitive ""impact"", 1963.     Opposition to these uses is widespread.  84% of AHD3's Usage Panel disapproved of ""social pathologies [...] that impact heavily on such a community""; and 95% disapproved of ""a potential for impacting our health"".  Among the objections to such use of ""impact"" are that it sounds pretentious and bureaucratic, and that it may connote to the reader violence that the author did not intend.  The latter objection can apply also to ""impact"" the noun.  Kenneth Hudson, in _The Dictionary of Diseased English_ (Macmillan, 1977), noted: ""'Yves St. Laurent's Triangles give even more design impact to your bed' (Washington Star, 17.10.76) is not the happiest of sentences. 'Make a nice bed look even better' would have been more reassuring.""  ""It needs cleaned"" ------------------  is not standard English, although ""It needs to be cleaned"", ""It needs cleaning"", and ""I need it cleaned"" all are.  ""It needs cleaned"" is common informally in some parts of the U.S., and in Scotland, where it may have originated.  ""It's me"" vs ""It is I"" ---------------------- (freely adapted from an article by Roger Lustig)     Fowler says:  ""_me_ is technically wrong in _It wasn't me_ etc.; but the phrase being of its very nature colloquial, such a lapse is of no importance"".     The rule for what he and others consider technically right is *not* (as is commonly misstated) that the nominative should *always* be used after ""to be"".  Rather, it is that ""to be"" should link two noun phrases of the same case, whether this be nominative or accusative:   I believe that he is I.  Who do you believe that he is?  I believe him to be me.  Whom do you believe him to be?  According to the traditional grammar being used here, ""to be"" is not a transitive verb, but a *copulative* verb.  When you say that A is B, you don't imply that A, by being B, is doing something to B. (After all, B is also doing it to A.)  Other verbs considered copulative are ""to become"", ""to remain"", ""to seem"", and ""to look"".     Sometimes in English, though, ""to be"" does seem to have the force of a transitive verb; e.g., in Gelett Burgess's:   I never saw a Purple Cow,    I never hope to see one;  But I can tell you, anyhow,    I'd rather see than be one.  The occurrence of ""It's me"", etc., is no doubt partly due to this perceived transitive force.  In the French _C'est moi_, often cited as analogous, _moi_ is not in the accusative, but a special form known as the ""disjunctive"", used for emphasis.  If _etre_ were a transitive verb in French, _C'est moi_ would be _Ce m'est_.     In languages such as German and Latin that inflect between the nominative and the accusative, B in ""A is B"" is nominative just like A.  In English, no nouns and only a few personal pronouns (""I"", ""we"", ""thou"", ""he"", ""she"", ""they"" and ""who"") inflect between the nominative and the accusative.  In other words, we've gotten out of the habit, for the most part.     Also, in English we derive meaning from word position, far more than one would in Latin, somewhat more than in German, even.  In those languages, one can rearrange sentences drastically for rhetorical or other purposes without confusion (heh) because inflections (endings, etc.) tell you how the words relate to one another.  In English, ""The dog ate the cat"" and ""The cat ate the dog"" are utterly different in meaning, and if we wish to have the former meaning with ""cat"" prior to ""dog"" in the sentence, we have to say ""The cat was eaten by the dog"" (change of voice) or ""It is the cat that the dog ate.""  In German, one can reverse the meaning by inflecting the word (or its article):  _Der Hund frass die Katze_ and _Den Hund frass die Katze_ reverse the meaning of who ate whom. In Latin, things are even more flexible: almost any word order will do:  Feles edit canem  Feles canem edit  Canem edit feles  Canem feles edit  Edit canem feles  Edit feles canem all mean the same, the choice of word order being made perhaps for rhetorical or poetic purpose.     English is pretty much the opposite of that:  hardly any inflection, great emphasis on order.  As a result, things have gotten a little irregular with the personal pronouns.  And there's uncertainty as to how to use them; the usual rules aren't there, because the usual word needs no rules, being the same for nominative and accusative.     The final factor is the traditional use of Latin grammatical concepts to teach English grammar.   This historical quirk dates to the 17th century, and has never quite left us.  From this we get the Latin-derived rule, which Fowler still acknowledges.  And we *do* follow that rule to some extent: ""Who are they?"" (not ""Who are them?"" or ""Whom are they?"")  ""We are they!"" (in response to the preceding)  ""It is I who am at fault.""  ""That's the man who he is.""     But not always.  ""It is me"" is attested since the 16th Century. (Speakers who would substitute ""me"" for ""I"" in the ""It is I who am at fault"" example would also sacrifice the agreement of person, and substitute ""is"" for ""am"".)  ""less"" vs ""fewer"" ----------------     The rule usually encountered is:  use ""fewer"" for things you count (individually), and ""less"" for things you measure:  ""fewer apples"", ""less water"".  Since ""less"" is also used as an adverb (""less successful""), ""fewer"" helps to distinguish ""fewer successful professionals"" (fewer professionals who are successful) from ""less successful professionals"" (professionals who are less successful). (No such distinction is possible with ""more"", which serves as the antonym of both ""less"" and ""fewer"".)     ""Less"" has been used in the sense of ""fewer"" since the time of King Alfred the Great (9th century), and is still common in that sense, especially informally in the U.S.; but in British English it became so rare that the 1st edition of the OED (in a section prepared in 1902) gave no citation more recent than 1579 and gave the usage label ""Now regarded as incorrect.""  The 2nd edition of the OED added two 19th-century citations, and changed the usage label to ""Frequently found but generally regarded as incorrect.""     Fowler mentioned it only in passing, and cited no real examples. In a section whose main intent was to disparage ""less"" in the sense ""smaller"" or ""lower"", he wrote:  ""It is true that _less_ and _lesser_ were once ordinary comparatives of _little_ [...] and that therefore they were roughly equivalent in sense to our _smaller_ [...].  The modern tendency is so to restrict _less_ that it means not _smaller_, but _a smaller amount of_, is the comparative rather of _a little_ than of _little_, and is consequently applied only to things that are measured by amount and not by size or quality or number, nouns with which _much_ and _little_, not _great_ and _small_, nor _high_ and _low_, nor _many_ and _few_, are the appropriate contrasted epithets:  _less butter, courage_; but _a smaller army, table_; _a lower price, degree_; _fewer opportunities, people_.  Plurals, and singulars with _a_ or _an_, will naturally not take _less_; _less tonnage_, but _fewer ships_; _less manpower_, but _fewer men_ [...]; though a few plurals like _clothes_ and _troops_, really equivalent to singulars of indefinite amount, are exceptions:  _could do with less troops_ or _clothes_.""     Webster's New International Dictionary, 2nd ed. (1934), gave the usage label ""now incorrect, according to strict usage, except with a collective; as, to wear _less_ clothes.""  Of the panelists for The Harper Dictionary of Contemporary Usage (1975), 76% said that they observed ""less""/""fewer"" distinction in speech, and 85% in writing. The editors noted:  ""even those panelists who have not observed the distinction in the past now regard it as a useful precept to bear in mind in the future.""     Partisans of ""fewer"" use ""one car fewer"" rather than ""one fewer car"", and ""far fewer"" rather than ""much fewer"".  ""like"" vs ""as"" --------------     For making comparisons (i.e., asserting that one thing is similar to another), the prescribed choices are:     1.  A is like B.    2.  A behaves like B.    3.  A behaves as B does.    4.  A behaves as in an earlier situation.  In 1 and 2, ""like"" governs a noun (or a pronoun or a noun phrase). In 3, ""as"" introduces a clause with a noun and a verb.  In 4, ""as"" introduces a prepositional phrase.  Look at what the word introduces, and you will know which to use.     In informal English, ""like"" is often used in place of ""as"" in sentences of type 3 and 4.  ""Like"" has been been used in the sense of ""as if"" since the 14th century, and in the sense of ""as"" since the 15th century, but such use was fairly rare until the 19th century, and ""a writer who uses the construction in formal style risks being accused of illiteracy or worse"" (AHD3).  ""Like"" in 1 and 2 is a preposition; ""as""/""like"" in 3 or 4 and ""as if"" are conjunctions.  Fowler put ""_Like_ as conjunction"" first in his list of ""ILLITERACIES"" (he defined ""illiteracy"" as ""offence against the literary idiom"").     In some sentences of type of 3, ""as"" may sound too formal: ""Pronounce it as you spell it.""  To avoid both this formality and the stigma of ""like"" here, you may use ""the way"":  ""Pronounce it the way you spell it.""  But this solution is available only if you are specifying a single way; it doesn't work, for example, in ""Play it as it's never been played before.""  (""Play it in a way..."" might work here, but lacks the connotations of enthusiasm and excellence that ""play it as"" has.)     The most famous use of ""like"" as a conjunction was in the 1950s slogan for Winston Cigarettes:  ""Winston tastes good, like a cigarette should.""  The New Yorker wrote that ""it would pain [Sir Winston Churchill] dreadfully"", but in fact conjunctive ""like"" was used by Churchill himself in informal speech:  ""We are overrun by them, like the Australians are by rabbits.""  ""Like"" in the sense of ""as if"" was, until recently, more often heard in the Southern U.S. than elsewhere, and was perceived by Britons as an Americanism. When used in this sense, it is never now followed by the inflected past subjunctive:  people say ""like it is"" or ""like it was"", not ""like it were"".     Sometimes, ""as"" introduces a noun phrase with no following verb. When it does, it does not signify a qualitative comparison, but rather may:  a) indicate a role being played.  ""They fell on the supplies as men starving"" means that they were actually starving men; in ""They fell on the supplies like men starving"", one is *comparing* them to starving men.  ""You're acting as a fool"" might be appropriate if you obtained the job of court jester; ""You're acting like a fool"" expresses the more usual meaning.  b) introduce examples.  (""Some animals, as the fox and the squirrel, have bushy tails."")  ""Such as"" and ""like"" are more common in this use. For the use of ""like"" here, see the next entry.  c) be short for ""as ... as"":  ""He's deaf as a post"" means ""He's as deaf as a post"" (a quantitative comparison).  ""like"" vs ""such as"" -------------------     The Little, Brown Handbook (6th ed., HarperCollins, 1995) says: ""Strictly, _such as_ precedes an example that represents a larger subject, whereas _like_ indicates that two subjects are comparable. _Steve has recordings of many great saxophonists such as Ben Webster and Lee Konitz._  _Steve wants to be a great jazz saxophonist like Ben Webster and Lee Konitz._""  Nobody would use ""such as"" in the second sentence; the disputed usage is ""like"" in the first sentence.     Opposing it are:  earlier editions of The Little, Brown Handbook (which did not use the hedge ""strictly""); the _Random House English Language Desk Reference_ (1995); _The Globe and Mail Style Book_ (Penguin, 1995); _Webster's Dictionary & Thesaurus_ (Shooting Star Press, 1995); _Fine Print: Reflections on the Writing Art_ by James Kilpatrick (Andrews and McMeel, 1993); _The Wordwatcher's Guide to Good Writing and Grammar_ by Morton S.  Freeman (Writer's Digest, 1990); _Word Perfect:  A Dictionary of Current English Usage_ by John O. E. Clark (Harrap, 1987); and _Keeping Up the Style_ by Leslie Sellers (Pitman, 1975).     The OED, first edition, in its entry on ""like"" (which is in a section prepared in 1903), said that ""in modern use"", ""like"" ""often = 'such as', introducing a particular example of a class respecting which something is predicated"".  Merriam-Webster Editorial Department unearthed the following 19th-century citations for me: ""Good sense, like hers, will always act when really called upon"", Jane Austen, _Mansfield Park_, 1814; ""A straight-forward, open-hearted man, like Weston, and a rational unaffected woman, like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to their own concerns"", Jane Austen, _Emma_, 1816; ""[...] to argue that because a well-stocked island, like Great Britain, has not, as far as is known [...]"", Charles Darwin, _Origin of the Species_, 1859.     Fowler apparently saw nothing wrong with ""like"" in this sense: in the Concise Oxford Dictionary, he gave ""resembling, such as"" without a usage label as one its meanings, and gave the example ""a critic like you"", which he explained as ""of the class that you exemplify"".  And he used it himself in the passage quoted under ""'less' vs 'fewer'"" above.  More commonly, though, he wrote ""such ...  as"" when using examples to define the set (""such bower-birds' treasures as _au pied de la lettre_, _a` merveille_, [...] and _sauter aux yeux_""), and ""as"" or ""such as"" when the words preceding the examples sufficed to define the set (""familiar words in -o, as _halo_ and _dado_""; ""simple narrative poems in short stanzas, such as _Chevy Chase_"").  This is the same restrictive vs nonrestrictive mentioned under ""'that' vs 'which'"": ""Ballads, such as Chevy Chase, can be danced to"" would imply that all ballads can be danced to, whereas ""Such ballads as Chevy Chase can be danced to"" would not.     ""Such ... as"" is now confined to formal use, and for informal restrictive uses where the example is not introduced merely for the sake of example, but is the actual topic of the sentence, ""like"" is now obligatory:  ""I'm so glad to have a friend like Paul.""  _Guide to Canadian English Usage_ by Margery Fee and Janice McAlpine (Oxford, 1997, ISBN 0-19-540841-1) rightly points out that ""such as""  would not be idiomatic here.     _Modern American Usage_ by Wilson Follett (Hill and Wang, 1966) says:  ""_Such as_ is close in meaning to _like_ and may often be interchanged with it.  The shade of difference between them is that _such as_ leads the mind to imagine an indefinite group of objects [...].  The other comparing word _like_ suggests a closer resemblance among the things compared [...].  [...P]urists object to phrases of the type _a writer like Shakespeare_, _a leader like Lincoln_.  No writer, say these critics, _is_ like Shakespeare; and in this they are wrong; writers are alike in many things and the context usually makes clear what the comparison proposes to our attention.  _Such as Shakespeare_ may sound less impertinent, but if Shakespeare were totally incomparable _such as_ would be open to the same objection as _like_.""  Bernstein, in _Miss Thistlebottom's Hobgoblins_ (Farrar, 1971), agrees, calling those who object to ""German composers like Beethoven"" ""nit-pickers"".  ""more/most/very unique"" -----------------------     Fowler and other conservatives urge restricting the meaning of ""unique"" to ""having no like or equal"".  (OED says ""in this sense, readopted from French at the end of the 18th Century and regarded as a foreign word down to the middle of the 19th."")  Used in this sense, it is an incomparable:  either something is ""unique"" or it isn't, and there can be no degrees of uniqueness. Those who use phrases like ""more unique"", ""most unique"", and ""very unique"" are using ""unique"" in the weaker sense of ""unusual, distinctive"".  ""mouses"" vs ""mice"" ------------------     _Wired Style:  Principles of English Usage in the Digital Age_ (ed. Constance Hale, HardWired, 1996, ISBN 1-888869-01-1) says: ""What's the plural of that small, rolling pointing device invented by Douglas Engelbart in 1964?  We prefer ~mouses~.  ~Mice~ is just too suggestive of furry little creatures.  But both terms are common, so take your pick.  We actually emailed Engelbart to see what he'd say.  His answer?  'Haven't given the matter much thought.'    ""In fact, Engelbart shared credit for the name with 'a small group in my lab at SRI.'  Nobody among his colleagues seems to remember who first nicknamed the device, but all agree that the name was given because the cord ('tail') initially came out the 'back' of the device.  'Very soon we realised that the connecting wire should be brought out the ""front"" instead of the back,' Engelbart notes, but by then the name had stuck.""     _The Microsoft(R) Manual of Style for Technical Publications_ (ed. Amanda Clark, Microsoft Press, 1995, ISBN 1-55615-939-0) says:  ""Avoid using the plural _mice_; if you need to refer to more than one mouse, use _mouse devices_.""     Markus Laker reports from the U.K.:  ""In the early eighties, a few people did selfconsciously say 'mouses', but the traditional plural 'mice' gained ground rapidly and is now more or less universal here.""  ""near miss"" -----------     A near miss is a near-hit.  ""none is"" vs ""none are"" -----------------------     With mass nouns, you have to use the singular.  (""None of the wheat is..."")  With count nouns, you can use either the singular or the plural.  (""None of the books is..."" or ""None of the books are..."")  Usually, the plural sounds more natural, unless you're trying to emphasize the idea of ""not one"", or if the words that follow work better in the singular.     The fullest (prescriptive) treatment is in Eric Partridge's book _Usage and Abusage_ (Penguin, 1970, 0-14-051024-9).  In the original edition Partridge had prescribed the singular in certain cases, but a rather long-winded letter from a correspondent persuaded him to retract.  Plurals of Latin/Greek words ----------------------------     Not all Latin words ending in ""-us"" had plurals in ""-i"". ""Apparatus"", ""cantus"", ""coitus"", ""hiatus"", ""impetus"", ""Jesus"", ""lapsus linguae"", ""nexus"", ""plexus"", ""prospectus"", ""sinus"", and ""status"" were 4th declension in Latin, and had plurals in ""-us"" with ""genus"", and ""opus"" were 3rd declension, with plurals ""corpora"", ""genera"", and ""opera"".  ""Virus"" is not attested in the plural in Latin, and is of a rare form (2nd declension neuter in -us) that makes it debatable what the Latin plural would have been; the only plural in English is ""viruses"".  ""Omnibus"" and ""rebus"" were not nominative nouns in Latin.  ""Ignoramus"" was not a noun in Latin.     Not all classical words ending in ""-a"" had plurals in ""-ae"". ""Anathema"", ""aroma"", ""bema"", ""carcinoma"", ""charisma"", ""diploma"", ""dogma"", ""drama"", ""edema"", ""enema"", ""enigma"", ""lemma"", ""lymphoma"", ""magma"", ""melisma"", ""miasma"", ""sarcoma"", ""schema"", ""soma"", ""stigma"", ""stoma"", and ""trauma"" are from Greek, where they had plurals in ""-ata"".  ""Quota"" was not a noun in Latin.  (It comes from the Latin expression _quota pars_, where _quota_ is the feminine form of an interrogative pronoun meaning ""what number"".  In *that* use, it did have plural _quotae_, but in English the only plural is ""quotas"".)     Not all classical-sounding words ending in ""-um"" have plurals in ""-a"".  ""Factotum"", ""nostrum"", ""quorum"", and ""variorum"" were not nouns in Latin.  (_Totus_ = ""everything"" and _noster_ = ""our"" were conjugated like nouns in Latin; but ""factotum"" comes from _fac totum_ = ""do everything"", and ""nostrum"" comes from _nostrum remedium_ = ""our remedy"".)  ""Conundrum"", ""panjandrum"", ""tantrum"", and ""vellum"" are not Latin words.     If in doubt, consult a dictionary (or use the English plural in ""-s"" or ""-es"").  One plural that you *will* find in U.S. dictionaries, ""octopi"", raises the ire of purists (the Greek plural is ""octopodes"").     The classical-style plurals of ""penis"" and ""clitoris"" are ""penes"" /'pi:ni:z/ and ""clitorides"" /klI'tOrIdi:z/.     The Latin plural of ""curriculum vitae"" is ""curricula vitae"". Some people who know a little Latin think it should be ""curricula vitarum"" (since _vitae_ means ""of a life"" and _vitarum_ means ""of lives""); but to an ancient Roman, ""curricula vitarum"" would suggest that each document described more than one life.  This is a feature of the Latin genitive of content, which differs in this regard from the more common Latin genitive of possession.  Foreign plurals => English singulars ------------------------------------     Some uses of classical plurals as singulars in English are undisputed:  ""opera"", ""stamina"", ""aspidistra"".  (""Opera"", still used as the plural of ""opus"", became singular in Vulgar Latin, and then in Italian acquired the sense ""musical drama"", giving rise to the English word.)  ""Agenda"" once excited controversy but is now accepted.  Others are the subject of current controversy:  ""data"" (used by Winston Churchill!), ""erotica"", ""insignia"", ""media"", ""regalia"", ""trivia"".  Yet others are still widely stigmatized: ""bacteria"", ""candelabra"", ""criteria"", ""curricula"", ""memorabilia"", ""phenomena"", ""strata"".     ""Bona fides"", ""kudos"", and ""minutia"" are singulars in Latin or Greek.     ""Graffiti"" (plural in Italian) is disputed in English.  But ""zucchini"" (also plural in Italian) is the invariable singular form in English (the English plural is ""zucchini"" or ""zucchinis""). ""Biscotti"" seems to be going the same way.  The names of types of pasta (cannelloni, cappelletti, ditali, fusilli, gnocchi, maccheroni, manicotti, ravioli, rigatoni, spaghetti, spaghettini, taglierini, tortellini, vermicelli, ziti, which are masculine plural in Italian; and conchiglie, farfalle, fettuccine, linguine, rotelle, which are feminine plural; some of the -e words are often spelled with -i in English; _maccheroni_ is ""macaroni"" in English) are treated as mass nouns in English:  they take singular verbs, but plurals are not made from them.  (Many of the words listed as disputed above are also treated as mass nouns when they are used as singulars.)  Preposition at end ------------------     Yes, yes, we've all heard the following anecdotes:  (1) Winston Churchill was editing a proof of one of his books, when he noticed that an editor had clumsily rearranged one of Churchill's sentences so that it wouldn't end with a preposition.  Churchill scribbled in the margin, ""This is the sort of English up with which I will not put.""  (This is often quoted with ""arrant nonsense"" substituted for ""English"", or with other variations.  The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations cites Sir Ernest Gowers' _Plain Words_ (1948), where the anecdote begins, ""It is said that Churchill...""; so we don't know exactly what Churchill wrote.  According to the Oxford Companion to the English Language, Churchill's words were ""bloody nonsense"" and the variants are euphemisms.)  (2) The Guinness Book of (World) Records used to have a category for ""most prepositions at end"".  The incumbent record was a sentence put into the mouth of a boy who didn't want to be read excerpts from a book about Australia as a bedtime story:  ""What did you bring that book that I don't want to be read to from out of about 'Down Under' up for?""  Mark Brader ( msb@sq.com -- all this is to the best of his recollection; he didn't save the letter, and doesn't have access to the British editions) wrote to Guinness, asking:  ""What did you say that the sentence with the most prepositions at the end was 'What did you bring that book that I don't want to be read to from out of about ""Down Under"" up for?' for?  The preceding sentence has one more.""  Norris McWhirter replied, promising to include this improvement in the next British edition; but actually it seems that Guinness, no doubt eventually realising that this could be done recursively, dropped the category.  (3) ""Excuse me, where is the library at?"" ""Here at Hahvahd, we never end a sentence with a preposition."" ""O.K.  Excuse me, where is the library at, *asshole*?""  Fowler and nearly every other respected prescriptivist see NOTHING wrong with ending a clause with a preposition; Fowler calls it a ""superstition"".  (""Never end a sentence with a preposition"" is how the superstition is usually stated, although it would ""naturally"" extend to any placement of a preposition later than the noun or pronoun it governs.)  Indeed, Fowler considers ""a good land to live in"" grammatically superior to ""a good land in which to live"", since one cannot say *""a good land which to inhabit"".  ""quality"" ---------     The attributive use of ""quality"", as in ""quality workmanship"", is sometimes questioned.  The alternative that nobody will object to is ""high-quality"" (for which OED's first citation is from 1910).     OED's first citation of ""quality"" in the sense ""high quality, excellence"" is from Shakespeare (1606):  ""The Grecian youths are full of qualitie, Their loving well composed, with guift of nature."" (Troilus and Cressida, IV iv).  It seems to have been in steady use since then.  The proverb ""Quality is better than quantity"" is first recorded in 1604 in the form ""The gravest wits [...] The qualitie, not quantitie, respect.""     The attributive use of ""quality"" is another matter.  OED has a citation of ""quality air"" from 1701; but there is only scattered evidence between then and the following note in _A Manual for Writers_, by John Matthews Manly and John Arthur Powell (University of Chicago Press, 2nd ed., 1915):  ""~Quality~ is grossly misused as an adjective; fortunately the misuse is confined almost entirely to advertisements, where all sorts of violence are done to the language:  'Quality clothes!  Built (!) from the most exclusive (!) designs.'""  The next dictionary evidence after the OED's citation is the listing in Webster's New International Dictionary, 2nd ed. (1934), which labels it ""colloquial, chiefly U.S."".  Chamber's Twentieth Century Dictionary, 1959 edition, calls it ""vulgar"". Modern dictionaries do not give it a usage label.  It is attacked by Morton S. Freeman (_A Handbook of Problem Words and Phrases_, ISI, 1987) and by James Kilpatrick (_Fine Print: Reflections on the Writing Art_, Andrews and McMeel, 1993), and prohibited by _The Globe and Mail Style Book_ (Penguin, 1995).  It is defended by Theodore Bernstein (_Dos, Don'ts, and Maybes of English Usage_, Barnes & Noble, 1977).  _Bloomsbury Good Word Guide_ (Bloomsbury, 1988) and _Harper Dictionary of Contemporary Usage_ (Harper & Row, 1975 & 1985) note that some people object to it.     The term ""quality time"", meaning ""time spent in social interaction with another person, especially one's young child"", dates from 1980.  It is widely derided as faddish.  ""High-quality time"" is not used.  In England, up-market, broadsheet newspapers have been called ""the quality papers"" since 1961.     Other words that have acquired similarly specialized meanings are:  ""fortune"" meaning ""good fortune"" (dates from 1390, and had precedent in Latin); ""luck"" meaning ""good luck"" (1480); ""behave"" meaning ""to behave properly"" (1691); ""criticize"" meaning ""to criticize unfavourably"" (1704); ""temper"" meaning ""ill-temper, short temper"" (1828); ""class"" meaning ""high class, elegance"" (1874; informal; originally a sports term; the term ""class act"" dates from 1976); ""temperature"" meaning ""feverish temperature"" (1898; informal; an ironic development, since ""temperature"" once meant to be in temper, to be free from the distemper that fever indicates); and ""attitude"" meaning ""hostile attitude"" (1962; U.S. informal; probably from such phrases as ""You'd better change your attitude"" and ""I don't like your attitude"").  Context usually indicates the specialized meaning, e.g., in ""He has a temper""; one would have no occasion to want to say, ""He has a temper, but I'm not going to tell you whether it's long or short or anything else about it.""  Repeated words after abbreviations ----------------------------------     Disputes occur about the legitimacy of placing after an acronym/ initialism the last word that is abbreviated in it, e.g., ""AC current"", ""the HIV virus"".  ""AC"" and ""HIV"" by themselves will certainly suffice in most contexts.  But such collocations tend to become regarded as irreducible and uninterpretable words.  ""The SNOBOL language"" and ""BASIC code"" are as good as ""the BASIC language"" and ""SNOBOL code""; and why should ""an LED display"" (Light Emitting Diode display) be reasonable, but not ""an LCD display"" (Liquid Crystal Display display)?  The extra word may guard against ambiguity; e.g., ""I've forgotten my PIN"" might be mistaken in speech as being about sewing, whereas ""I've forgotten my PIN number"" identifies the context as ATMs.      It cannot be denied, though, that many such repetitions stem from ignorance.  The more familiar someone is with computer memory, the less likely he is to say ""ROM memory"" or ""RAM memory"".  ""Scotch"" --------     Scots' preferred adjective for Scotland and for themselves is ""Scots"".  ""Scottish"" is also acceptable.  But ""Scotch"" (although used by Robert Burns and Sir Walter Scott, and still used by some Americans of Scots descent) is now considered offensive by many Scots.  Certain Scots hold that only three things can be ""Scotch"": ""Scotch whisky"", ""Scotch egg"", and ""Scotch mist"".  They are not interested in considering additions to this list, although many other terms containing ""Scotch"" can be found in dictionaries.     The term ""Scotch tape"" (a trademark for clear sticky tape made by the 3M company, based in Minnesota) was originally a reference to the stereotype of Scots miserliness.  3M at one time made a tape with no adhesive along the middle.  The tape was intended as a masking tape for painting cars (masking off areas that you didn't want to paint), so 3M thought it didn't need a full sticky coating; but customers were not impressed.  ""shall"" vs ""will"", ""should"" vs ""would"" --------------------------------------     The traditional rules for using these (based on the usage of educated Southern Englishmen in the 18th and 19th centuries) are quite intricate, and require some choices (""Should you like to see London?"";  ""The doctor thought I should die"") that are no longer idiomatically reasonable.  But if you're dead set on learning them, you can access the relevant section of _The King's English_ at < http://www.columbia.edu/acis/bartleby/fowler/213.html >.  Usage outside England has always been different, although the historical prevalence of ""shall"" in the U.S. is sometimes underestimated: Benjamin Franklin said, ""We must all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately""; and the Shaker hymn ""Simple Gifts"" has ""To bow and to bend we shan't be ashamed.""     The old joke, where the Irishman cries for help:  ""I will drown and no one shall save me"" and the Englishman mistakes this for a suicide resolution, is contrived, in that an Irishman would far more likely say ""no one will save me.""  split infinitive ----------------     Sir Ernest Gowers wrote in _The Complete Plain Words_ (HMSO, 1954):  ""The well-known [...] rule against splitting an infinitive means that nothing must come between 'to' and the infinitive.  It is a bad name, as was pointed out by Jespersen [...] 'because we have many infinitives without _to_, as ""I made him go"".  _To_ therefore is no more an essential part of the infinitive than the definite article is an essential part of a substantive, and no one would think of calling _the good man_ a split substantive.'  It is a bad rule too; it increases the difficulty of writing clearly [...].""  The split infinitive construction goes back to the 13th century, but was relatively rare until the 19th.  No split infinitives are to be found in the works of Shakespeare, Spenser, Pope, or Dryden, or in the King James Version of the Bible.     Fowler wrote (in the article POSITION OF ADVERBS, in MEU) that ""to"" + infinitive is ""a definitely enough recognized verb-form to make the clinging together of its parts the natural and normal thing""; ""there is, however, no sacrosanctity about that arrangement"".  There are many considerations that should govern placement of adverbs:  there are other sentence elements, he said, such as the verb and its object, that have a *stronger* affinity for each other; but only avoidance of the split infinitive ""has become a fetish"".     Thus, although in ""I quickly hid it"", the most natural place for ""quickly"" is before ""hid"", ""I am going to hide it quickly"" is slightly more natural than ""I am going to quickly hide it"".  But ""I am going to quickly hide it"" is itself preferable to ""I am going quickly to hide it"" (splitting ""going to"" changes the meaning from indicating futurity to meaning physically moving somewhere), or to ""I am going to hide quickly it"" (separation of the verb from its object).  And even separating the verb from its object may become the preferred place for the adverb if ""it"" is replaced by a long noun phrase (""I am going to hide quickly any trace of our ever having been here"").     Phrases consisting of ""to be"" or ""to have"" followed by an adverb and a participle are *not* split infinitives, and constitute the natural word order.  ""To generally be accepted"" and ""to always have thought"" are split infinitives; ""to be generally accepted"" and ""to have always thought"" are not.     Certain kinds of adverbs are characteristically placed before ""to"".   These include negative and restrictive adverbs: ""not"" (""To be, or not to be""), ""never"", ""hardly"", ""scarcely"", ""merely"", ""just""; and conjunctive adverbs:  ""rather"", ""preferably"", ""moreover"", ""alternatively"".  But placing adverbs of manner in this position is now considered good style only in legal English (""It is his duty faithfully to execute the provisions..."").     Clumsy avoidance of split infinitives often leads to ambiguity: does ""You fail completely to recognise"" mean ""You completely fail to recognise"", or ""You fail to completely recognise""?  Ambiguous split infinitives are much rarer, but do exist:  does ""to further cement trade relations"" mean ""to cement trade relations further"", or ""to promote relations with the cement trade""?     The most frequently cited split infinitive is from the opening voice-over of _Star Trek_:  ""to boldly go where no man has gone before"".  (_Star Trek: The Next Generation_ had ""one"" in place of ""man"".)  Here, ""boldly"" modifies the entire verb phrase:  the meaning is ""to have the boldness that the unprecedentedness of the destinations requires"".  If ""boldly"" were placed after ""go"", it would modify only ""go"", changing the meaning to ""to go where no man has gone before, and by the way, to go there boldly"".     Hardly any serious commentator believes that infinitives should never be split.  The dispute is between those who believe that split infinitives should be avoided when this can be done with no sacrifice of clarity or naturalness, and those who believe that no effort whatever should be made to avoid them.  ""that"" vs ""which"" -----------------     In ""The family that prays together stays together"", the clause ""that prays together"" is called a RESTRICTIVE CLAUSE because it restricts the main statement to a limited class of family.  In ""The family, which is the basic unit of human society, is weakening"", ""which ... society"" is called a NONRESTRICTIVE CLAUSE because it makes an additional assertion about the family without restricting the main statement.     It is generally agreed that nonrestrictive clauses should be set off by commas; restrictive clauses, not.  Nonrestrictive clauses are now nearly always introduced by ""which"" or ""who"" (although ""that"" was common in earlier centuries).  Fowler encourages us to introduce restrictive clauses with ""that""; but this is not a binding rule (although some copy-editors do go on ""which hunts""), and indeed is not possible if a preposition is to precede the relative pronoun.  ""Which"" seem to have more ""weight"" than ""that""; the weight often just adds starch, but it can be of use when the relative pronoun is separated from the antecedent:  ""This is the only book in my personal library which I haven't read."" Often, too, euphony favours one or the other.     Object relative pronouns can be omitted altogether (""the book that I read"" or ""the book I read""); in standard English, subject relative pronouns cannot be omitted, although in some varieties of informal spoken English, they are (""There's a man came into the office the other day"").     Robert Sigley ( Robert.Sigley@vuw.ac.nz ) is writing a Ph.D. thesis on relative pronoun choice.  ""that kind of a thing"" ----------------------     The forms you're likely to encounter, in roughly decreasing order of formality, are ""that kind of thing"", ""those kinds of things"", ""those kind of things"", and ""that kind of a thing"".  Sir Ernest Gowers wrote:  ""it is as well to humour the purists by writing _things of that kind_.""  the the ""hoi polloi"" debate ---------------------------     Yes, ""hoi"" means ""the"" in Greek, but the first 5 citations in the OED, and the most famous use of this phrase in English (in Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta _Iolanthe_), put ""the"" in front of ""hoi"". This is not a unique case:  words like ""alchemy"", ""alcohol"", ""algebra"", ""alligator"", and ""lacrosse"" incorporate articles from other languages, but can still be prefixed in English with ""the"". ""The El Alamein battle"" (which occurred in Egypt during World War II), sometimes proffered as a phrase with three articles, actually contains only two:  _alamein_ is Arabic for ""two flags"" (which is appropriate for a town on the border between Egypt and Libya), and does not contain the Arabic article _al_.  ""true fact"" -----------     Many phrases often criticized as ""redundant"" are redundant in most contexts, but not in all.  ""Small in size"" is redundant in most contexts, but not in ""Although small in size, the ship was large in glory.""  ""Consensus of opinion"" is redundant in most contexts, but not in ""Some of the committee members were coerced into voting in favour of the motion, so although the motion represents a consensus of votes, it does not represent a consensus of opinion.""     Context can negate part of the definition of a word.  ""Artificial light"" is light that is artificial (= ""man-made""), but ""artificial flowers"" are not flowers (i.e., genuine spermatophyte reproductive orders) that are artificial.  In the latter phrase, ""artificial"" negates part of the definition of ""flower"".  The bats known as ""false vampires"" do not feed on blood:  ""false"" negates part of the definition of ""vampire"".     The ordinary definition of ""fact"" includes the idea of ""true"" (e.g., fact vs fiction); the meaning of ""fact"" does have other aspects (e.g., fact vs opinion).  Context can negate the idea of ""true"".  Fowler himself used the phrase ""Fowler's facts are wrong; therefore his advice is probably wrong, too"" (a conclusion that he was eager to avert, moving him to defend his facts) in one of the S.P.E. tracts.     It follows that ""true fact"" need not be a redundancy.  ""try and"", ""be sure and"", ""go"" + verb -------------------------------------     These colloquial constructions are synonymous, or nearly so, with ""try to"", ""be sure to"", and ""go and"" respectively, those equivalents being undisputedly acceptable in both formal and informal style.  They are syntactic curiosities in that they can only be used in conjugations identical to the infinitive:  we can say ""to try and do it"", ""try and do it"" (imperative), ""I'll try and do it"", ""if I try and do it"", and ""he did try and make the best of it"", but not ""if he tries and does it"" or ""he tried and did it"" with the same sense.     Some commentators maintain that there is no semantic difference whatever between ""try and"" and ""try to""; certainly in many contexts they are interchangeable:  ""I will try to/and attend the party tonight.""  But in other contexts ""try and"" seems to imply success: ""Do try and behave"" suggests that the only reason the listener is not behaving is that he is not trying to.  Then there are the ironic contexts where ""try and"" implies failure:  ""Try and make me move."" Here, ""try to"" would not be idiomatic.     WDEU suggests that ""try and"" may actually be older than ""try to""; both are first attested in the 17th century.  ""Go"" + bare infinitive was used by Shakespeare (""I'll go see if the bear be gone""; ""I'll go buy spices for our sheep-shearing"") but is now nearly confined to informal American usage, and elsewhere to a few fixed expressions (""hide and go seek"", ""He can go hang for all I care"").     Most handbooks disapprove of these expressions in formal style; even the permissive WDEU admits of ""try and"" that ""most of the examples are not from highly formal styles"".  Fowler wrote, ""It is an idiom that should not be discountenanced, but used when it comes natural""; but he also wrote that it is ""almost confined to exhortations and promises"", and these are more common in informal than in formal contexts.  ""whom"" ------     In informal English, one can probably get away with using ""who"" all the time, except perhaps after a preposition.     The prescription for formal English is:  use ""who"" as the subjective form (like ""he""/""she""/ ""they""), and ""whom"" as a direct or indirect object (like ""him""/ ""her""/""them""):   He gave it to me.  Who gave it to me?  That's the man who  gave it to me.  I gave it to him.  Whom did I give it to?  That's the man  whom I gave it to.  I gave him a book.  Whom did I give a book?  That's the man  whom I gave a book.     (The construction in the last two sentences is rare.  Usually a preposition, in this case ""to"", is used when the indirect object is separated from the direct object.)     Note the difference between:   I believe (that) he is drowned.  Who do I believe is  drowned?  That is the man who I believe is drowned.  and:   I believe him to be drowned.  Whom do I believe to be  drowned?  That is the man whom I believe to be drowned.  Note also, that unless you say ""It is he"", you cannot rely on these transformations for complements of the verb ""to be"".  You may say ""It's him"", but the question is ""Who is it?"", definitely not ""Whom is it?""     The case of ""whoever"" is determined by its function in the dependent clause that it introduces, not by its function in the main clause:  ""I like whoever likes me.""  ""Whomever I like likes me.""     Very few English-speakers make these distinctions instinctively; most of those who observe them learned them explicitly.  Instincts would lead them to select case based on word order rather than on syntactic function.  Hence Shakespeare wrote ""Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drowned"".  But Fowler called this a solecism in modern English; it might be better to abstain from ""whom"" altogether if one is not willing to master the prescriptive rules.  ""you saying"" vs ""your saying"" -----------------------------     In ""You saying you're sorry alters the case"", the subject of ""alters"" is not ""you"", since the verb is singular.  Fowler called this construction the ""fused participle"", and recommended ""Your saying..."" instead.  The fused participle *can* lead to ambiguity: in _Woe is I_ (Grosset/Putnam, 1996, ISBN 0-399-14196-0), Patricia T. O'Conner contrasts the sentences ""Basil dislikes that woman's wearing shorts"" and ""Basil dislikes that woman wearing shorts"": ""Both are correct, but they mean different things.  In the first example, Basil dislikes shorts on the woman.  In the second, he dislikes the woman herself.  The lesson?  Lighten up, Basil!""     Other commentators have been less critical of the fused participle than Fowler.  Jespersen traced the construction as the last in a series of developments where gerunds, which originally functioned strictly as nouns, have taken on more and more verb-like properties (""the showing of mercy"" => ""showing of mercy"" => ""showing mercy"").  Partridge defends the construction by citing lexical noun-plus-gerund compounds.  In most of these (e.g., ""time-sharing""), the noun functions as the object of the gerund, but in some recent compounds (e.g., ""machine learning""), it functions as the subject.  ====================================================================    PUNCTUATION   -----------  ""."" after abbreviations -----------------------     Fowler recommends putting a ""."" only after abbreviations that do not include the last letter of the word they're abbreviating, e.g., ""Capt."" for captain but ""Cpl"" for corporal.  In some English- speaking countries, many people follow this rule, but not in the U.S., where ""Mr."" and ""Dr."" prevail.  spaces between sentences ------------------------     This issue is more suited to comp.fonts than here.  In recent years, printers typesetting with proportional fonts have generally *not* made the inter-sentence space any greater than the inter-word space, although greater inter-sentence space can be found quite often in older books.  Traditionally, students in typing classes have been taught to put two spaces between sentences.  Some people never like the extra space, some always do, and some like it if the text is monospaced but not if it is proportionally spaced.  The traditional UNIX text formatter, troff, uses extra space; in TeX it is optional, but turned on by default.  The extra space, if used, need not be as much as the normal interword space (it can be less in TeX, but not in troff).  Advocates of the extra space argue that the practice speeds reading by making it easier to pick out sentences.  And sometimes it can aid clarity.  A passage such as:  | ""What's pluperfect?"" is a reasonably reasonable question that has | yet to be sweetly but fully answered on a.u.e. I answer the | questions about Erzherzoginen (Habsburg archduchesses).  is far from clear on first reading.  "", vs ,"" --------     According to William F. Phillips ( wfp@world.std.com ), in the days when printing used raised bits of metal, ""."" and "","" were the most delicate, and were in danger of damage (the face of the piece of type might break off from the body, or be bent or dented from above) if they had a '""' on one side and a blank space on the other.  Hence the convention arose of always using '.""' and ',""' rather than '"".' and '"",', regardless of logic.     Fowler was a strong advocate of logical placement of punctuation marks, i.e. only placing them inside the quotation marks if they were part of the quoted matter.  This scheme has gained ground, and is especially popular among computer users, and others who wish to make clear exactly what is and what is not being quoted. Logical placement is accepted by many more publishers outside than inside the U.S.     Some people insist that '.""' and ',""' LOOK better, but Fowler calls them ""really mere conservatives, masquerading only as aesthetes"".  ""A, B and C"" vs ""A, B, and C"" -----------------------------     This is known as the ""serial comma"" dispute.  Both styles are common.  The second style was recommended by Fowler, and is Oxford University Press house style (hence it is also called ""the Oxford comma""; it is also known as ""the Harvard comma""); it is more common in the U.S. than elsewhere.  Although either style may cause ambiguity (in ""We considered Miss Roberts for the roles of Marjorie, David's mother, and Louise"", are there two roles or three?), the style that omits the comma is more likely to do so: ""Tom, Peter, and I went swimming.""  (Without the comma, one might think that the sentence was addressed to Tom.)  ""I ordered sandwiches today.  I ordered turkey, salami, peanut butter and jelly, and roast beef."" Without that last comma, one would have a MIGHTY weird sandwich! -- Gabe Wiener.  James Pierce reports that an author whose custom it was to omit the comma dedicated a novel: ""To my parents, Ayn Rand and God.""  ====================================================================    FOREIGNERS' FAQS   ----------------     Non-native speakers are often unnecessarily cautious in their use of English.  Someone once posted to alt.usage.english from Japan, asking, ""What is the correct thing to say if one is being assaulted: 'Help!' or 'Help me!'?""  Not only are they both correct; there was a whole slew of responses asking, ""Why the heck would you worry about correctness at a time like that?""     It may happen that your post's greatest departure from English idiom is something unrelated to what you are asking about.  If you like, say ""Please correct any errors in this post""; otherwise, those who answer you may out of politeness refrain from offering a correction.     Although not so stratified as some languages, English does have different stylistic levels.  In a popular song, you may hear:  ""It don't make much difference.""  When speaking to a friend, you will probably want to say:  ""It doesn't make much difference.""  If you are writing a formal report, you may want to render it as:  ""It makes little difference.""  So it's helpful if when posting, you specify the stylistic level that you're enquiring about.

Roger Depledge writes:  ""since you rightly show some concern for the non-native speaker, you might care to consider adding to your list of dictionaries the _Collins Cobuild English Dictionary_ (HarperCollins, 2nd ed., 1995, ISBN 0-00-379401-8), all of whose plentiful examples come from their 200-million-word corpus.  As a freelance translator in Toulouse, I find it invaluable when my native ear for English fails me.  And for usage for the non- specialist, I know of none better than Michael Swan, _Practical English Usage_ (OUP, 2nd ed., 1995, ISBN 0-19-431197-X).  In its favour I would cite the 26 reprints of the 1980 edition, and the six pages on taboo words, including the priceless example, 'Bugger me! There's Mrs Smith. I thought she was on holiday.'""     Anno Siegel recommends _The BBI Combinatory Dictionary of English_, by Morton Benson, Evelyn Benson, and Robert Ilson, Benjamins, 1986, ISBN 90-272-2036-0.  ""a""/""an"" before abbreviations -----------------------------     ""A"" is used before words beginning with consonants; ""an"", before words beginning with vowels.  This is determined by sound, not spelling (""a history"", ""an hour"", ""a unit"", ""a European"", ""a one""). Formerly, ""an"" was usual before unaccented syllables beginning with ""h"" (""an historian"", ""an hotel""); these are ""now obsolescent"" in British English (Collins English Dictionary), although ""an historian"" is retained in more dialects than ""an hotel"".     Before abbreviations, the choice of ""a""/""an"" depends on how the abbreviation is pronounced:  ""a NATO spokesman"" (because ""NATO"" is pronounced /'neItoU/); ""an NBC spokesman"" (because ""NBC"" is pronounced /Enbi:'si:/) ""a NY spokesman"" (because ""NY"" is read as ""New York (state)"").     A problem:  how can a foreigner *tell* whether a particular abbreviation is pronounced as a word or not?  Two non-foolproof guidelines:  (1) It's more likely to be an acronym if it *looks* as if it could     be an English word.  ""NATO"" and ""scuba"" do; ""UCLA"" and ""NAACP""     don't.  (2) It's more likely to be an acronym if it's a *long* sequence of     letters.  ""US"" is short; ""EBCDIC"" is too bloody long to say as     ""E-B-C-D-I-C"".  (But of course, abbreviations that can be broken     down into groups, like ""TCP/IP"" and ""AFL-CIO"", are spelled out     because the groups are short enough.)     Is it ""a FAQ"" or ""an FAQ""?  These days, probably the former, although some of us do say ""an F-A-Q"".  ""A number of..."" ----------------     ""A number of ..."" usually requires a plural verb.  In ""A number of employees were present"", it's the employees who were present, not the number.  ""A number of"" is just a fuzzy quantifier.  (""A number of..."" may need a singular in the much rarer contexts where it does not function as a quantifier:  ""A number of this magnitude requires 5 bytes to store."")     On the other hand, ""the number of..."" always takes the singular: ""The number of employees who were present was small.""  Here, it's the number that was small, not the employees.  When to use ""the"" -----------------     This is often quite tricky for those learning English.  The basic rules can be found in the Purdue University Online Writing Lab's WWW page titled ""The Use and Non-Use of Articles"": < http://owl.english.purdue.edu/Files/25.html > (very brief), and in ""An Overview of English Article Usage for Speakers of English as a Second Language"" by John R. Kohl of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute: < http://www.rpi.edu/dept/llc/writecenter/web/text/esl.html > (As explained in the document ""Accessing the Internet by E-Mail FAQ"" posted to alt.internet.services , you can obtain textual WWW pages by e-mail.  Send e-mail to "" agora@dna.affrc.go.jp "" with, in this case, ""send http://www.rpi.edu/dept/llc/writecenter/web/text/esl.html "" as the message body.)  The book _Three Little Words; A, An and The: a Foreign Student's Guide to English_ by Elizabeth Claire (Delta, 1988, ISBN 0-937354-46-5) has been recommended.     The article ""the"" before a noun generally indicates one specific instance of the object named.  For example, ""I went to the school"" refers to one school.  (The context should establish which school is meant.)  Such examples have the same meaning in all English- speaking countries.     The construct <preposition><noun>, with no intervening article, often refers to a state of being rather than to an instance of the object named by the noun.  The set of commonly used preposition-noun combinations varies from one dialect to another. Some examples are:    I went to bed = I retired for the night.  Even if I had the       habit of sleeping on the floor, I would still say ""I went       to bed"" and not ""I went to floor"".    She is at university (U.K.) = She is in college (U.S.) = She       is a student, enrolled in a particular type of tertiary       institution.  This sentence does not imply that she is now       physically present on the campus.    He was taken to hospital (U.K.) = He was hospitalized.  (A       U.S. speaker might say ""to the hospital"" even if there       were several hospitals in the area.)  Subjunctive -----------  Present Subjunctive     The present subjunctive is the same in form as the infinitive without ""to"".  This is also the same form as the present indicative, except in the third person singular and in forms of the verb ""to be"".  The present subjunctive is used:  (1) in third-person commands:  ""Help, somebody save me!""  Most third-     person commands (although not those addressed to ""somebody"") are     now expressed with ""let"" instead.  The following (current but     set) formulas would probably use ""let"" if they were being     coined today:  ""So be it""; ""Manners be hanged!""; ""... be     damned""; ""Be it known that...""; ""Far be it from me to..."";     ""Suffice it to say that...""  (2) in third person wishes.  Most third-person wishes are now     prefixed with ""may"" instead, as would the following formulas be:     ""God save the Queen!""; ""God bless you""; ""God help you""; ""Lord     love a duck""; ""Hallowed be thy name.  Thy kingdom come.  Thy     will be done.""; ""Heaven forbid!""; ""The Devil take him!""; ""Long     live the king!""; ""Perish the thought!""  (3) in formulas where it means ""No matter how..."" or ""Even if..."":     ""Come what may, ...""; ""Be that as it may, ...""; ""Though all     care be exercised...""; ""Be he ever so...""  (4) after ""that"" clauses to introduce a situation that the actor     wants to bring about.  Used to introduce a formal motion (""I move     that Mr Smith be appointed chairman""); after verbs like     ""demand"", ""insist"", ""propose"", ""prefer"", ""recommend"", ""resolve"",     ""suggest""; and after phrases like ""it is advisable/desirable/     essential/fitting/imperative/important/necessary/urgent/vital     that"".  ""Should"" can also be used in such clauses.  This use of     the subjunctive had become archaic in Britain in the first half     of the 20th century, but has been revived under U.S. influence.     Note the difference between ""It is important that America has     an adequate supply of hydrogen bombs"" (America has an adequate     supply of H-bombs, and this is important) and ""It is important     that America have an adequate supply of hydrogen bombs"" (America     probably *lacks* an adequate supply, and must acquire one).  (5) after ""lest"".  ""Should"" can also be used after ""lest"".  After     the synonymous ""in case"", the plain indicative is usual.  (6) ""Come..."", meaning ""When ... comes""  Past Subjunctive     The past subjunctive is the same in form as the past indicative, except in the past subjunctive singular of ""to be"", which is ""were"" instead of ""was"".  The past subjunctive is used:  (1) for counterfactual conditionals:  ""If I were..."" or     (literary) ""Were I..."".  In informal English, substitution of     the past indicative form (""If I was..."") is common.  But note     that speakers who make this substitution are *still*     distinguishing possible conditions from counterfactual ones,     by a change of tense:      Present         Past      Possible condition:         ""If I am""       ""If I was""      Counterfactual condition:   ""If I were/was"" ""If I had been""      ""As if"" and ""as though"" were originally always used to introduce     counterfactuals, but are now often used in ""looks as if"",     ""sounds as though"", etc., to introduce things that the speaker     actually believes (""It looks as if"" = ""It appears that"").  In     such cases the present indicative is often used.  (""As if"" and     ""as though"" are exceptions to the above table in that they take     the past subjunctive, not the pluperfect subjunctive, for     counterfactuals in the past.  The past tense of ""If he were a     fool, he would mention it"" is ""If he had been a fool, he would     have mentioned it""; but the past tense of ""He talks as if he     were a fool"" is ""He talked as if he were a fool.""  ""He talked as     if he had been a fool"" would mean that he seemed, not foolish,     but regretful of earlier foolishness.)      Fowler says that there is no ""sequence of moods"" requirement in     English:  it's ""if I were to say that I was wrong"", not ""if I     were to say that I were wrong"".  (2) for counterfactual wishes:  ""I wish I were..."";  ""If only I     were...""; (archaic) ""Would that I were..."".  Again, substitution     of the past indicative is common informally.  Achievable wishes     are usually expressed with various verbs plus the infinitive:     ""I wish to..."", ""I'd like you to...""  (3) in archaic English, sometimes to introduce the apodosis     (""then"" part) of a conditional:  ""then I were"" = ""then I would     be"".  (4) in ""as it were"" (a formula indicating that the previous     expression was coined for the occasion or was not quite     precise -- literally, ""as if it were so"").  ====================================================================    WORD ORIGINS   ------------  ""A.D."" ------     ""A.D."" stands for _Anno Domini_ = ""in the year of the Lord"", not for ""after the death"".     Most stylebooks prescribe placing ""A.D."" before the year: ""Arminius died A.D. 21.""  WDEU calls this ""the traditional and still most frequently used styling"" (the OED has citations from 1579 on); but Collins English Dictionary says ""this is no longer general practice.""  Placing ""A.D."" after the year is, if anything, better supported by precedents from Classical Latin (whose word order was flexible enough that either placement would be grammatical):  the ancient Romans did not use A.D. dating, but Cicero (_Pro Flacco_ I) has _quingentesimo anno rei publicae_ = ""in the five-hundredth year of the state"".  ""alumin(i)um"" (notes by Keith Ivey) -------------     This word is usually ""aluminum"" /@'lu:m@n@m/ in the U.S. and in Canada, and ""aluminium"" /,&lU'mInI@m/ in other English-speaking countries.     People sometimes complain that the American form is inconsistent with other element names, which end in ""-ium"".  But even in British spelling, there are elements that end in ""-um"" not preceded by ""i"": lanthanum, molybdenum, platinum, and tantalum (not to mention argentum, aurum, cuprum, ferrum, hydrargyrum, plumbum, and stannum; but then those aren't English names, just the names from which the symbols are derived).     A widespread false belief among those who spell the word ""aluminium"" is that theirs is the original spelling, from which the American version is a later development, perhaps resulting from a typographical error.  The CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics (63rd ed., p. B-5) gives this bit of history:       The ancient Greeks and Romans used alum in medicine as an      astringent, and as a mordant in dyeing.  In 1761 [Baron Louis-      Bernard Guyton] de Morveau proposed the name alumine for the      base in alum, and [Antoine] Lavoisier, in 1787, thought this      to be the oxide of a still undiscovered metal. [...]  In 1807,      [Sir Humphrey] Davy proposed the name alumium for the metal,      undiscovered at that time, and later agreed to change it to      aluminum.  Shortly thereafter, the name aluminium was      adopted to conform with the ""ium"" ending of most elements,      and this spelling is now in use elsewhere in the world.      Aluminium was also the accepted spelling in the U.S. until      1925, at which time the American Chemical Society officially      decided to use the name aluminum thereafter in their      publications.     I used to work for ACS, but I have no idea why they would have chosen ""aluminum"" over ""aluminium"", especially if ""aluminium""  was already established.     _A Dictionary of American English on Historical Principles_ (University of Chicago Press, 1938, ISBN 0-226-11737-5) gives U.S. citations of ""aluminum"" from 1836, 1855, 1889 (two), and 1916, and says:  ""This form is in common use in mining, manufacturing, and the trade in the U.S.; the form _aluminium_ is used with practical uniformity in Great Britain and generally by chemists in the U.S.""     ""Aluminium"" is given as the only form by Noah Webster's 1828 dictionary; and as the preferred form by _The Century Dictionary_ (1889) and by the 9th and 11th editions of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.  The Britannica yearbook switched its index entry from ""aluminium or aluminum"" to ""aluminum"" in 1942.  ""bloody"" --------     The use of ""bloody"" as an intensifier used to be considered highly offensive in England, as the fuss made over it in Shaw's _Pygmalion_ shows.  (It is less offensive now, as shown by its use on mainstream British TV programmes such as EastEnders.)     Eric Partridge, in _Words, Words, Words_ (Methuen, 1933), lists the following suggested origins:  1. From an alleged Irish word _bloidhe_, meaning ""rather"".  This    was proposed by Charles Mackay in the 19th century, but is highly    implausible:  even if the word exists, it would presumably have    been pronounced /bli:/ since the early Modern Irish period.  The    closest I could find to it in an Irish dictionary was _bluire_=    ""a bit, some"". 2. ""by our Lady"" (an invocation of the Virgin Mary).  There *was*    an interjection ""byrlady"", attested since 1570 and frequently    used by Shakespeare, which *did* mean ""by our Lady"".  But    this was an interjection, not an adverb, although a citation    from Jonathan Swift (""it grows by'r Lady cold"") shows a possible    intermediate use.  The transition from ""byrlady"" to ""bloody"" is    phonetically implausible. 3. ""S'blood"", an ancient oath shortened from ""God's blood"".  The    Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology says this is ""probably""    the origin, but the OED says ""there is no ground for the notion"".    The etymologies in the OED are largely untouched since the first    edition; the ODEE is generally more up to date. 4. blood with reference either to menstruation or to ""the bloody    flux"", an old term for dysentery.  ""Ingenious, but [...] much too    restricted"", says Partridge. 5. ""blood"", an aristocratic young roisterer.  The OED plumped for    this one, because its earliest citations of ""bloody"" as an    intensifier were in the phrase ""bloody drunk"", which it    conjectured meant ""as drunk as a blood"" (cf. ""as drunk as a    lord"").  But the earlier citation found by Weekley (see below)    makes this less plausible, and ""bloody drunk"" would be an    unusual lexicalization of ""as drunk as a blood"". 6. blood's being something vivid or distressing.  Partridge himself    plumps for this one.     Ernest Weekley, in _Words Ancient and Modern_ (Murray, 1926), finds analogous uses of French _sanglant_, German _blutig_, and Dutch _bloedig_.  He gives one citation that antedates those in the OED (""A man cruelly eloquent and bluddily learned"", John Marston, 1606 -- but ""bluddily"" may be a descriptive adverb rather than an intensifier here), and two (""It was bloody hot walking to-day"", Swift, 1711; ""bloody passionate"", Samuel Richardson, 1742) that show that ""up to about 1750 it was inoffensive"".  He attributes the dropping of ""-ly"" from ""bloodily"" to ""an instinct which tends to drop _-ly_ from a word already ending in _-y_"", as seen in ""very"", ""pretty"", and ""jolly"".     A Merriam-Webster etymologist (in e-mail to me) chose 6, possibly influenced by 3, considering the analogy of German _blutig_ the strongest argument, and added:  ""'Bloody' in 19th-century England -- like 'fucking' and other so-called intensifiers -- functioned principally as a marker of speech register signaling group or class membership.  In a society in which speech register was strongly associated with economic class, and class distinctions were extraordinarily significant, it is not too hard to see why 'bloody' became so taboo for Victorians.  I'm not sure any other explanation need be sought.  The taboo on 'bloody' as well as a lot of other constraints in Britain declined in force with the social upheavals initiated by  World War I.""  ""bug""=""defect"" --------------     The 1947 incident often related by Grace Hopper, in which a technician solved a glitch in the Harvard Mark II computer by pulling a moth out from between the contacts of one of its relays, *did* happen.  However, the log entry (""first actual case of bug being found"") indicates that this is *not* the *origin* of this sense of ""bug"".  It was used in 1899 in a reference to Thomas Edison.  See the Jargon File.  It may come from ""bug"" in the obsolete sense ""frightful object"", whose use in Coverdale's 1535 translation of the Bible led to its being nicknamed ""the Bug Bible"". (Coverdale rendered Psalm 91:5 as ""Thou shalt not nede to be afrayed for eny bugges by night""; the King James Version reads ""terror"".)  This word, which was the source of the current word ""bugbear"" and may be related to ""bogey"", comes from Middle English ""bugge"", which was used in the senses ""scarecrow"" and ""demon"". Possible etyma are Welsh _bwg_=""ghost"" and proto-Germanic *_bugja_= ""swollen up, thick"".  The latter is also posited as the etymon of the Norwegian dialect _bugge_=""important man"" and English ""big"", from the proto-Indo-European *_beu-_=""to blow up, swell"", whence the English words ""poach""=""cook"", ""pocket"", ""poke""=""bag"", ""pout"", ""Puck""=""sprite"", and ""pucker"".     ""Bug""=""insect"" (which gave rise to the senses ""germ"", ""annoy"", ""enthusiast"", and ""listening device"") is attested from 1622.  It may come from Anglo-Saxon _budda_=""beetle"", influenced by ""bug""= ""frightful object"".  ""Caesarean section"" -------------------     The OED erroneously states that Julius Caesar was born by Caesarean section.  Merriam-Webster Editorial Department (on its AOL message board, in response to a query from me) writes:     ""The name 'Caesar' is a cognomen, a nickname given to one member of a Roman clan and borne by his descendants as a kind of surname. No one knows who the original Caesar was, but his descendants within his clan, the Julii, continued to use his cognomen and formed a major branch of the clan.    ""According to a legend related by the Roman naturalist Pliny, the first Caesar was so called because he was cut from the womb of his mother (_a caeso matris utero_), _Caesar_ supposedly being a derivative of the verb _caedere_ 'to cut'.  This etymology is dubious, but the name 'Caesar' has continued to be associated with surgery to remove a child that cannot be delivered naturally.    ""The OED gives evidence for the belief that Julius Caesar, the most famous bearer of the cognomen, was delivered this way that dates from 1540.  There is no authority for this notion in ancient sources.  Moreover, Julius Caesar's mother lived long after his birth -- unlikely if she had undergone such an operation, which few women would have survived in those days.  In any case, the earliest record we have for the term 'cesarean section' used in English dates from 1615.  You can easily see from these dates why we say that the term came from the belief, and not, to throw in a little more Latin, vice versa.""     The Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins suggests that Caesar's name may have become associated with the operation because of an edict of the Caesars of Imperial Rome (Lex Caesarea) that any pregnant woman dying at or near term was to be delivered by C-section; but Merriam-Webster Editorial Department says ""We can find no evidence for"" such an edict.     Also not named directly after Julius Caesar are ""Caesar salad"" (allegedly named after a restaurant named Caesar's in Tijuana, Mexico); and ""Julian day"" (number of days elapsed since 1 January 4713 B.C., used in astronomy; named by Joseph Scaliger after his father, Julius Caesar Scaliger).  The computer term ""Julian date"" (date represented as number of days elapsed from the beginning of a chosen year) was apparently inspired by ""Julian day"".  ""canola"" --------     ""Canola"" is defined as any of several varieties of the rape plant having seeds that contain less than 2% erucic acid, and whose solid component contains less than 30 micromoles per gram of glucosinolates.  (This has been the statutory definition in Canada since 1986.)  If you ever come across rapeseed oil that is *not* canola, avoid it, because erucic acid causes heart lesions, and glucosinolates cause thyroid enlargement and poor feed conversion!    Rape plants have been grown in Europe since the 13th century; rapeseed oil was used in Asia and Europe originally in lamps, and later as a cooking oil.  Canola was developed between 1958 and 1974 by two Canadian scientists, Baldur Stefansson and Richard Downey.    Dictionaries have variously explained ""canola"" as standing for ""Canada oil, low acid"", and as a blend of ""Canada"" and ""colza"".  I imagine that ""Mazola"" (a brand name for corn [= ""maize""] oil) had an influence.    ""Canola"" was originally a trademark in Canada, but is now a generic term.  It's the only term one is now likely to encounter there on packaging and in newspapers and books; some sources do say that canola was ""formerly called rape"".  But the term ""rape"" still has some currency among Canadian farmers.  (Although ""rape"" denoting the plant is etymologically unconnected with ""rape"" meaning forced sexual intercourse, the homonymy doubtless contributed to the former term's falling into disfavour.)    The Canola Council of Canada, based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, told me that ""Canola"" was registered as a trademark in 1978 (that's one year before MWCD10's 1979) by the Western Canadian Oilseed Crushers' Association, and that control of the term was transferred in 1980 to the Rapeseed Association of Canada, which changed its name to the Canola Council of Canada the same year.  They say that the origin is simply ""Canadian oil"", that ""it's not an acronym"", and that rapeseed oil that does not meet the criteria for canola should still be called ""rapeseed oil"".    ""Designer eggs"", low-cholesterol eggs developed at the University of Alberta, are produced by adding canola and flax to the hens' diet.  ""catch-22"" ----------     ""Catch-22"" means a trap created by mutually frustrating regulations.  It was coined by Joseph Heller in his 1961 novel _Catch-22_, which satirized military illogic.  From the novel:   Yossarian looked at him soberly and tried another approach.      ""Is Orr crazy?""  ""He sure is,"" Doc Daneeka said.  ""Can you ground him?""  ""I sure can.  But first he has to ask me to.  That's part of      the rule."" [...]  ""And then you can ground him?"" Yossarian asked.  ""No.  Then I can't ground him.""  ""You mean there's a catch?""  ""Sure there's a catch,"" Doc Daneeka replied.  ""Catch-22.      Anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy.""  [...] Yossarian [...] let out a respectful whistle.  ""That's      some catch, that Catch-22,"" he observed.  ""It's the best there is,"" Doc Daneeka agreed.  Later in the novel, Yossarian visits a former brothel from which soldiers have chased away all the prostitutes.  Yossarian asks why.   ""No reason,"" wailed the old woman.  ""No reason.""  ""What right did they have?""  ""Catch-22. [...]  Catch-22 says they have a right to do      anything we can't stop them from doing. [...]  What does it      mean, Catch-22?  What is Catch-22?""  ""Didn't they show it to you?"" Yossarian demanded, stamping      about in anger and distress.  ""Didn't you even make them read      it?""  ""They don't have to show us Catch-22,"" the old woman      answered.  ""The law says they don't have to.""  ""What law says they don't have to?""  ""Catch-22."" [...]  Yossarian [...] strode out of the apartment, cursing      Catch-22 vehemently as he descended the stairs, even though he      knew there was no such thing.  Catch-22 did not exist, he was      positive of that, but it made no difference.  What did matter      was that everyone thought it existed, and that was much worse,      for there was no object or text to ridicule or refute [...].  It is not logical for ""Catch-22"" to be hyphenated; other such expressions in English normally are not.  But that's the way Heller did it.  Heller originally planned to title the novel _Catch-18_, but changed it because of Leon Uris's 1961 novel _Mila 18_.  ""cop"" -----  does not stand for ""constable on patrol"" or ""constabulary of police"". The noun ""cop"" (first attested meaning ""policeman"" in 1859) is short for ""copper"" (first attested meaning ""policeman"" in 1846).  ""Copper"" in this sense is unlikely to derive from copper buttons or shields worn by early policemen.  Rather, dictionaries derive it from ""to cop"" (first attested meaning ""to grab"" in 1704 and meaning ""to arrest"" in 1844).  ""To cop"" may come Dutch _kapen_ = ""to steal""; or it may come from Old French dialect _caper_ = ""to take"", from Latin _capere_.  ""copacetic"" -----------     This word, meaning ""extremely satisfactory"", was first recorded in 1919, and was originally heard chiefly among U.S. black jazz musicians.  The tap dancer Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson (1878-1949) popularized the word, and claimed to have coined it when he was a shoeshine boy in Richmond; but a number of Southerners testified that they had heard the word used by parents or grandparents in the late 19th century.  Suggested origins include:  a supposed Italian word _copacetti_; a Creole French word _coupersetique_ meaning ""that can be coped with""; and the Hebrew phrase _kol besedeq_ ""all with justice"".   RHUD2 says that all these theories ""lack supporting evidence"".  ""crap"" ------     ""Crap"" does not derive from Thomas Crapper.  Thomas Crapper (1837-1910) did exist and did make toilets.  (At least 3 authors have gone into print asserting he was a hoax, but you can see some of his toilets at the Gladstone Pottery Museum, Uttoxeter Road, Longton, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire ST3 1TQ, U.K.; phone +44 1782 311378), and also at the Science Museum in London.  The word ""crap"" was imported into English from Dutch in the 15th century, with the meaning ""chaff"".  It is recorded in the sense ""to defecate"" from 1846; Thomas Crapper did not set up his business until 1861.  Also, Thomas Crapper did not ""invent"" the flush toilet (the ancient Minoans had them); he merely improved the design.     The Crapper company lived on until 1966 -- 105 years in business. See the article ""Thomas Crapper: Myth & Reality"" from the June 1993 issue of _Plumbing and Mechanical_ at < http://www.theplumber.com/crapper.html >.  You can see some photographs of Thomas Crapper at < http://www.geocities.com/RodeoDrive/1093/Thomas_Crapper.html >.  ""ebonics"" ---------     This recently popular term for what linguists usually call BEV (Black English Vernacular) or AAEV (African-American English vernacular), or BVE or AAVE, was devised in 1973 by Robert Lewis Williams (born in 1903), a retired professor of linguistics at Washington University; he expanded on it in his 1975 book _Ebonics: the True Language of Black Folks_ (published by the Institute of Black Studies in St. Louis).     The term came to wide attention when on 18 December 1996 the Oakland, California, school board unanimously voted to recognise Ebonics as a second language and to alter educational procedures to account for the difference between English taught in schools and the ""primary language"" of many of the district's students.  The text of the resolution can be found at < http://www.west.net/~joyland/Oakland.htm >.  Backlash to the Oakland School Board's decision prompted an amended resolution < http://ousd.k12.ca.us/board/wk011297/Amended_Resolution_No_9697_0063.html > on 15 January 1997, explaining that the board instructed teachers to accept Ebonics as a primary language and facilitate the transition to standard English, not to teach Ebonics in classrooms.     The most distinctive characteristics of Ebonics are not conjugating the verb ""to be"" and dropping final consonant sounds, but there are of course many other differences from standard English.  Ebonics can make some distinctions that standard English cannot, for example, the use of ""be"" to signify habitual action: ""He be sick"" means that he is chronically ill, whereas ""He sick"" means that he is ill at present.  The corresponding negative forms are ""He don' be sick"" and ""he ain' sick""; the interrogative forms are ""Do he be sick?"" and ""Is he sick?""  ""He be sick right now"" and ""He sick all the time"" would be ungrammatical.  Some of the grammatical features are listed at < http://www.west.net/~joyland/BlkEng.html >.  There are also semantic differences; for example, Ebonics shares with U.S. Southern English ""carry"" in the sense ""to escort""; the sentence ""I'm going to take you, but I'm not going to carry you"" would in Ebonics be ""I gonna carry you, but I ain' gonna tote you.""     A resolution on Ebonics adopted by the Linguistic Soceity of America can be found at < http://www.lsa.umich.edu/ling/jlawler/ebonics.lsa.html >.  There is a bibliography at < http://www.english.uiuc.edu/English302/aavedesc.htm >.  A forthcoming book is _The Ebonics Controversy : Exploring the Roots of an African-American Dialect_ (Birch Lane Press, 1997, ISBN 1559724277).  ""eighty-six""=""nix"" ------------------     This verb meaning ""to eject or debar from premises, to reject or abandon"" was previously an expression used by waiters and bartenders indicating that the supply of an item was exhausted or that a customer was not to be served.  Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins says:  ""[...] 86 may well have come from a number code created by [...] soda fountain clerks [...].  Originally, according to the _American Thesaurus of Slang_, it was a password used between clerks to indicate:  'We're all out of the item ordered.'  The transition from this meaning [...] to the bartender's sense of 'Serve no more because of the shape he's in' is fairly obvious.  The number code developed by soda clerks was very extensive [...].  A hissed '98' from one soda-popper to another indicated 'The assistant manager is prowling around.  Watch out.' [...]   And most cheerful warning of all, 87 1/2, meaning 'There's a good-looking girl out front!'""     The earliest clear citation is from the February 1936 issue of _American Speech_, which gives the definition ""_Eighty-six_, item on the menu not on hand.""  The Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang cites a comedy with a date range 1926-35 in which a waiter gives his number as 86.     AHD3 gives the etymology:  ""Perhaps after Chumley's bar and restaurant at 86 Bedford Street in Greenwich Village, New York City.""  But most other dictionaries, including MWCD10, suggest that eighty-six was rhyming slang for ""nix"".  On its AOL message Board, Merriam-Webster Editorial Department writes:  ""The etymology we give at 'eighty-six' is the one we'll stand by.  It is our contention that the address at Chumley's is purely coincidence, and that the word was developed in rhyming slang, and originally used by restaurant workers so that the average customer didn't know what they were talking about.     ""The earlier citations for 'eighty-six' [...] do not influence our decisions about the etymology [...].  In fact, if the first citation is from the early part of the range, it would tell against the Chumley's hypothesis, as Chumley's did not exist before 1927-29. Finally, because slang usually exists in the language for a number of years before it is recorded, the existence of a citation from the 1920s tells strongly against the Chumley's explanation.     ""There are a number of other theories about the origin of the word:  that it originated in the heyday of the British merchant marine (the standard crew was 85, so that the 86th didn't get to go); that 86 was the number of the California (or Florida) law that forbade bartenders to serve the overly intoxicated; and that it refers to the number of tables (85) at the New York restaurant 21, and the table (86, in other words, no table) that the undesirable got.  There are more, but the Chumley's theory is the most popular.""     ""Eighty-six"" is attested as a verb meaning ""get rid of"" from 1955 on.  It was surely in reference to this meaning that Maxwell Smart, the hero of the 1960s sitcom ""Get Smart!"", was Agent 86.  ""Eskimo"" --------     It now seems unlikely that ""Eskimo"" means ""eater of raw meat"". Merriam-Webster changed its etymology when it brought out MWCD10, and referred me to an article by Ives Goddard in _Handbook of North American Indians_ (Smithsonian, 1984), vol. 5, p. 5-7. Goddard cites the following Amerindian words:  Montagnais _ayassimew_=""Micmac"" Plains Cree _ayaskimew_=""Eskimo"" Attikamek Cree _ashkimew_=""Eskimo"" North Shore Montagnais _kachikushu_ or _kachekweshu_=""Eskimo""    ""not analysable but explained by speakers as meaning 'eater of    raw meat'"" Ojibwa _eshkipot_=""Eskimo"" (literally ""one who who eats raw"") Algonquin Eastern Ojibwa _ashkipok_=""Eskimo"" (literally ""raw    eaters"")     Goddard writes:  ""In spite of the tenacity of the belief, both among Algonquian speakers and in the anthropological and general literature [...] that Eskimo means 'raw-meat eaters', this explanation fits only the cited Ojibwa forms (containing Proto- Algonquian *_ashk-_ 'raw' and *_po-_ 'eat') and cannot be correct for the presumed Montagnais source of the word Eskimo itself. [...] The Montagnais word _awassimew_ (of which _ay-_ is a reduplication) and its unreduplicated Attikamek cognate exactly match Montagnais _assimew_, Ojibwa _ashkime_ 'she nets a snowshoe', and an origin from a form meaning 'snowshoe-netter' could be considered if the original Montagnais application (presumably before Montagnais contact with Eskimos) were to Algonquians.""     _A Dictionary of the Otchipwe Language_ by Bishop Frederic Baraga (Beauchemin & Valois, 1878) gives _ashkime_=""I lace or fill snowshoes""; the phrase _agim nind ashkima_ with the same meaning (_agim_ is the noun for ""snowshoe""); _askimaneiab_=""babiche, strings of leather for lacing snowshoes""; and _ashkimewin_=""art or occupation of lacing snowshoes"".  But there are no other obvious cognates:  the words for ""snowshoe"", ""lace"", ""leather"", ""net"", and ""string"" are all unrelated.  In all other words beginning with ""ashk-"" or ""oshk-"", the prefix signifies ""raw, fresh, new"".     Eskimos' self-designations include:       singular  plural     language      places       Inuk      Inuit      Inuktitut     Canada, West Greenland      Inupiaq   Inupiat    Inupiaq       North Alaska      Inuvialuk Inuvialuit               Mackenzie Delta                Katladlit  Kalaallisut   Greenland      Yupik                Yupik         Southwest Alaska      Yuk       Yuit                     Siberia, St. Lawrence Island  ""Inuk"" and ""Yuk"" mean simply ""person""; ""Inupiaq"" and ""Inuvialuk"" mean ""real, genuine person"".     Goddard writes:  ""In the 1970s in Canada the name Inuit all but replaced Eskimo in governmental and scientific publication and the mass media, largely in response to demands from Eskimo political associations.  The erroneous belief that Eskimo was a pejorative term meaning 'eater of raw flesh' had a major influence on this shift.  The Inuit Circumpolar Conference meeting in Barrow, Alaska, in 1977 officially adopted Inuit as a designation for all Eskimos, regardless of their local usages [...].""     For the the number of words the Eskimos supposedly have for snow, see the sci.lang FAQ, or the alt.folklore.urban archive under < http://www.urbanlegends.com >.  ""flammable"" -----------     People often ask why ""flammable"" and ""inflammable"" mean the same thing.  The English words come from separate Latin words: _inflammare_ and the rarer _flammare_, which both meant ""to set on fire"".  Latin had two prefixes _in-_, one of which meant ""not""; the other, meaning ""in"", ""into"", or ""upon"", was the one used in _inflammare_.   ""Inflammable"" dates in English from 1605.     ""Flammable"" is first attested in an 1813 translation from Latin It was rare until the 1920s when the U.S. National Fire Protection Association adopted ""flammable"" because of concern that the ""in-"" in ""inflammable"" might be misconstrued as a negative prefix. Underwriters and others interested in fire safety followed suit. Benjamin Whorf (1897-1941), the linguist who shares credit for the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis that language shapes thought, may have been influential in promoting this change.  Merriam-Webster Editorial Department writes:  ""Though we have been unable to confirm that Benjamin Whorf was responsible for the word's adoption, the theory seems plausible enough:  he was, in fact, employed by the Hartford Fire Insurance Company from 1918 to 1940, and was widely recognized for his work in fire prevention.""     ""Flammable"" is still commoner in the U.S. than in the U.K.; in figurative uses, ""inflammable"" prevails (e.g., ""inflammable temper"").     Other words where an apparently negative prefix has little effect on the meaning are:  ""to (dis)annul"", ""to (de)bone"", ""to (un)bare"", ""to (un)loose"", and ""to (un)ravel"".  ""Irregardless"" (which probably arose as a blend of ""irrespective"" and ""regardless""; it was first recorded in western Indiana in 1912), means the same as ""regardless"", but is not considered acceptable.  ""freeway"" ---------     The ""free"" in ""freeway"" never referred to lack of a speed limit; nor did it originally refer to a lack of tollbooths, although W3's second definition is ""a toll-free highway"".  The word is attested since 1930, and in the earliest citations it is defined as a thoroughfare to which the abutting owners have no right of direct access.  ""fuck"" ------     ""Fuck"" does NOT stand for ""for unlawful carnal knowledge"" or ""fornication under consent of the king"".  It is not an acronym for anything at all.     It is a very old word, recorded in English since the 15th century (few acronyms predate the 20th century), with cognates in other Germanic languages.  The Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang (Random House, 1994, ISBN 0-394-54427-7) cites Middle Dutch _fokken_ = ""to thrust, copulate with""; Norwegian dialect _fukka_ = ""to copulate""; and Swedish dialect _focka_ = ""to strike, push, copulate"" and _fock_ = ""penis"". Although German _ficken_ may enter the picture somehow, it is problematic in having e-grade, or umlaut, where all the others have o-grade or zero-grade of the vowel.     AHD1, following Pokorny, derived ""feud"", ""fey"", ""fickle"", ""foe"", and ""fuck"" from an Indo-European root _*peig2_ = ""hostile""; but AHD2 and AHD3 have dropped this connection for ""fuck"" and give no pre-Germanic etymon for it.  Eric Partridge, in the 7th edition of _Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English_ (Macmillan, 1970), said that ""fuck"" ""almost certainly"" comes from the Indo-European root _*peuk-_ = ""to prick"" (which is the source of the English words ""compunction"", ""expunge"", ""impugn"", ""poignant"", ""point"", ""pounce"", ""pugilist"", ""punctuate"", ""puncture"", ""pungent"", and ""pygmy""). Robert Claiborne, in _The Roots of English: A Reader's Handbook of Word Origin_ (Times, 1989) agrees that this is ""probably"" the etymon.  Problems with such theories include a distribution that suggests a North-Sea Germanic areal form rather than an inherited one; the murkiness of the phonetic relations; and the fact that no alleged cognate outside Germanic has sexual connotations.  ""golf"" ------  does not stand for ""Gentlemen Only, Ladies Forbidden"".  It is a Scots word mentioned in 1457 in reference to the game.  Possible cognates are Scots _gowf_=""to strike"", Dutch _kolf_=""club for striking balls"", Swedish _kolf_=""butt-end"", and Old Icelandic _kolfr_=""bolt"".  The postulated Proto-Germanic root is *_kulb-_. The English word ""club"" comes from the possibly related Proto-Germanic *_klumbon_=""heavy stick"".  ""hooker"" --------     Contrary to what you may have read in Xaviera Hollander's book _The Happy Hooker_, the ""prostitute"" sense of ""hooker"" does NOT derive from Joseph ""Fighting Joe"" Hooker (1814-1879), a major general on the Union side of the U.S. civil war, whose men were alleged to frequent brothels.  ""Hooker"" in this sense goes back to 1845 (see AHD3); the U.S. Civil War did not begin until 1861.  It may come from the earlier sense of ""thief"" (which goes back to 1567, ""to hook"" meaning to steal), or it may refer to prostitutes' linking arms with their clients.  A geographical Hook (Corlear's Hook in New York City, or the Hook of Holland) is also possible.  ""ISO"" by Mark Brader -----     ISO is the International Organization for Standardization, not the International Standards Organization.  Some people think the organization's initials in French are ISO, but actually they would be OIN (for ""Organisation internationale de normalisation""). According to someone I met who worked there, the abbreviation ISO was adopted because they didn't want to use the actual English initials, but could permute them into the Greek-derived prefix iso- meaning ""same"" (which is what standards are for making things the :-) ).  In other words, it's wordplay.  For the official account, see < http://www.iso.ch/infoe/intro.html >.     Coordinated Universal Time is UTC because the C is of secondary importance and can be written as a subscript.  This one, too, is mistaken for coming from French, but does not.  ""jerry-built""/""jury-rigged"" ---------------------------     ""Jury-rigged"", which means ""assembled in a makeshift manner"", is attested since 1788.  It comes from ""jury mast"", a nautical term attested since 1616 for a temporary mast made from any available spar when the mast has broken or been lost overboard.  The OED dubiously recorded a suggestion that this was short for ""injury mast"", but recent dictionaries say that it is probably from Old French _ajurie_=""help or relief"", from Latin _adiutare_=""to aid"" (the source of the English word ""adjutant"").     ""Jerry-built"", which the OED defines as ""built unsubstantially of bad materials; built to sell but not last"" is attested since 1869, and is said to have arisen in Liverpool.  It has been fancifully derived from the Biblical city of Jericho, whose walls came tumbling down; from the prophet Jeremiah, because he foretold decay; from the name of a building firm on the Mersey; from ""jelly"", signifying instability; from French _jour_=""day"" (workers paid day-by-day considered less likely to do a good job); and from the Romany _gerry_=""excrement"".  More likely, it is linked to earlier pejorative uses of the name Jerry (""jerrymumble"", to knock about, 1721; ""Jerry Sneak"", a henpecked husband, 1764; ""jerry"", a cheap beer house, 1861); and it may have been influenced by ""jury-rigged"".     ""Jerry"" as British slang for ""a German, especially a German soldier"" is not attested until 1898 and is unconnected with ""jerry-built"".  ""kangaroo"" ----------     ""Kangaroo"" does NOT derive from the aboriginal for ""I don't understand"".  Captain James Cook's expedition learned the word from an aboriginal tribe that subsequently couldn't be identified. Since there were a *large* number of Australian aboriginal languages, and it has taken some time to record and catalogue the surviving ones, for many years the story that it meant ""I don't understand"" was plausible.  The search was further complicated by the fact that many aboriginal languages imported the word *from* English.  But if you consult an up-to-date English dictionary, such as RHUD2, you will see that ""kangaroo"" is derived from the Guugu-Yimidhirr (a language spoken near Cooktown, North Queensland) word _ga<eng>-urru_ ""a large black or grey species of kangaroo"".     Similar stories are told about ""llama"" (a Quechua word, not from the Spanish _Como se llama?_ = ""What's it called?""); ""indri"" (this one DOES derive from the Malagasy word for ""Look!""); and several place names, among them Canada (_kanata_ was the Huron- Iroquois word for ""village, settlement""; Jacques Cartier is supposed to have mistaken this for the name of the country); Istanbul (said to come from a Turkish mishearing of Greek _eis ten poli_ ""to the city""); Luzon (supposedly Tagalog for ""What did you say?""); Nome (supposedly a printer's misreading of a cartographer's query, ""Name?""); Senegal (supposedly from Wolof _senyu gal_ ""our boats""); and Yucatan (supposedly = ""I don't understand you"").  ""limerence""/""limerent"" ----------------------     The meaning of ""limerence"" falls somewhere between ""infatuation"" and ""romantic love"".  It was coined circa 1977 by Dorothy Tennov, then professor of psychology at the University of Bridgeport, Connecticut.  It was an arbitrary coinage; there is no specific etymology.  For further information on limerence see her book _Love and Limerence_ (Stein and Day, 1979); or you may e-mail her directly at "" tennov@dmv.com "".  ""loo"" -----     This British colloquial word for ""toilet"" was established usage by the 1920s.  Suggested origins include: French _lieu d'aisance_ = ""place of easement"" French _On est prie de laisser ce lieu aussi propre qu'on le trouve_  = ""Please leave this place as clean as you find it"" French _Gardez l'eau!_ = ""Mind the water!"" (supposedly said in the  days before modern plumbing, when emptying chamber pots  from upper-storey windows.  According to Chris Malcolm  ( cam@aifh.ed.ac.uk ), this phrase is still sometimes used by  common folk in Edinburgh when heaving water or slops, and  tour guides say that it originated there circa 1600.) ""louvre"" (from the use of slatted screens for a makeshift lavatory) ""bordalou"" (an 18th-century ladies' travelling convenience) ""looward"" or ""leeward"" (the sheltered side of a boat) ""lee"", a shepherd's shelter made of hurdles ""lieu"", as in ""time off in lieu"", i.e., in place of work done ""lavatory"", spoken mincingly ""Lady Louisa Anson"" (a 19th-century English noblewoman whose sons  took her name-card from her bedroom door and put it on  the guest lavatory) a misreading of room number ""100"" (supposedly a common European  toilet location) a ""water closet""/""Waterloo"" joke.  (James Joyce's _Ulysses_ (1922)  contains the following text:  ""O yes, _mon loup_.  How much  cost?  Waterloo.  water closet."")  ""love""=""zero"" -------------     On its AOL message board, Merriam-Webster Editorial Department writes:  ""The notion that the sports term 'love' comes from the French _l'oeuf_ seems to be another popular fallacy; so far, our etymologists have been unable to find any evidence that _oeuf_ was ever used in a 'zero' or 'goose-egg' sense in reference to game scores.  A more probable, if less imaginative, explanation can be found in the Oxford English Dictionary, which links this sense of 'love' to the phrase 'for love' (i.e. 'without stakes, for nothing').""  ""merkin"" (notes by Michael B. Quinion and Ruth Bygrave) --------     The word ""merkin"" is one of the perpetual bad puns of the Internet.  It actually means ""pubic wig"" (such wigs are used, apparently, in the theatrical and film worlds as modesty devices in nude scenes).  It can also be a contrivance used by male cross-dressers designed to imitate the female genitals, or, as Eric Partridge delicately puts it, ""an artificial vagina for lonely men"". The OED dates it 1617 in the sense ""pubic wig""; the origin is unknown.     Then ""merkin"" was coined afresh to mean ""an American"", because it sounds a bit like the half-swallowed pronunciation of ""American"" by some Americans, particularly President Lyndon Johnson; and the fact that it had a ""naughty"" meaning didn't hurt.  Punning use of the word dates back to at least the early 1960s.  Bill Fisher writes: ""I'd guess multiple re-invention is going on here.  When I was fooling around with the Orange Blossom Playhouse in Orlando, FL, about 1963, we were amusing ourselves with trying to change a word here or there in the play 'Teahouse of the August Moon' -- without really screwing anything up -- and one guy cracked the cast up one night when instead of the line 'But ... but ... he's an American!' he said 'But ... but .. he's a Merkin!'  (The cast had been laughing for a week or two about the definition of 'merkin' that someone had found in a dictionary.)""     One of Peter Sellers' roles in Stanley Kubrick's 1964 film _Dr. Strangelove_ was U.S. President Merkin Muffley.  This gets two risque' locutions past the censor at once, since ""muff"" is another slang term for female genitals or pubic hair (as in ""muff-diving"" for cunnilingus).  This name was presumably the work of Kubrick or his scriptwriter Terry Southern.  The film was based on the 1958 novel _Two Hours to Doom_ (titled _Red Alert_ in the U.S.), by Peter George, pseudonym of Peter Bryant (1924-1966).  The novel was serious -- Bryant had served in the RAF -- and does not name the presidential character.  But when Kubrick filmed it as a satire, Bryant was so convinced that he then re-novelized the film. On Usenet, ""merkin"" is only a few years old.  A few people recall alt.fan.pratchett (a newsgroup dedicated to the writings of Terry Pratchett, a British writer of humorous fantasy) as the origin, but Matthew Crosby ( crosby@nordsieck.cs.colorado.edu ) writes:  ""I believe I was the original person to use 'Merkin' in AFP (certainly it was my use of the word that started the large thread on it), and I'm sure that 'Merkin' was being used before that as an underhand insult.  By me, if nothing else.""     ""Merkin"" is now widely used on Usenet to designate Americans (especially by non-Americans).  ""nimrod"" --------     Genesis 10:8-9, in describing how the Seventy Nations were founded by the descendants of Noah, says that Nimrod, son of Cush, son of Ham, son of Noah, was ""a mighty man on earth"" and ""a mighty hunter before the LORD"".  The word ""nimrod"" is recorded in English since 1545 with the (now obsolete) meaning ""tyrant"", and since 1712 with the meaning ""hunter"".     In contemporary U.S. slang, ""nimrod"" means ""fool, numbskull"". Rex Knepp ingeniously suggested that the origin of this was Bugs Bunny's taunt of Elmer Fudd:  ""So long, Nimrod.""  Unfortunately for this theory, Jesse Sheidlower says that Random House has two citations of ""nimrod"" = ""numbskull"" from the 1930s, before the Bugs Bunny episode containing the taunt.  ""O.K."" ------     This one has generated *lots* of folklore.  The following list of suggested origins and info comes from MEU2, from Eric Partridge's _Dictionary of Historical Slang_ (1972 edition, Penguin, 0-14-081046-X), and from Cecil Adams' _More of the Straight Dope_ (Ballantine, 1988, ISBN 0-345-34145-2).  Thanks to Jeremy Smith for his help.  The abbreviations on cracker boxes, shipping crates, cargoes of rum, et al., became synonymous with quality.     ""Oll korrect, popularized by Old Kinderhook"" is what's given in most up-to-date dictionaries.  The earliest known citation is from the Boston Morning Post of 23 March 1839:  "" [...] he of the Journal, and his train-band, would have the 'contributions box,' et ceteras, o.k. -- all correct -- and cause the corks to fly.""  This was a facetious suggestion by a Boston editor that a Providence editor (the Journal mentioned was in Providence) sponsor a party.  American ""O.K."", abbreviation of Obadiah Kelly, a shipping agent American ""O.K."", abbreviation of Old Keokuk, a Sac Indian chief American ""O.K."", contraction of ""oll korrect"".  This was the choice    of a British judiciary committee that investigated the matter for    a 1935 court case (MEU2), and was further documented by Columbia    University professor Allen Walker Read in ""The Evidence on    'O.K.', _Saturday Review of Literature_, 19 July 1941.  A vogue    for comically misspelled abbreviations began in Boston in the    summer of 1838, and spread to New York and New Orleans in 1839.    They used ""K.G."" for ""know go"", ""K.Y."" for ""know yuse"", ""N.S.""    for ""nuff said"", and ""O.K."" for ""oll korrect"". American ""O.K."", abbreviation of Orrins-Kendall crackers American ""O.K."", abbreviation of Otto Kaiser, American industrialist American ""O.K. Club"".  ""O.K."" gained national currency in 1840 as    the slogan of the ""O.K. club"", a club of supporters of then    President Martin Van Buren, in allusion to his nickname, ""Old    Kinderhook"" -- Van Buren was born in the village of Kinderhook,    N.Y. Choctaw _(h)oke_ = ""it is so"" English opposite of ""K.O."" (""knock out"") English ""of Katmandu"" English ""open key"" English ""optical kleptomaniac"" English ""our kind"" Ewe (West African) Finnish _oikea_ French _Aux Cayes_, a place in Haiti noted for excellence of its rum French _aux quais_, stencilled on Puerto Rican rum specially    selected for export German _ordnungsgemaess kontrolliert_ ""properly checked"" German letters of rank appended to signature of Oberkommandant Greek _olla kalla_ = ""all good"" Latin _omnia correcta_ = ""all correct"" Mandingo (West African) = _o ke_ ""that's it"", ""all right"" Occitan _oc_ = ""yes"" (Occitan or Langue d'Oc is so called because it  uses _oc_ where French uses _oui_.) Scots _och aye!_ ""oh yes"" Tewa _oh-ka(n)_ = ""come here"", ""all right"" Wolof (West African) ""waw kay"" = ""yes indeed"".  Supported by Prof.    J. Weisenfeld, professor of African and African-American religion    at Columbia University.  It was shown by Dr Davis Dalby (""The    Etymology of O.K."", The Times, 14 January 1971) that similar    expressions were used very early in the 19th century by Negroes    of Jamaica, Surinam, and South Carolina:  a Jamaican planter's    diary of 1816 records a Negro as saying ""Oh ki, massa, doctor no    need be fright, we no want to hurt him.""  The use of ""kay"" alone    is recorded in the speech of black Americans as far back as 1776;    significantly, the emergence of O.K. among white Americans dates    from a period when refugees from southern slavery were arriving    in the north.     Queried about the Dalby citations, Merriam-Webster Editorial Department told me:  ""A word pronounced approximately 'kai' is an expression of surprise or amusement in Jamaican Creole and in Sea Islands Creole (Gullah).  If you take into account the pronunciation and meaning, you'll see that it does not fit 'okay' either semantically or phonetically.  There is nothing in the history of 'O.K.' or 'okay' that suggests it has an African-American origin.""  ""outrage"" ---------  does not come from English ""out"" + ""rage"".  It comes from French _outre_ = ""beyond"" + _-age_.  French _outre_ comes from Latin _ultra_.  ""paparazzo"" -----------     This word for a freelance photographer who pursues celebrities is first attested in English in 1966.  It comes from Paparazzo, the surname of the photographer played by Marcello Mastroianni in Federico Fellini's 1960 film _La Dolce Vita_.  Fellini got the name ""Paparazzo"" from the name of a hotelkeeper in George Gissing's 1901 novel _By the Ionian Sea_.  _Paparazzo_ could be analysed in Italian as _papa_=""pope"" + _razzo_=""rocket""; according to Jesse Sheidlower, _paparazzo_ means ""a buzzing insect"" in dialectal Italian.  Webster's New World College Dictionary derives _paparazzo_ from French _paperassier_=""a scribbler, rummager in old papers"".  ""pie-shaped"" ------------     This word, for which our earliest citation so far is from 1913 (found by Fred Shapiro with Lexis) nearly always means ""shaped like a slice of pie"", not ""shaped like a pie"".  (A use found by Matthew Rabuzzi in W3's entry ""Jack Horner pie"" may mean the latter.) The word is quite common in North America (a search by Myles Callum on Nexis turned up more than a thousand instances), but little known elsewhere (a search on a British corpus turned up nothing, and British correspondents tell us that they ""would not automatically assume that that was what was meant"").  The word, for which there is no entry in *any* dictionary, was discovered by Mark Israel on 11 July 1995, when Matthew Rabuzzi used it in a suggested emendation to the ""Origin of the dollar sign"" entry in this FAQ, and it was found to be missing from the dictionaries. That's right, folks; in future years, when you open your dictionary and see an entry for ""pie-shaped"" there, remember:  you have *me* to thank for it!     Other discoveries of mine are:  ""underwear"" in the specific sense ""(women's) underpants"" (American women have taken a dislike to the word ""panties"", and will now say things like ""I put two pairs of underwear in the wash"", or ""I'm not wearing any underwear"" when wearing a bra); ""slab leak"" (a leak from a pipe embedded in a concrete slab; many plumbers advertise in the Yellow Pages that this is something they can repair); and ""go to temple"" (dictionaries note that ""church"" has a specific sense in which it is used as a mass noun, ""divine worship at a church"", but do not note that ""temple"" and ""shul"" can be used in a similar way).  ""portmanteau word"" ------------------     This term for ""blend word"" comes from ""portmanteau"", ""a leather travelling case that opens into two hinged compartments"" (from the French for ""carry cloak""), by way of Humpty Dumpty in Lewis Carroll's _Through the Looking-Glass_:  ""You see it's like a portmanteau -- there are two meanings packed up into one word."" Although most modern blends are simply the first part of one word plus the last part of another (e.g., ""brunch"" = ""breakfast"" + ""lunch""; ""smog"" = ""smoke"" + ""fog""; ""Chunnel"" = ""Channel"" + ""tunnel""), Carroll himself formed his portmanteau words in a more subtle manner:  ""slithy"" = ""lithe"" + ""slimy""; ""mimsy"" = ""miserable"" + ""flimsy""; ""frumious"" = ""fuming"" + ""furious"".  Carroll's coinages ""chortle"" (which is now in most dictionaries) and ""galumph"" (which is in the OED) are generally understood as ""chuckle"" + ""snort"" and ""gallop"" + ""triumph"" respectively, although Carroll himself never explained them.     Blend words predate Carroll:  MWCD10 derives ""squiggle"" from ""squirm"" + ""wriggle"", and dates it circa 1816.     There is a dictionary of them:  _Portmanteau Dictionary:  Blend Words in the English Language Including Trademarks and Brand Names_ by Dick Thurner (McFarland, 1993, ISBN 0-89950-687-9).     There is a Lewis Carroll WWW page at: < http://www.LewisCarroll.org/carroll.html > ""posh"" ------     ""Posh"" (probably) does NOT stand for ""port out, starboard home"". MWCD10, p. 27a, says, ""our editors frequently have to explain to correspondents that the dictionary fails to state that the origin of _posh_ is in the initial letters of the phrase 'port out, starboard home' -- supposedly a shipping term for the cooler accommodations on steamships plying between Britain and India from the mid-nineteenth century on -- not because the story is unknown to us but because no evidence to support it has yet been produced.  Some evidence exists that casts strong doubt on it; the word is not known earlier than 1918 (in a source unrelated to shipping), and the acronymic explanation does not appear until 1935.""     A tenable theory is that ""posh"" meant ""halfpenny"" (from Romany _posh_ ""half"") and then ""money"" before acquiring its present meaning.  Or it may come from the slang ""pot"" (= ""big"", ""a person of importance"").  Or it may be a contraction of ""polished"".     I got e-mail from someone whose grandmother claimed to have seen steamship tickets with ""P.O.S.H."" overprinted.  And William Safire's _I Stand Corrected_ (Times, 1984, ISBN 0-8129-01097-4) quotes a letter from an Ellen Thackara of Switzerland:  ""When I lived in the Orient the P.&O. (Pacific [sic] and Orient) Line out of London _did_ put beside the names of important people 'POSH', so they would have the cooler side of the ship.""  (The P&O is actually the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company; it's not clear whether the mistake is Thackara's or Safire's.)  But to convince us, you'll have to *find* one of these tickets and send a copy to Merriam-Webster.  ""quiz"" ------     This is first recorded in 1749 in the sense ""an odd person"".  It is *doubtful* that ""quiz"" came from an alleged incident in which James Daly, a late-18th-century Dublin theatre manager, made a wager that he could introduce a new word into the English language overnight, and hired urchins to chalk the word ""quiz"" on every wall and billboard in Dublin.  ""Quiz"" may come from the Latin ""Qui es?"" (= ""Who are you?"", the first question asked in Latin oral exams in grammar schools), or it may be a shortening of ""inquisitive"".  ""Santa Ana"" -----------     This California term for ""a strong, hot, dust-bearing wind blowing towards the southern Pacific coast from the desert"" comes from (according to MWCD10) the Santa Ana mountain range or (according to AHD3) the Santa Ana Canyon, not from the California city of Santa Ana.  ""scot-free"" -----------     Like ""hopscotch"", this word for ""without incurring any penalty"" has no connection with frugal Scotsmen.  In 12th-century England, a ""scot"" or ""sceot"" was a municipal tax paid to the local bailiff or sheriff (the word came from an Old Norse cognate of ""shoot""/""shot"", and meant ""money thrown down"").  The word ""scot-free"", which is recorded from the 13th century, referred to someone who succeeded in dodging these taxes.  Later, the term was given wider currency when ""scot"" was used to mean the amount owed by a customer in a tavern: anyone who had a drink on the house went ""scot-free"".  This ""scot"" was reinforced by the fact that the drinks ordered were ""scotched"", or marked on a slate, so that the landlord could keep track of how much the customer owed.  ""sincere"" ---------     ""Sincere"" is sometimes said to derive from Roman quarrymen's temporarily concealing imperfections in marble blocks by rubbing wax on them.  On its AOL message board, Merriam-Webster Editorial Department writes:  ""The theory that 'sincere' ultimately derives from Latin _sine cera_, meaning 'without wax', is a popular one; unfortunately, there is no evidence to support it.  A far more likely origin, in our view, is that the Latin word _sincerus_ derives from _sem-_ ('one') and _-cerus_ (akin to Latin _crescere_, meaning 'to grow').""  ""sirloin""/""baron of beef"" -------------------------     ""Sirloin"" comes from Old French _surlonge_, from _sur_ ""above"" and _loigne_ ""loin"".  Its current spelling may have been influenced by a story that a King of England (variously said to be Henry VIII, James I, and Charles II) ""knighted"" this cut of beef because of its superiority.     A ""baron of beef"" is a joint consisting of two sirloins left uncut at the backbone.  This ""baron"" may have originated as a joke on ""sirloin"", or it may be an independent word.  ""SOS"" -----     SOS does NOT stand for ""Save Our Ship/Souls"", for ""Stop Other Signals"", for ""Send Our Saviour/Succour"", for ""Sure of Sinking"", or for the Russian _Spasiti Ot Smerti_ (= ""save from death"").  The signal ""...---..."", recommended for international distress calls at the international Radio Telegraph Conference of 1906 and officially adopted in 1908, was not chosen for any alphabetic significance.     Such a signal is now known as a ""prosign"" (from ""procedural signal"").  Those prosigns (such as this one) that are transmitted without interletter gaps are notated with an overbar.  Since ""..."" is S and ""---"" is O in Morse code, the distress signal is conventionally represented as:  ___  SOS but since there are no interletter gaps, it could also be analysed as various other combinations of Morse code letters.     Fred Bland writes:  ""Three of anything (e.g. gun shots, fires, cairns) is a conventional signal of distress recommended in survival guides.  I don't know whether this convention or the use of three dots and dashes is older.""    Mark Brader writes:  ""The sign used before SOS was CQD, which was composed of the usual 'calling' sign CQ, plus D for Distress. Even in 1912 when the Titanic was sinking, its operator put out a CQD first and only added SOS after being reminded.""     Thomas Hamilton White ( whitetho@med.unc.edu ) writes:  ""I have read that the international distress call evolved from SOE (sent as three letters), which had been used as a distress signal by German companies.  However, because the final E in this sequence consisted of a single dot, the signal was modified to ...---...  to be more distinctive and symmetrical. [...]  I can think of one very practical reason for continuing to informally treat the distress signal as SOS -- ever try to stamp ...---... in a snowbank?""  ""spoonerism"" ------------     This term for interchanging parts of two different words in a phrase is named after the Reverend William Archibald Spooner (1844-1930), Dean and Warden of New College, Oxford.  The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, 2nd edition (1953), attributed two famous spoonerisms to Dr Spooner:  ""Kinquering congs their titles take"", and ""You have deliberately tasted two worms and you can leave Oxford by the town drain.""  (The ""down train"" was the train going away from London, in this case through Oxford.  Other popular attributions to Dr Spooner are:  ""a well boiled icicle""; ""a blushing crow""; ""a half-warmed fish""; ""our shoving leopard""; ""our queer old Dean""; ""You hissed my mystery lectures""; ""My boy, it's kisstomary to cuss the bride""; ""Take this in aid of Oxford's beery wenches""; ""When the boys come home from France, we'll have hags flung out""; ""Pardon me, madam, you are occupewing my pie.  May I sew you to another sheet?""; and ""Have you any signifying glasses?  Oh well, it really doesn't magnify."")     But after the publication of _Spooner: A Biography_ by Sir William Hayter (W. H. Allen, 1976, ISBN 0-491-01658-1), the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, 3rd edition (1979), gives only one spoonerism (""weight of rages""), and says:  ""Many other Spoonerisms, such as those given in the previous editions of O.D.Q., are now known to be apocryphal.""  The OED says the word ""spoonerism"" was ""known in colloquial use in Oxford from about 1885.""  In his diary entry of 9 May 1904, Spooner wrote that someone he met at dinner ""seemed to think he owed me some gratitude for the many 'Spoonerisms' which I suppose have appeared in Tit Bits.""  One of the undergraduates who attested ""weight of rages"" commented:  ""Well, I've been up for four years, and never heard the Spoo make a spoonerism before, and now he makes a damned rotten one at the last minute.""  ""suck""=""be very unsatisfying"" by John Davies -----------------------------     It is pretty clear that ""suck"" started out as a sexual insult, e.g., ""Charlie sucks"", what he sucks being unnecessary to spell out. As a term of general disapproval it did not take long to be applied to all sorts of things, animate and inanimate, to the point where it is now used by all manner of people, small children included, without any consciousness whatsoever of the sexual origin of the term.  Some of them seem to find it very hard to accept that it ever had a sexual connotation.  It has crossed the Atlantic, but would be regarded both by those who use it and those accustomed to hearing it as a conscious Americanism.     The curious thing is that ""sucks!"" as a taunt or term of derision seems to be even older in U.K. english, but it has never to my knowledge had any hint of a sexual meaning attached to it, though that doesn't mean it never did have.  The construction is not at all the same as the contemporary US phrase.  To quote Eric Partridge's _Dictionary of slang and Unconventional English_:  ""Sucks!  An expression of derision:  schools (?mostly boys') since late C19. Often sucks to you.  E. F.  Benson, _David of Kings_ (1924) has Sucks for----!  (That's a disappointment for so-and-so).  'Sucks to' may also be directed at others, e.g. 'Well, sucks to them! they can jolly well go without'.""     But for people of a certain age, ""Yah boo, sucks to you"" is indelibly associated with Billy Bunter, a fat schoolboy created by Frank Richards (1875-1961), and immortalized in children's books and comics of the period.  Even when I was a small boy in the 1940s, ""sucks"" in that context sounded old-fashioned and upper-class, and personally I've never heard or seen it except as a conscious parody of Bunter.  ""till""/""until"" --------------     The conjunction ""till"" is not a shortening of ""until"".  MWCD10 dates ""till"" from the 12th century and ""until"" from the 13th century. ""Until"" was a compound, whose first element also survives in ""unto"", and whose second element was the ancestor of ""till"".     The spelling ""'til"" occurs, but is not standard anywhere.  ""tip"" -----     ""Tip"", in the sense of ""gratuity"", does NOT stand for ""to insure [i.e., ensure] politeness/promptness"" or ""to improve performance"". It may derive from ""tip"" in the sense ""to tap, to strike lightly"" or in the sense ""extremity"", both of which have cognates in other Germanic languages.  Or it may be a shortening of ""stipend"".  ""titsling""/""brassiere"" ----------------------     ""Brassiere"" is first recorded in a Canadian advertisement of 1911, and in the U.S. Index of Patents for the year 1910 (published in 1911).  Dictionaries derive it from obsolete (17th century) French _brassiere_ = ""bodice"", from Old French _braciere_ = ""arm protector"", from _bras_ = ""arm"".  (The French word for bra is _soutien-gorge_, literally ""support-throat"".)     In the southern U.S., a bra is sometimes called a ""tit-sling"". This has an obvious derivation.     Wallace Reyburn, to whom Thomas Crapper owes his current fame, wrote a later book describing a lawsuit over rights to the bra, fought from 1934 to 1938 in New York, between a German-born designer, Otto Titzling (1884-1942), and a French-born designer, Philippe de Brassiere.  Martin Gardner, in _Time Travel and Other Mathematical Bewilderments_ (Freeman, 1988, ISBN 0-7107-1925-8), p. 137, says:  ""The book by Wallace Reyburn _Flushed with Pride: The Story of Thomas Crapper_ does exist.  For many years I assumed that Reyburn's book was the funniest plumbing hoax since H. L. Mencken wrote his fake history of the bathtub. [...]  Reyburn wrote a later book titled _Bust-up: The Uplifting Tale of Otto Titzling and the Development of the Bra_.  It turns out, though, that both Thomas Crapper and Otto Titzling were real people, and neither of Reyburn's books is entirely a hoax.""     On its AOL message board, Merriam-Webster Editorial Department writes:  ""dull though it may be, all the available etymological evidence indicates that the word derives from the French 'brassiere' [...]; there are many examples of the use of 'brassiere' in the women's apparel sense throughout the 19th century -- in French. [...]  Given the word's history and that country's language heritage, it is not surprising that the first occurrence of the ""brassiere"" in English comes from Canada. [...]  We can find no verifiable evidence that anyone named either 'Titzling' or 'Brassiere' had anything to do with the origin of the term.""  troll -----     This word, meaning ""to fish by trailing bait behind one's boat"", and hence ""to post an article to Usenet designed to elicit flames from new or unperceptive readers, while signalling levity to the savvy and experienced"", is unconnected with ""to trawl"" (=""to fish by dragging a net along the sea floor"").  ""Troll"" seems to come from Middle French _troller_=""to run here and there"", of Germanic origin, cognate with Middle High German _trollen_=""to walk or run with short steps"" and perhaps also with ""troll"", the mythological being; ""trawl"" seems to come from Middle Dutch _traghel_=""dragnet"", perhaps from Latin _tragula_=""dragnet"", from _trahere_=""drag"".  typo ----     ""Typo"" is related to, but does not come from, the verb ""to type"". It is short for ""typographical error"", which, of course, could refer to any error made by a typographer.  (The humorous but useful hackish coinage ""thinko"", used for when the person typing was *thinking* of the wrong thing, pretends that ""typo"" does come from ""to type"".  The Jargon File also gives ""mouso"", a ubiquitous kind of error in this point-and-click era.)     Arguments of the form ""It couldn't have been a typo, because those two keys are nowhere near each other on the keyboard"" are a bit tiresome, especially when one keeps the true etymology of ""typo"" in mind.  Wicca -----     Wicca is ""a pagan nature religion having is roots in pre- Christian Europe and undergoing a 20th-century revival"" (AHD3). Only the most recently published dictionaries contain an entry for it; RHUD2 dates it 1975.  ""Wicca"" is a revival of an Old English word that you can find in older dictionaries by looking up the etymology of either ""witch"" or ""wicked"".  In Old English, _wicca_ was the masculine form of a word meaning ""wizard"" or ""sorcerer"". (The feminine form was _wicce_.  ""Witch"" comes from _wicce_.) _Wicca_ and _wicce_ came from from a proto-Germanic (not Celtic) _wikkjak_, ""one who wakes the dead"", the first element of which comes from the same Indo-European root as ""wake"".     Yes, we've heard the joke about the Beatles song ""Wiccan, Work It Out"".  ""widget"" (notes by William C. Waterhouse) --------     ""Widget"" is a deliberately invented word meant (probably) to suggest ""gadget"".  Most dictionaries fail to trace it to its origin. It comes from the 1924 play ""Beggar on Horseback"", by George Kaufman and Marc Connelly.  In the play, a young composer gets engaged to the daughter of a rich businessman, and the next part of the play acts out his nightmare of what his life will be like, doing pointless work in a bureaucratic big business.  At one point he encounters his father-in-law at work, and we get the following dialogue:  (Father-in-law): Yes, sir!  Big business! ---- Yes.  Big business.  What business are we in? ---- Widgets.  We're in the widget business. ---- The widget business? ---- Yes, sir!  I suppose I'm the biggest manufacturer      in the world of overhead and underground A-erial widgets.  Part of the point, of course, is that no one ever tells him what ""widgets"" are.  ""wog"" -----     ""Wog"", a chiefly British, derogatory word for someone from the Middle or Far East, does NOT stand for ""wealthy/Western/wily/ wonderful/worthy Oriental gentleman"", or for ""worker on Government service"".  It may be a shortening of ""golliwog"".  ""wonk"" (notes by Fred Shapiro) ------     The OED defines ""wonk"" as ""a studious or hardworking person"". An article in _Sports Illustrated_, 17 Dec. 1962, explains that in Harvard slang, there was a tripartite classification of students into wonks, preppies, and jocks.  I believe that this classification is in fact the origin of each of the three terms.  The earliest citations in the OED for the three terms are dated, respectively, 1962, 1970, and 1963.  I have found an occurrence of ""wonk"" in _Time_ in 1954; an occurrence of ""preppie"" in the _Cambridge Review_ in 1956; and an occurrence of ""jock"" in the _Harvard Crimson_ in 1958.  In all three instances the context is a Harvard one.  (But Esther Vail recalls:  ""'jocks'; we called them that at Syracuse Univ. as early as 1948"".)     ""Wonk"" is said to derive from the word ""know"" spelled backwards, but this is not certain.  Other suggested origins are the adjective ""wonky"" = ""weak, shaky"", and ""wanker"" = ""masturbator"".  ""Preppy"" comes from ""preparatory school"".  ""Jock"" (attested from 1922 in the sense ""athletic supporter"") comes from ""jockstrap"", from ""jock"" = ""penis"", from the male name Jack.  ""wop"" -----     This derogatory word for ""an Italian"" does not stand for ""without papers/passport"", for ""working on pavement"", or for ""western Oriental person"".  It comes from Italian dialectal _guappo_ = ""thug"", ultimately from Latin _vappa_ = ""flat wine"".  ""ye""=""the"" ----------     The ""y"" here is a representation of the obsolete letter thorn, which looked like ""b"" and ""p"" superimposed, and was pronounced [T] or [D] (the same as modern ""th"").  The pronunciation of ""ye"" in ""Ye Olde Curiositie Shoppe"" as /ji/, which you sometimes hear, is a spelling pronunciation.  ====================================================================    PHRASE ORIGINS   --------------  ""the bee's knees"" -----------------     A bee's ""corbiculae"", or pollen-baskets, are located on its tibiae (midsegments of its legs).  The phrase ""the bee's knees"", meaning ""the height of excellence"", became popular in the U.S. in the 1920s, along with ""the cat's whiskers"" (possibly from the use of these in radio crystal sets), ""the cat's pajamas"" (pyjamas were still new enough to be daring), and similar phrases which made less sense and didn't endure:  ""the eel's ankle"", ""the elephant's instep"", ""the snake's hip"".  Stories in circulation about the phrase's origin include:  ""b's and e's"", short for ""be-alls and end-alls""; and a corruption of ""business"".  ""beg the question"" ------------------     Fowler defines ""begging the question"" as the ""fallacy of founding a conclusion on a basis that as much needs to be proved as the conclusion itself.""     ""Question"" here does not mean ""a sentence in interrogative form"". Rather, it means ""the point at issue, the thing that the person is trying to prove"".  The phrase is elucidated by William Fulke in ""Heskins parleamant repealed"" (1579):  ""O shameless beggar, that craveth no less than the whole controversy to be given him!""  The OED's first citation for ""to beg the question"" is from 1581.     Common varieties of begging the question are paraphrase of the statement to be proved (""Telepathy cannot exist because direct transfer of thought between individuals is impossible""), and arguing in a circle (""The Bible must be true, because God wouldn't lie to us; we know God is trustworthy, because it says so in the Bible"").  Fowler gives two example of non-circular question-begging: ""that fox-hunting is not cruel, since the fox enjoys the fun, and that one must keep servants, since all respectable people do so"". Gowers notes that single words, such as ""reactionary"" and ""victimization"", can be used in a question-begging way.     The Latin term for the fallacy is _petitio principii_, a translation of the Greek _to en archei aiteisthai_=""at the beginning to assume""; but _aiteisthai_ does literally mean ""to beg"". The phrase can be traced back to Aristotle (4th century B.C.): ""Begging or assuming the point at issue consists (to take the expression in its widest sense) in failing to demonstrate the required proposition.  But there are several other ways in which this may happen; for example, if the argument has not taken syllogistic form at all [...].  If, however, the relation of B to C is such that they are identical, or that they are clearly convertible, or that one applies to the other, then he is begging the point at issue."" (_Prior Analytics_ II xvi)     Many people unaware of the technical meaning of ""to beg the question"" in logic use it in one of two looser senses.  The first of these, ""to evade the question, to duck the issue"", is attested since 1860 (WDEU).  The second, ""to invite the obvious question, (with an inanimate subject) to raise the question"", is now the most commonly heard use of the phrase, although we have found no mention of it prior to The Oxford Guide to English Usage, 1st edition (1983), and it is not yet in most dictionaries.  The meaning of the adjective ""question-begging"" does not seem to have suffered a similar broadening.  ""billions and billions"" -----------------------     Carl Sagan (1934-1996), in his last book _Billions & Billions_ (Random House, 1997, ISBN 0-679-41160-7), admitted that in the TV series _Cosmos_, first aired in 1980, he ""pronounced 'billions' with a fairly plosive 'b'"" to distinguish it from ""millions"".  But he asserted that he never used the phrase ""billions and billions"" in that show, and that the public association of him with that phrase is due to a parody that Johnny Carson did of Sagan on _The Tonight Show_.  ""blue moon""  (notes by Philip Hiscock) -----------     The phrase ""blue moon"" has been around a long time, well over 400 years, but during that time its meaning has shifted around a lot.  I have counted six different meanings which have been carried by the term, and at least four of them are still current today.    The earliest uses of the term are in a phrase remarkably like early references to ""green cheese"".  Both were used as examples of obvious absurdities about which there could be no argument.  Four hundred years ago, if someone said ""He would argue the moon was blue"", the average 16th-centuryman would take it the way we take ""He'd argue that black is white.""  The earliest citation is a 1528 poem ""Rede Me and Be Not Wroth"":  ""Yf they say the mone is blewe/We must believe that it is true.""    This understanding of a blue moon's being absurd (the first meaning) led eventually to a second meaning, that of ""never"".  To say that something would happen when the moon turned blue was like saying that it would happen on Tib's Eve (at least before Tib got a day near Christmas assigned to her).     But of course, there are examples of the moon's actually turning blue; that's the third meaning:  the moon's visually appearing blue. When the Indonesian volcano Krakatoa exploded in 1883, its dust turned sunsets green and the moon blue all around the world for the best part of two years.  In 1927, a late monsoon in India set up conditions for a blue moon.  And the moon here in Newfoundland was turned blue in September 1950 when huge forest fires in Alberta threw smoke particles up into the sky.  Even by the 19th century, it was clear that although visually blue moons were rare, they did happen from time to time.  So the phrase ""once in a blue moon"" came about.  It meant then exactly what it means today:  that an event was fairly infrequent, but not quite regular enough to pinpoint. That's meaning number four, and today it is still the main one.    I know of six songs which use ""blue moon"" as a symbol of sadness and loneliness.  In half of them, the poor crooner's moon turns to gold when he gets his love at the end of the song.  That's meaning number five:  check your old Elvis Presley or Bill Monroe records for more information.    Finally, in the 1980s, a sixth meaning was popularized (chiefly by the game Trivial Pursuit):  the second full moon in a month.  The earliest reference cited for this is The Maine Farmers' Almanac for 1937.  Rumour has it that when there were two full moons in a calendar month, calendars would put the first in red, the second in blue.  ""Bob's your uncle"" ------------------     This British phrase means ""all will be well"" or ""simple as that"": ""You go and ask for the job -- and he remembers your name -- and Bob's your uncle.""  It dates from circa 1890.    P. Brendon, in _Eminent Edwardians_, 1979, suggests an origin: ""When, in 1887, Balfour was unexpectedly promoted to the vital front line post of Chief Secretary for Ireland by his uncle Robert, Lord Salisbury (a stroke of nepotism that inspired the catch-phrase 'Bob's your uncle'), ...""    Or it may have been prompted by the cant phrase ""All is bob"" = ""all is safe.""    (Info from Eric Partridge's _Dictionary of Catch Phrases_, 2nd edition, revised by Paul Beale, Routledge, 1985, ISBN 0-415-05916-X.)  ""Break a leg!"" --------------     There is a superstition in the theatre that wishing an actor good luck ""tempts the gods"" and causes bad luck, so negative expressions are substituted.  In French one says _Merde!_ (""Shit!"") when an actor is about to go on stage.  The German expression is _Hals und Beinbruch_=""neck and leg fracture"" (_Bein_ used to mean ""bone"" in German, so the translation ""neck and bone break"" may be correct if the expression is sufficiently old).  The leading theory is that the English expression came from the German, possibly via Yiddish.  Other suggested origins are:  John Wilkes Booth, the actor who broke his leg shortly after he assassinated Abraham Lincoln in 1865; the great French actress Sarah Bernhardt, who ""had but one leg and it would be good luck to be like her""; wishing someone a ""big break"", that is, good luck leading to success; and the Hebrew _hatzlacha u-brakha_ = ""success and blessing"".  ""to call a spade a spade"" -------------------------  is NOT an ethnic slur.    It derives from an ancient Greek expression:  _ta syka syka, te:n skaphe:n de skaphe:n onomasein_ = ""to call a fig a fig, a trough a trough"".  This is first recorded in Aristophanes' play _The Clouds_ (423 B.C.), was used by Menander and Plutarch, and is still current in modern Greek.  There has been a slight shift in meaning:  in ancient times the phrase was often used pejoratively, to denote a rude person who spoke his mind tactlessly; but it now, like the English phrase, has an exclusively positive connotation.  It is possible that both the fig and the trough were originally sexual symbols.    In the Renaissance, Erasmus confused Plutarch's ""trough"" (_skaphe:_) with the Greek word for ""digging tool"" (_skapheion_; the two words are etymologically connected, a trough being something that is hollowed out) and rendered it in Latin as _ligo_. Thence it was translated into English in 1542 by Nicholas Udall in his translation of Erasmus's version as ""to call a spade [...] a spade"".  (_Bartlett's Familiar Quotations_ perpetuates Erasmus' error by mistranslating _skaphe:_ as ""spade"" three times under Menander.)    ""To call a spade a bloody shovel"" is not recorded until 1919. ""Spade"" in the sense of ""Negro"" is not recorded until 1928.  (It comes from the colour of the playing card symbol, via the phrase ""black as the ace of spades"".)     This, of course, does *not* necessarily render the modern use of ""to call a spade a spade"" ""politically correct"".  Rosalie Maggio, in _The Bias-Free Word-Finder_, writes:  ""The expression is associated with a racial slur and is to be avoided"", and recommends using ""to speak plainly"" or other alternatives instead.  In another entry, she writes:  ""Although by definition and derivation 'niggardly' and 'nigger' are completely unrelated, 'niggardly' is too close for comfort to a word with profoundly negative associations.  Use instead one of the many available alternatives:  stingy, miserly, parsimonious...""  Beard and Cerf, in _The Official Politically Correct Handbook_, p. 123, report that an administrator at the University of California at Santa Cruz campaigned for the banning of such phrases as ""a chink in his armor"" and ""a nip in the air"", because ""chink"" and ""nip"" are also derogatory terms for ""Chinese person"" and ""Japanese person"" respectively.  In the late 1970s in the U.S., a boycott of the (now defunct) Sambo's restaurant chain was organized, even though the name ""Sambo's"" was a combination of the names of its two founders and did not come from the offensive word for dark-skinned person.  ""cut the mustard"" -----------------     This expression meaning ""to achieve the required standard"" is first recorded in an O. Henry story of 1902:  ""So I looked around and found a proposition [a woman] that exactly cut the mustard.""     It may come from a cowboy expression, ""the proper mustard"", meaning ""the genuine thing"", and a resulting use of ""mustard"" to denote the best of anything.  O. Henry in _Cabbages and Kings_ (1894) called mustard ""the main attraction"":  ""I'm not headlined in the bills, but I'm the mustard in the salad dressing, just the same.""  Figurative use of ""mustard"" as a positive superlative dates from 1659 in the phrase ""keen as mustard"", and use of ""cut"" to denote rank (as in ""a cut above"") dates from the 18th century.     Other theories are that it is a corruption of the military phrase ""to pass muster"" (""muster"", from Latin _monstrare_=""to show"", means ""to assemble (troops), as for inspection""); that it refers to the practice of adding vinegar to ground-up mustard seed to ""cut"" the bitter taste; that it literally means ""cut mustard"" as an example of a difficult task, mustard being a relatively tough crop that grows close to the ground; and that it literally means ""cut mustard"" as an example of an easy task (via the negative expression ""can't even cut the mustard""), mustard being easier to cut at the table than butter.     The more-or-less synonymous expression ""cut it"" (as in ""'Sorry' doesn't cut it"") seems to be more recent and may derive from ""cut the mustard"".  ""cut to the chase"" ------------------     On its AOL message board, Merriam-Webster Editorial Department writes:  ""The phrase 'cut to the chase' developed from cinema terminology, where it referred to the act of switching from a less action-packed scene to a more exciting sequence -- typically a chase scene -- in order to draw the audience's attention back to the screen.  Within the past fifteen years or so, 'cut to the chase' has come to be used outside of the film industry with the figurative meaning of 'get to the point.'""     Jesse Sheidlower adds:  ""The literal use -- as a director's instruction to go to a chase scene -- is quite old.  A 1929 novel about Hollywood has 'Jannings escapes....Cut to chase', for example. The figurative use, which is now quite common, is fairly recent; it seems to date only from the early 1980s.""  ""The die is cast."" ------------------  does NOT mean ""The metal template has been molded.""   It's what Julius Caesar said on crossing the river Rubicon to invade Italy in 49 B.C.  The ""die"" is a gambling die, and ""cast"" means thrown.  The phrase means ""An irrevocable decision has been made.""  (The Latin words, ""Jacta alea est"", are given in Suetonius' _Divus Julius_, XXXII.  _Alea_ denotes the *game* of dice, rather than the physical die:  the dice game is in its thrown state.  ""The die is cast"" and ""the dice are cast"" would be equally good translations.  Compare ""Les jeux sont faits"", heard at Monte Carlo.)     Plutarch wrote two accounts in Greek of Caesar's crossing the Rubicon.  Both times, he gives the words as _Anerriphtho: kubos_ = ""Let the die be cast.""  In one of the accounts (Life of Pompey), he says that Caesar actually uttered the words in Greek; in the other (Life of Caesar), he suggests that the words were already a proverb before Caesar uttered them.  ""dressed to the nines"" ----------------------     This expression, meaning ""very fashionably and elaborately dressed"", is recorded from the 18th century.  ""The nine"" or ""the nines"" were used to signify ""superlative"" in numerous other contexts.  Theories include:  9, being the highest single-digit number, symbolized the best; a metanalysis of Old English _to then eyne_ ""to the eyes""; and a reference to the 9 muses.  ""Elementary, my dear Watson!"" -----------------------------  does not occur as such in any of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, although Holmes does exclaim ""Elementary"" in ""The Crooked Man"", and says ""It was very superficial, my dear Watson, I assure you"" in ""The Cardboard Box"".  The first recorded juxtaposition is in the 1929 film _The Return of Sherlock Holmes_ (the first Holmes film with sound).     The original stories never mention an Inverness cape, a deerstalker hat, or a meerschaum pipe, either.  Those props are due to illustrators and to actors.     The WWW Sherlockian home page is at: < http://watserv1.uwaterloo.ca/~credmond/sh.html > ""Enquiring minds want to know."" (notes by James Kiso) -------------------------------     This originated as a slogan used in TV ads in the 1980s by the National Enquirer.  The Enquirer (based in Lantana, Florida; not to be confused with Philadelphia Inquirer, a fine paper) is the largest-selling ""news"" weekly in the U.S.; it belongs to the sensationalistic genre known as ""supermarket tabloids"" or ""checkout- line rags"" because the most familiar points of distribution are racks near supermarket checkout lines.     The ads featured a series of ""ear-catching"" headlines from recent issues followed by actors (I hope) miming surprise at the revelation. The stories ranged from amazing weight-loss diets based on the intake of broccoli and ice cream to the tragic story of Michael Jackson's unrequited love for Liz Taylor.  A following voice-over would say, ""Enquiring minds want to know.""  ""The exception proves the rule."" --------------------------------     The common misconception (which you will find in several books, including the _Dictionary of Misinformation_) is that ""proves"" in this phrase means ""tests"".  That is *not* the case, although ""proof"" *does* mean ""test"" in such locutions as ""proving ground"", ""proofreader"", ""proof spirit"", and ""The proof of the pudding is in the eating.""    As MEU says, ""the original legal sense"" of the ""the exception proves the rule"" is as follows: ""'Special leave is given for men to be out of barracks tonight till 11.0 p.m.'; 'The exception proves the rule' means that this special leave implies a rule requiring men, except when an exception is made, to be in earlier.  The value of this in interpreting statutes is plain.""    MEU2 adds: ""'A rule is not proved by exceptions unless the exceptions themselves lead one to infer a rule' (Lord Atkin).  The formula in full is _exceptio probat regulam in casibus non exceptis_.""  [That's Latin for ""The exception proves the rule in cases not excepted.""]    The phrase seems to date from the 17th century.  (Anthony Cree, in _Cree's Dictionary of Latin Quotations_ (Newbury, 1978) says that the phrase comes from classical Latin, which it defines as Latin spoken before A.D. 400; but no classical citations have come to our attention.)  Below are the five seventeenth-century citations that we could find.  1, 3, and 4 are in the OED; 2 is in _Latin for Lawyers_ by E. Hilton Jackson and Herbert Broom; 5 is in _A Dictionary of the Proverbs in England in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries_, by Morris Palmer Tilley. 1. 1617 Samuel Collins, _Epphata to F.T.; or, the Defence of the    Bishop of Elie concerning his answer to Cardinall Ballarmine's    Apologie_ 100:  ""Indefinites are equivalent to universalls    especially where one exception being made, it is plaine that all    others are thereby cut off, according to the rule Exceptio    figit regulam in non exceptis.""  [Note that _figit_ rather than    _probat_ is here used.  _Probo_ can mean any of ""give official    approval to"", ""put to the test"", or ""demonstrate the verity of"";    but _figo_ can only mean ""fix"", ""fasten"", or ""establish"".] 2. _The reports of Sir Edvvard Coke, Kt., late Lord Chief-Justice    of England_ (1658 edition; Sir Edward Coke died in 1634): ""[...]    upon which Award of the Exigent, his Administrators brought a    Writ of Error; and it was adjudged, That the Writ of Error did    lie, and the reason was, Because that by the Awarding of the    Exigent, his Goods and Chattels were forfeited, and of such    Awards which tend _ad tale grave damnum_ of the party, a Writ of    Error lieth, although the Principal Judgment was never given; in    this case, _Exceptio probat regulam_, & _sic de similibus_.""    [""A writ of error lieth"" = ""an appeal is admissible""; ""exigent""    = writ of suspension of civil rights; _ad tale grave damnum_ =    ""to such great loss""; _sic de similibus_ = ""thus about similar    things"".] 3. 1640 Gilbert Watts, _Bacon's Advancement and proficience of    learning_ VIII. iii. Aph. 17:  ""As exception strengthens the    force of a Law in Cases not excepted, so enumeration weakens it    in Cases not enumerated.""  [So when Lewis Carroll wrote ""I am    fond of children (except boys)"", he affirmed his fondness for    girls more strongly than he would have had he written merely ""I    am fond of children.""] 4. 1664 John Wilson, _The Cheats_, To Reader:  ""For if I have shown    the odd practices of two vain persons pretending to be what they    are not, I think I have sufficiently justified the brave man    even by this reason, that the exception proves the rule.""  [The    OED (but not the other books I checked) gives the date as 1662.    As far as I can tell from this scant context, Wilson seems to be    saying, ""My description of two cowardly cheats should serve to    show you the bad consequences of not being brave, and hence    convince you of the need for a rule: 'Be brave!'.""] 5. 1666 Giovanni Torriano, _Piazza universale di proverbi italiani,    or A Common Place of Italian Proverbs_ I, p. 80 ""The exception    gives Authority to the Rule."" note 28, p. 242 ""And the Latin    says again, Exceptio probat Regulam."" To convince us that *in this particular phrase* ""proves"" originally meant ""tests"", you will have to produce citations as old as or older than these to support your view.  ""face the music"" ----------------     This expression, meaning ""accept the unpleasant consequences"", is first recorded in the U.S. around 1850.  It may derive from musical theatre:  a nervous actor would have to summon all his courage to face the audience across the orchestra pit.  Or it may be one of three military references:  an infantryman taking his place in the line of assembly; a cavalier keeping his restive horse still while the band starts to play; or a soldier being drummed out of his regiment.  ""fall off a turnip truck"" -------------------------     This is now a very common phrase, as a search of Deja News will show.  But Merriam-Webster reports that it has no citations of the whole phrase earlier than 1988, and no citations of ""turnip truck"" earlier than 1985.  R. J. Valentine writes:  ""This phrase has been used for many years by Johnny Carson, who hosted _The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson_ on NBC from the early 1960s to the early 1990s.  He used it in precisely in the context discussed. He may not have originated it, but he certainly popularized it, and began doing so long before 1985.""     Evan Morris, at < http://www.interport.net/~words1 >, says that this phrase ""seems to be a good example of an entire class of catch phrases based on urban-rural rivalry.  The thrust of such phrases is, of course, that 'I am not a fool or a newcomer,' and, in this case, that 'I am not an ignorant country bumpkin who just arrived in the big city on a truck full of lowly turnips that I was dumb enough, on top of everything else, to fall off of.'  This image of a bewildered hayseed ripe for fleecing by urban con artists is a close relative of more general phrases used to assert one's 'insider status' and thus intelligence or savvy.  The United States being a nation largely composed of immigrants, it's not surprising that the all-time most commonly heard phrase of this type is 'I didn't just get off the boat.'""  ""full monty"" ------------     This British expression meaning ""the whole thing"", or more specifically ""16 megabytes of memory, when fitted to an IBM PC or compatible computer"", is first attested in 1986.  To Michael Quinion's comprehensive treatment at < http://clever.net/quinion/words/monty.htm > may be added a story reported by Simon Gray that the origin is ""the full diamond mount"", i.e., the whole diamond ring; and the Jargon File's statement: ""This usage is possibly derived from a TV commercial for Del Monte fruit juice, in which one of the characters insisted on 'the full Del Monte'.""  ""Get the lead out"" ------------------  is short for ""Get the lead out of your ass/britches/butt/feet/ pants"", which is long for ""Move!""  These expressions originated in the U.S. circa 1930.  ""Go figure"" -----------     This expands to ""Go and figure it out"", and means: ""The reasons for the fact just stated are unknown and possibly unknowable.  You can waste your time thinking about what they might be, if you choose, but you're not likely to accomplish anything."" (Kivi Shapiro)     ""Go figure"" comes from Yiddish _Gey vays_ ""Go know"".  Leo Rosten, in _The Joys of Yinglish_ (Penguin, 1989, ISBN 0-452-26534-6), says: ""In English, one says, 'Go _and_ see [look, ask, tell]...'  Using an imperative without any link to a conjunction is pure Yiddish, no doubt derived from the biblical phrase, translated literally: 'Go tell...'  'Go praise the Lord...'  (In English this becomes 'Come, let us praise the Lord.')""     Gianfranco Boggio-Togna writes:  ""The expressions an Italian is likely to use to show bafflement correspond exactly to ""go figure"": _va a capire_='go understand' or _va a sapere_='go know'.  The _va a_ idiom is common in colloquial Italian.""     Other English expressions said to derive from Yiddish include: ""Big deal!"" (_A Groyser kunst!_); ""Bite your tongue"" (_Bays dir di tsung_); ""bottom line"" (_untershte shure_); ""Eat your heart out"" (_Es dir oys s'harts_); ""Enough already!"" (_Genug shoyn_); ""for real"" (_far emmes_); ""Look who's talking!"" (_Kuk nor ver s'ret!_); ""make like a"" (_makh vi_); ""shm-"" as in ""Fair, shmair""; ""Sez you"" (_Azoy zugst du_); ""Thanks a *lot*"" (ironic) (_A shenem dank aykh_); ""That's for sure"" (_Dos iz oyf zikher_); and ""Who needs it?"" (_Ver darf es?_).  ""Go placidly amid the noise and the haste"" (Desiderata) -------------------------------------------------------     ""Desiderata"" was written in 1927 by Max Ehrmann (1872-1945).  In 1956, the rector of St. Paul's Church in Baltimore, Maryland, used the poem in a collection of mimeographed inspirational material for his congregation.  Someone who subsequently printed it asserted that it was found in Old St. Paul's Church, dated 1692.  The year 1692 was the founding date of the church and has nothing to do with the poem.  See Fred D. Cavinder, ""Desiderata"", _TWA Ambassador_, Aug. 1973, pp. 14-15.  ""go to hell in a handbasket"" ----------------------------     This phrase, meaning ""to deteriorate rapidly"", originated in the U.S. in the early 20th century.  A handbasket is just a basket with a handle.  Something carried in a handbasket goes wherever it's going without much resistance.     James L. Rader of Merriam-Webster Editorial Dept. writes:  ""The Dictionary of American Regional English [...] records 'to go to heaven in a handbasket' much earlier than [...] 'hell,' which is not attested before the 1950s.  The earliest cite in our files is from 1949 [...].  'In a handbasket' seems to imply ease and and speed [...].  Perhaps part of the success of these phrases must simply be ascribed to the force of alliteration.  DARE has a much earlier citation for another alliterative collocation with 'handbasket' (1714), from Samuel Sewall's diary:  'A committee brought in something about Piscataqua.  Govr said he would give his head in a Handbasket as soon as he would pass it.' I suspect that 'to go to hell in a handbasket' has been around much longer than our records would seem to indicate.""  ""hell for leather"" ------------------     Robert L. Chapman's _New Dictionary of American Slang_ (Harper & Row, 1987, ISBN 0-06-181157-2) says:  ""hell-for-leather or hell- bent-for-leather adv _from late 1800s British_  Rapidly and energetically; =all out, flat out.  _You're heading hell-for-leather to a crack-up_ [origin unknown; perhaps related to British dialect phrases _go hell for ladder, hell falladerly, hell faleero_, and remaining mysterious even if so, although the _leather_ would then be a very probable case of folk etymology with a vague sense of the _leather_ involved in horse trappings.]""  ""hoist with his own petard"" ---------------------------     ""For 'tis the sport to have the enginer / Hoist with his owne petar"" -- Shakespeare, Hamlet III iv.  ""Hoist"" was in Shakespeare's time the past participles of a verb ""to hoise"", which meant what ""to hoist"" does now:  to lift.  A petard (see under ""peter out"" for the etymology) was an explosive charge detonated by a slowly burning fuse.  If the petard went off prematurely, then the sapper (military engineer; Shakespeare's ""enginer"") who planted it would be hurled into the air by the explosion.  (Compare ""up"" in ""to blow up"".)  A modern rendition might be:  ""It's fun to see the engineer blown up with his own bomb.""  ""by hook or by crook"" ---------------------     This phrase formerly meant ""by fair means or foul"", although now it often (especially in the U.K.) means simply ""by whatever necessary means"".  The first recorded use is by John Wycliffe in _Controversial Tracts_ (circa 1380).  Theories include:  a law or custom in mediaeval England that allowed peasants to take as firewood from the King's forests any deadwood that they could reach with a shepherd's crook and cut off with a reaper's billhook; rhyming words for ""direct"" (reachable with a long hook) and ""indirect"" (roundabout); beginners' writing exercises, where letters have hooks and brackets are ""crooks""; and from ""Hook"" and ""Crook"", the names of headlands on either side of a bay north of Waterford, Ireland, referring to a captain's determination to make the haven of the bay in bad weather using one headland or the other as a guide.  ""Illegitimis non carborundum"" -----------------------------     Yes, this means ""Don't let the bastards grind you down"", but it is not real Latin; it is a pseudo-Latin joke.     ""Carborundum"" is a trademark for a very hard substance composed of silicon carbide, used in grinding.  (The name ""Carborundum"" is a blend of ""carbon"" and ""corundum"".  ""Corundum"" denotes aluminium oxide, and comes to English from Tamil _kuruntam_; it is related to Sanskrit _kuruvinda_ = ""ruby"".)  ""The ""-ndum"" ending suggests the Latin gerundive, which is used to express desirability of the activity denoted by the verb, as in _Nil desperandum_ = ""nothing to be despaired of""; _addendum_ = ""(thing) fit to be added""; _corrigendum_ = ""(thing) fit to be corrected""; and the name Amanda, from _amanda_ = ""fit to be loved"").     _Illegitimis_ is the dative plural of _illegitimus_ = ""illegitimate""; the gerundive in Latin correctly takes the dative to denote the agent.  _Illegitimus_ could conceivably mean ""bastard"" in Latin, but was not the usual word for it:  _Follett World-Wide Latin Dictionary_ (Follett, 1967) gives _nothus homo_ for bastard of known father, and _spurius_ for bastard of unknown father.     The phrase seems to have originated with British army intelligence early in World War II.  It was popularized when U.S. general Joseph W. ""Vinegar Joe"" Stilwell (1883-1946) adopted it as his motto.  Various variant forms are in circulation.  ""in like Flynn"" ---------------     This phrase's first meaning was ""in favour, assured of success, in an enviable position"".  Some writers allege that it originated in allusion to Edward Joseph ""Boss"" Flynn (1892-1953), a campaign manager for the U.S. Democratic party during Franklin Delano Roosevelt's presidency.  Flynn's machine was so successful at winning elections that his candidates seemed to be in office automatically.     But the phrase was popularized with reference to Australian-born Hollywood actor Errol Flynn (1909-59), whose amorous exploits gave it a second meaning:  ""being a quick seducer"".  The earliest citation we have seen does refer to Errol Flynn (but not to seduction):  ""_In like Flynn._  Everything is O.K.  In other words, the pilot is having no more trouble than Errol Flynn has in his cinematic feats."" (1945 in _American Speech_ Dec. 1946, 310)     The phrase ""In Like Flint"" has also been heard: it was the title of a 1967 movie, a sequel to ""Our Man Flint"" (1965).  Both films were spy spoofs starring James Coburn.  The 1967 title was, of course, wordplay on ""in like Flynn"" and the character name ""Flint"".  ""Jingle Bells"" --------------     This song by James Pierpont was fist published in 1857 by Oliver Ditson & Co., with the title ""The One Horse Open Sleigh"".  In 1859 Ditson reissued it with a new cover, and the title ""Jingle Bells, Or the One horse open Sleigh.""  The book _Popular Songs of Nineteenth-Century America_ (ed. Richard Jackson, Dover, 1976, ISBN 0-486-23270-0) reprints this second edition in facsimile. There is no comma between ""Jingle"" and ""bells"" in either the title or the chorus.  The first verse has ""Bells on bobtail ring"" (not ""bobtails"").  The word ""fun"" appears nowhere in the song: the first verse has ""Oh what sport to ride and sing / A sleighing song tonight"", and the chorus has ""Oh! what joy it is to ride / In a one horse open sleigh.""  The verse tune and the words of both the verse and the chorus are nearly identical to those familiar today.  The chorus tune is much less monotone than the chorus tune familiar today, but would have been too difficult for children to sing:  it must have been corrupted by generations of schoolchildren into what we have now.     In the same volume are facsimiles of ""Jim Crack Corn"" (the words ""Jim crack corn I don't care"" have no ""and"", and ""don't"" rather than ""I"" on the downbeat), and ""Oh My Darling Clementine"" (said to be originally a serious song; the original does not include the verse with ""And her shoes were number nine"").  ""Let them eat cake!"" --------------------     The French is _Qu'ils mangent de la brioche_ (not _gateau_ as one might expect).  And Queen Marie-Antoinette did *not* say this. (When famine struck Paris, she actually took an active role in relieving it.)  Jean-Jacques Rousseau attributed the words to ""a great princess"" in book 6 of his _Confessions_.  _Confessions_ was published posthumously, but book 6 was written 2 or 3 years before Marie-Antoinette arrived in France in 1770.     John Wexler writes:  ""French law obliged bakers to sell certain standard varieties of loaf at fixed weights and prices.  (It still does, which explains why the most expensive patisserie will sell you a baguette for the same price as a supermarket.)  At the time when this quotation originated, the law also obliged the baker to sell a fancier loaf for the price of the cheap one when the cheap ones were all gone.  This was to forestall the obvious trick of baking just a few standard loaves, so that one could make more profit by using the rest of the flour for price-unregulated loaves.  So whoever it was who said _Qu'ils mangent de la brioche_, she (or he) was not being wholly flippant.  The idea was that the bread shortage could be alleviated if the law was enforced against profiteering bakers.  I have seen this explanation quoted in defence of Marie Antoinette. It seems a pity, after all that, if she didn't say it.""     Gregory Titelman, in _Random House Dictionary of Popular Proverbs & Sayings_ (1996), writes:  ""Zhu Muzhi [head of the official Chinese Human Rights Study Society in the People's Republic of China] traces it to an ancient Chinese emperor who, being told that his subjects didn't have enough rice to eat, replied, 'Why don't they eat meat?'""  ""mind your p's and q's"" -----------------------     This expression, meaning ""be very careful to behave correctly"", has been in use from the 17th century on.  Theories include:  an admonishment to children learning to write; an admonishment to typesetters (who had to look at the letters reversed); an admonishment to seamen not to soil their navy pea-jackets with their tarred ""queues"" (pigtails); ""mind your pints and quarts""; ""mind your prices and quality""; ""mind your pieds and queues"" (either feet and pigtails, or two dancing figures that had to be accurately performed); the substitution of /p/ for ""qu"" /kw/ in the speech of uneducated ancient Romans; or the confusion by students learning both Latin and Ancient Greek of such cognates as _pente_ and _quintus_.  And yes, we've heard the joke about the instruction to new sextons:  ""Mind your keys and pews.""     The most plausible explanation is the one given in the latest edition of Collins English Dictionary:  an alteration of ""Mind your 'please's and 'thank you's"".  ""more honoured in the breach than the observance"" -------------------------------------------------     From _Hamlet_, Act 1, Scene 4.  Shakespeare meant ""BETTER broken than observed"", not ""more often broken than observed"".  ""more than you can shake a stick at"" ------------------------------------     This 19th-century Americanism now means ""an abundance""; but its original meaning is unclear.  Suggestions have included ""more than one can count"" (OED, AHD3), ""more than one can threaten"" (Charles Earle Funk), and ""more than one can believe"" (Dictionary of American English).  No one of these seems easy to reconcile with all the following citations:  ""We have in Lancaster as many taverns as you can shake a stick at."" (1818)  ""This was a temperance house, and there was nothing to treat a friend to that was worth shaking a stick at.""  (David Crockett, _Tour to the North and Down East_, 1835)  ""Our queen snake was [...] retiring, attended by more of her subjects than we even dared to shake a stick at."" (1843)  ""I have never sot eyes on anything that could shake a stick at that."" (= ""set eyes on anything that could compare with that"", 1843) ""[...] Uncle Sam [...] has more acres than you can throw a stick at."" (1851)  ""She got onto the whappiest, biggest, rustiest yaller moccasin that ever you shuck er stick at."" (1851)     A connection with the British expression ""hold (the) sticks with"", meaning ""compete on equal terms with"" and attested since 1817, is not impossible.     OED staff told me:  ""The US usages in DAE do appear to have a different sense to that given in OED. [...]  All the modern examples I've found on our databases conform to OED's definition so I think this is still the most common usage.""     Merriam-Webster staff opined that the ""count"" interpretation ""works as well for 'as many as you can shake a stick at' [...] if you take it to mean that there is no limit to how many of the objects in question one could shake one's stick at. [...]  We would consider 'A can't shake a stick at B' a different expression entirely, with a meaning similar to 'A can't hold a candle to B' [...].""     In their 1897 work _A Dictionary of Slang, Jargon & Cant_, Albert Barrere and Charles Leland suggested that Dutch immigrants originated the expression using the Dutch word _schok_ = ""to shake or hit.""  ""ollie ollie oxen free"" -----------------------     At < http://www.randomhouse.com/jesse/display.cgi?970422.html >, Jesse Sheidlower writes:  ""'Ollie ollie oxen free' is one of about a bajillion variants (I know -- I counted) of a phrase used in various children's games [...], especially hide-and-(go-)seek. [...]  The original form of the phrase was something like 'all in free or all's out come in free', both standing for something like 'all who are out can come in free'.  These phrases got modified to 'all-ee all-ee (all) in free' or 'all-ee all-ee out(s) in free'; the '-ee' is added, and the 'all' is repeated, for audibility and rhythm.  ['All ye' has also been suggested as the origin.]   From here the number of variants takes off, and we start seeing folk etymologies in various forms.  The most common of these has 'oxen' replacing 'out(s)' in, giving 'all-ee all-ee oxen free'; with the 'all-ee' reinterpreted as the name 'Ollie' [the nickname for Oliver ...]. It's difficult to determine early dates for these expressions -- most of them weren't collected until the 1950s and later -- but based on recollections of the games, it seems that they were in common use by the 1920s, and probably earlier ('home free' is found in print in the 1890s, and the game hide-and-seek is at least four centuries old).  ""peter out"" -----------     This expression meaning ""to dwindle to nothing"" is recorded from 1846, which precludes derivation ""peter"" in the sense ""penis"", an Americanism not attested until 1902.  ""To peter out"" was apparently first used by American miners referring to exhausted veins of ore. The origin is uncertain.  It may come from ""saltpetre"" (used in the miners' explosives, so called because it forms a salt-like crust on rocks, ultimately from Greek _petra_ = ""rock"", whence we also get ""petrify"" and ""petroleum""); or it may come from French _peter_, which literally means ""to fart"" but is used figuratively to mean ""to fizzle"" and in the phrase _peter dans la main_ = ""to come to nothing"" (this comes from the Indo-European root _*perd-/_*pezd-_, whence we get ""fart"", ""feisty"", ""fizzle"", ""partridge"", ""pedicular"", and ""petard"").  ""politically correct"" ---------------------     MWCD10 (1993) dates this expression 1983.  But Merriam-Webster has since discovered a much earlier use, in H. V. Morton's _In the Steps of St. Paul_ (1936).  The passage reads:  ""To use such words would have been equivalent to calling his audience 'slaves and robbers'. But 'Galatians', a term that was politically correct, embraced everyone under Roman rule, from the aristocrat in Antioch to the little slave girl in Iconium.""     Jesse Sheidlower of Random House sent me this citation from the U.S. Supreme Court decision Chisholm v. Georgia (1793):  ""The states, rather than the People, for whose sakes the States exist, are frequently the objects which attract and arrest our principal attention [...].  Sentiments and expressions of this inaccurate kind prevail in our common, even in our convivial, language.  Is a toast asked?  'The United States,' instead of the 'People of the United States,' is the toast given.  This is not politically correct.""  ""push the envelope"" -------------------     ""Push the envelope"" is now used figuratively to mean ""stretch the boundaries"".  (The image is not of pushing a mailing envelope across a desk:  those who push this sort of envelope do it from within.  Cf. ""pressing the limits"".)  On its AOL message board, Merriam-Webster Editorial Department writes:  ""A sentence we spotted in a 1991 issue of the Wall Street Journal provides a typical example of the use of the phrase [...]:  'Ads...seem to be pushing the envelope of taste every day.'  'Push the envelope' in this sense is a very recent arrival on the scene, dating only from 1988 according to the evidence in our files.     ""The phrase has its origins in the world of aviation, where 'envelope' has, since at least the late 60s, had the meaning 'a set of performance limits that may not be safely exceeded.'  Test pilots are often called on to 'push' a new aircraft's performance envelope by going beyond known safety limits, as in determining just how fast an airplane can be flown.  In 1979 Tom Wolfe's best-seller 'The Right Stuff' vividly described the life of test pilots during the 50s and 60s, and it appears that this book, and the subsequent movie, did much to popularize the notion of pushing the envelope.  [Stuart Leichter reports that the words used in the movie are ""pushing the outside of the envelope""; someone should check what they were in the book.]     ""The idea of an envelope as a kind of enclosing boundary is of course not new.  In 1899 Arnold Bennett wrote: 'My desire is to depict the deeper beauty while abiding by the envelope of facts.'""  ""put in one's two cents' worth"" -------------------------------     This expression meaning ""to contribute one's opinion"" dates from the late nineteenth century.  Bo Bradham suggested that it came from ""the days of $.02 postage.  To 'put one's two cents' worth in' referred to the cost of a letter to the editor, the president, or whomever was deserving"".   According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, the first-class postal rate was 2 cents an ounce between 1883 and 1932 (with the exception of a brief period during World War I).  This OED citation confirms that two-cent stamps were once common:  ""1902 ELIZ. L. BANKS Newspaper Girl xiv, Dinah got a letter through the American mail.  She had fivepence to pay on it, because only a common two-cent stamp had been stuck on it.""  On the other hand, ""two-cent"" was an American expression for ""of little value"" (similar to British ""twopenny-halfpenny""), so the phrase may simply have indicated the writer's modesty about the value of his contribution.  ""rule of thumb"" ---------------     This term for ""a simple principle having wide application but not intended to be strictly accurate"" dates from 1692.  A frequently repeated story is that ""rule of thumb"" comes from an old law regulating wife-beating:  ""if a stick were used, it should not be thicker than a man's thumb.""  Jesse Sheidlower writes at < http://www.randomhouse.com/jesse/display.cgi?961108.html >: ""It seems that in 1782 a well-respected English judge named Francis Buller made a public statement that a man had the right to beat his wife as long as the stick was no thicker than his thumb.  There was a public outcry, with satirical cartoons in newspapers, and the story still appeared in biographies of Buller written almost a century later.  Several legal rulings and books in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries mention the practice as something some people believe is true.  There are also earlier precedents for the supposed right of a man to beat his wife.     ""This 'rule' is probably not related to the phrase 'rule of thumb', however.  For one thing, the phrase is [...] attested [earlier ...].  (Of course, it's possible that it was a well-known, but unrecorded, practice before Buller.)  Another problem is that the phrase 'rule of thumb' is never found in connection with the beating practice until the 1970s.  Finally, there is no semantic link [... from what was presumably a very specific distinction to the current sense 'rough guideline'].  The precise origin of 'rule of thumb' is not certain, but it seems likely to refer to the thumb as a rough measuring device ('rule' meaning 'ruler' rather than 'regulation'), which is a common practice.  The linkage of the phrase to the wife-beating rule appears to be based on a misinterpretation of a 1976 National Organization of Women report, which mentioned the phrase and the practice but did not imply a connection.  There is more information about this, with citations from relevant sources, at the Urban Legends Archive.""     Thumbs were used to measure *lots* of things (the first joint was roughly one inch long before we started growing bigger, and French _pouce_ means both ""inch"" and ""thumb"").  The phrase may also come from ancient brewmasters' dipping their thumb in the brew to test the temperature of a batch; or from a guideline for tailors: ""Twice around the thumb is once around the wrist...""     For a definitive rule of thumb, see the paper ""Thumb's rule tested: Visual angle of thumb's width is about 2 deg."" by Robert P. O'Shea in _Perception_, 20, 1991, pp. 415-418.  ""shouting fire in a crowded theater"" ------------------------------------     This is from the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Schenck v. U.S. (1919), setting limits on the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution.  Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Junior, wrote:  ""The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic.""  ""son of a gun"" --------------  dates from 1708; therefore, NOT son of a ""shotgun marriage"", which is only recorded from 1922.  Possibly, it means ""cradled in the gun-carriage of a ship""; allegedly, the place traditionally given to women on board who went into labour -- the only space affording her any privacy and without blocking a gangway -- was between two guns. Or it may mean more simply ""son of a soldier"".  ""spit and image""/""spitting image"" ---------------------------------     These phrases mean ""exact likeness"".  ""Spitting image"" is first recorded in 1901; ""spit and image"" is a bit older (from the late 19th century), which seems to refute the explanation ""splitting image"" (two split halves of the same tree).  An older British expression is ""He's the very spit of his father"", which Eric Partridge, in his _Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English_ (Routledge, 1950) traces back to 1400:  ""He's ... as like these as th'hads't spit him.""  Other languages have similar expressions; e.g., the French say _C'est son pere tout crache_ = ""He is his father completely spat.""  Alternative explanations are ""so alike that even the spit out of their mouths is the same""; ""speaking likeness""; and a corruption of ""spirit"".  ""There's a sucker born every minute"" ------------------------------------     Those of P. T. Barnum's acquaintances who mentioned the subject were unanimous in insisting that he never said this.  The closest thing to it that can be found in Barnum's writings is: ""I said that the people like to be humbugged when, as in my case, there is no humbuggery except that which consists in throwing up sky-rockets and issuing flaming bills and advertisements to attract public attention to shows which all acknowledge are always clean, moral, instructive, elevating, and give back to their patrons in every case several times their money's worth"" (the Bridgeport Standard, 2 Oct. 1885).     Captain Alexander Williams, a New York City police inspector at the time, attributed ""There's a sucker born every minute, but none of them ever die"" to Joseph Bessimer, a notorious confidence trickster of the early 1880s known to the police as ""Paper Collar Joe"".  See _P. T. Barnum: the Legend and the Man_, by A. H. Saxon (Columbia University Press, 1989).     ""There is a Sucker Born Every Minute"" is the title of one of the songs in the 1980 Broadway musical _Barnum_ by Jim Dale.  ""to all intents and purposes"" -----------------------------     This cliche (meaning ""practically"") is a shortening of the legal phrase ""to all intents, constructions, and purposes"" (found in an act adopted under Henry VIII in 1547).  The corruption ""for all intensive purposes"" is frequently reported.  ""wait for the other shoe to drop"" ---------------------------------     This phrase means ""to await an event causally linked to one that one has already observed"".  In the form ""drop the other shoe"", meaning ""say the next obvious thing"" or ""end the suspense"", it dates from the early 20th century.  It derives from the following joke:     A guest who checked into an inn one night was warned to be quiet because the guest in the room next to his was a light sleeper.  As he undressed for bed, he dropped one shoe, which, sure enough, awakened the other guest.  He managed to get the other shoe off in silence, and got into bed.  An hour later, he heard a pounding on the wall and a shout:  ""When are you going to drop the other shoe?""     Markus Laker reports that The Goon Show (a 1950s BBC radio comedy) made reference to this.  The character Eccles was an idiot and a bit of a freak.    *CLONK*    ""What's that noise?""    *CLONK*    ""Oh, that's just Eccles taking his boots off.""    *CLONK*  ""Wherefore art thou Romeo?"" ---------------------------    ""Wherefore"" means ""why"", not ""where"".  ""whole cloth"" (notes by Ellen Rosen) -------------     The phrase ""made out of whole cloth"" (and variants) currently means ""utterly without foundation in fact, completely fictitious."" MWCD10 gives only this sense for ""whole cloth"" and dates it 1840. The phrase did not always have this connotation, however.     The OED has citations for ""whole cloth"" from 1433 on.  Its first definition is ""a piece of cloth of the full size as manufactured, as distinguished from a piece that may be cut off or out of it for a garment, etc.""  This sense is still used by people who sew or quilt, who use ""whole cloth"" to mean ""uncut fabric"".     The OED also gives several citations for the phrase ""cut (or made) out of whole cloth"".  The earliest citation is from 1579. These citations indicate that for roughly 300 years, the phrase was used to connote entirety, but not falsehood (an example from 1634: ""The valiant Souldier ... measureth out of the whole cloath his Honour with his sword"". This positive sense of ""whole cloth"" persisted in England until at least the beginning of this century (a citation from 1905: ""That Eton captain is cut out of whole cloth; no shoddy there"".)     Before the Industrial Revolution, few people had ready access to whole cloth.  Cotton had to be picked (or sheep sheared); the cotton or wool had to be washed and picked over; the material had to be spun into thread, and the thread woven into cloth.  Cloth was therefore precious and frequently reused.  A worn-out man's shirt would be cut down to make a child's shirt; the unworn parts of a woman's skirt would be reused to make quilts; etc.  Also, homespun fabric was not very comfortable to wear.  Even after the Industrial Revolution, ready-made whole cloth was sufficiently expensive that many people could not afford to use new cloth for everything.     Therefore, to have a piece of clothing made out of whole cloth must have been very special, indeed:  something new, not something hand-me-down; something that hadn't been patched together from disparate, often unmatched pieces; maybe even something comfortable. So describing something as being made from whole cloth would mean that it had never existed as a garment before, and that it was something special, something wondrous -- one's Sunday best, or better.     The meaning of the phrase ""made out of whole cloth"" appears to have begun to change in the United States in the first half of the 19th century.  The OED labels the falsehood sense ""U.S. colloquial or slang"", and provides a citation from 1843:  ""Isn't this entire story ... made out of whole cloth?""  The change of meaning may have arisen from deceptive trade practices.  Charles Earle Funk suggests that 19th-century tailors advertising whole cloth may really have been using patched cloth or cloth that was falsely stretched to appear to be full-width.     Alternatively, the modern figurative meaning of ""whole cloth"" may depend on a lie's having sprung whole _ex nihilo_, having no connection with existing facts.  All-newness distinguishes garments and lies made out of whole cloth.  This is a positive characteristic for clothes, but not for the average tissue of lies and deception.     A Web search done by Michael Papadopoulos ( papadop@peak.org ) indicates (a) that the original British usage has not been left behind by the British and (b) that ""the opposite US usage meaning 'completely fictitious' is neither the only US usage nor the dominant one.""  ""the whole nine yards"" ----------------------     This phrase, meaning ""all of it, everything"", dates from at least the 1950s.  The origin is a matter for speculation.  9 yards is not a particularly significant distance either in football or in the garment business (a man's three-piece suit requires about 7 square yards of cloth, and cloth is sold in bolts of 20 to 25 yards).  The phrase may refer to the capacity of ready-mix concrete trucks, alleged to average about 9 cubic yards.  Some people (e.g., James Kilpatrick in _Fine Print:  Reflections on the Writing Art_) have satisfied themselves that the concrete-trucks explanation is the correct one; but I haven't seen the evidence.  And Matthew Jetmore has unearthed some evidence to the contrary, a passage from the August 1964 issue of _Ready Mixed Concrete_ Magazine:  ""The trend toward larger truck mixer units is probably one of the strongest and most persistent trends in the industry.  Whereas, just a few years ago, the 4 1/2 cubic yard mixer was definitely the standard of the industry, the average nationwide mixer size by 1962 had increased to 6.24 cubic yards, with still no end in sight to the demand for increased payload.""  The phrase is covered by Cecil Adams in _More of the Straight Dope_, pp. 252-257.  A ""canonical collection"" of explanations has been compiled by ""Snopes"" ( snopes@netcom.com ).     Michael Nunamaker writes that a friend of his in the U.S. Air Force suggested a World War II origin:  ""According to him, the length of the ammunition belt (feeding the machine guns) in the Supermarine Spitfire was nine yards.  Therefore, when a pilot had shot all his ammunition he would say he had 'shot the whole nine yards'.""  ""You have another think coming"" -------------------------------     ""If you think that, you have another think coming"" means ""You are mistaken and will soon have to alter your opinion"".  This is now sometimes heard with ""thing"" in place of ""think"", but ""think"" is the older version.  Eric Partridge,  in _A Dictionary of Catch Phrases_, gives the phrase as ""you have another guess coming"", ""US: since the 1920s, if not a decade or two earlier"".   Clearly ""think"" is closer to ""guess"" than ""thing"" is.  The OED gives a citation with ""think"" from 1937, and no evidence for ""thing"".  Merriam-Webster Editorial Department writes:  ""When an informal poll was conducted here at Merriam-Webster, about 60% of our editors favored 'thing' over 'think,' a result that runs counter to our written evidence.""  ====================================================================    WORDS FREQUENTLY SOUGHT   -----------------------  words ending in ""-gry"" ----------------------     Yes, questions like this belong in rec.puzzles , not here, but in a desperate attempt to reduce the volume of queries, I give here the answer from the rec.puzzles archive:     THERE IS NO COMMON THIRD WORD ENDING IN ""-GRY"".     Aside from ""angry"" and ""hungry"" and words derived therefrom, there is only one word ending with ""-gry"" in W3:  ""aggry."" However, this word is defective in that it is part of a phrase ""aggry beads"".  The OED's usage examples all talk about ""aggry beads"".     Moving to older dictionaries, we find that ""gry"" itself is a word in Webster's Second Unabridged (and the OED):  gry, n. [L. gry, a trifle; Gr. gry, a grunt]    1. a measure equal to one-tenth of a line. [Obs.] (Obs. =  obsolete)    2. anything very small.

This puzzle has been plaguing AOL since at least mid-1995, and more recently Usenet.  It is often presented with embellishments such as ""you use it every day, and if you've listened closely, I've already told you the answer.""  A post by jackper@aol.com gives a clue to the origin of this version:  | I heard this riddle 20 years ago from a fiddle player.  He got it | from his wife who taught pre-school.  It was worded slightly | differently from the version that got onto the radio recently.  As | I remember it from 1975: | |   Think of words ending in 'gry'.  Angry and hungry are two of them. |   There are only three words in the English language.  What is the |   third word?  The word is something that everyone uses every day. |   If you have listened carefully, I have already told you what it is. | | The answer, I remember, was 'language' (the first two words being | 'the' and 'English').     A person who doesn't know the trick and asks someone else to try the puzzle will almost certainly change the wording, unwittingly making it insoluble.  It appears that one of these changed versions made it into circulation on phone-in radio shows.     Other trick answers, each allegedly original, are ""what"" (as in ""What is the third word?""), ""say"" (with ""g or y"" pronounced to sound like ""g-r-y"" in the question), and ""gry"" (to satisfy the statement that the word has just been used).  words without vowels --------------------     When I was 6 years old, my schoolmistress said, ""There are no words in the English language that have no vowels.  To anyone who can tell me a word with no vowels, I'll give threepence.""     I raised my hand and said, ""Shhh.""     The mistress looked at me very contemptuously and said, ""He thinks 'shhh' is a word.  But it isn't; it's just a sound that people make.""     A couple of weeks later, the mistress asked the class, ""Has anyone thought of a word without any vowels yet?""     Another little boy raised his hand and said, ""My.  Try. Sky.""     ""No,"" replied the mistress, ""'y' is a vowel there.  But I'll give you threepence anyway, because you've been thinking.""     After all these years, I *still* think my example was better than that other little boy's.     I WANT MY THREEPENCE!     The word ""vowel"" has more than one meaning.  From MWCD10:  # 1: one of a class of speech sounds in the articulation of which # the oral part of the breath channel is not blocked and is not # constricted enough to cause audible friction; broadly : the one # most prominent sound in a syllable  2: a letter or other symbol # representing a vowel -- usu. used in English of a, e, i, o, u, and # sometimes y  Children are usually taught sense 2, because meaning 1 would be harder for them to grasp.  But since sense 2 is not that *useful* except as a rough approximation to sense 1 (and on the U.S. TV show _Wheel of Fortune_), ""words without vowels"" in sense 2 (such as ""cwm"", ""nth"", ""Mrs."", and ""TV"") are not terribly interesting.  Words without vowels in sense 1 (such as ""shhh"", ""psst"", and ""mm-hmm"") *are* interesting, because they tell us something about the phonology of the language.

Look 'em up. :-)   (A good book to look them up in is _The Random House Dictionary for Writers and Readers_, by David Grambs, Random House, 1990, ISBN 0-679-72860-0.  There are also two lists on the WWW: < http://www.uky.edu/ArtsSciences/Classics/rhetoric.html > and < http://www.csi.uottawa.ca/~kbarker/ling-devices.html >.)  ""I won't mention..."" --------------------     Mentioning something by saying you aren't going to mention it (e.g., ""I won't mention his laziness"") is called ""apophasis"" or ""preterition"".  Joseph Shipley's _Dictionary of World Literary Terms_ (The Writer, 3rd ed., 1970) says: ""~apophasis~  Seeming to deny what is really affirmed.  Feigning to pass by it while really stressing it"" (e.g., ""not to mention his laziness""):  ""paralepsis. Touching on it casually:  metastasis.  Pretending to shield or conceal while really displaying (as Antony with Caesar's will in Shakespeare's play):  parasiopesis. [...]  ~autoclesis~ (P. the self-inviter).  Introduction of an idea by refusing before being requested, intending thus to awaken (and respond to) a demand, as Antony with the will in _Julius Caesar_.""  ""Paralepsis"" is more often spelled ""paraleipsis"" (which is the Greek form) or ""paralipsis"".  A few sources (such as The Century Dictionary, and the Universal English Dictionary by Henry Cecil Wyld) do not support a distinction between apophasis and paraleipsis.  names of ""&"", ""@"", and ""#"" --------------------------     (The lists of names given in this entry are DELIBERATELY incomplete.  For a comprehensive list of formal and informal terms for these and many other keyboard symbols, see the entry ASCII in the Jargon File.)     ""&"" is called ""ampersand"".     The longest name for ""@"" is ""commercial at sign""; the first and last words may each be omitted.  The official ANSI/CCITT name is ""commercial at"".     There are actually two typeset symbols, with distinct histories, for which we use ""#"" in ASCII text.    One (with horizontal strokes slanted and thicker than the vertical strokes) is the musical ""sharp (sign)"", as in ""the key of C# major"".    The other (with vertical strokes slanted) is called ""number (sign)"", as in ""the team finished in the #5 position"", or ""pound (sign)"", referring to weight, as in ""a 5# bag of potatoes"". Although use of this sign to denote weight has declined, ""pound"" is the most widely used name for it in the U.S.  But it confuses people who expect that term to mean the symbol for sterling currency (located on many British keyboards in the same place as ""#"" is found on U.S. keyboards).  ""Number sign"", adopted by ANSI/CCITT, is unambiguous, but little known in both the U.K. and the U.S.    Computer-users in the U.K. usually call the symbol a ""hash"", from its appearance (reminiscent of marks one might make when chopping).    Finally, in a failed attempt to avoid the naming problem by creating a new name, the term ""octothorp(e)"" (which MWCD10 dates 1971) was invented for ""#"", allegedly by Bell Labs engineers when touch-tone telephones were introduced in the mid-1960s.  ""Octo-"" means eight, and ""thorp"" was an Old English word for _village_: apparently the sign was playfully construed as eight fields surrounding a village.  Another story has it that a Bell Labs supervisor named Don MacPherson coined the word from the number of endpoints and from the surname of U.S. athlete James Francis Thorpe. Merriam-Webster Editorial Department told me:  ""All of the stories you record are known to us, but the evidence does not line up nicely behind any one of them.""  ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."" ----------------------------------------------     Sentences containing every letter of the alphabet are called ""pangrams"", or ""holalphabetic sentences"".  They are covered in part 2 of the language section of the rec.puzzles archive.  ""Take the prisoner downstairs"", said Tom condescendingly. ---------------------------------------------------------     A sentence where a description of the manner of saying refers punningly to quoted matter is called a ""Tom Swifty"".  (Some people restrict ""Tom Swifty"" to sentences where the pun is in an adverb, and use ""croaker"" for sentences where the pun is in the verb:  ""'I'm dying', he croaked."")  The name ""Tom Swifty"" derives from the Tom Swift adventure series for boys (whose enthusiastic use of adverbs modifying ""said"" they parody); but the form goes back to the 19th century, and was used by James Joyce in _Ulysses_ (1922).     I maintain the Canonical Collection of Tom Swifties, with over 900 entries.  It's available on the WWW as: < http://www.scripps.edu/pub/dem-web/misrael/TomSwifties.html > or by e-mail from me.     A sentence where words following a quotation humorously reinterpret what is quoted (""'Eureka!' said Archimedes to the skunk"") is called a ""wellerism"", after the character Sam Weller in Dickens' novel _The Pickwick Papers_.  The form predates Dickens.  What is the opposite of ""to exceed""? ------------------------------------     ""To fall short of"".  ""To trail"" can also come in handy when both things are moving.  What is the opposite of ""distaff side""? ---------------------------------------     ""Spear side"", but I prefer Truly Donovan's suggestion, ""datstaff side"". :-)  What do you call the grass strip between the road and the sidewalk? -------------------------------------------------------------------     This varies regionally.  Terms include ""verge"" (U.K.); ""nature strip"" (south Australia); ""berm"" (New Zealand); ""parkway"" and ""planting strip"" (western U.S.); ""parking strip"", ""parking"", ""tree belt"", ""tree lawn"", ""lawn strip"", ""devil strip"", ""boulevard"", and ""terrace"" (all eastern U.S.); ""city strip"" and ""boulevard strip"" (both Canada); and ""long acre"" (rural Ireland and elsewhere).  Most of these terms have other meanings also.  ====================================================================    MISCELLANY   ----------  What is a suggested format for citing online sources? -----------------------------------------------------     Michael Quinion has an essay on this.  It is available at his WWW site < http://clever.net/quinion/words/citation.htm > or by e-mail from him ( michael@quinion.demon.co.uk ).  Does the next millennium begin in 2000 or 2001? -----------------------------------------------     Many of us will be happy if people can even spell ""millennium""! As Mark Brader has noted in the relevant entry in the news.announce.newusers FAQ ""Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet"", the A.D. calendar system was devised before ""origin 0 counting"" was invented.  The first year assumed (incorrectly, as most scholars now believe) to have begun after Jesus' birth was A.D. 1, not A.D. 0; the previous year was 1 B.C. This gives us the millennia 1-1000, 1001-2000, and 2001-3000.  On the other hand, the convenience of grouping together years, decades, and centuries having like digits is obvious.  The standard joke is that those who say the next millennium will begin in 2001 and not 2000 are right, but they'll be missing one hell of a party!  What will we call the next decade? ----------------------------------     ""2000"" and ""2001"" will probably be called ""two thousand"" and ""two thousand and one"", under the influence of the movie _2001: A Space Odyssey_; but after that, people will probably gradually switch to calling the years ""twenty oh three"", etc.  As for what we'll call the decade 2000-2009 (comparable to ""the eighties"", ""the nineties"", etc.), who knows?  Several people have suggested ""the aughts"", but this may be too archaic to bear revival.  No, don't bother snowing me with other proposals; let's just wait and see.  Fumblerules (""Don't use no double negatives"", etc.) ---------------------------------------------------     _Fumblerules_ was the title of a 1990 book by William Safire containing such rules, but it seems these rules should actually be credited to George L. Trigg.  For the rules and their provenance, see < http://www.amherst.edu/~writing/tips.html >.  English is Tough Stuff ----------------------     This poem is properly titled ""The Chaos"", and appeared in _Drop Your Foreign Accent - Engelse Uitspraakoefeningen_, by G. Nolst Trenite (5th rev. ed., H. D. Tjeenk Willink & Zoon, 1929).  It can be found at: < http://www.tue.nl/lava/people/henri/tough.html > What is the phone number of the Grammar Hotline? ------------------------------------------------     There are many such.     Of the two most prominent, one (""The National Grammar Hotline"") is run by Michael Strumpf, Professor of English at Moorpark Community College, Moorpark, California, and author of _Painless, Perfect Grammar:  Tips from the Grammar Hotline_ (Monarch, 1985, ISBN 0-671-52782-7).  The phone number is (805) 378-1494; the hours are irregular, but he will return calls.     The other (""The Write Line"") is run by Richard Francis Tracz, Chairman of the English Department at Oakton Community College in Des Plaines, Illinois, and author of _Dr. Grammar's Writes from Wrongs:  A supremely authoritative guide to the common and not-so- common rules of the English language_ (Vintage, 1991, ISBN 0-679-72715-9).  The phone number is (708) 635-1948, and the hours are 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Central Time while classes are in session.  His e-mail address is "" richard@oakton.acs.edu "".     In general, Prof. Strumpf gives more conservative advice than Prof. Tracz.

For one thing, every > dictionary I've ever examined has been all too full of > *un*intentional errors, and they could serve the same purpose.     On the other hand, books such as _Who's Who_ do have fictitious entries.  How reliable are dictionaries? ------------------------------     A former senior lexicographer at a major dictionary publisher has told me by e-mail:  ""An editor seldom sits down and composes new text for any lemma out of whole cloth.  Even for a supposedly thoroughgoing revision, what usually happens is that you take the text from your previous edition, apply whatever mechanical formatting changes have been decreed, and then check two or three of your competitors' books to see if they've said anything different from what you have.  (Right -- it's no accident that all the major dictionaries look so much alike!)  This practice can lead to some pretty awful results; the nautical terminology in [a dictionary that I worked on] was based on 19th-century square-rigger stuff originally copied out of OED -- and evidently *they* didn't have any sailors on the staff either!     ""In any case, the citation files don't normally even get looked at unless something in the entry raises a red flag -- it's a new word, or a member of some class of words marked for special scrutiny (e.g., gender-specific terms or personal pronouns), or has been tagged for special attention as the result of someone's query somewhere along the line.""     For more on the frightening extent to which dictionaries copy from one another, see ""The Genealogy of Dictionaries"", in Robert Burchfield's _Unlocking the English Language_ (Hill and Wang, 1992, ISBN 0-374-52339-8), pp. 147-165.     Thus we see that a consensus of dictionaries does not necessarily indicate a consensus of actual research.  Nor does disagreement among dictionaries necessarily indicate actual scholarly controversy:  it may simply be that the lexicographers were too overworked and deadline-pressed to copy from one another more thoroughly.  Samuel Johnson's observation, ""Dictionaries are like watches; the worst is better than none, and the best cannot be expected to go quite true"", remains highly pertinent today, despite the improvements in both products since Johnson's day.  etymologies of personal names -----------------------------     See < http://www.engr.uvic.ca/~mcampbel/etym >.  How did ""Truly"" become a personal name? --------------------------------------- by Truly Donovan ( truly@lunemere.com )     My name is my mother's nickname.  Her name was Etrulia, which she acquired from an aunt-by-marriage, Etrulia (a.k.a. Truly) Shattuck. Beyond that, the origins of the name are lost.  Truly Shattuck, however, was a woman of some notoriety, having first come to public attention, according to family legend, when her mother, Jane, was tried and acquitted for having murdered her young daughter's seducer. This would have been in Northern California, perhaps the Bay Area, around the turn of the century, I would guess.  At some point thereafter Truly went on the stage, and was supposedly a Floradora girl.  Somehow (family legend is very murky about this), she got herself married to a staid Scottish lawyer from Michigan (during which time my mother was born and named for her), but that was not a very enduring union.  During my mother's childhood, she was known to be running a chicken farm in California.  Her last brush with notoriety, which we learned about from her obituary published in the Chicago Tribune, was when she was arrested for shoplifting a very expensive dress at Marshall Field.  Her defense was that she needed to look for a job and hadn't anything to wear.     Anyway, it sure beats being named for a fatuous character in a bad Ian Fleming children's book.  trademarks ----------     (None of the information here has been verified from legal sources.

back to Old English (alias Anglo-Saxon).  It's the same reason many of us say that someone is ""5 foot 2"" rather than ""5 feet 2"".     The source of the idiom is the old genitive plural, which did not end in -s, and did not contain a high front vowel to trigger umlaut (""foot"" vs ""feet"").  When the ending was lost because of regular phonetic developments, the pattern remained the same, and it now seemed that the singular rather than the plural was in use.  sentences grammatical in both Old English and Modern English ------------------------------------------------------------     Mitchell and Robinson's _A Guide to Old English_ (OUP, 5th edition, 1992, ISBN 0-631-16657-2) starts its ""Practice Sentences"" section with a few of these.  A sampling:    Harold is swift.  His hand is strong and his word grim.  Late in   life he went to his wife in Rome.    Grind his corn for him and sing me his song.

Opinions differ as to its initial meaning:  one possibility is that it meant 10^12 to mathematicians and 10^9 to others.  The first use in England recorded in the OED is by Locke in 1690:  the quotation clearly shows that for Locke it meant 10^12.  This remained the standard British meaning until the middle of the 20th century.  Early in the 18th century, French arithmeticians revised its meaning to 10^9, and the U.S., acquiring the word directly from the French, took this meaning also.     French has the word ""milliard"", also meaning 10^9, which had largely displaced ""billion"" by the beginning of the 20th century. (""Milliard"" is given in English dictionaries, though most of the few people who know it would think of it as a French word.)  By 1948, the use of large numbers in the sciences and the declining value of the franc led the French Weights and Measures conference to recommend the return of ""billion"" to its original meaning of 10^12. This became official policy in 1961.  For more information on international usage, see < http://clever.net/quinion/words/numbers.htm >.     By this time, the British had been introduced to the U.S. meaning.  MEU warns us that the usages differ; MEU2 (1965) suggests: ""Since _billion_ in our sense is useless except to astronomers, it is a pity that we do not conform [to the U.S. meaning]"".  The British Government took this advice in 1974, when Prime Minister Harold Wilson announced to the House of Commons that the meaning of ""billion"" in papers concerning Government statistics would thenceforth be 10^9, in conformity with U.S. usage.     Despite this, the U.S. meaning is still rare outside journalism and finance, its introduction having served merely to create confusion.  Throughout the U.K., a common response to the question ""What do you understand by 'a billion'?"" would be: ""Well, I mean a million million, but I often don't know what other people mean."" Few schoolchildren are confident of the meaning, though, again, 10^12 seems to be preferred.  Many well-educated adults, aware of both meanings, either avoid the term altogether or use it only in the unambiguous phrases ""English billion"" and ""American billion"". English-speaking South Africans, Australians, and New Zealanders are similarly reluctant to use a term that has become ambiguous.     Scientists have long preferred to express numbers in figures rather than in words, so it is easy to avoid ""billion"" in contexts where precision is required.  The plural is still used freely with the colloquial meaning of ""a very large number"".  Publications consulted:  OED, Editions 1 and 2. Robert, Dictionnaire historique de la langue francaise.

Biblical sense of ""to know"" ---------------------------     Some people say things like:  ""It is not correct that it is the biblical meaning.  The biblical meaning of a man's knowing a woman is such total love as to know all about her, which includes intercourse. It is not an evasive term for one-night stands.""    Not so.  The Biblical sense of ""to know"" is simply ""to fuck"", as you can see from Genesis 19:4-8 :  ""[...] the men of Sodom compassed the house round [...] and they called unto Lot, and said unto him, 'Where are the men which came in to thee this night? Bring them out unto us, that we may KNOW them.'  And Lot [...] said [...] 'Behold now, I have two daughters which have not KNOWN man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you [...]'""     The Hebrew word here is _yada_ (yod daleth ayin).  The Greek word _gino:sko:_ is used similarly in the New Testament.  Postfix ""not"" -------------     Is assertion followed by ""not"" a recent American neologism? NOT!  ""I love thee not"" was the regular word order in Shakespeare's day.  Examples including the pause are harder to find; the earliest that we've found is in Irish dialect, in Ellis Parker Butler's _Pigs is Pigs_ (1905):     ""Proceed to collect,"" he said softly.  ""How them    cloiks do loike to be talkin'!  _Me_ proceed to    collect two dollars and twinty-foive cints off    Misther Morehouse!  I wonder do thim clerks    _know_ Misther Morehouse?  I'll git it!  Oh, yes!    'Misther Morehouse, two an' a quarter, plaze.'    'Cert'nly, me dear frind Flannery.  Delighted!' _Not!_""  Clay Blankenship found a citation from ""circa 1906"" in the comic strip _Buster Brown_ on page 32 of _The Comics: An Illustrated History of Comic Strip Art_ by by Jerry Robinson (Putnam, 1974). A girl in the strip says, ""Swell time I had -- NOT!""  Jesse Sheidlower writes:  ""Jonathan Lighter and I wrote an article about this in _American Speech_ in 1993, which included the 1905 E. P. Butler quote as well as an earlier (1900) quote from George Ade that's somewhat equivocal; we also cited a number of later but still early uses including F. Scott Fitzgerald, Edmund Wilson, and others.  Since then we've found an even earlier one (1893 _Princeton Tiger_ (Mar. 30) 103: An Historical Parallel-- Not.) as well as more early examples (though the Buster Brown example is new to us).""  e. e. cummings wrote a poem beginning:     pity this busy monster manunkind    not.     Credit to David Murray for bringing the cummings example to our attention.  And Wanda Keown found the following in Fritz Leiber's _Conjure Wife_ (1943):  ""Norman thought:  Country parsonage? Healthy mental atmosphere, not!""     The construction owes its present popularity to the ""Wayne's World"" skits in the U.S. TV show _Saturday Night Live_.  The first use in SNL was in the 1970s in a skit with Jane Curtin and Steve Martin.  (It is said that the writers of these skits encountered the practice when it was a fad in their high school in the Toronto suburb of Scarborough.)  Another phrase that comes from SNL is ""Isn't that special?"" (the Church Lady, played by Dana Carvey).  Origin of the dollar sign (notes by Mark Brader) -------------------------     It is sometimes said that the dollar sign's origin is a narrow ""U"" superimposed over a wide ""S"", ""U.S."" being short for ""United States.""  This is wrong, and the correct explanation also tells why the $ sign is used both for dollars and for pesos in various countries.  The explanation is not widely known, maybe because not many people would think to look for it in a book called _A History of Mathematical Notations, Volume II: Notations Mainly in Higher Mathematics_ by Florian Cajori (published in 1929 and reprinted in 1952, by Open Court Press).  Cajori acknowledges the ""U.S."" theory and a number of others, but, after examining many 18th-century manuscripts, finds that there is simply no evidence to support those theories.     Spanish pesos were also called piastres, Spanish dollars, and pieces of eight.  (The piece of eight was so called because its value was eight reales.  Some countries made one-real coins by slicing pieces of eight into eight sectors; the still-current U.S. slang ""two bits"" for a quarter of a dollar may refer to this, although ""bit"" denoting any small coin -- as in ""threepenny bit"" -- was already in use.)  The coins were circulated in many parts of the world, much as U.S. dollars are today.  The coins were so well known that, when the U.S. got around to issuing its own silver coinage (U.S. dollar coins first appeared in 1794), it simply replicated the Spanish unit's weight and hence value, and even one of its names; so it was natural to use the same symbol.     Since three of the four names given above for the Spanish dollar start with p (and pluralize with s), it was natural for abbreviations like p and ps to be used.  Sometimes ps was written     s as P  -- P with a superscript s.  The superscript was a common way of rendering abbreviated endings of words -- we see vestiges of it today in the way some people write ""10th"".  Now, what happens if you write P with a superscript s *fast*, because it's part of a long document that you have to hand-write because you can't wait for the typewriter to be invented, let alone the word-processor?  Naturally, you join the letters.  Well, now look at the top part of the resulting symbol.  There's the $ sign!  Reduce the P to a single stroke and you have the form of the $ with a double vertical; omit it altogether and you get the single vertical.     And yes, both these forms are original.  Cajori reproduces 14 $ signs from a diary written in 1776; 11 of them have the single stroke, which was the more common form to the end of the century, and 3 have the double stroke.     Although the $ sign originally referred to a Spanish coin, it was the revolting British -> American colonists who made the transition from ps to the new sign.  (This is apparently also why we write $1 instead of 1$; it mimics the British use of the pound sign.)  So, while it did not originally refer to the U.S. dollar, the symbol does legitimately claim its origins in that country.  ====================================================================    SPELLING   --------  Spelling reform ---------------     The Simplified Spelling Society has a WWW page at: < http://www.les.aston.ac.uk/sss > Only a small minority of alt.usage.english participants favour spelling reform.  Joke about step-by-step spelling reform ---------------------------------------     The original version of this joke was apparently by Mark Twain, and can be found at < http://comedy.clari.net/rhf/jokes/87/2094.10.html >.  A more elaborate version, by Dolton Edwards (probably a pseudonym), which gives no credit to Twain, was published in the science fiction magazine _Astounding_ in 1946 and can be found at < http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~d92-abj/humor/spelling_reform.html >. Various other versions are in circulation.  What is ""ghoti""?  (notes by Jim Scobbie) ----------------     It's an alternative spelling of ""chestnut"". :-)  O.K., it's ""fish"", re-spelled by a Victorian spelling-reform advocate to demonstrate the inconsistency of English spelling:  ""gh"" as in ""cough"", ""o"" as in ""women"", ""ti"" as in ""nation"".     ""Ghoti"" is popularly attributed to George Bernard Shaw.  But Michael Holroyd, in _Bernard Shaw: Volume III: 1918-1950: The Lure of Fantasy_ (Chatto & Windus, 1991), p. 501, writes that Shaw ""knew that people, 'being incorrigibly lazy, just laugh at spelling reformers as silly cranks'.  So he attempted to reverse this prejudice and exhibit a phonetic alphabet as native good sense [...].  But when an enthusiastic convert suggested that 'ghoti' would be a reasonable way to spell 'fish' under the old system [...], the subject seemed about to be engulfed in the ridicule from which Shaw was determined to save it.""  We have not been able to trace the name of the ""enthusiastic convert"".  Bill Bedford ( billb@mousa.demon.co.uk ) writes:  ""I seem to remember a film/TV clip of Shaw himself referring to this - but don't ask for chapter and verse.""     It has also been suggested that ""ghoti"" could be a spelling of ""huge"":  ""h"" having its usual value, [h]; ""g"" making [j], the sound of ""y"" in yes, after the *following* consonant as in ""lasagne""; ""o"" = [u] as in ""move"", ""t"" = [d] as in ""Taoism"", and ""i"" = [Z] as in one pronunciation of ""soldier"".     In the same vein is ""ghoughpteighbteau"":  P    hiccough O    though T    ptomaine A    neigh T    debt O    bureau     Supposedly, this is an example of how awful English spelling is, and why it ought to be reformed.  In fact, it argues that English spelling is kind and considerate, and easy.  Why?  Because ""potato"" *isn't* spelled ""ghoughpteighbteau"".  It's spelled ""potato""!  O.K, O.K., ""neigh"" isn't spelt ""ne"", and we can get into all the old arguments, but these really fun examples overstate the case and strike those of us opposed to spelling reform as self-defeating.  I before E except after C (notes by Mark Wainwright) -------------------------     This old schoolroom spelling rule is supposed to help remember the spelling of vowels pronounced /i:/, the long ""e"" sound of ""feed"". It has no value for words where the vowel is pronounced in any other way, the key fact which people bemused by many ""exceptions"" to the rule usually do not realise.  A version often cited in the U.K. makes the restriction clear:   When the sound is /i:/,  it's I before E  except after C.  A common U.S. version:   ...  or when pronounced /eI/  as in ""neighbour"" and ""weigh"".  is misleading, as ""ei"" has many other pronunciations, as in, for instance, ""height"", ""heifer"", and ""forfeit"".  The rule also fails to apply to names (Sheila, Keith, Leigh, etc.).  ""I before E"":  Properly applied, the rule is a very useful guide for people who are not naturally excellent spellers; those who are may look out for themselves.  To an RP speaker, the exceptions in common use are very few: they are ""seize"", ""inveigle"", ""caffeine"", ""protein"", and ""codeine"".  (The last three were originally pronounced as three-syllable words.)  Other dialects pronounce a few other -ei- words with /i:/, making extra exceptions:  ""either"" and ""neither"" (RP vowel: /aI/, as in ""pie""), ""geisha"" and ""sheik(h)"" (RP: /eI/, as in ""say""), and ""leisure"" (RP: /E/, as in ""get"").  (Of course, derivatives of the above words, such as ""seizure"", ""decaffeinate"", and ""sheik(h)dom"", are spelled similarly.)  There are many exceptions in Scots, so speakers with a large Scots vocabulary may as well give up on this rule.  The vowel in ""weir"" and ""weird"" is usually quite different, as comparison of ""weird"" and ""weed"" will show; for most speakers, ""weird"" has a diphthong.  ""except after C"":  Fowler, who called the rule ""very useful"", noted: ""The c exception covers the many derivatives of Latin _capio_ [= ""take""], which are in such common use (_receive_, _deceit_, _inconceivable_; cf. _relieve_, _belief_, _irretrievable_) that a simple rule of thumb is necessary.""  For most Britons, /i:/ after C is always ""ei"" rather than ""ie"", except in ""specie"" and ""species"". Americans generally pronounce -cies and -cied in words derived from -cy endings (e.g., ""fancies"" and ""fancied"" from ""fancy"") with /i:/ rather than /I/, making these words exceptions.  Still, few people have any difficulty pluralizing -y, so such speakers should still be able to extract some value from the rule, by the application of a little common sense.  How do you spell ""e-mail""? --------------------------     In September 1995, Jeff Adams ( jeffa@kurz-ai.com ) did a search on ""a corpus of about 40 million words of Usenet news articles"", and counted the following forms:   email      19371  e-mail     15359  E-mail      7572  Email       5906  E-MAIL      3659  E-Mail      2986  EMAIL       1269  EMail        521  eMail        303  e-Mail        42  eMAIL          5  and several other forms each rare enough to be probably ""just dumb typos"".   Total without hyphen:   27378  Total with    hyphen:   29622     Bob Cunningham searched articles posted to alt.usage.english between mid-May and mid-September 1995, found 604 instances of ""e-mail"" and 235 of ""email"".     A 1995 poll of subscribers to the Copyediting-L mailing list produced 60 votes for ""e-mail"" and 24 votes for ""email"".     In favour of ""e-mail"", it has been argued that there are analogous nonce compounds in ""e-"" (e.g, ""e-vote"", ""e-boyfriend""); that the hyphen is a clue that the word is stressed on the first syllable; and that _email_ is French for ""enamel"".  In favour of ""email"", it has been argued that this is the spelling used in the Jargon File, and that there has been a general trend away from hyphenating words once they become established.  Many dictionaries favour ""E-mail"", which can be justified by analogy with such forms as ""A-bomb"", ""C-section"", and ""G-string"".  Why is ""I"" capitalized? -----------------------     The Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology (Wilson, 1988, ISBN 0-8242-0745-9) says: ""~I~ _pron._ 1137 _i;_ later _I_ (about 1250, in _The Story of Genesis and Exodus_); developed from the unstressed form of Old English (about 725) _ic_ singular pronoun of the first person (nominative case).  Modern and Middle English _I_ developed from earlier _i_ in the stressed position.  _I_ came to be written with a capital letter thereby making it a distinct word and avoiding misreading handwritten manuscripts.  In the northern and midland dialects of England the capitalized form _I_ appeared about 1250. In the south of England, where Old English _ic_  early shifted in pronunciation to _ich_ (by palatalization), the form _I_ did not become established until the 1700's (although it appears sporadically before that time).""  Diacritics ----------     You can use diaereses in words like ""naive"" and ""cooperate"" if you want.  The use of diacritics has been declining because of Linotypes and computers that didn't allow them.  ""-er"" vs ""-re"" --------------     The following words are spelled with ""-re"" in the U.K. but with ""-er"" in the U.S.:  accoutre(ment), calibre, centre, fibre, goitre, litre, louvre, lustre (brilliance, but ""luster"" one who lusts) , manoeuvre (""maneuver"" in the U.S.), metre (for the distance and for poetic and musical metre, but ""meter"" for the measuring device), meagre, mitre, nitre, ochre, philtre, reconnoitre, sabre, sceptre, sepulchre, sombre, spectre, (amphi)theatre, titre.  (The British ""metre""/""meter"" distinction is retained when the various prefixes are prepended:  ""kilometre"", ""speedometer"", etc.  ""Micrometer"", a device for measuring minute things, is distinguished from ""micrometre"", a micron.  ""Theatre"" has some currency in the U.S., especially in names of specific theatres.)     The following words are spelled ""-re"" in both the U.K. and the U.S.:  acre, cadre, euchre, lucre, massacre, mediocre, ogre, wiseacre.  (The ""-cre"" and ""-gre"" words may have been kept that way in order to keep the ""c"" and ""g"" hard, although there are counterexamples such as ""eager"" and ""meager"".)     In none of these words is ""-er"" the agent suffix (as in ""revolver"") or the comparative suffix (as in ""longer"").  Most of these words come from Latin through French, and they took the ""-re"" form in French because the ""e"" was not part of the word root.  (The adjectives tend to be in ""-ral"", ""-ric"", and ""-rical"", rather than ""-eral"", ""-eric"", or ""-erical"".)  But many similar words (cloister, diameter, neuter, number, sinister) were changed from ""-re"" to ""-er"" in English.  The process has merely happened faster in the U.S. than in Britain.  ""-ize"" vs ""-ise"" ---------------     The following verbs are always spelled with ""-ise"":  advertise, advise, arise, chastise, circumcise, comprise, compromise, demise, despise, devise, disguise, enterprise, excise, exercise, (dis/en)franchise, improvise, incise, merchandise, premise, reprise, revise, rise, supervise, surmise, surprise, televise.  (At least, they're *almost* always spelled that way:  ""advertize"", ""merchandize"", and ""surprize"" ARE listed in some U.S. college dictionaries, but are not the usual forms anywhere.)   A useful mnemonic is that, except ""improvise"", none of these make nouns in ""-isation"", ""-ization"", or ""-ism"".  (Exceptions in the other direction are ""aggrandize"", ""capsize"", ""recognize"", and verbs from which no verb ""-ization"" has been formed because the parent or cognate noun already had the desired meaning.)     ""Apprise"" means ""to inform""; ""apprize"" means ""to appreciate"". U.K. ""prise open"" = U.S. ""pry open"".     ""Exorcize"" is most commonly spelled ""exorcise"" in the U.S., though ""exorcize"" (which Fowler would have recommended) also occurs.     For other verbs, ""-ize"" is usual in the U.S. and recommended by Fowler, although ""-ise"" is also used in the U.K.  Fowler recommends ""-yse"" in ""analyse"", ""catalyse"", and ""paralyse"", although ""-yze"" is usual in the U.S.  doubling of final consonants before suffixes --------------------------------------------    The general rule is that when one of the suffixes ""-ed"", ""-ing"", ""-er"", and ""-est"" is applied to a word ending in one consonant preceded by exactly one vowel, the consonant is doubled if and only if the word's final syllable is stressed:  ""omitted"" but ""edited""; ""preferred"" but ""offered"".  Americans obey the stress rule when the final consonant is ""l"":  ""repelled"" but ""traveled"".  Britons double ""l"" regardless of stress:  ""repelled"", ""travelled"".  Detailed discussion of doubling can be found in MEU under ""-B-, -BB-"", ""-C-, -CK-"", ""-D-, -DD-"", etc.  Where to put apostrophes in possessive forms --------------------------------------------         by Peter Moylan  PRONOUNS  The ONLY personal possessive pronoun with an apostrophe is ""one's"".  .----------------------------------------------------------------------. | The words ""his"", ""its"", ""whose"", ""their"" do NOT contain apostrophes. | |        Nor do words like ""hers"", ""ours"", ""yours"", ""theirs"".          | |                   (Would you say ""mi'ne""?) | '----------------------------------------------------------------------'  The forms ""it's"", ""they're"", and ""who's"" are contractions for ""it is"" (or ""it has""), ""they are"", and ""who is"" (or ""who has"") respectively.  They have nothing to do with possessive pronouns.  The apostrophe does occur in the possessive case of indefinite pronouns (""anybody's"", ""someone's"", and so on).  NOUNS  1. The standard rule:  Use 's for the singular possessive, and a    bare apostrophe after the plural suffix -s or -es for the plural    possessive.  For example:         Singular         Plural       Nominative              dog             dogs       Possessive              dog's           dogs'  2. Nouns ending with an [s] or [z] sound (this includes words ending    in ""x"", ""ce"", and similar examples):  The plural suffix is -es    rather than -s (unless there's already an ""e"" at the end, as in    the ""-ce"" words), but otherwise the rule is the same as above:         Singular         Plural       Nominative             class          classes       Possessive             class's        classes'     (The possessive plural is what is wanted in ""the Joneses'"".    This is short for ""the Joneses' house"", which is not ""the    Jones's house"".)     There are, however, examples where the singular possessive suffix    is a bare apostrophe:        Singular         Plural       Nominative            patience        patiences       Possessive            patience'       patiences'     (In most such examples, the plural is rarely used.)  For nouns in    this category, many people would consider the 's suffix and the    bare apostrophe to be acceptable alternatives.  The rules listed    below may be taken as ""most common practice"", but they are    not absolute.     A. The 's suffix is preferred for one-syllable words (grass's) or    where the final syllable has a primary or secondary stress    (collapse's);     B. The bare apostrophe is preferred:       - for words ending in -nce (stance');       - for many classical names (Aristophanes', Jesus', Moses');       - where the juxtaposition of two or more [s] sounds would  cause an awkwardness in pronunciation (thesis').     C. Usage is divided in the situation where the final [s] or [z]       sound falls in an unstressed syllable (octopus'/octopus's,       phoenix's/phoenix', and so on).     The question of which suffix is correct arises less often than    one might imagine.  Instead of saying ""the crisis' start"" or ""the    crisis's start"", most native speakers of English would say ""the    start of the crisis"", thus avoiding the problem.  3. Plurals not ending in s:  Use 's for the possessive plural    (men's, people's, sheep's).  HISTORY     For those who want to know where the apostrophe came from, here is how it probably happened.  Some of this is well documented, some is guesswork on my part.     Back in the days when English had many more inflections than it now has, the most common suffix for the genitive singular was -es. (There were several noun declensions, so that not all nouns fitted this pattern; but this could be considered to be the ""most regular"" case.)  For example: mann (=man), mannes (=of the man).  Over time there developed a tendency to stop pronouncing the unstressed ""e"", so that ""mannes"" became ""mann's"".  The apostrophe stands for the omitted letter.     (Modern German still has -es as the genitive suffix for many nouns.  The Germans did not stop pronouncing their unstressed ""e""s, so the case suffix is still written as -es.)     Pronouns were also inflected, but not in the same way.  (They were all fairly irregular, as they still are today.)  The genitive form of ""hit"" (=it) was ""his"" (=its).  As ""his"" evolved into ""its"", there was no ""e"" to drop, therefore no logical reason to insert an apostrophe.     The ""its"" and ""it's"" forms did coexist in the 17th and early 18th century, but today the ""its"" form is considered to be the only correct spelling.     Plural nouns are harder to explain.  The most common genitive plural inflection was -a, which is quite unrelated to our modern -s'.  My best guess is that most of the old plural suffixes were replaced by -s under the influence of French; and that subsequently the rules for forming singular possessives were extended to the plurals.  If this is what happened, then a hypothetical -s's plural possessive suffix would immediately collapse to -s', in the same way as for many singular nouns ending in ""s"".  There was in any case a long period where spelling was a lot less standardized than it is today, so one should not think in terms of any sort of ""standard rule"" existing during the transitional period.  NOTE FOR NON-ENGLISH-SPEAKERS     The apostrophe in these cases normally has no effect on pronunciation.  Thus dogs, dog's, and dogs' all sound the same.  The exception is where the apostrophe separates two ""s""s, and then it is pronounced as an unstressed schwa.  Thus class's, classes, and classes' are all pronounced as /klA:s@z/.     For nouns where there is some difference of opinion over whether the possessive suffix should be -'s or a bare apostrophe (that is, those nouns where a final unstressed syllable ends with an [s] or [z] sound) some native speakers use a lengthened final consonant intermediate between /z/ and /z@z/.  This is, however, a fine and almost inaudible distinction.  OTHER COMMENTS     One occasionally hears that ""John's dog"" is an abbreviation for ""John his dog"".  It is more likely that the derivation went in the opposite direction, i.e.:    Johnes hund => John's hound => Johnny's dog => John 'is dog with the ""John his dog"" form coming into use only briefly before disappearing from modern English.     Using an apostrophe in a plural which is not a possessive form is almost never recommended by prescriptivists.  The only situation where it is recommended is where visual confusion would otherwise result, as for example in the sentence ""Mind your p's and q's"".  In forms like ""the 1980s"" or ""two CPUs"", apostrophes are not recommended.     It is correct to use an apostrophe to indicate missing letters, in contractions like ""aren't"", ""isn't"", ""it's"" (= it is or it has). Be careful in these cases to put the apostrophe in the correct place.  The apostrophe replaces the missing letter(s); it does not replace the space between words.  -- misrael@scripps.edu Mark Israel"

Use this natural trick to prevent stomach flu, even if you’ve been exposed! We’ve been doing this for six years and it has kept us healthy, even when we know we’ve been exposed to the stomach virus. It’s so easy, you’d be a fool not to try it! The stomach flu (not truly the “flu”) by nickname, stomach bug, norovirus, puking flu as my kids like to call it…whatever you call it, it’s NOT FUN. Use this simple, effective trick to prevent the stomach flu! If you need home remedies stomach flu has already hit your house perhaps? This works for anyone who is exposed to the stomach virus, but is not yet showing symptoms. We do this daily in our house. Don’t wait any longer order what you need now! Before you waste any more time run over and order everything you need to prevent the stomach virus daily. This is the best home remedies stomach flu post you’ll find and here are the products you need at the best prices. Plus you’ll save yourself a trip to the store where you will likely pick up more germs! These are the best prices on the products you need plus they’ll ship right to your door. Don’t wait any longer on ordering these. Use them year-round or during peak stomach virus season, it’s up to you! There is a little-known home remedy to prevent the stomach bug altogether. The trick here is PREVENTION! If you are already feeling symptoms of the stomach flu then this will NOT work. You need to do this BEFORE you get sick. However, if you have been EXPOSED to the stomach bug but aren’t showing symptoms yet then this is the trick you need to prevent yourself from getting sick. The best part? It’s natural and doesn’t involve anything containing chemicals. I am all for natural remedies! Okay, this is going to sound a little “out there” but I’ve tried it and believe me this works! On Monday my hubby came down with the stomach flu. He was puking and felt awful. I think heÂ had norovirus which is a highly contagious stomach flu.Â Norovirus has been going around and sure enough, a guy he works with had it right before him.Â Well, of course, he had eaten off my plate that day and I was so worried that the kids and I would all get it too. A friend of mine told me to start drinking grape juice to prevent me from getting sick. The kids and IÂ all started drinking grape juice and here we are 3 days later healthy and well! You may have landed on my page after searching “prevent stomach flu grape juice”. Well, I did some research as there wasn’t much info out there on this. It turns out there is some science behind this grape juice thing and I did a little research. In order to prevent yourself from getting the stomach flu after you know you have been exposed (taking care of a sick person, being around someone that was sick, etc) you need to start drinking 100% Grape Juice, no sugar added, right away BEFORE any symptoms appear. If you are having symptoms then it is too late for thisÂ home remedies stomach fluÂ trick and DO NOT drink the grape juice or you will be puking purple and it won’t be pretty! Drink the grape juice three times a day for a few days after being exposed. I have been drinking a juiceÂ glass full three times a day and filling the kids sippy cups full three times a day. Yes, this is a lot of sugar but I’d rather consume/give my kids sugar than have them get the stomach flu. The grape juice works by changing the pH in your intestinal tract soÂ that the virus can’t multiply. It also harbors various strong anti-viral chemicals in it. Along with the Vitamin C and anti-oxidants in the juice, it’s supposed to flush and kill the virus and/or severely lesson the symptoms. When you get a stomach virus, it actually isn’t in your stomach, it’s all in your large and small intestines. The effects of what it’s doing to those makes you sick to your stomach (changing the acidity in your stomach). Keeping the pH of the intestines slightly more alkaline is supposed to stop the virus from taking hold and thus making you sick.

Does anyone have any idea how embarrassing that is?”“They’re refusing us entry to this country based on circumstances we have nothing to do with. It’s inhumane,” Donald Jr. piped up. “We have rights you know.”More:  How Donald Trump’s Sons Spent 24 Hours In VancouverThe decision to detain the pair has caused such controversy that even the President of the United States has personally tweeted about the incident. “Detaining people at an airport is disgusting. How the hell can the people of Vancouver look at themselves in the mirror after this,” he said, claiming the entire incident was all he needed to “finally justify invading Canada”.RCMP added that the cost of detaining the Trump bros. will be happily paid for by BC taxpayers.What do you think of the Trumps in Vancouver? Join the debate on Facebook  and Twitter , or support us by donating as little as $1 to our Patreon page !

https://www.snopes.com/red-cross-bans-prayer-at-shelters-even-in-churches/	Red Cross Bans Prayer at Shelters, Even in Churches?	false	['prayer', ' red cross', ' red cross prayer ban', ' todd starnes']	https://en.wikipedia.org/	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Louisiana_floods	2016/08/30	"The 21 Louisiana parishes that were designated as federal disaster areas by FEMA in the aftermath of the floods. In August 2016, prolonged rainfall in southern parts of the U.S. state of Louisiana resulted in catastrophic flooding that submerged thousands of houses and businesses. Louisiana's governor, John Bel Edwards, called the disaster a ""historic, unprecedented flooding event"" and declared a state of emergency. Many rivers and waterways, particularly the Amite and Comite rivers, reached record levels, and rainfall exceeded 20 inches (510 mm) in multiple parishes. Because of the large number of homeowners without flood insurance that were affected, the federal government is providing disaster aid through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The flood has been called the worst US natural disaster since Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Thirteen deaths have been reported as a result of the flooding. A map of radar-estimated rainfall accumulations across Louisiana between August 9 and 16, 2016; areas shaded in white indicate accumulations in excess of 20 in (510 mm). Early on August 11, a mesoscale convective system flared up in southern Louisiana around a weak area of low pressure that was situated next to an outflow boundary. It remained nearly stationary, and as a result, torrential downpours occurred in the areas surrounding Baton Rouge and Lafayette. Rainfall rates of up to 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) an hour were reported in the most deluged areas. Totals exceeded nearly 2 feet (61 cm) in some areas as a result of the system remaining stationary. Accumulations peaked at 31.39 inches (797 mm) in Watson, just northeast of Baton Rouge. The Washington Post noted that the ""no-name storm"" dumped three times as much rain on Louisiana as Hurricane Katrina. It dropped the equivalent of 7.1 trillion gallons of water or enough to fill Lake Pontchartrain about four times. Hurricane Katrina, by comparison, dumped about 2.3 trillion gallons of rainwater in the state (though more in other states). The flood also dumped more water than Hurricane Isaac. According to the National Weather Service Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center, the amount of rainfall in the hardest-hit locations had a less than 0.1 percent chance of happening or was a (less than) 1-in-1,000-year event. Because the rain did not fall from a named storm, there was less warning to the public for emergency preparations. GPM provides a closer look at the Louisiana floods. A rapid attribution study that was published within one month after the event  indicates an anthropogenic climate warming role in the increased probability of the return time of a similar extreme event happening in the future. A follow-on peer-reviewed paper  indicates that the catastrophic flood in Louisiana was a result of intense precipitation produced by a slow-moving tropical low pressure system interacting with an eastward-traveling baroclinic trough to the north. While tropical-midlatitude interactions of this nature are rare, they are not unprecedented. Analyses presented point towards the tendency for more and perhaps stronger upper level troughs propagating out of the western U.S. in summer; these then have an increasing potential to cross paths with low pressure systems that form around the Gulf Coast. Combined with the projected increase in precipitable water, resulting precipitation magnitude would increase. Large-ensemble modeling indicates that the prospect of future tropical-midlatitude interactions is a scenario that Louisiana will face in the future. Regional simulations suggest that the climate warming since 1985 may have increased the event precipitation (11-14 August 2016) on the order of 20%. Rainfall like this and the emergency help needed after the flooding subsides are straining the federal system for aid to states; some wonder if this is the new normal for storms and floods. Flooding began in earnest on August 12. On August 13, a flash flood emergency was issued for areas along the Amite and Comite rivers. By August 15, more than ten rivers (Amite, Vermilion, Calcasieu, Comite, Mermentau, Pearl, Tangipahoa, Tchefuncte, Tickfaw, and Bogue Chitto) and many more had reached a moderate, major, or record flood stage. Eight rivers reached record levels including the Amite and Comite rivers. The Amite River crested at nearly 5 ft (1.5 m) above the previous record in Denham Springs. Nearly one-third of all homes—approximately 15,000 structures—in Ascension Parish were flooded after a levee along the Amite River was overtopped. Water levels began to slowly recede by August 15, though large swaths of land remained submerged.Livingston Parish was one the hardest hit areas; an official estimated that 75 percent of the homes in the parish were a ""total loss"". It was thought over 146,000 homes were damaged in Louisiana. This mass flooding also damaged thousands of businesses. Thirteen people have been confirmed dead as a consequence of the flooding. The latest, according to WBRZ, is an elderly woman in Livingston Parish. Parish officials confirmed her death. A man's body was found Wednesday on Whitehall Avenue in Denham Springs. Officials said they found a man in his 50's in the South Point subdivision off of Walker South. They added the man had no obvious signs of trauma, and the area he was found in had five-feet of water in it at one point. Of the other deaths, five people have died in East Baton Rouge Parish, three in Tangipahoa Parish, two in St. Helena Parish, two in Livingston Parish and one in Rapides Parish from the storms and their aftermath. The US Coast Guard coordinating rescue operations with the St. Amant Fire Department in the Baton Rouge area. The widespread flooding stranded tens of thousands of people in their homes and vehicles. At least 30,000 people were evacuated by local law enforcement, firefighters, the Louisiana National Guard, the Coast Guard and fellow residents, from submerged vehicles and flooded homes. Many boat-owning residents of Louisiana and Mississippi, together with other volunteers, formed an informal rescue service known as the Cajun Navy and navigated through flooded areas to answer calls for help that they received via social media. They rescued as many as a thousand people and pets and distributed emergency supplies. A group of 70 volunteers from St. Bernard Parish conducted hundreds of boat rescues in East Baton Rouge Parish. By August 15, approximately 11,000 people sought refuge in 70 shelters. Flash flooding swamped a 7-mile (11 km) section of Interstate 12 between Tangipahoa Parish and Baton Rouge, stranding 125 vehicles. At one point, an approximately 62-mile stretch was closed because of flooding concerns. State police and the National Guard used high-water vehicles to rescue trapped motorists, but many remained stuck for over 24 hours. A cellular network outage complicated rescues over the affected area. On August 12, a state of emergency was activated for the whole of Louisiana. The Baton Rouge River Center served as a shelter for hundreds of displaced flood victims. With an estimated 146,000 homes damaged in the flooding—characterized as the worst US natural disaster since Hurricane Sandy in 2012—thousands of Louisianians were forced into shelters, with more than 11,000 in state-operated shelters. This prompted an estimated 1,500 American Red Cross volunteers to travel to Louisiana, along with other groups to send volunteers such as Louisiana State University, the Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New Orleans, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Celebration Church, Grace Church of Central, and the Church of Scientology. There were media reports of one man who cooked 108 pounds (49 kg) of brisket for displaced people. The Louisiana Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals attempted to rescue stray pets, and the Second Harvest Food Bank and the United Way of Southeast Louisiana sent supplies and food. More than 109,398 individuals and households have registered for FEMA assistance. FEMA has approved $132 million for assistance. Singer Beyoncé, along with sister Solange and Kelly Rowland, held an event to help raise money for those affected by the floods in Baton Rouge. They raised more than $4 million thanks to their presence. In addition, singer Taylor Swift donated $1 million to Louisiana's relief fund. Another singer, Lady Gaga, donated an unspecified amount of money. On August 13, the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters was activated by the USGS, allowing for the humanitarian redeployment of satellite assets by the international community.AT&T donated US$100,000 to be split between the Baton Rouge Area Foundation and DonorsChoose.org for flood relief.Randy Jackson and Harry Connick Jr. were scheduled to host a benefit concert at the Baton Rouge River Center Theatre on September 5, featuring over a dozen artists; all proceeds are going to the American Red Cross Louisiana Flood Relief fund. On the ""Ellen"" show Friday (Sept. 9), host Ellen DeGeneres announced that she and Britney Spears would each donate $125,000 to help victims of the Louisiana Flood of 2016. Both celebrities are from Louisiana. Spears gave $125,000 to the Louisiana Red Cross to buy a new emergency response vehicle. DeGeneres received a letter from Betsey Baldwin, a P.E. teacher at Galvez Middle School in Ascension parish, which was inundated with two feet of water. The school has 620 students, who after the floods have been forced to study at another, nearby school. ""I thought of one person that would help me, and it was you,"" Baldwin said. The company Shutterfly, at the request of DeGeneres, donated $125,000 to help Galvez Middle School recover. Since the start of the floods, around 265,000 children have been out of school, nearly 30% of the school-aged population in the state of Louisiana. The initiation of the school year has been difficult due to the direct damage many schools received, the damage of many teachers' homes, and the large number of students in between homes after being displaced by the floods. There were reports that 6 schools were heavily flooded in East Baton Rouge Parish with another 15 in Livingston Parish. Livingston Parish's Superintendent, Rick Wentzel, believes that their school system is in a similar position compared to the Northshore following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and he held a meeting with the school district to discuss possible options. Livingston Parish conducted a teacher survey August 23–24, and a parent survey August 25 to assess how those are affected, and on Friday, August 26, 2016, Superintendent Rick Wentzel announced that Livingston Parish Public Schools will be resuming class on September 12, 2016. Wentzel, who was affected by the flooding himself, said he was ""very pleased"" that all schools will be resuming together. The late restart date is because LPPS received the most extensive damage with eight of the 15 flooded schools having ""extensive damage"". Wentzel said that each school will have a welcome back event for parents and students before returning on September 12, 27 school days following the August 4th start date. Wentzel said that the restart will have some unfortunate ""side effects"" as some schools will be temporarily platooned. The exact school and class times will be announced at a later date, but it is known that Denham Springs High School will be at Live Oak High School, Denham Springs Freshman High will be at Live Oak Middle School, Southside Junior High will be at Juban Parc High School, and Springfield High School will be at Springfield Middle School. LPSB announced that all host and platooned schools will follow a similar time for class. All host schools will be in session from 6:30 am until 11:40 am and all platooned schools will be in class from 2:25 pm until 5:37 pm. The two elementary schools will be in class alongside their relocated school. It is unknown if class sizes will be increased or where the extra students will be held. It is known, however, that Denham Springs Elementary will be split among Eastside Elementary (Grades: PreK, K, 1, 2) and Freshwater Elementary (Grades: 3, 4, 5) while Southside Elementary will be split among Lewis Vincent Elementary (Grades: PreK, K, 1) and Juban Parc Elementary (Grades: 2, 3, 4, 5). This announcement also came with Superintendent Wentzel saying ALL students will receive free lunch until September 30. Following a school board meeting on Thursday, September 9, Assistant Superintendent Stephen Parill announced the ""known and confident updates"" for the 2016 Academic Calendar. Only four changes were made to the calendar that include: changing Thursday, September 15 from a half-day to a whole day, removing the parish fair holiday on Friday, October 7 (the fair was cancelled due to the flooding), removing a parent-teacher conference day on Thursday, October 20, and making Wednesday, November 16 a whole day instead of a half-day. The board also voted to add class time to the day. Parill said they are still waiting on their appeal to Louisiana BESE waiving the required minutes of class, and any further changes will be made after BESE's ruling. For the entire state, superintendent John White said that at least 22 schools had heavy damage and will need time to recover. There were also many school closures due to flooding in the Lafayette area as well. Transportation will also pose a challenge, as many kids were displaced from their homes and many school buses were damaged from flood water. Many teachers' homes flooded, with 4,000 staff members' homes in Baker sustaining damage and another 2,000 in East Baton Rouge Parish. East Baton Rouge Parish schools announced they won't open back up until September 6, 25 days after school was originally canceled for the floods on August 12, the third day of school. The Louisiana Correctional Institute for Women (LCIW), located in St. Gabriel and the sole Louisiana state prison for women, had 985 prisoners at the time of the flooding. The prison experienced flooding ranging from 8 inches (200 mm) to 3 feet (0.91 m). LCIW, the only state-operated prison to receive flooding during the incident, temporarily closed. It was the first time in state history that the whole population of a particular prison was evacuated to other facilities. As of 2017[update] the prisoners are still housed in other prisons.Elayn Hunt Correctional Center, next to LCIW, was not evacuated. Damages were anticipated to reach $10-15 billion, with this storm likely ranking as the seventh most expensive of natural disasters in the US since 1978. Because many of the areas that flooded were not in ""high flood risk areas"", the majority of homeowners affected by the flood did not have flood insurance. Across Louisiana, about 21% of all structures have coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program. Despite this, in many parishes that percentage is much lower. In St. Helena Parish, which was among the hardest hit parishes by the floods, less than 1% of all homeowners had flood insurance. Because of the large number of homeowners without flood insurance that were affected, the federal government is providing disaster aid through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The flood has been called the worst US natural disaster since Hurricane Sandy in 2012. FEMA, which has stepped in to help homeowners without flood insurance, has declared these 20 parishes as federal disaster areas: Acadia, Ascension, Avoyelles, East Baton Rouge, East Feliciana, Evangeline, Iberia, Iberville, Jefferson Davis, Lafayette, Livingston, Pointe Coupee, St. Helena, St. Landry, St. Martin, St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, Vermilion, Washington, and West Feliciana. Homeowners with damage from the floods in those parishes are eligible for up to $33,000 in federal disaster aid and so far around 102,000 people have applied for help. For business continuity and community rebuilding, private mobile flood recovery centers have also been made available, including a 10-piece modular building complex used in Baton Rouge by FEMA as a portable school for children of displaced families who moved north from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. The national media has been criticized by many leaders in Louisiana for lack of media coverage of the floods, especially compared to other major natural disasters. This seems to have happened because of the heavy coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympics and the 2016 U.S. presidential election, along with the fact that the storm did not have a name since it was not a tropical storm nor hurricane. In fact, the storm was not even a tropical depression, the lowest level a tropical system can have. The Times-Picayune expressed their frustrations in an article and noted that CNN and The New York Times had not covered the floods until late Sunday August 14, despite widespread flooding starting on August 12. During the floods, President Barack Obama was on vacation in Martha's Vineyard. On August 18, an editorial in The Advocate criticized the president for not coming to Louisiana during the crisis. However, Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards defended the president's handling of the emergency, saying that he had been talking to him daily and that a visit by the president would require road closures for his motorcade and distract first responders when rescues are still underway. On August 23, 2016, Obama visited the Baton Rouge area and made a speech, along with meeting residents affected by the floods. In his speech he said that the floods were not a photo op issue and that ""after the TV cameras leave, the whole country is going to continue to support"" the Louisiana. During his visit he also took the time to visit the family of Alton Sterling and the families of the slain police officers who were killed in a shooting earlier in the summer following unrest in Baton Rouge. Initially, presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump also faced criticism for paying little to no attention to the floods. On August 19, 2016, four days before the President's visit, Trump and his running mate Mike Pence toured the flooded areas. Trump visited affected families in St. Amant, a community southeast of Baton Rouge, and handed supplies from an 18-wheeler truck from a local church. Hillary Clinton said she would not visit Louisiana in the near future, saying that her political campaign would cause distraction, though said she wanted Louisianans to have the resources they needed. High school football brought national coverage of the damage from the floods in September 2016. The focus was the local high school football teams in Livingston Parish. ESPN was ""shining a spotlight"" on Denham Springs High School's football program's rebound following the flooding. DSHS had to forfeit their first game against East Ascension in wake of the flooding, and opened the season at home against Tara. On the night of Thursday, September 8, DSHS hosted a pep rally to get fans and students ready for the upcoming season. During the pep rally, ESPN Sportscenter recorded various clips and interviews that are set to play every hour between 7 am and noon on Friday (September 9). ESPN also held two ""live remote feeds"" covering pregame at Yellow Jacket Stadium from 5-6 pm airing on Sportscenter and ESPN2. Sportscenter ended their national coverage of the flood on Saturday morning (September 10) by having a live broadcast at James Grill in Denham Springs, Louisiana from 6-8am.

He told Politico that his resignation was not in any way related to scandal. Not in any way shape or form. Ive been given more enemas by more people over the last eight years than you can possibly imagine. From the Secret Service to the Democratic Party. I am who I am. If they had something really scandalous, it wouldve come out a long, long time ago.Well, it would be true that it would have come out a long, long time ago had the FBI been investigating Russian money laundering by people involved in the American political process. But until Donald Trump came along, there werent really any major questions about such things in our political process. But we will get into that in a bit.The real scandal here is that somebody wanted to sleep with Jason ChaffetzAnother revelation is that Jason Chaffetz wants to spend more time with his family because he is allegedly having an affair.Latest from a well placed Congressional source is that @jasoninthehouse multi year affair with a woman was about to be revealed. https://t.co/Dg4hKCRtbZ Claude Taylor (@TrueFactsStated) April 20, 2017Just in case you arent familiar with Claude Taylor, he is a veteran of three presidential campaigns and was a White House staffer for the Clinton administration. He also served in the Obama administration. And this is just one piece of possible Russian kompromat on Jason Chaffetz.A 2nd source is claiming that the Russians knew about Chaffetz's affair and were blackmailing him. https://t.co/Dg4hKCzRNp Claude Taylor (@TrueFactsStated) April 20, 2017Chaffetz and Comeys leaked letterChaffetz is also the person responsible for leaking James Comeys letter to the public over the Clinton e-mail scandal. The press continually blamed Comey but the real culprit that used that information to interfere in the election was none other than Jason Chaffetz. This garnered Chaffetz a big fat ethics complaint from Scott Dworkin of the Democratic Coalition.According to a statement from Dworkin: Representative Chaffetz, in an ill-planned partisan attempt, released information that compromised the integrity of the FBI, when he irresponsibly tweeted out that the case investigating Secretary Clintons emails had been reopened, when in fact, it had not been. Members of Congress are elected to make our country a safer, better place  not to use their power to work with leaders such as Comey in a partisan fashion. I hope that both are held accountable for their actions.Some reports also allege that Chaffetz received a check from Trump for a whopping $10 million bucks for leaking the letter. Money that was likely obtained through nefarious means. Russian money laundering, anyone?Chaffetz and Russian Money LaunderingAnother scandal comes amid allegations that Chaffetz along with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell were working on ways to get Russian money into the American political process via dark super PACs that would hide the origin of the money received.According to an article from The Daily Kos:...The laundering of Russian money does make a great deal of sense. Why? Because just a few days ago there was a lot of chatter about an audio tape the FBI took into evidence. This pre-election tape purports to be a recording of Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell discussing how best to wash Russian money through House and senate campaigns via dark money superPACs. Paul Ryans name has already been linked with the Russian hacking of voter data from swing states so money laundering on behalf of the Russians is not a big leap from there and would be entirely in character for both men. Certainly both were desperate to hold onto the power they knew was slipping through their fingers so both would have grabbed at any opportunity for big money assistance without caring much where it came from.That would also explain Chaffetzs desires to gut the Office of Congressional Ethics. After all, with the complaints filed and a looming FBI investigation, that particular office could prove to be quite the thorn in the side of Republicans looking to cover up the crimes of the Trump campaign.According to a report from The Failing New York Times:House Republicans, overriding their top leaders, voted on Monday to significantly curtail the power of an independent ethics office set up in 2008 in the aftermath of corruption scandals that sent three members of Congress to jail.The move to effectively kill the Office of Congressional Ethics was not made public until late Monday, when Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, announced that the House Republican Conference had approved the change. There was no advance notice or debate on the measure.Of course, they failed to gut the OCE due to public outcry but Republicans may still win the day when a new budget passes.So actually, yeah Jason, youre resigning because of a massive scandal. Just not one massive scandal. Unless, of course, Chaffetz doesnt think Russian money laundering is a scandal. We look forward to seeing him do the perp walk with his cohorts in the House and Senate.

Domestic assets are moving into defensive positions. POSSIBLY RELATED MATERIAL (UPDATES CONTINUE BELOW FOLLOWING THIS RELATED MATERIAL)American and Russian fighter jets had a tense showdown in the skies above Syria as the Russians dropped bombs on U.S.-backed rebels.U.S. and Russian fighter jets bloodlessly tangled in the air over Syria on June 16 as the American pilots tried and failed to stop the Russians from bombing U.S.-backed rebels in southern Syria near the border with Jordan.The aerial close encounter underscores just how chaotic Syria’s skies have become as Russia and the U.S.-led coalition work at cross-purposes, each dropping bombs in support of separate factions in the five-year-old civil war.The near-clash also highlights the escalating risk of American and Russian forces actually coming to blows over Syria, potentially sparking a much wider conflict between the world’s leading nuclear powers.The incident began when at least two twin-engine Su-34 bombers, some of Moscow’s most advanced warplanes, struck what the Pentagon described as a “border garrison”  housing around 200 U.S.-supported rebels in At Tanf on the Syrian side of the Syria-Jordan border.The rebels had been “conducting counter-ISIL operations in the area,” the Pentagon stated on June 18, using an alternative acronym for ISIS.The United States and its allies in Syria clearly did not expect the air strike. The rebels in At Tanf are party to a shaky ceasefire agreement between rebel forces and the regime of Syrian president Bashar Al Assad—and, by extension, the Russian military contingent backing Al Assad. The Los Angeles Times reported that Russian planes had not previously been active over At Tanf. The Su-34s’ initial strike wounded, and perhaps killed, some of the rebels in At Tanf.The U.S. Navy scrambled F/A-18 fighters to intercept the Russians, the Los Angeles Times reported. The Navy has deployed two aircraft carriers to the region for strikes on ISIS. As the F/A-18s approached the Su-34s, officials with U.S. Central Command—which oversees America’s wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan—used a special hotline to contact their Russian counterparts directing Russia’s own intervention in Syria.Arriving over At Tanf, the American pilots apparently spoke directly to the Russian aviators. “Pilots CAN communicate with one another on a communications channel set up to avoid air accidents,” Central Command confirmed in a statement to The Daily Beast.Washington and Moscow had established the hotline as part of a so-called “Safety of Flight Memorandum of Understanding” that the two governments signed in October specifically in order to avoid the kind of aerial confrontation that occurred over Syria last week.With the American jets flying close enough to visually identify the Su-34s, the Russians departed the air space over At Tanf. Some time shortly thereafter, the F/A-18s ran low on fuel and left the area in order to link up with an aerial tanker. That’s when the Su-34s reportedly returned to At Tanf —and bombed the rebels again.According to the Los Angeles Times, the second strike killed first-responders assisting survivors of the first bombing run.The next day, senior U.S. Defense Department officials organized an “extraordinary” video conference with Russian counterparts to discuss the incident. The meeting included Acting Assistant Secretary for International Security Affairs Elissa Slotkin and U.S. Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, a strategic planner on the Pentagon’s joint staff, plus unspecified Russian Ministry of Defense officials.“Department officials expressed strong concerns about the attack on the coalition-supported counter-ISIL forces at the At Tanf garrison, which included forces that are participants in the cessation of hostilities in Syria, and emphasized that those concerns would be addressed through ongoing diplomatic discussions on the cessation of hostilities,” Defense Department spokesman Peter Cook explained in a statement.""Regarding safety, department officials conveyed that Russia’s continued strikes at At Tanf, even after U.S. attempts to inform Russian forces through proper channels of on-going coalition air support to the counter-ISIL forces, created safety concerns for U.S. and coalition forces,” Cook continued. “Department officials requested Russian responses to address those concerns.”Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov confirmed, via the country’s state-owned media, that the teleconference took place—but he did not specify the results of the “extraordinary” meeting.Russian warplanes had previously shadowed planes belonging to the U.S.-led coalition over Syria, but the coalition always described the Russians’ behavior as “professional.” By contrast, in April Russian Su-24 bombers repeatedly buzzed the U.S. Navy warship USS Donald Cook while the vessel sailed in international waters in the Black Sea. A Pentagon spokesman called the Russians’ actions in that incident “provocative and unprofessional.”The Kremlin should be keenly aware of the potential for unwanted—and potentially destabilizing—bloodshed that exists in the air over Syria. In November, a Russian Su-24 bomber flying a mission over Syria strayed over the Syria-Turkey border into Turkey—and a Turkish F-16 fighter promptly shot it down .The two Russian crew members ejected. One flier died when Syrian rebels on the ground opened fire on his parachute. Russian, Syrian and Iranian forces launched a complex rescue mission that ultimately retrieved the surviving pilot. One Russian marine died and a helicopter was destroyed during that operation.The fallout from the November incident continues, with Russia and Turkey exchanging threats—and Moscow imposing economic sanctions on Ankarra including limits on some food imports to Russia from Turkey.It’s not clear how close the U.S. fighters came to attacking and potentially shooting down the Su-34s over At Tanf. Central Command declined to say what the rules of engagement are for American pilots flying over Syria. “ROE are actually specifics that we don’t get into,” Central Command said in a statement.The last time a U.S. military warplane shot down a Russian—actually, Soviet—plane was in 1953, over Korea or China, depending on which historians you believe. The last time a Russian or Soviet warplane shot down an American aircraft was in 1970, when a U.S. Army plane strayed over Armenia.#### RESUMING UPDATES . . . .At 4:32 AM EDT -- A huge explosion has struck an ammunition depot at a military firing range in southern Russia. The Defense Ministry said around 600 people have been evacuated.The incident took place at Ashuluk testing range near the city of Astrakhan in southern Russia. As of 6:23 EDT this morning Currently NATO has an abnormal ammount of fighters and c-130s up over europe.x10 F-16"

After more than two decades following a “no testing on animals” policy, cosmetics giants Avon, Mary Kay, and Estee Lauder have resumed the practice without letting consumers know. In the late 1980s, PETA’s “Avon Killing” campaign eventually led to the company banning animal testing for their products, with Mary Kay and Estée Lauder following suit.According to a press release from Rush PR, the news was broken after animal rights organization PETA removed the companies from their cruelty-free list after discovering that they had returned to using testing on animals for their products. The three companies began the tests again in order to satisfy regulations from the Chinese government so they could sell their products in China. However, PETA contends that there are alternative testing methods that are just as effective and widely used in the US.Kathy Guillermo, the Vice President of PETA’s Laboratory Investigations was saddened by the move: “Avon, Estée Lauder, and Mary Kay have regressed a generation: Their products are once again being dripped into rabbits’ eyes and smeared onto animals’ abraded skin.” She’s urging customers to choose cruelty-free products instead.Avon spokeswoman Reese Witherspoon may be upset to learn about the new animal testing as well. Late last year she was “dismayed” to learn a bag she was spotted with was made from real python skin and agreed to throw it away. But perhaps she can use her star power to influence Avon to go back to their animal-friendly ways.Keep You Up To Date On All Our Doggie News!Join our mailing list to receive the latest news and updates from Dog Files.SUBMIT!Thank you so much for subscribing to Dog Files!Share:
https://www.snopes.com/food/tainted/roundupwheat.asp	The Real Reason Wheat is Toxic	mixture	['asp article', ' gluten', ' monsanto', ' roundup', ' wheat']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/x6ljl	2014/12/25	The Real Reason Wheat is Toxic (it’s not the gluten)by Sarah Updated: February 20, 2017 Green Living Comments: 1,1011.9MShare Tweet Pin Email-The stories became far too frequent to ignore. Emails from folks with allergic or digestive issues to wheat in the United States experienced no symptoms whatsoever when they tried eating pasta on vacation in Italy.Confused parents wondering why wheat consumption sometimes triggered autoimmune reactions in their children but not at other times.Is Your Home Making You Sick?Get a free chapter of my book Living Green in an Artificial World + my newsletter and learn how to start creating a living environment that supports and enhances health!XIn my own home, I’ve long pondered why my husband can eat the wheat I prepare  at home, but he experiences negative digestive effects eating even a single roll in a restaurant.There is clearly something going on with wheat that is not well known by the general public. It goes far and beyond organic versus nonorganic, gluten or hybridization because even conventional wheat triggers no symptoms for some who eat wheat in other parts of the world.What indeed is going on with wheat?For quite some time, I secretly harbored the notion that wheat in the United States must, in fact, be genetically modified.  GMO wheat secretly invading the North American food supply seemed the only thing that made sense and could account for the varied experiences I was hearing about.I reasoned that it couldn’t be the gluten or wheat hybridization. Gluten and wheat hybrids have been consumed for thousands of years. It just didn’t make sense that this could be the reason for so many people suddenly having problems with wheat and gluten in general in the past 5-10 years.Finally, the answer came over dinner a couple of months ago with a friend who was well versed in the wheat production process. I started researching the issue for myself, and was, quite frankly, horrified at what I discovered.The good news is that the reason wheat has become so toxic in the United States is not because it is secretly GMO as I had feared (thank goodness!).The bad news is that the problem lies with the manner in which wheat is grown and harvested by conventional wheat farmers.You’re going to want to sit down for this one.  I’ve had some folks burst into tears in horror when I passed along this information before.Common wheat harvest protocol in the United States is to drench the wheat fields with Roundup several days before the combine harvesters work through the fields as the practice allows for an earlier, easier and bigger harvest.Pre-harvest application of the herbicide Roundup or other herbicides containing the deadly active ingredient glyphosate to wheat and barley as a desiccant was suggested as early as 1980.  It has since become routine over the past 15 years and is used as a drying agent 7-10 days before harvest within the conventional farming community.According to Dr. Stephanie Seneff of MIT who has studied the issue in depth and who I recently saw present on the subject at a nutritional Conference in Indianapolis, desiccating non-organic wheat crops with glyphosate just before harvest came into vogue late in the 1990’s with the result that most of the non-organic wheat in the United States is now contaminated with it.  Seneff explains that when you expose wheat to a toxic chemical like glyphosate, it actually releases more seeds resulting in a slightly greater yield:   “It ‘goes to seed’ as it dies. At its last gasp, it releases the seed” says Dr. Seneff.According to the US Department of Agriculture, as of 2012, 99% of durum wheat, 97% of spring wheat, and 61% of winter wheat has been treated with herbicides. This is an increase from 88% for durum wheat, 91% for spring wheat and 47% for winter wheat since 1998.Here’s what wheat farmer Keith Lewis has to say about the practice:I have been a wheat farmer for 50 yrs and one wheat production practice that is very common is applying the herbicide Roundup (glyposate) just prior to harvest. Roundup is licensed for preharvest weed control. Monsanto, the manufacturer of Roundup claims that application to plants at over 30% kernel moisture result in roundup uptake by the plant into the kernels. Farmers like this practice because Roundup kills the wheat plant allowing an earlier harvest.A wheat field often ripens unevenly, thus applying Roundup preharvest evens up the greener parts of the field with the more mature. The result is on the less mature areas Roundup is translocated into the kernels and eventually harvested as such.This practice is not licensed. Farmers mistakenly call it “desiccation.” Consumers eating products made from wheat flour are undoubtedly consuming minute amounts of Roundup. An interesting aside, malt barley which is made into beer is not acceptable in the marketplace if it has been sprayed with preharvest Roundup. Lentils and peas are not accepted in the market place if it was sprayed with preharvest roundup….. but wheat is ok.. This farming practice greatly concerns me and it should further concern consumers of wheat products.Here’s what wheat farmer Seth Woodland of Woodland and Wheat in Idaho had to say about the practice of using herbicides for wheat dry down:That practice is bad . I have fellow farmers around me that do it and it is sad. Lucky for you not all of us farm that way. Being the farmer and also the president of a business, we are proud to say that we do not use round up on our wheat ever!This practice is not just widespread in the United States either. The Food Standards Agency in the United Kingdom reports that use of Roundup as a wheat desiccant results in glyphosate residues regularly showing up in bread samples. Other European countries are waking up to to the danger, however. In the Netherlands, use of Roundup is completely banned with France likely soon to follow.Using Roundup on wheat crops throughout the entire growing season and even as a desiccant just prior to harvest may save the farmer money and increase profits, but it is devastating to the health of the consumer who ultimately consumes the glyphosate residue laden wheat kernels.The chart below of skyrocketing applications of glyphosate to US wheat crops since 1990 and the incidence of celiac disease is from a December 2013 study published in the Journal Interdisciplinary Toxicology examining glyphosate pathways to autoimmune disease. Remember that wheat is not currently GMO or “Roundup Ready” meaning it is not resistant to its withering effects like GMO corn or GMO soy, so application of glyphosate to wheat would actually kill it.While the herbicide industry maintains that glyphosate is minimally toxic to humans,  research published in the Journal Entropy  strongly argues otherwise by shedding light on exactly how glyphosate disrupts mammalian physiology.Authored by Anthony Samsel and Stephanie Seneff of MIT, the paper investigates glyphosate’s inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, an overlooked component of lethal toxicity to mammals.The currently accepted view is that ghyphosate is not harmful to humans or any mammals.  This flawed view is so pervasive in the conventional farming community that Roundup salesmen have been known to foolishly drink it during presentations!However, just because Roundup doesn’t kill you immediately doesn’t make it nontoxic.  In fact, the active ingredient in Roundup lethally disrupts the all important shikimate pathway found in beneficial gut microbes which is responsible for synthesis of critical amino acids.Friendly gut bacteria, also called probiotics, play a critical role in human health. Gut bacteria aid digestion, prevent permeability of the gastointestinal tract (which discourages the development of autoimmune disease), synthesize vitamins and provide the foundation for robust immunity.  In essence:Roundup significantly disrupts the functioning of beneficial bacteria in the gut and contributes to permeability of the intestinal wall and consequent expression of autoimmune disease symptoms.In synergy with disruption of the biosynthesis of important amino acids via the shikimate pathway, glyphosate inhibits the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes produced by the gut microbiome.  CYP enzymes are critical to human biology because they detoxify the multitude of foreign chemical compounds, xenobiotics, that we are exposed to in our modern environment today.As a result, humans exposed to glyphosate through use of Roundup in their community or through ingestion of its residues on industrialized food products become even more vulnerable to the damaging effects of other chemicals and environmental toxins they encounter!What’s worse is that the negative impact of glyphosate exposure is slow and insidious over months and years as inflammation gradually gains a foothold in the cellular systems of the body.The consequences of this systemic inflammation are most of the diseases and conditions associated with the Western lifestyle:Gastrointestinal disorders

Several of the diplomats were recent arrivals at the embassy, which reopened in 2015 as part of former President Barack Obama's reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba.Some of the diplomats' symptoms were so severe that they were forced to cancel their tours early and return to the United States, officials said. After months of investigation, U.S. officials concluded that the diplomats had been exposed to an advanced device that operated outside the range of audible sound and had been deployed either inside or outside their residences. It was not immediately clear if the device was a weapon used in a deliberate attack, or had some other purpose.The U.S. officials weren't authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the U.S. retaliated by expelling two Cuban diplomats from their embassy in Washington on May 23. She did not say how many U.S. diplomats were affected or confirm they had suffered hearing loss, saying only that they had ""a variety of physical symptoms.""The Cuban government said in a lengthy statement late Wednesday that ""Cuba has never permitted, nor will permit, that Cuban territory be used for any action against accredited diplomatic officials or their families, with no exception.""The statement from the Cuban Foreign Ministry said it had been informed of the incidents on Feb. 17 and had launched an ""exhaustive, high-priority, urgent investigation at the behest of the highest level of the Cuban government.""It said the decision to expel two Cuban diplomats was ""unjustified and baseless.""The ministry said it had created an expert committee to analyze the incidents and had reinforced security around the U.S. embassy and U.S. diplomatic residences.""Cuba is universally considered a safe destination for visitors and foreign diplomats, including U.S. citizens,"" the statement said.U.S. officials told The Associated Press that about five diplomats, several with spouses, had been affected and that no children had been involved. The FBI and Diplomatic Security Service are investigating.Cuba employs a state security apparatus that keeps many people under surveillance and U.S. diplomats are among the most closely monitored people on the island. Like virtually all foreign diplomats in Cuba, the victims of the incidents lived in housing owned and maintained by the Cuban government.However, officials familiar with the probe said investigators were looking into the possibilities that the incidents were carried out by a third country such as Russia, possibly operating without the knowledge of Cuba's formal chain of command.Nauert said investigators did not yet have a definitive explanation for the incidents but stressed they take them ""very seriously,"" as shown by the Cuban diplomats' expulsions.""We requested their departure as a reciprocal measure since some U.S. personnel's assignments in Havana had to be curtailed due to these incidents,"" she said. ""Under the Vienna Convention, Cuba has an obligation to take measures to protect diplomats.""U.S. diplomats in Cuba said they suffered occasional harassment for years after the restoration of limited ties with the communist government in the 1970s, harassment reciprocated by U.S. agents against Cuban diplomats in Washington. The use of sonic devices to intentionally harm diplomats would be unprecedented.___"

These attempts to distort Catholic teaching have weakened the Church’s witness to the truths of the natural and supernatural order and have threatened the well-being of the family, especially its weakest and most vulnerable members.The Apostolic Exhortation Amoris Laetitia is a very lengthy document, which discusses a wide variety of subjects related to the family. There are many passages that faithfully reflect Catholic teaching but this cannot, and does not, lessen the gravity of those passages which undermine the teaching and practice of the Catholic Church. Voice of the Family intends to present full analyses of the serious problems in the text over the coming days and weeks.Voice of the Family expresses the following initial concerns with the greatest reverence for the papal office and solely out of a sincere desire to assist the hierarchy in its proclamation of Catholic teaching on life, marriage and the family and to further the authentic good of the family and its most vulnerable members.We consider that in raising the following concerns we fulfil our duty as clearly laid out in the Code of Canon Law, which states:According to the knowledge, competence, and prestige which they possess, they have the right and even at times the duty to manifest to the sacred pastors their opinion on matters which pertain to the good of the Church and to make their opinion known to the rest of the Christian faithful, without prejudice to the integrity of faith and morals, with reverence toward their pastors, and attentive to common advantage and the dignity of persons. ( Canon 212 §3 )Admission of the “divorced and remarried” to Holy CommunionAmoris Laetitia, over the course of Chapter VIII (paragraphs 291-312), proposes a number of approaches that prepare the way for “divorced and remarried” Catholics to receive Holy Communion without true repentance and amendment of life. These paragraphs include:confused expositions of Catholic teaching on the nature and effects of mortal sin, on the imputability of sin, and on the nature of conscience;the use of ideological language in place of the Church’s traditional terminology;and the use of selective and misleading quotations from previous Church documents.A particularly troubling example of misquotation of previous teaching is found in paragraph 298 which quotes the statement of Pope John Paul II, made in Familiaris Consortio, that there exist situations “where, for serious reasons, such as the children’s upbringing, a man and woman cannot satisfy the obligation to separate.” However in Amoris Laetitia the second half of Pope John Paul II’s sentence, which states that such couples “take on themselves the duty to live in complete continence, that is, by abstinence from the acts proper to married couples” (Familiaris Consortio, No. 84),  is omitted.Furthermore, in the footnote to this misleading quotation, we read:In such situations, many people, knowing and accepting the possibility of living ‘as brothers and sisters’ which the Church offers them, point out that if certain expressions of intimacy are lacking, ‘it often happens that faithfulness is endangered and the good of the children suffers’ (Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World Gaudium et Spes, 51).The document makes reference to this erroneous view but does not explain why it is a false approach, which is namely that: All sexual acts outside of a valid marriage are intrinsically evil and it is never justifiable to commit an intrinsically evil act, even in order to achieve a good end.“Faithfulness is endangered” by acts of sexual intimacy outside of marriage but faithfulness is lived when two individuals in an invalid union refrain from sexual intimacy in fidelity to their original union, which remains valid.The quotation implies that children will suffer because their parents, with the help of divine grace, live chastely. On the contrary, such parents are giving their children an example of fidelity, chastity and trust in the power of God’s grace.The document cites Gaudium et Spes but the passage is quoted out of context and does not support the argument made. The context makes clear that Gaudium et Spes is speaking of married Catholics, in the context of procreation, not those cohabiting in an invalid union. The full sentence is as follows:But where the intimacy of married life is broken off, its faithfulness can sometimes be imperilled and its quality of fruitfulness ruined, for then the upbringing of the children and the courage to accept new ones are both endangered (Gaudium et Spes, No. 51).It is therefore difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Apostolic Exhortation is at least raising the possibility that adulterous sexual acts might in some cases be justifiable and has misquoted Gaudium et Spes as if to provide grounds for this.Other approaches that undermine Catholic doctrine on reception of the sacraments will be discussed by Voice of the Family in due course.Parental rights and sex educationAmoris Laetitia includes a section entitled “The Need for Sex Education” (paragraphs 280-286). This section spans more than five pages without making even one reference to parents. On the other hand there is reference to “educational institutions”. Yet sex education is “a basic right and duty of parents” which “must always be carried out under their attentive guidance, whether at home or in educational centers chosen and controlled by them” (Pope John Paul II, Familiaris Consortio, No. 37). The omission of this teaching seriously fails parents at a time when parental rights regarding sex education are under serious and sustained attack in many nations of the world, and at the international institutions. In this section Amoris Laetitia does not cite any of the previous Church documents that clearly affirm this right; it does however cite a psychoanalyst, Erich Fromm, associated with the Frankfurt school. The document’s earlier references to parental rights (paragraph 84), while welcome, cannot compensate for the exclusion of parents from this section.Homosexual unionsAmoris Laetitia, following an approach similar to that previously adopted in synod documents, implies that “same-sex unions” may offer a “certain stability” and can have a kind of similarity or relation to marriage. It states that:We need to acknowledge the great variety of family situations that can offer a certain stability, but de facto or same-sex unions, for example, may not simply be equated with marriage. (Paragraph 53)There is great pressure at the international institutions for the rejection of the traditional understanding of the family through the adoption of language which refers to “variety” or “diversity” in the forms of the family. The implication that “same-sex unions” form part of the “great variety of family situations” is precisely what pro-family groups are fighting hard to oppose. By using such language the Apostolic Exhortation undermines the pro-family movement’s work to protect the true definition of the family and, consequently, to protect children who depend on the family structure willed by God for their well-being and healthy development.It should be noted that in paragraph 251 the authentic teaching of the Church, that “there are absolutely no grounds for considering homosexual unions to be in any way similar or even remotely analogous to God’s plan for marriage and family” is restated.“Gender ideology”Amoris Laetitia endorses a central aspect of “gender ideology” by asserting that it “needs to be emphasized” that biological sex and socio-cultural ‘gender’ can be “distinguished but not separated” (paragraph 56). This acceptance of the underlying principle of gender theory undermines the document’s otherwise welcome criticism of the ideology and its effects. The false notion that biological sex is distinguishable from so-called “gender” was first proposed in the 1950s and is the foundation of “gender ideology”. Opposition to the consequences of “gender ideology”will be impossible if its erroneous first principle is accepted.Attacks on innocent human lifeAmoris Laetitia fails to grapple with the scale of the threat to unborn children, the elderly and the disabled. Conservative estimates indicate that over one billion unborn lives have been destroyed by abortion over the last century. Yet in a document addressing challenges to the family, which is 264 pages long, there are only a small number of passing references to abortion. There is no mention of the destruction caused by artificial methods of reproduction, which have also resulted in the loss of millions of human lives. The absence of serious discussion of attacks on unborn life in this context is a grave omission.There is also minimal reference to euthanasia and assisted suicide despite the increasing pressure for their legalization across the world. Failure to adequately discuss this threat is likewise another very regrettable omission.ContraceptionAmoris Laetitia fails to adequately restate Catholic teaching on the use of contraception. This is a troubling oversight given that (i) the separation of the procreative and unitive ends of the sexual act is a major catalyst for the culture of death and that (ii) there is widespread disobedience and ignorance of the Church’s teaching in this area precisely because of the failure of the hierarchy to communicate this truth.  The document’s discussion of conscience is likewise flawed both in paragraph 222, which deals with “responsible parenthood”, and in Chapter VIII which deals with the admission to the sacraments of those in public adultery. Paragraph 303 is of particular concern, especially in the following assertion:Yet conscience can do more than recognize that a given situation does not correspond objectively to the overall demands of the Gospel. It can also recognize with sincerity and honesty what for now is the most generous response which can be given to God, and come to see with a certain moral security that it is what God himself is asking amid the concrete complexity of one’s limits, while yet not fully the objective ideal. In any event, let us recall that this discernment is dynamic; it must remain ever open to new stages of growth and to new decisions which can enable the ideal to be more fully realized.This statement seems to adopt a false understanding of the “law of gradualness” and suggest that there are certain occasions when sin is not only unavoidable but even actively willed by God for that person. This would clearly be unacceptable.ConclusionsThis is only a brief introduction to the very numerous problems found within Amoris Laetitia. It will take further study to fully draw out all the implications of the text but it is already abundantly clear that the document fails to give a clear and faithful exposition of Catholic doctrine and leads inescapably to conclusions that could result in violations of the immutable teaching of the Catholic Church, and those disciplines which are inextricably founded upon it. Our initial overview provides sufficient cause to regard this document as a threat to the integrity of the Catholic faith and the authentic good of the family.We reiterate once again that we make these criticisms with great reverence for the office of the papacy but with the consciousness of our duties as lay Catholics towards the good of the Church, and our duties as pro-life/pro-family campaigners to work to protect the family and its most vulnerable members.

The disease was unknown in Europe or any other continent, occurring only in North America.White snakeroot is a shade-loving plant found throughout Indiana. It is commonly seen growing on roadsides, in damp open areas, or on the shaded north side of ridges. The plant is also found in western Ohio and the wooded parts of Illinois. These three states probably had the greatest quantity of the weed and probably do so today.By definition, milk sickness is poisoning by milk from cows that have  eaten white snakeroot. Many early settlers in the Midwest came into contact with the sickness. In the fall of 1818, Nancy Hanks Lincoln died as milk sickness struck the Little Pigeon Creek settlement.The sickness has been called puking fever, sick stomach, the slows, and the trembles. The illness was most common in dry years when cows wandered from poor pastures to the woods in search of food. In man, the symptoms are loss of appetite, listlessness, weakness, vague pains, muscle stiffness, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, severe constipation, bad breath, and finally coma. Recovery is slow and may never be complete, but more often an attack is fatal, as it was for Nancy Hanks Lincoln. She died on October 5, 1818.While milk sickness usually develops when a person or animal eats the plant, the sickness can also occur if one eats heavily of the flesh of an animal that has died of severe white snakeroot poisoning. Within the present century persons have suffered and died from milk sickness in parts of Indiana, Ohio, and Illinois. It is written that more than half of the deaths that occurred early in the 19th century in Dubois County, Indiana, were caused by milk sickness.In the library of the Surgeon General in Washington, D.C. are some 200 articles pertaining to milk sickness, many of them in medical journals. Until the present century, few people -- including physicians -- knew much of the sickness. Milk sickness or ""trembles"" was more prevalent in late summer and early fall, but records show that many cases occurred in the winter and early summer also. In late summer, when the plant is in full bloom, it is easily recognized, growing to a height of 18 to 48 inches, more woodlands were cleared, cattle had adequate pasture even in dry weather. As a result the incidence of the disease tapered off. The mixing of milk from many cows at the dairy further reduces the chances of milk sickness today.EXPERIENCE YOUR AMERICA""The National Park Service cares for special places saved by the American        people so that all may experience our heritage.""  "

It has recently come to the attention of the College that one of the recommended vaccines could possibly be associated with the very rare but serious condition of premature ovarian failure (POF), also known as premature menopause. There have been two case report series (3 cases each) published since 2013 in which post-menarcheal adolescent girls developed laboratory documented POF within weeks to several years of receiving Gardasil, a four-strain human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV4).1,2 Adverse events that occur after vaccines are frequently not caused by the vaccine and there has not been a noticeable rise in POF cases in the last 9 years since HPV4 vaccine has been widely used.Nevertheless there are legitimate concerns that should be addressed: (1) long-term ovarian function was not assessed in either the original rat safety studies3,4 or in the human vaccine trials, (2) most primary care physicians are probably unaware of a possible association between HPV4 and POF and may not consider reporting POF cases or prolonged amenorrhea (missing menstrual periods) to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), (3) potential mechanisms of action have been postulated based on autoimmune associations with the aluminum adjuvant used1 and previously documented ovarian toxicity in rats from another component, polysorbate 80,2 and (4) since licensure of Gardasil® in 2006, there have been about 213 VAERS reports (per the publicly available CDC WONDER VAERS database) involving amenorrhea, POF or premature menopause, 88% of which have been associated with Gardasil®.5 The two-strain HPV2, CervarixTM, was licensed late in 2009 and accounts for 4.7 % of VAERS amenorrhea reports since 2006, and 8.5% of those reports from February 2010 through May 2015. This compares to the pre-HPV vaccine period from 1990 to 2006 during which no cases of POF or premature menopause and 32 cases of amenorrhea were reported to VAERS.Many adolescent females are vaccinated with influenza, meningococcal, and tetanus vaccines without getting Gardasil®, and yet only 5.6% of reports related to ovarian dysfunction since 2006 are associated with such vaccines in the absence of simultaneous Gardasil® administration. The overwhelming majority (76%) of VAERS reports since 2006 with ovarian failure, premature menopause, and/or amenorrhea are associated solely with Gardasil®. When VAERS reports since 2006 are restricted to cases in which amenorrhea occurred for at least 4 months and is not associated with other known causes like polycystic ovary syndrome or pregnancy, 86/89 cases are associated with Gardasil®, 3/89 with CervarixTM, and 0/89 with other vaccines administered independently of an HPV vaccine.5 Using the same criteria, there are only 7 reports of amenorrhea from 1990 through 2005 and no more than 2 of those associated with any one vaccine type.Few other vaccines besides Gardasil® that are administered in adolescence contain polysorbate 80.6 Pre-licensure safety trials for Gardasil® used placebo that contained polysorbate 80 as well as aluminum adjuvant.2,7 Therefore, if such ingredients could cause ovarian dysfunction, an increase in amenorrhea probably would not have been detected in the placebo controlled trials. Furthermore, a large number of girls in the original trials were taking hormonal contraceptives which can mask ovarian dysfunction including amenorrhea and ovarian failure.2 Thus a causal relationship between human papillomavirus vaccines (if not Gardasil® specifically) and ovarian dysfunction cannot be ruled out at this time.Numerous Gardasil safety studies, including one released recently,8 have looked at demyelinating and autoimmune diseases and have not found any significant problems. Unfortunately, none of them except clinical safety pre-licensure studies totaling 11,778 vaccinees9 specifically addressed post-vaccination ovarian dysfunction. While data from those studies do not indicate an increased rate of amenorrhea after vaccination, the essential lack of saline placebos and the majority of participants taking hormonal contraceptives in those studies preclude meaningful data to rule out an effect on ovarian function.A Vaccine Safety Datalink POF study is planned to address an association between these vaccines and POF, but it may be years before results will be determined. Plus, POF within a few years of vaccination could be the tip of the iceberg since ovarian dysfunction manifested by months of amenorrhea may later progress to POF. Meanwhile, the author of this statement has contacted the maker of Gardasil, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to make known the above concerns and request that (1) more rat studies be done to look at long-term ovarian function after HPV4 injections, (2) the 89 VAERS reports identified with at least 4 months amenorrhea be reviewed by the CDC for further clarification since the publicly available WONDER VAERS database only contains initial reports, and (3) primary care providers be notified of a possible association between HPV and amenorrhea. A U.S. Government Representative responded that they “will continue to conduct studies and monitor the safety of HPV vaccines. Should the weight of the evidence from VAERS or VSD and other sources indicate a likely causal association between POF and HPV vaccines, appropriate action will be taken in terms of communication and public health response.”The College is posting this statement so that individuals considering the use of human papillomavirus vaccines could be made aware of these concerns pending further action by the regulatory agencies and manufacturers. While there is no strong evidence of a causal relationship between HPV4 and ovarian dysfunction, this information should be public knowledge for physicians and patients considering these vaccines.Primary author: Scott S.

https://www.snopes.com/texas-harvey-israel/	Did a City in Texas Require Harvey Aid Recipients to Promise Not to Boycott Israel?	true	['harvey', ' hurricane harvey', ' israel', ' israel boycott', ' texas']	https://www.texasmonthly.com/	https://www.texasmonthly.com/the-daily-post/dickinson-harvey-israel/	2017/10/24	8 CommentsQUOTE OF THE DAY“We understand your desire to attend our games as an escape and chosen form of entertainment. In that, we feel there is significant commonality in all of us that allows our community to be so special. That commonality should include aspirations for social justice, freedom of speech in its many forms, and equal opportunity for education and economic advancement regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation or religion.”—Manu Ginobili, in a tweet on Thursday, according to the San Antonio Express-News . Before Wednesday’s game, Spurs players—along with retired legends Tim Duncan and David Robinson—locked arms as the above message was displayed on screens inside the AT&T Center.BIG NEWSChris Gaspard helps remove ruined items from his friend Bryan Parson’s home brought on by flooding in the wake of Hurricane Harvey in Dickinson, Texas.Photo by Win McNamee/Getty ImagesBad DealThe city of Dickinson, in Galveston County, was among the hardest-hit places when Hurricane Harvey’s torrential rains slammed Texas . Residents now seeking Harvey relief face a strange ultimatum: agree not to boycott Israel, or your application for aid will be denied. According to the Houston Chronicle , the city’s hurricane repair grant application , which allows residents to apply for funds to help rebuild a home or business impacted by Hurricane Harvey, includes a surprising stipulation. “By executing this Agreement below, the Applicant verifies that the Applicant: (1) does not boycott Israel; and (2) will not boycott Israel during the term of this Agreement,” it states. The application has gotten the attention of the American Civil Liberties Union, which called the prohibition unconstitutional on Thursday. “The First Amendment protects Americans’ right to boycott, and the government cannot condition hurricane relief or any other public benefit on a commitment to refrain from protected political expression,” Andre Segura, the legal director of the ACLU of Texas, told the Chronicle. “Dickinson’s requirement is an egregious violation of the First Amendment, reminiscent of McCarthy-era loyalty oaths requiring Americans to disavow membership in the Communist party and other forms of ‘subversive’ activity.”MEANWHILE, IN TEXASReal TalkFormer President George W. Bush delivered a harshly worded speech on Thursday. He condemned the divisive actions of President Donald Trump , though he stopped short of actually calling out the president by name. “We’ve seen our discourse degraded by casual cruelty,” Bush said during a sixteen-minute address at “The Spirit of Liberty” event in New York, sponsored by his presidential center. “Bullying and prejudice in our public life sets a national tone and provides permission for cruelty and bigotry. The only way to pass along civic values is to first live up to them.” Bush said our political system has been corrupted by “conspiracy theories and outright fabrication,” and cautioned against the U.S. turning inward under Trump. “We’ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism, forgotten the dynamism that immigration has always brought to America,” Bush said. “We see a fading confidence in the value of free markets and international trade, forgetting that conflict, instability and poverty follow in the wake of protectionism. We’ve seen the return of isolationist sentiments, forgetting that American security is directly threatened by the chaos and despair of distant places.” He took aim at white supremacy too. “Our identity as a nation—unlike many other nations—is not determined by geography or ethnicity, by soil or blood,” Bush said. “This means that people of every race, religion, and ethnicity can be fully and equally American. It means that bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed.”On the BrinkThe Houston Astros face a must-win situation Friday night in game six of the American League Championship Series against the New York Yankees. If they win, they live another day, forcing a series-deciding game seven in Houston on Saturday. If they lose, their season is done. As ESPN notes, this is an unusual spot for the ‘Stros to be in. They’ve held onto first place in the American League West for 178 of 183 days during the regular season, every day since April 12, and they held a lead at the end of 25 of 36 innings in the previous round of the playoffs. Even in the ALCS, they were leading or tied through the series’s first nineteen innings, jumping out to a 2-0 series lead. On Friday, the team will turn to starting pitcher Justin Verlander, who dominated the Yankees in the second game of the series, striking out thirteen batters while allowing one run over nine spectacular innings. They’ll also have the support of their home crowd. “Our backs are against the wall,” catcher Brian McCann told ESPN. “We’ll be ready. This team, we’ve played extremely well all season long, and nothing’s going to change. We’ll be ready for game six. We’ve responded all year long.”Fast Food BeefWhataburger is typically considered the undisputed champ of the fast food scene here in Texas, but according to a new ranking by Business Insider , Texans actually prefer California-based chain In-N-Out. Yes, we know, this is truly a travesty. Business Insider’s methodology here is hardly scientific, as it relies solely the publication data from Foursquare, a social media app which lets users “check in” at certain locations, to determine which fast food restaurant was most popular in each state. “For the study, we looked at which chains received the most visits on average in every state based on the total number of visits to each chain divided by the number of locations in that state,” Business Insider wrote. Somehow, that research showed In-N-Out as the top choice among Texans. As the Houston Chronicle notes, In-N-Out only has 35 restaurants in Texas, while Whataburger has nearly 200 locations in the Houston area alone. We think Whataburger still has a leg up on In-N-Out, regardless of what Business Insider says.WHAT WE’RE READINGSome links are paywalled or subscription-only.Laura Bush will appear as a guest in the final season of Fixer Upper  Dallas Morning NewsAustin’s Richard Overton, the oldest living World War II veteran in the U.S., has new digs Austin American-StatesmanA Killeen ISD teacher duct-taped the mouths of ten fifth-graders Killeen Daily HeraldAmazon just opened a giant wind farm in Scurry County CNBCThe death of a pet dog gave a Texan woman “broken-heart syndrome” Washington PostGet Texas Monthly.

It’s why he calls his lab manager, Wade Sanders, “Walter,” after the show’s protagonist, Walter White.And like the famously pure and powerful blue meth White cooked up on Breaking Bad, the product produced by 710 Labs’ fancy equipment is extremely concentrated, powerful, and coveted: butane-extracted hash oil (BHO). The lab’s finished BHO might not look like much—a thin, hard, and shiny brown slab, like peanut brittle without the peanuts—but when a piece of this “shatter,” as it’s called, is placed on the nail of a specially designed pipe that’s been superheated by a blowtorch, it vaporizes and delivers a direct hit of 70 to 90 percent THC, three times the potency of the strongest marijuana strains. As Melshenker puts it, if smoking regular pot is like drinking a beer, “dabbing,” as this process is known, is a shot of hard liquor. Vice calls the result , “The smoothest slow-motion smack in the face of clean, serene stonedness that you’ve ever experienced.” Rolling Stone reports , “Your head spins, your eyes get fluttery, a few beads of sweat surface on your forehead and, suddenly, you're cosmically baked.” Some pot aficionados vow to never smoke the old way again.Gucci Earwax, a butane extraction, made by Mahatma Extreme Concentrates for Karmaceuticals in Denver. It won the first-place medical concentrate trophy at the High Times 2013 Denver U.S. Cannabis Cup.Courtesy of Ry Prichard/CannabisEncyclopedia.comHash, in other words, is no longer just a way to make use of leftover marijuana trim. It’s now becoming the main attraction. (Butane isn’t the only way to extract hash oil from marijuana, either; some concentrate-makers use carbon dioxide– or water-based extraction methods.) At Greenest Green , Melshenker’s Boulder dispensary, the inventory used to be 60 percent marijuana flower, 30 percent BHO, and 10 percent edibles. Now it’s the opposite: 60 percent BHO, 30 percent flower, and 10 percent edibles. And roughly 40 dispensaries statewide contract with 710 Labs to turn their marijuana into shatter or “budder,” a gloopier version. (Because of delays in Boulder’s regulation process, 710 Labs won’t be able to produce recreational BHO until Feb. 17.)AdvertisementHash oil is even fueling its own subculture. Forget 4:20; “dab heads” or “oil kids” light up at 7:10. (Turn the digits upside down and you have “OIL.”) Connoisseurs sport specially designed blowtorches and incredibly pricey “oil rig” pipes; a top-of-the-line rig from Melshenker’s Faulty Pelican glass company sets you back $14,000. There’s even dab gear, made by companies like Grassroots .“There’s a whole industry here,” says Melshenker, whose business card doubles as a stainless-steel dabber, the tool used to apply BHO to an oil rig’s superheated nail.A production process laden with volatile chemicals; a highly concentrated, easily transportable final product; incredibly stoned kids with blowtorches …Colorado’s thriving dabbing scene could just be one more bit of proof that the state is becoming a global mecca for marijuana. After all, the state’s legalized marijuana experiment has so far been an unqualified success. Despite the surprisingly limited number of recreational pot shops that opened their doors on Jan. 1—and the hefty crowds waiting in line to patronize them—the state hasn’t experienced widespread product shortages or weed prices high enough to trigger an Uber-style backlash . Yes, there was that story about 37 deadly marijuana overdoses on the first day of sales , but it turned out to be an obvious hoax. The few pundits who’ve complained about Colorado’s legalized pot, like David Brooks and Nancy Grace, have found their arguments blasted full of holes , not to mention lambasted on Saturday Night Live . The Justice Department is looking into ways to help banks play nice with marijuana businesses — a very serious problem —and even President Obama in a recent New Yorker profile conceded it’s important for the experiment to go forward .Soon enough, then, Colorado’s small-scale experiment should spread far and wide, with controversial drug laws getting the boot, millions of clandestine tokers coming out of the closet, and governments reaping the benefits in taxes and fees. That is unless something goes terribly wrong, derailing the whole legalization movement.AdvertisementSuch a gloomy outcome isn’t out of the question. The only reason that Colorado is enjoying fame as the first place to legalize pot is thanks to a combination of fortunate timing, plucky advocates, forward-thinking lawmakers, and a remarkable lack of snafus. Colorado’s 2012 legalization attempt very well could have floundered if the effort hadn’t enjoyed remarkably positive media coverage. Considering the precipitous rise of the state’s medical marijuana industry and lawmakers’ keen efforts to moderate it, all it could have taken was the right bad headline—a high-profile crime or a boneheaded political move—to set the endeavor back considerably. Recall that alcohol prohibition was built on the temperance movement’s carefully crafted tales of woe and violence. As Salvation Army Commander Evangeline Booth once put it :Drink has drained more blood …Dishonored more womanhood,Blasted more lives,Driven more to suicide, andDug more graves than any other poisoned scourge that ever swept its death-dealing waves across the world.Mixed shatter slab by TC Labs. The product is broken prior to packaging to fit into the 1 gram or less packaging requirements.Courtesy of Ry Prichard/CannabisEncyclopedia.comIn Colorado, however, there have been very few sordid marijuana tales that could be used to demonize the drug—so far. Weed-fueled horror stories could still emerge in the state—and with the world watching, such calamities could have an international impact. So what are the biggest potential risks? A major concern is diversion, taking Colorado’s legal pot and offloading it to the black market or selling it out of state. While Colorado has established an extensive tracking system to prevent this from happening, there will always be tourists trying to take home a pot-infused souvenir. Beyond diversion, there’s the menace of crime—not just the threat of burglaries and organized crime in a largely cash-based industry, but also the distant possibility of banks or other financial institutions getting slapped with federal money laundering charges if they accept any of that free-flowing marijuana cash. Finally, there’s the prospective collateral damage, such as kids accidentally eating pot brownies— something that’s already in the news —or a violent pot-related car crash.If any of these calamities do occur, Colorado’s red-hot dabbing scene could in fact be the source of the problem. Dabbing certainly appears on the surface to be dangerous: Kids are freebasing marijuana! It looks like they’re smoking crack! But it’s important to remember that there’s no evidence that it’s possible to overdose on pot. (Compared to say, acetaminophen, overdoses of which killed more than 1,500 Americans during the past decade.) So you can smoke the strongest dab imaginable—or even, if you’re a showboat, smoke 50 dabs in a row —and science says it won’t kill you. It will just get you really, really high.Mars OG ISO dab, an isopropyl alcohol extraction made by Pink House Labs in Denver.Courtesy of Ry Prichard/CannabisEncyclopedia.comAdvertisementBut just because something won’t poison you the way alcohol can doesn’t mean it can’t lead you to do something stupid enough that will kill you. And there seem to be enough disconcerting variables associated with dabbing culture—a production process laden with volatile chemicals; a highly concentrated, easily transportable final product; and incredibly stoned kids with blowtorches—it seems only a matter of time until somebody in the scene does something very stupid and possibly fatal.Yes, dabbing might not be as inherently dangerous as, say, a bar full of binge-drinkers. But it’s important to remember that recreational marijuana isn’t necessarily replacing alcohol use—it’s just adding a new legal vice to the options people already have. While some researchers predict legalized marijuana will decrease alcohol use , others predict it could lead to “heavy drinking” and “carnage on our highways.” So will folks really reach for a dabbing pipe instead of a shot glass—or will they reach for both?Top CommentNobody tell these fellows about vaporizers. They're going to worry about them detonating the atmosphere, or causing glaciers to melt, or something.   More...-J P McMahonJoin InQuestions like this have led California and Washington to outlaw the production of smokeable marijuana concentrates. Colorado, however, has gone the opposite route: In November it released a draft of proposed concentrate production rules , positioning itself to become the only place in the world where marijuana concentrate production is both legal and regulated. The idea is to police the blooming subculture, to stay on top of it, so it ends up more akin to tattooing than meth. “If we outlaw concentrates, people will make them in their basements and blow themselves up,” says Norton Arbelaez, co-owner of the Denver dispensary RiverRock Wellness , which operates a concentrate production facility. But just because a concentrate extraction system is certified by a third-party industrial hygienist, as will likely be required by Colorado’s concentrate rules, doesn’t mean that system can’t still accidentally blow up.It makes sense that Colorado is at the vanguard of legalized dabbing. It’s made a habit of taking risks when it comes to marijuana. Colorado can’t regulate away the chance that dabbing or some other marijuana-related endeavor will lead to a spectacular accident, either industrial or personal. But so far its legalization effort has taken pains to thoughtfully minimize such risks—and so far, it’s working.

Center for Biological DiversityThis story was updated at 6:33 p.m. EST.Looking for some Trump wine for the holiday?Head no farther than Shenandoah National Park, where you can pick it up at the Skyland Resort.That's according to Bill Snape, senior counsel at the Center for Biological Diversity, who wants to get to the bottom of why it's sold there.""Even as we sit down for Thanksgiving dinner on Thursday, Trump wine is everywhere — how?"" Snape said in an interview today.AdvertisementHoping to find answers, Snape filed a request under the federal Freedom of Information Act, asking the National Park Service to provide records regarding the sale of wine and other alcoholic beverages at Shenandoah and other national parks.The request also asks NPS to produce any records or documents that mention Trump, his family members or Trump merchandise.Snape said the discovery of the wine at Shenandoah was first made by one of the center's members, who took photos of the bottles but wants to remain anonymous.""She just stumbled across it and obviously got a little fired up and upset. I checked it out and confirmed it,"" Snape said.Snape added that the issue raises more questions on the extent to which Trump's role as commander in chief collides with his role ""as chief of the Trump empire ... with no understanding of where it begins and where it ends.""""If this is the level of Trumpism at national parks, what other policy issues have that level of Trumpism?"" Snape said. ""It just raises a number of disturbing and intriguing conflict-of-interest issues.""Jeremy Barnum, spokesman for the National Park Service, said the wine is not being sold by Shenandoah National Park, but rather by Delaware North Cos. Inc., the park's licensed concessioner.""The National Park Service authorizes concessioners to sell categories of retail goods and products like t-shirts, baseball hats, and in this case wine. However, the NPS does not specify what brands of these products should be sold,"" Barnum said. ""The concessioner has been selling wine from the distributor of this particular winery in Virginia for years."""

She'll then lie waiting for her cubs to be born as winter sets in.""Image caption Sir David travelled to both polar regions with the film crewLater, the film cuts to a mountainside: ""On lee-side slopes beneath the snow, new lives are beginning,"" Sir David narrates.Footage of the newborn cubs filmed at the animal park is then screened.The den was actually created by humans before the polar bear entered.The BBC said the narration ""talked in general about polar bears in the wild rather than the specific cubs shown"".In the online clip, posted on 7 November  - before the episode in question was broadcast - producer Kathryn Jeffs explains: ""The problem for us is that they (the polar bears) do it (give birth) underneath the snow in these dens of ice, and there's absolutely no way that we could get our cameras down there.""It would be completely impractical and you wouldn't want to disturb the polar bears by getting that close,"" she added.The BBC programme features 10-minute segments at the end of each episode explaining how film crews got up close to the wildlife, but the polar bear cub footage was not included here.Media regulator Ofcom said they have received ""fewer than a handful"" of complaints about Frozen Planet.The organisation will now decide whether they will investigate further or it is a matter for the BBC Trust."

I have been in ministry for 13 years. 2) I most identify with the Apostle Paul. I was completely against Jesus at one point in my life, even making fun of His followers.  When Jesus saved me by His grace, I became a person who cannot remain silent about His great love. 3) There are so many things that make Greenwell Springs awesome. The music, the preaching, the activities, and the food are all incredible. However, from my very first day walking into Greenwell Springs, the love and fellowship from the people has been amazing.  My favorite aspect would have to be just being in fellowship with the believers here. 4) The best thing about my area of ministry with students has to be the opportunity I am given to teach the Bible. The students of our day are attacked daily with teachings and culture that go against the Word of God. In return our students are not sure what they believe, and they have so many questions. I am blessed to have a chance to help them find the answers that always lead to God. 5) Sulley from Monsters Inc. always makes me think of myself.  Looks tough on the outside but on the inside he is a softy. 6) I love to travel and I have been many places in the world. So far the main place that I would love to visit again is Hawaii. It was so beautiful there. 7) If I’m not at Greenwell Springs during the day I am mostly likely at a school somewhere hanging out with the students. In the evenings I spend a lot of time either with my family or at the gym training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. 
https://www.snopes.com/hillary-bill-clinton-russia-sanctions-speech/	Did Hillary Clinton Side With Kremlin on Sanctions Due to a $500,000 Payment to Bill?	unproven	['dnc hack', ' donald trump', ' fox news', ' hillary clinton', ' magnitsky act', ' russia investigation', ' sanctions', ' sergei magnitsky', ' wikileaks']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/hRd2u	2017/07/20	Now PlayingEmails show Bill Clinton paid thousands for speech in RussiaThe Russian lawyer who landed a meeting with Donald Trump Jr. during last year’s presidential campaign with the promise of dirt on Hillary Clinton had one big thing in common with the Democratic candidate: Both had opposed Russia sanctions targeting human-rights abusers. Further, former Secretary of State Clinton’s initial opposition coincided with a $500,000 speech her husband gave in Moscow – a link her 2016 campaign fought to downplay in the press, according to WikiLeaks-released documents.Trump White House officials now are trying to draw attention to that speech and the Clintons’ ties to Russia in a bid to counter criticism over Trump Jr.’s now-infamous meeting. “If you want to talk about having relationships with Russia, I'd look no further than the Clintons,” Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a briefing last week. “Bill Clinton was paid half a million dollars to give a speech to a Russian bank, personally thanked by President Putin.”“With the help of the research team, we killed a Bloomberg story trying to link HRC’s opposition to the Magnitsky bill a $500,000 speech that WJC gave in Moscow.”- May, 2015 email from Clinton campaign stafferThe former president indeed had received a personal call from then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin expressing his appreciation for the speech. According to Mrs. Clinton’s ethics disclosure form filed while she was secretary of State, Bill Clinton was paid $500,000 by the Russia-based finance company Renaissance Capital for his June 29, 2010, speech in Moscow to its employees and guests attending the company's annual conference. The speech is now coming back to haunt the Clintons, considering the company that cut the check was allegedly tied to the scandal that spurred the Global Magnitsky Act, a bill that imposed sanctions on Russians designated as human-rights abusers and eventually would become law in 2012.Related ImageExpand / CollapseFormer President Bill Clinton with his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton  (AP)This was the same law Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya was lobbying against during her sit-down with Trump Jr. last year. And back in 2010, it would have put the Clintons on her side. Shortly before Bill Clinton’s speech in 2010, when members of Congress pushing the sanctions bill had asked Hillary Clinton to refuse visas to Russian officials implicated under the policy, the State Department denied the request. The Obama administration initially was opposed to the Magnitsky Act because then-President Barack Obama was seeking a “reset” with Russia and did not want to deepen the divide between the two countries.Former President Bill Clinton’s speech to Renaissance just weeks later was all the more curious, considering Renaissance’s Russian investment bank executives would have been banned from the U.S. under the law. Fast-forward to 2015, and the timeline apparently had caught the attention of Bloomberg News. Related ImageExpand / CollapsePortrait of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky held by his mother Nataliya Magnitskaya during 2009 press conference in Moscow.  (The Associated Press)According to a memo from Clinton’s presidential campaign team later published by WikiLeaks , however, the Clinton campaign was able to stop the presses.“With the help of the research team, we killed a Bloomberg story trying to link HRC’s opposition to the Magnitsky bill a $500,000 speech that WJC gave in Moscow,” Jesse Lehrich, on the Rapid Response Communications team for Hillary For America, boasted on May 21, 2015. The Global Magnitsky Act was named for 36-year-old tax attorney Sergei Magnitsky, who died in the custody of the Russian government after accusing the government and organized crime of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from a foreign company, Hermitage Capital Management. Magnitsky, hired by foreign investor and Hermitage owner William Browder, had tracked what turned out to be hundreds of millions of dollars in tax fraud. He reported the fraud to the Russian authorities, but instead of pursuing charges against the alleged offender, Russian authorities jailed Magnitsky.After Magnitsky died in November 2009, Browder said Magnitsky proved Renaissance officials were among those orchestrating the scheme. The State Department finally reversed its position in 2011 and refused visas to some Russians purportedly involved in the financial fraud seeking to enter the country.The Magnitsky Act passed with bipartisan support in 2012.Russia retaliated against the U.S., ending any possibility for Americans to adopt Russian orphans and also banning 18 U.S. officials from entering their country.Malia Zimmerman is an award-winning investigative reporter focusing on crime, homeland security, illegal immigration crime, terrorism and political corruption.

That decision, to play both sides and continue the divisiveness of Barack Obama, has now cost them dearly.Nike, the largest athletic company and number one sponsor of professional sports in the world, has canceled all dealings with the Dallas Cowboys. Company CEO Isaac P. Freely told Fox Sports:“To come out on the field and kneel to thugs and criminals just before saluting the flag was a reprehensible move our company won’t easily forgive. The Dallas Cowboys are no longer licensed to wear, display or sell merchandise with the Nike name or logo on it.”Owner Jerry Jones says he will fight the move, stating that he was showing his players that he was with them but still managed to see that every one of them stood for the National Anthem.Sorry, Jerry, but it isn’t about the National Anthem anymore, it’s about respect. Those people should just take their “protests” to places where they’re welcome.Share This As American As Apple Pie Article Now!11.9k

The houses nearby are emptied of the living. The victims symptoms are consistent with sarin, the nerve agent that was dropped on an opposition-held area near Damascus in 2013, killing more than 1,000 people. After that attack the regime supposedly gave up its chemical weapons arsenal.Moscow, Bashar al-Assads principal backer in the war, said the Syrian government had bombed a rebel-run toxic gas manufacturing plant in Khan Sheikhun, and that the gas had subsequently leaked out.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   A label marks the site of the attack. Photograph: Kareem Shaheen for the GuardianThe Guardian, the first western media organisation to visit the site of the attack, examined a warehouse and silos directly next to where the missile had landed, and found nothing but an abandoned space covered in dust and half-destroyed silos reeking of leftover grain and animal manure.Residents said the silos had been damaged in air raids six months ago, and had stood unused since then. You can look at it ; theres nothing there except maybe some grain and animal dung, and theres even a dead goat there that suffocated in the attack, one person said. Residents responded in disbelief to the Russian allegation.There was no evidence of any building being hit in recent days or weeks near where so many people were killed and wounded by a nerve agent. The homes across the street appeared undamaged from the outside. There was no contamination zone near any building. Instead, the contamination area radiated from a hole in a road.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   The warehouse next to where the missile landed  now an abandoned space covered in dust. Photograph: Kareem Shaheen for the GuardianThe Guardian interviewed witnesses, first responders, victims relatives and the wounded in an effort to reconstruct the attack. They offered fresh details that shed light on an incident that has prompted worldwide condemnation and refocused attention on the brutality of the Syrian war. It was like Judgment Day, said Hamid Khutainy, a civil defence volunteer in Khan Sheikhun.Witnesses said the air raids began shortly after 6.30am on Tuesday, with four bombings around the town. Initially they thought it was just another airstrike, until the first responders who arrived at the scene began falling to the ground.Khutainy said: They told us HQ, we are losing control. We had no idea what they were trying to say. Then they said, come save us, we can no longer walk. So the second and third teams went with just face masks. We could smell it from 500 metres away.People described a scene of utter horror at the attack site . The wounded were shaking and convulsing on the ground, foaming at the mouth, their lips blue, passing in and out of consciousness.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Dozens die in suspected chemical attack in Syria  video reportI found children lying on the ground, in their last breaths, their lips going blue, said Abu al-Baraa, who lives nearby and rushed to help when the full extent of what had happened dawned on him. Standing across the street from the crater left by the missile, he added: People on the rooftops and in the basements. People on the ground in the street. Wherever you looked there were dead human beings.Idlib mapThe suffocating patients and those who had died were taken to the nearby civil defence centre and the adjacent clinic built into the side of a rocky mountainous outcrop to withstand potential airstrikes. The dead were laid in a nearby shed while emergency workers hosed down the injured with water, and administered atropine, a nerve agent antidote.But while medical workers were trying to come to grips with the crisis, between eight and 10 airstrikes targeted the medical facility and civil defence centre. The shed collapsed on the dead, and the site was put out of service.Maybe the pilots heard the myth that you could come back to life 48 hours after dying from sarin, so they decided to bomb them again just in case, said an official from the Ahrar al-Sham rebel group who was on the scene. Thank God there is a Day of Judgment in the afterlife.The Guardian visited the destroyed medical facility and civil defence centre briefly. Local people said reconnaissance planes had been spotted in the sky earlier and believed the area might be targeted again later in the day. The site was filled with rubble. Inside, hospital equipment, beds, surgical instruments and small boxes of medicine lay covered in dust or broken on the ground. There were no weapons in sight, and the rooms inside the cave were darkened with the electricity knocked out.Putin stands by Assad as firm evidence of chemical attack mounts Read moreIn a nearby cemetery, the graves were still fresh from funerals the day before, the red soil still upturned. In one corner 18 new graves were set up, the names barely etched with a rough chisel on the tombstones. They contained the bodies of 20 people, including two children who were buried with their mother. They were all from the same family.Abdulhamid al-Yousef, one of the few survivors in the family, was receiving condolences at his home in Khan Sheikhun, a day after burying his wife and nine-month-old twins, Ahmed and Aya, fighting back tears.Yousef had rushed to help the other victims of the attack. He came back instead to find that much of his family had perished, including siblings, nephews and nieces. His wife and children had rushed down to the bomb shelter in their basement, only for the toxic gas to seep into it, which killed them all.That evening at the cemetery, he insisted on carrying his two infants in his arms to bury them himself. Almost in a trance Yousef repeated the childrens names, choking as he did so. Aya and Ahmed, my souls. Yasser and Ahmed, my brothers who had my back. Ammoura and Hammoudi, Shaimaa, so many others, he said.TopicsSyriaMiddle East and North AfricaBashar al-AssadnewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content'

Introduction""For several months, our nurses have been baffled to find a dead patient in  the same bed every Friday morning"" a spokeswoman for the Pelonomi Hospital  (Free State, South Africa) told reporters. ""There was no apparent cause for  any of the deaths, and extensive checks on the air conditioning system, and a search for possible bacterial infection, failed to reveal any clues.""""However, further inquiries have now revealed the cause of these deaths.  It seems that every Friday morning a cleaner would enter the ward, remove the plug that powered the patient's life support system, plug her floor polisher into the vacant socket, then go about her business. When she had finished her chores, she would plug the life support machine back in and leave, unaware that the patient was now dead. She could not, after all, hear the screams and eventual death rattle over the whirring of her polisher.""We are sorry, and have sent a strong letter to the cleaner in question. Further, the Free State Health and Welfare Department is arranging for an electrician to fit an extra socket, so there should be no repetition of this incident. The enquiry is now closed.""from (Cape Times, 6/13/96)BTW, the headline of the newspaper story was, ""Cleaner Polishes Off Patients.""This is the way the world was introduced, in July 1996, to the story of South Africa's most careless cleaner. There was little reason to disbelieve the tale, as it not only cited a credible source (the Cape Times) and a date of appearance, but also quoted officials confirming the tale quite categorically, even down to the wonderful detail of an electrician fitting an extra socket.Problem one: the story as it appeared throughout the world bore little resemblance to the original Cape Times story, and the original Cape Times story bore little resemblance to the story's first mention in print.Problem two: life support systems not only have battery backups, but include alarm systems to alert staff if anything goes wrong, as well as monitoring equipment that would reveal an interruption in the information flow.2. So what are you saying: this never happened?No; I'm saying that there is no evidence it ever happened. I'm also saying that it is an urban legend, believed by many people around the world, including newspaper editors, who are contributing to its further spread.3. But newspapers require evidence before they report such things, don't they?No; they require a credible source, which is not quite the same thing.4. So what was the source of this story?For most news media that carried it, the Cape Times report was regarded as sufficiently credible source, as it is a highly reputable and respected newspaper.5. But you say they didn't report the Cape Times version of the story. How was their version different from the one above?This is how the story ran on page 1 of the Cape Times on June 13 1996:Cleaner polishes off patientBy Lindiz van ZillaBLOEMFONTEIN: Health authorities  are investigating a series of deaths of patients who all died mysteriously in the same hospital bed over a period of several weeks.Staff at the Pelonomi Hospital here were baffled when each Friday, they would come across another dead patient. Checks on the air-conditioning system and the position of the bed in relation to the windows failed to provide any clues about the deaths, which occurred two years ago.The ""killer disease"" was uncovered when staff came across a cleaner who had unknowingly unplugged the life-support system to plug in her floor polisher. Every Friday she would enter the ward, plus her polisher into the socket meant for the life-support system and calmly go about her business.Upon completing her chores she would reconnect the life-support system, leaving no trace as to the cause of the patient's death.Despite reports of several deaths in this way, only one is being investigated by the Free State Health and Welfare Department.A hospital spokesperson said he did not know about the incident.6. That sounds vaguely conclusive. But it doesn't quite hang together, does it?That's partly because of space constraints that force most South African newspapers to compress stories that they do not consider of vital importance. In this case, one key sentence was left out of the original report. It went like this:Yesterday, a department [of Health and Welfare] spokesman, Mr Victor Litlhakanyane, said: ""Hospital staff haven't yet confirmed the incident, and we are still investigating it.""Combined with a hospital spokesperson not knowing of the incident, it would have set alarm bells ringing. With that little detail, it becomes clear that the rest of the story, at that stage, remained in the realm of rumour, speculation and hearsay.7. Whoa! That's a pretty detailed story for mere speculation. On the other hand, it's still frustratingly vague. Could it be that the Cape Times picked it up from another source, and then merely made a few phone calls to confirm that it hadn't been made up by a rival source?It could be, and it is the way it happened. The Cape Times' deputy news editor, Sybrand Mostert, spotted the story in Cape Town's Afrikaans-language daily newspaper, Die Burger (literally, ""The Citizen""). The story went like this (as found in Die Burger's online archive ):Page 811 June 1996Pasient sterf glo na werker masjien uitpropBLOEMFONTEIN. Familie van 'n pasient wat in een van die waaksale van die Pelonomi Hospitaal hier gesterf het nadat 'n skoonmaker glo die masjiene wat die pasient aan die lewe moes hou, uitgeprop het, word versoek om na vore te kom. Die skoonmaker het glo die kragprop van haar vloerpoleerder by die muursok ingeprop.Dr. Craig Househam, Vrystaatse adjunk-direkteur-generaal van Gesondheid en Welsyn, het gese hy weet van die voorval van meer as 2 jaar gelede. Hy kon nie se of tugstappe teen die werker gedoen en of die familie van die pasient in die beweerde voorval vergoeding ontvang het nie.Aanvanklike gerugte het gelui meer as een pasient is binne 'n paar agtereenvolgende weke elke Vrydag in dieselfde bed oorlede. Toe personeel begin onraad vermoed, het hulle op die werker afgekom wat Vrydae haar vloerpoleerder inprop by die muursok wat vir die lewensnoodsaaklike masjiene bedoel is.Translation:Patient believed to have died after worker unplugged machineBloemfontein: Family of a patient who died in one of the intensive care wards of the Pelonomi Hospital after a cleaner is understood to have unplugged the life support machine, have been requested to come forward. The cleaner presumably plugged her floor polisher into the wall power socket.Dr Craig Househam, the Free State's deputy director general of Health and Welfare, said he had known about the incident for the past two years. He could not say whether disciplinary steps had been taken against the cleaner or whether the family of the patient in the alleged incident had received any compensation.Initial rumours suggested that more than one patient had died in the same bed every Friday for consecutive weeks. When staff began suspecting something amiss, they discovered the worker who, every Friday, plugged her floor polisher into the wall socket intended for the life support machine.Keep an eye on two key phrase there: aanvankilike gerugte"" and ""beweerde voorval"", which I've translated as ""initial rumours"" and ""alleged incident"".It was assumed at the Cape Times that Die Burger had picked up the story from its sister newspaper in Bloemfontein, Die Volksblad, the only daily newspaper serving the whole Free State province. According to Judith Soal, one of the most Internet-savvy sub-editors (that's the South African equivalent of a copy editor) at the Cape Times, Mostert ""found it interesting, wasn't sure whether or not to believe it, decided to put a reporter on it"".8. So what did the reporter find? Did he speak to Die Volksblad? And did he believe the story?""I never got around to speaking to anyone at the Volksblad,"" Lindiz van Zilla advised me by e-mail. ""I did however phone Pelonomi Hospital and spoke to a medical superintendent on duty who informed me of the ongoing investigation. The hospital did not indicate any knowledge of unusual deaths, but said they too had become aware of rumours - they were basing their investigation on these rumours... I personally don't believe the story - a 'genuine' urban legend.""9. The Cape Times couldn't have been too charmed. Did they then just decide to run with the story and forget about the facts?A part-time sub-editor, who does not want to be named, edited the story. He wasn't sure whether to believe it or not, but was told that it had been discussed and the decision had been made to use it.Judith takes up the story, although she wasn't on duty that night:""I think what made them decide to run it was that the hospital had said it was investigating, giving some credibility to the story... The story was much discussed, and it was decided to run it as a lightish thing, not shock horror, because it couldn't be verified... we gave it a fair amount of prominence because of the newsworthiness of the fact that such a story had got so far, and the bizzareness of it all. The original headline was quite straight - along the lines of 'xx die in hospital', and the revise sub [the senior copy editor who makes final revisions of sub-editors' work] changed it.The revise sub, Don Mallett, takes up the story:""Actually I didn't sub or revise the story. However, I did hear my colleagues discussing it and I read it. When I heard someone sing out a headline about it later, I suggested the headline that eventually appeared. Someone else suggested something about ""patients being unplugged"" and the night editor asked the subs' room which we should use and they went for mine.""I realised fully that the headline was insensitive and in poor taste, but felt this would be considerably cushioned by the facts that the story was a couple of years old, no patients or families were identified, and anyone affected would be far from the Cape Times area of circulation.""Judith continues: ""The weird thing is that Pam, another sub here, was sent an e-mail weeks later, with a much-changed version of the story, but the original Cape Times headline.""10. Did Pam get the version I think she did?Yep, word for word as recorded at the beginning of this document. Pam Sykes sent me a copy of the e-mail, which she had received at the beginning of August, from a contact in Montana, USA. By that time, obviously, it was already feverishly circulating on the Internet. At the time of writing this FAQ, the version circulating on the Internet remains word-for-word identical to the first modified version Pam received.11. Okay, so that's how the Cape Times got the blame. Or is it? How did the story change so dramatically?That is the first structural evidence that it is an urban legend. The attribution of spurious quotes to unnamed authorities, the radical transformation of the story in its re-telling, and then the rapid spread of the story as a result of its shock appeal, are all classic hallmarks of urban legend proliferation. It is impossible to trace the moment of transformation unless the individual responsible for the rewriting confesses.12. How could other media fall for the rewritten story? It even looks made up, aside from the Cape Times reference.That reference was crucial. It was responsible for the next step up the ladder of credibility, when it came to the attention of John Hoyland, editor of the lighthearted Feedback column in the respected British popular science magazine New Scientist . He checked with the Cape Times, first speaking to an archivist, and ""she was very emphatic the story was true"". So he ran the story in Feedback - except that it was the Internet-modified version of the tale. For the sake of completeness, this is how it looked when it left his computer:SOME readers may already have seen this story, which appeared originally in South Africa's Cape Times this summer, and is apparently true. We are passing it on for the unenlightened so that they may reflect on the fickleness of the hand of fate that shapes our destinies.""For several months, our nurses have been baffled to find a dead patient in the same bed every Friday morning,"" a spokeswoman for the Pelonomi Hospital (Free State, South Africa) told reporters. ""There was no apparent cause for any of the deaths, and extensive checks on the air conditioning system, and a search for possible bacterial infection, failed to reveal any clues.""However, further inquiries have now revealed the cause of these deaths. It seems that every Friday morning, a cleaner would enter the ward, remove the plug that powered the patient's life support system, plug her floor polisher into the vacant socket, then go about her business. When she had finished her chores, she would plug the life support machine back in and leave, unaware that the patient was now dead. She could not, after all, hear the screams and eventual death rattle over the whirring of her polisher.""We are sorry, and have sent a strong letter to the cleaner in question. Further, the Free State Health and Welfare Department is arranging for an electrician to fit an extra socket, so there should be no repetition of this incident.""The inquiry is now closed.""Says John: ""Apart from the intro, it's word for word what we got off the Net. The reason for saying 'some readers may have already seen this story' is that the story was apparently run earlier in Private Eye magazine, though I never saw it.""Since then, he says, a colleague had talked to the Cape Times again and, once more, they had ""confirmed"" the story - but this time faxed their original article to New Scientist. And lo and behold, it was a rather different story, at least in terms of attributions and confirmations.""I don't mind admitting that I've been had,"" says John, who cooperated warmly in the construction of this FAQ.12. But he didn't start it, did he? You mentioned Die Volksblad - what does that mean, for starters? And did they run the story first? And has anyone confessed to being the original perpetrator?No, the People's Paper, yes, and yes. One of the people of the people's paper is an investigative journalist who was then their medical correspondent, Andreij Horn. On 11 June 1996, his name appeared under the headline:Inligting gesoek oor gerug dat pasient dood is weens skoonmaker se optredeTranslation:Information sought regarding rumour that patient died due to cleaner's actionsNow that doesn't have quite the same ring as ""Cleaner polishes off patients"", but then Die Volksblad had good reason to play this one low key. The story ran like this (original Afrikaans version is available - note that the simultaneous version from Die Burger was obviously lifted from here, and note too the subtle differences between the opening paragraphs, that gave the version from Die Burger an edge of added credibility and removed the powerful shadow of doubt that hangs over the original version):Family of a patient who died in one of the intensive care wards of the Pelonomi Hospital after a cleaner is understood to have unplugged the life support machine, have been requested to come forward. The cleaner allegedly plugged her floor polisher into the wall power socket.Dr Craig Househam, the Free State's deputy director general of Health and Welfare, had earlier told Die Volksblad he knew about the incident, but that it had happened two-and-a-half years ago, and that Die Volksblad had already reported it.He could not say whether disciplinary steps had been taken against the cleaner or whether the family of the patient in the alleged incident had received any compensation. He first wanted to consult the records, since it had happened under the previous management.Die Volksblad could find no reference to the alleged incident in its own records.This follows repeated tip-offs from various sources over the past month that such an incident had in fact taken place at Pelonomi, and had been hushed up. Initial rumours suggested that more than one patient died in the same bed every Friday in consecutive weeks. When staff began suspecting something amiss, they discovered the worker who, every Friday, plugged her floor polisher into the wall socket intended for the life support machine.Yesterday the Department said that no record of such an incident could be traced. Ms Elke Grobler, public relations officer of the department, said the department knew that such rumours were doing the rounds.""The department requests the family of the patient that allegedly died, or anyone who knew something about this, to come forward, so that the allegations can be properly investigated.""Anyone with information can phone the department on (051) 405-4818.The word ""allegedly"" in the second sentence is translated from the Afrikaans phrase ""na bewering"", which Die Volksblad used in its report. Die Burger changed the word to ""glo"", which is a far softer word for ""allegedly"" and is closer to ""believed to have"" or ""presumed to have"", which removes the slight edge of incredulity that ""allegedly"" imparts to the story. In the eyes of health authorities, however, the story is identical, and they would have had no reason to reject the subsequent interpretation by Die Burger when approached by the Cape Times.13. There's a real, live phone number in there somewhere. Did anyone then phone the Department with more information?No.14. You don't think I'm just going to leave it at that, do you? What about the reporter who started the whole thing?Andreij Horn? Definitely the hero in this epic drama. Not least because he was willing and ready to expand on his role. Had the Department of Health and Welfare not made a specific appeal to the public, he says, he would have dropped the story. It was obvious, he says, that it was an urban legend. Had anyone bothered to ask him, it would never have reached the stage where the world demanded a FAQ. He is extremely happy to recount his role, however, and is most polite about the whole fuss. In a telephonic interview from Bloemfontein on November 12 1996, he said (translated from Afrikaans):""When I first came across these rumours, I thought to myself this looks exactly like an urban legend. I approached the report from the point of view that it was an urban legend, but then the department said that, while they had no information about the incident, they wanted to hear from people who did. Nothing came of their appeal, but that was the angle that resulted in it becoming a worldwide urban legend.""In investigating the story, I went to the top - the Department of Health and Welfare. I did not contact the hospital, because that is not the way the channels work here. The hospital is required to report any unusual incidents. If someone died under such circumstances, a judicial hearing would have to be held.""Even if there had been a conspiracy to hush it up, it is such a sensational story that it could never in a million years be kept quiet. I have no doubt in my mind that, if the department has no record of an investigation into possible malpractice, it is an urban legend.""To tell the truth, it was the department's commitment to transparency [an open approach] that gave momentum to the urban legend. They could have dismissed it as a fairy tale, but were prepared to allow the public to assist with the investigation. Had they not done that, my report would never have appeared. The fact that they took it semi-seriously gave momentum to the spread of the urban legend.""Horn then kindly faxed through a copy of the original story.15. But where did he get the story? How long had it been around before he wrote about it? Where did the whole thing start?Sheesh. It's expensive phoning Bloemfontein all the time with your suspicions. Okay then, this was from a follow-up interview on November 13 1996:""We had been receiving calls for quite some time, I'd say two to three months, from people who asked us why we didn't write about this incident that they had heard happened at Pelonomi Hospital. When it reached my news editor for the second or third time, he said it might be worthwhile investigating the matter. Dr Househam was a classic example of how the story developed in people's heads: he had it in the back of his mind that it had happened more than two years ago, but during the previous administration, so he had no personal knowledge about it, and he thought he had read about it in Die Volksblad.""You have to understand here that Die Volksblad is the most important news and information source in the Free State, and when people think they knew about something because they read it in the newspaper - the way people often retell urban legends - then in the Free State they assume they read it in Die Volksblad.""We went to great lengths to try to track down a report of such an incident in our newspaper. All our stories are pasted on pages, which we went through carefully, and we have a card reference system that includes every story that has appeared in the paper since 1954. If it wasn't in that system, then it definitely had not appeared in our newspaper.""I would estimate that I heard my first version of the story about three months before I wrote the report. I should have reacted sooner, but it was such an unlikely story to me, that I had no faith in the rumour whatsoever. Every version was precisely the same, except for the number of patients that had died. Sometimes it was just one, in other versions people said it had carried on for weeks, and in others up to 14 people had died. The more the bodies, the more indignant people were about how many people had to die before the authorities realised there was a problem.""I cannot imagine such a thing happening in a South African hospital  - that people can die in such a fixed pattern without the authorities investigating - no matter how cynical we become about the possible lowering of standards. It simply does not make sense. And I must add that the fact that the Free State health authorities were so willing to respond instantly was an indication to me of how seriously they take their responsibilities and their image. They are extremely conscientious.""16. Okay, I buy it. We're talking urban legend. But does it behave like other urban legends? Are there variations on this theme? Aside from the different versions of the Pelonomi tale? Are their regional variations, for instance?Sure there are.During August 1996 it took on another necessary characteristics of an urban legend (no, they didn't lynch the cleaning lady). Firstly, the story was told by a caller to the Johannesburg-based radio station 702 as having happened at Baragwanath Hospital (listed in the 1997 Guinness Book of Records as the largest hospital in the world) near Soweto. Ironically and tragically, life imitated UL a few weeks later when two babies died at Baragwanath after a power failure during which the emergency generators also failed due to running out of fuel - but this was the subject of a high-level investigation, officially confirmed, and is not an urban legend.Secondly, in subsequent weeks I heard the story told as word-of-mouth, but having happened at the Johannesburg Hospital. It seems, however, that the Pelonomi version then took a firm grip on the public consciousness - partly thanks to the Internet - and all subsequent versions reverted to the original tale from Bloemfontein.17. So it's an authentic, indigenous South African urban legend?I didn't say that. It is likely that it has been around for decades. Take, for instance, this posting from Christopher Becke to the alt.folklore.urban newsgroup on November 11 1996:On HBO on Sunday morning was a movie starring George Wendt (of Cheers Fame) in some sort of Teacher role.  The movie was called Plain Clothes (1988). In it, one of the characters is telling the other about the untimely demise of the husband (or was it the father) of another character. Apparently, the gentleman was hooked up in an iron lung, and the cleaning woman knocked out the plug with the vacuum cleaner. Although it wasn't a case of unplugging the one to plug in the other, I thought it may have provided a source for the now famous UL.18. Ha! We've found the true origin! Haven't we?Afraid not. I've been told that the story was circulating in Wales in the early 1980s. It is also used as an example in debates among Jewish religious scholars about the acceptability of taking people off life support and allowing them to die naturally. The broadly accepted view is that, while one is not obliged to place someone on life support and can allow them to die naturally if there is little hope of saving them, the picture changes once someone is actually on life support.According to the argument, it is unacceptable for any human being to cut off the life support machine - intentionally - regardless of how hopeless the situation may be, since a decision to end a life may only be taken by God. However, and this is exactly as it was put to me by one scholar, should ""a cleaner accidentally unplug the machine to plug in a cleaning machine, you are not obliged to switch the machine back on again"". Of course, this is a completely theoretical argument, as many of these theological arguments are, and the example is used merely to advance a hypothesis.It is even possible that such hypothetical debates may have sparked the legend, but I have no evidence for that, either.19.

Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Friday that he discovered Friday that it fell to him to shut down the government — “which is kind of cool.”Welcome to the whatever shutdown.The attitude permeating the Trump administration reflects, to some degree, the confidence that comes from finding that the world keeps spinning every time they do something they’ve been warned would have dire consequences, like withdrawing from the Paris climate accord or announcing plans to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.According to a half-dozen White House officials and outside advisers, Trump is viewing the shutdown through a similar lens, a view encouraged by White House aides, including senior adviser Stephen Miller and congressional liaison Marc Short, who urged him on Friday not to give in to Democratic demands, particularly on immigration.Several presidential advisers expressed confidence that Democrats, who offered no philosophical objections to the 30-day continuing resolution approved by House Republicans, wanted to make a statement but don’t want to hurt federal workers, tens of thousands of whom will be staying home from work without pay if government funding isn’t restored by Monday morning.Two presidential aides said they expect the current crisis to be resolved by the end of the weekend.But Democrats themselves are sending a different message, at least publicly — giving no indication they are ready to buckle to pressure. “It’s important,” Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said of the shutdown’s impact on federal workers. “But I was just at the women’s march this morning, and there are a lot of federal workers there and … they were basically: ‘You need to stand up to this guy.’”One House Democrat said he was relieved his party had finally “grown a spine.”The most reliable politics newsletter.Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning — in your inbox.EmailSign UpBy signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.The White House has responded by shrugging it off, hewing to a consistent message: This shutdown won’t hurt as much as the one President Barack Obama oversaw five years ago.Mulvaney drew the comparison repeatedly on Saturday, telling reporters that national parks and monuments would remain open, though they were closed in 2013; that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would continue to protect Americans from this year’s flu outbreak; and that, in another departure from five years ago, the activities of the Environmental Protection Agency would continue uninterrupted.He also argued that Democrats today are being more unreasonable than were Republicans in 2013. “We were asked to vote for something in 2013 that we did not approve of,” said Mulvaney, who, as a South Carolina congressman, supported the 2013 shutdown because the government-funding bill required lawmakers to approve funding for Obamacare, a federal program to which they vehemently objected.Other West Wing aides were playing it cool as well.Whose Fault Is the Shutdown?By POLITICO STAFF“This seems so banal compared to 2013, when the two sides were actually fired up and there was a cause,” said a senior presidential aide. The 2013 shutdown, precipitated by Republican attempts to prevent funds from flowing to the Affordable Care Act, lasted 17 days. “Everybody figures this is going to resolve itself by the end of the weekend,” the aide said.“It will be nothing compared to Obama’s shutdown,” said another senior White House official, though the 2013 shutdown was roundly blamed on Republicans.Trump himself, who has yet to appear in public since the shutdown early Saturday morning, is sticking with the message that Democrats will take most of the heat, though he privately joked to staff that he knows he’ll get blamed — because he always does.Though he hasn’t appeared before the cameras, he was active on Twitter throughout the day on Saturday, writing: “This is the One Year Anniversary of my Presidency and the Democrats wanted to give me a nice present. #DemocratShutdown .”In photos released late Saturday by the White House, Trump and top staff appeared relaxed and smiling.Joyce N. Boghosian/Official White House photoWhite House aides said that they think Trump’s Twitter microphone is enough, and they don’t believe the president needs to make official remarks to bring the shutdown to a close.Indeed, Trump’s own erratic behavior in negotiations last week — including his remarks to lawmakers that many immigrants come from “shithole” countries — helped precipitate the breakdown in spending talks on the Hill by hardening the positions among party rank-and-file on both sides and giving Democrats a ready-made excuse to walk away from the negotiating table on immigration.Since then, he’s been a bit player in the shutdown drama — the absence of his direction and leadership driving events more than their presence.By BRENT D. GRIFFITHSThe irony is that while many had high hopes that Trump’s election augured a new era of bipartisanship in the country, the government shutdown is the clearest evidence yet that that hasn’t materialized.Instead, a year into his first term, the president — who won the election railing against the political system — finds himself trapped inside it, waiting for the political leaders he holds in contempt to set him free.Annie Karni and Seung Min Kim contributed to this report.

Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco), who said the current law discriminated against those who have human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, the precursor to AIDS, because exposure to other communicable diseases is a misdemeanor.The same reduction in crime level would apply to people who donate blood or semen without disclosing that they have tested positive for HIV or AIDS.Read More— Phil Willon (@philwillon) October 19, 2017AdvertisementOct. 2, 2017, 3:23 p.m.California LegislatureCalifornia farmworkers will have to undergo sexual assault prevention trainingGov.

Nigerian officials posted pictures on social media this week revealing the horrors of the Libya’s modern-day slave trafficking. GETTYShareWorld Libya Slave tradeUpdate | A burned corpse hanging upside down. Three men standing side by side with scars covering the wounds from their stolen internal organs. Human beings for sale.Those are the searing images of the modern-day slavery taking place across Libya, posted by a former Nigerian minister after a CNN investigation  revealed that Nigerian migrants were being sold into slavery by smugglers for $200.“Roasted alive,” tweeted former Nigerian aviation minister Femi Fani-Kayode. “This is what Libyans do to sub-Saharan Africans who are looking for a transit point to Europe. They sell them into slavery and either murder, mutilate, torture or work them to death.” Keep up with this story and more by subscribing nowFani-Kayode quoted a report claiming that 75 percent of those sold into the Libyan slave trade were southern Nigerians who'd had their organs harvested and their bodies burned or mutilated.It is unclear whether Fani-Kayode's images are authentic. In the one featuring the burned corpse, a soldier standing nearby is wearing an Iraqi military uniform, suggesting that the picture was not connected to the Libyan slave trade.But it is clear that the former government minister was trying to put pressure on current Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari for remaining silent on the trade of his people. Buhari did finally make a statement after the photos were posted, saying he would bring back the Nigerians stranded in Libya and discourage Nigerians from fleeing the country.“We will ensure they all return home safely and are rehabilitated,” he said.Fani-Kayode is pushing Nigeria to go to war with Libya.“If there were ever a reason or cause for us to go to war, the Libyans have provided it by enslaving our people and buying and selling them like Christmas turkeys and sallah goats,” he tweeted, posting an image that may not be authentic. “No human being deserves to be caged like an animal and roasted like suya meat. ”So far, 242 Nigerians have been returned from Libya. A majority had been living in detention camps, while others asked to be brought back home, according to CNN . The United Nations Security Council met in an emergency session this week to consider applying sanctions and the full range of international law against the smugglers involved in the slave trade.Celebrities including musical artist Pharrell Williams, rapper Common and civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton brought attention to the cause, tweeting about the slave trade to their millions of followers. This story was updated to strengthen the suspicion that Fani-Kayode's Twitter posts featured inauthentic pictures designed to pressure Nigeria to attack Libya.
https://www.snopes.com/schools-prayer-rugs-muslims/	U.S. Schools Now Buying Prayer Rugs for Muslims?	false	['cair']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/oGC9J	2016/04/05	PrintIt isn’t known if schools in America are installing holy water fonts next to the classroom doors, although they are small, plastic, inexpensive, and unobtrusive, nor is it known if Christian students are now allowed 20-seconds a day to say Grace before lunch, and there is little evidence that school districts have made the switch to Kosher foods to accommodate the dietary restrictions of Jewish students.The St. Cloud, Minnesota school district, however, is devoting its resources to providing accommodations to Muslim students based solely on the basis of their religion, which under the current interpretation of the Establishment clause of the First Amendment, would be impermissible for Christian or Jewish students – or Hindu, Buddhist or pagan students, either.The accommodations come as a result of a federal lawsuit filed in 2011 by the Council of American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) alleging that the school district had created a hostile environment for Muslim students.Somalis are the fastest growing group of residents in St. Cloud, a small city of 65,000 in central Minnesota comprising approximately 20 percent of the school district’s 10,000 students.Now Muslims students are not only given time both in class and in private rooms for prayer, which is “required” by their faith, but providing prayer rugs for them to use – free of charge courtesy of the taxpayers.The practice, which comes during the school day, disrupts classroom activities and leaves non-Muslim students confused and resentful that they do not have an excuse to leave the classroom and be dismissed early on Friday, while forcing teachers to design lesson plans and manage the classroom schedule so that mandatory activities like tests and presentations do not conflict with Muslim prayer time.The school district has also taken steps of hiring full-time staff members to navigate cultural differences, but the efforts have been directed at non-Muslims.One staff member said teachers needed to be “educated” to understand that Somali students do not make eye contact as a sign of respect, rather than helping students become comfortable looking others in the eye, a basic communication skill that will help them form friendships, fit in on sports teams, and eventually in jobs and careers where they live now.

Portlands city council on Wednesday voted 3 to 1 in favor of the Equal Use Act, a new resolution granting individuals who identify as furries the same rights afforded to dogs and their respective owners who frequent popular off-leash areas and dog parks in the greater Portland area.The decision comes on the heels of a four-day sit-in organized by PDX Furs, a regional furry community based in the Portland metro area, which staged the protest at Portlands city council offices on Milwaukie Avenue last weekend. This is a huge victory, said Bo Kirkman. Not just for furries here in Portland but furries living all across the United States.Bo, a former kindergarten teacher and self-described furry rights advocate, told the Portland Tribune that he identifies as a dog. Its one thing to say you cant bring your cat or your ferret or whatever to the off-leash areas because obviously theyre not dogs. But if I want to go to the park and play with my owner, well as a canine, that should be my right.Now, thanks to the City of Portland, Bo and his fellow furries can take advantage of the citys designated off-leash areas. Provided they respect and adhere to the posted rules and regulations at our city parks, said Public Affairs commissioner Dan Saltzman who sits on the city council and voted in favor of the resolution.According to the City of Portlands official website, dog park visitors are expected to pick up and dispose of their pets waste and are advised to leave sick animals at home. In an effort to prevent the spread of disease, we ask that owners refrain from allowing their dogs  or furries  drink from standing water, Saltzman said.However, not everyone is celebrating the new resolution.. I think its rediculous, said council-member Amanda Fritz who sits on the Portland Parks Board and voted against the proposal. Were allowing people in costumes to frolic about and fornicate to their hearts content in our public parks.Mrs. Fritz may be alone in her sentiments. Portland mayor Charlie Hales told the Daily Journal of Commerce that the Equal Use Act is synonymous with Portlands unofficial slogan. Keep Portland weird, quoted Mayor Hales before adding, That is precisely what we intend to do.Share the News:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)MoreClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)Tags:animal costumes, defecate, dog parks, furries, keep portland weird, mate, off-leash areas, oregon, portland, public urination, real news right now, realnewsrightnow, realnewsrightnow.com, rights, sex, voyeurism  R.

It’s a double standard. There shouldn’t be a black history month. We’re Americans, period.” Well, she definitely started a conversation… and has agreement in unexpected places:1.  Listen to what famous rapper Waka Flocka said:He said:“But honestly, I always felt like that. Like why the f**k we got BET? BET is for black people and MTV is for white people? Think about it. Why the f**k we got Black History Month only in February? How can the people that took our history, give us our history for one month? Just think about it.”I have to admit, I don’t know who “Waka Flocka” is, or what he sings, but I agree with him on this! 2.  Listen to what rapper, writer, actor, director Ice Cube said about the  #OscarSoWhite controversy :“We don’t do movies for the industry. We do movies for the fans, for the people,” Ice Cube said Friday. “To cry about not winning an award is like crying because you don’t have enough icing on your cake!”Though he didn’t mention Stacey by name, isn’t it interesting how he echoed her sentiments exactly?We shouldn’t segregate ourselves or limit Black History Month to one month a year. I wish things were really colorblind… I don’t know what we can do as a society to come together as one.Ss far as what I have seen about the #OscarSoWhiteControversy, it seems  Jada Smith started it because her husband wasn’t getting nominated.I don’t know how other people think about it, but I hope my son sees early on – that not everyone gets a trophy.Buy my Mom’s new devotional, Sweet Freedom, in bookstores everywhere!

The explosion, which appears to have originated in the basement, was heard nearly three miles away. The closest neighbor, a farm nearly a mile away, felt what they thought was a “mild earthquake. When first-responders arrived on site, they found a huge hole in the center of the ranch and bodies strewn about the surrounding area.Fire Marshall Sandy Batternofski said that the blast looked like the product of some sort of illegal activity:“There was a massive amount of pressure built up from something before it ignited. Then it burned so fast it incinerated everything in its path. The victims look like overcooked chicken wings. Gonna be tough to ID them.”We asked Police Chief Matt Schmidt what he thought and he never skipped a beat when he said:“Meth. No doubt about it. Al’s got some explaining to do.”Ex-Senator Franken, who lives in a penthouse in Minneapolis with his mistress, told police he hadn’t been to the ranch in over a year and that his brother Randy was looking after it for him. When asked about the obvious existence of a meth lab, Franken snorted and hung up the phone.We’ll update the story when the bodies are identified.     .About Flagg Eagleton  44 ArticlesFlagg Eagleton is the son of an American potato farmer and a patriot.

He was taking summer classes at his high school and left the classroom for what was supposed to be a quick call to a documentary crew preparing a feature on the rivalry with De La Salle High School in Northern California.“I stepped outside to make the phone call and I ran into a classmate of mine,” Banks says.Her name was Wanetta Gibson. She was a friend. She was 15.“We met, hugged, started talking and agreed to go to an area on our campus that was known as a make-out area,” Banks says. “We went to this area and made out. We never had sex.”By the end of the day, Banks was in custody, accused of raping Gibson on the school’s campus. But we never had sex, Banks pleaded. Nobody believed him.“I was being arrested and accused of kidnapping and rape,” he says. “I was taken into custody that same day and the judge put a bail on me that was too high for me to post bond. It was over $1 million.”He languished in juvenile hall for an entire year before his case came up. He was to be tried as an adult and if found guilty, faced 41 years to life. His football dreams effectively died that summer day in the stairwell of his school.Life isn’t fair.Brian Banks was an innocent man.Brian Banks weeps upon hearing judge clear his name in May of 2012.(Brittany Murray/ASSOCIATED PRESS)***After turning down three plea deals that would have put him in prison for 25, 18 or nine years, Banks was told on the day of jury selection “that I had no chance in trial because I was a big, black teenager and the jury would be an all-white jury and they would automatically assume me as guilty because of that,” Banks says.Gibson was also black, as was Banks’ attorney. As the jury was about to be selected, Banks was offered a deal to plead guilty to one count of rape under the condition that the other charges would be dropped. He would then undergo a 90-day observation at Chino State prison and would be interviewed and evaluated by psychologists and counselors “who would determine on a ladder system whether I would receive probation or three or six years prison,” Banks says. “I was promised and guaranteed by my attorney that I would get probation if I took the plea. I was also told that if I didn’t take it, I would more than likely be found guilty and receive life in prison.”He was 17 years old. “Do I plead to a crime that I did not commit and receive a small sentence or do I roll the dice, risk my entire life behind bars for a crime I didn’t commit?” he says. “I realized that day, regardless of whatever my decision was, neither one of them was going home an innocent man.”All he could think about was getting his life back, going home, playing football, finishing his high school education, enrolling at USC. They put him in a room and gave him 10 minutes to make his decision. He sat there crying. “I was unable to speak to my mom. I was denied that right,” he says. “At the age of 17, I felt like 90 days was doable after already spending a year behind bars.”He underwent the 90-day observation. The psychologist and counselor recommended probation. The judge gave him six years. He had never been in trouble before, not even a speeding ticket. He sat in the holding cell, held both hands up, shaking uncontrollably as he figured out that he would have to serve 85% of the six years. He had already served one year. That meant he still had just over four years remaining.“Just the trauma and the stress that I had already dealt with that first year, it was unimaginable how I was going to do another four years,” he says.He went to jail with career criminals. He was angry, depressed, hostile. He saw fights, stabbings, killings right in front of him, riots, lockdowns.He saw hell.Banks lost 10 years of his life, a frightful five years and two months in prison followed by five years of high custody parole.After his release in 2007, he moved back in with his mother, a second-grade schoolteacher who had sold her house and car to pay his attorney fees. At 22 he tried to resume his football career at Long Beach City College. He played in a game two days after his release, a good way to take out aggression. But after playing a handful of games before the season ended, a new law went into effect in California requiring sex offenders to wear an ankle GPS tracking device, making it impossible for him to play football.He had already registered as a sex offender and couldn’t live within 2,000 yards of a school or park. He had trouble finding work.“I wanted revenge,” Banks says. “I wanted people to be held accountable for the things that happened to me.”The past is the past. It already happened. Tomorrow is a mystery.Life’s not fair, Banks thought. I’m an innocent man.***Three years ago, Banks was checking his Facebook account and got a start. He had been home for four years working odd jobs, still carrying the label of sex offender. But there, staring him in the face, was a friend request.“It was her,” Banks says, “the girl who had accused me nine years ago.”Banks still doesn’t know her reasoning for selling him down the river when she knew they never had sex and there was no DNA trace on her underwear. Maybe it was the $1.5 million she collected from the Long Beach school system, claiming it was an unsafe environment (the city is trying to recoup $2.6 million from her now). Banks thinks maybe Gibson was afraid her older sister, who went to the same high school, would find out she made out with him and tell her mother. Or that he would brag to friends. Maybe she thought he would just be suspended. He doesn’t think she was trying to put him in jail. He also thinks perhaps a school security guard saw her leaving the stairwell with him, asked what she was doing and if she wanted to do it.“Oh well, then he raped you,” Banks surmises the guard said.“We don’t really know what the truth really is as to why she lied,” he says. “I never really got a clear reason.”Banks never had contact with her from the day they made out until that day on Facebook in 2011.He asked why she would request him.“I was hoping we could let bygones be bygones,” Banks says Gibson wrote. “I was immature back in the day, but I’m much more mature now. Let’s hang out. I’d love to see you. I’ve seen your picture on Facebook. You look real good. I would love to hook up.”Banks obviously had no interest.His parole agreement didn’t allow him any contact with her. Banks called a private investigator and said he felt there was an opportunity for her to tell the truth and he wanted it recorded.“In the event that I violated my parole conditions coming into contact with her and was sent back to prison, I wanted them to at least know what was said,” Banks says. “I took a big risk. I knew this was the only opportunity to prove my innocence by her admitting she lied.”In 2013, Atlanta's Brian Banks faces Cincinnati.(Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images)He invited Wanetta Gibson to the investigator’s office. They spoke with the investigator monitoring in another room. Banks wanted her to understand what she did to his life. He asked her to come back the second day to speak to the investigator.“Did he rape you? Did he kidnap you?” the investigator asked.Banks said she laughed it off and said, “Of course not. If he raped me, I wouldn’t be here right now. We were just young and having a good time, being curious, then all these other people got involved and blew it out of proportion.”It was all on tape. Banks took it to the California Innocence Project, which took his case and appealed it.One year later, three months before he was to come off parole, Banks was cleared.On May 24, 2012, the same Los Angeles Superior Court judge who had sentenced Banks to six years in prison when he begrudgingly accepted a plea bargain for a crime he did not commit after he was led to believe he would get probation, took less than one minute to dismiss his conviction.He was already a free man. But now he had his freedom.“My record is cleaner than yours,” he says.He’s not bitter, he’s not looking for an apology. He didn’t sue anybody.“When you put yourself in position where you have to make a decision whether you forgive somebody or you don’t, that means you are still dealing with it,” Banks says. “I’m not dealing with it anymore. The past is the past. It already happened. Tomorrow is a mystery.”***Banks tried football again after gaining back his full freedom. Carroll, the coach Banks wanted to play for at Southern Cal and the first coach to give him a tryout once he was exonerated in 2012, and who will be coaching in his second consecutive Super Bowl next Sunday, brought him to Seattle for a tryout the day after all charges were dropped.Banks remembers when his cell phone rang.Brian Banks has a moment with his mother, Leomia Myers and father, Jonathan Banks, outside courthouse.(Nick Ut/ASSOCIATED PRESS)“I’m looking for a linebacker. You know where I can find one?” the caller says.“You got the right number. Who is this?” Banks says.“Pete Carroll,” he says. “You’ve been out of the game 10 years. I don’t know what the hell you can do. But I’m going to fly you out here because I know how hard you work. I just want to see what you can do.”One year before he was exonerated, Banks had been up to 290 pounds. He then started training and within three months was down to 245 pounds when he went to Seattle.“It was a terrible tragedy in a young man’s life, to be falsely accused like that and have to give up years of his life,” Carroll said in an e-mail to the Daily News. “I don’t think anyone could’ve handled something like that any better. He was strong, gracious and compassionate, and he exhibited great character and integrity.”Banks was thrilled to hear from Carroll.“We reconnected and it was like we were back on that same path to where we left off recruiting,” he says. “Here we were once again.”But the football part didn’t work out. It had been too long.“I tried out. They were impressed,” Banks says. “They invited me back to camp. I trained in camp with them. They decided it was a little premature and they decided not to roll with me.”He had tryouts with the 49ers, Chiefs, Vikings, Chargers, Eagles and Falcons.Nobody signed him. It had been 10 years since he had really played.“You could tell he had missed some years of ball,” Carroll says. “He missed out on the physical development a college athlete gets and all that comes with that process. He missed the opportunity to hone his physical and mental skills as it relates to football, but his competitiveness shined through and he battled so hard for that chance, and did a phenomenal job with his opportunity.”Former Giants coach Jim Fassel then signed Banks for the Las Vegas Locomotives of the United Football League. He played linebacker and special teams before the league folded during the 2012 season after Banks had played in just a couple of games.Brian Banks exits court after his kidnap-rape conviction was dismissed.(Brittany Murray/AP)“I heard about his story and as a coach, you just say ‘Gosh sakes, what this man has gone through and his attitude is still positive,’ ” Fassel says by phone last week. “This guy deserved somebody to give him a chance. It was amazing he wasn’t bitter, but he was really, really raw.”The Falcons reached out again in 2013, signed him in the offseason, brought him to camp. He played in all four preseason games, but was let go on the final cut from 75 players to 53.Banks, officially, was done. He was just 28 years old. His formative years in football were spent shuttling between adult prisons in California.“He was an all-star player and set himself apart in high school, so if he had gotten the chance, it’s clear he definitely could’ve been a legitimate NFL prospect,” Carroll said.***Who knows what would have happened to Banks if his life had not been derailed?“I don’t really wonder. I know,” Banks says. “I know I would have been a force to be reckoned with in the NFL.""Banks is 29 now and dressed in a dark suit sitting in the office of Troy Vincent, the NFL’s executive vice president of football operations, in the league’s Park Avenue headquarters. He began working for the NFL in the football operations department at the beginning of the 2014 season. On game days, he helps out in the officiating department with replays.Vincent and Roger Goodell brought him in because he’s a bright and eager guy. He also has a riveting message that might make an impact on some of the players in the NFL.“Very few people could even endure what happened to Brian, much less emerge with such resilience and determination,” Vincent says. “I saw a young man who was dealt a bad hand, but he refused to allow it to deter him from pursuing his dream to be part of the NFL.""Now he might be on his way to becoming a star in the NFL office.“He’s a great guy,” Goodell says.For Banks, the dream is once again alive.“If you ask me, I made an NFL roster and that’s here in the front office in New York,” he says. “I still wear the shield. I accomplished a dream that was taken away from me.”He now does volunteer work for the California Innocence Project. A movie is being made about his life. Banks also has developed a business speaking to schools all over the country. He has a strong message and an appropriate T-shirt.It’s a California license plate that says, XONR8. Sign up for BREAKING NEWS Emails"

The man in the video, Greig Tonkins (who is reportedly a zookeeper), was on a boar-hunting trip with a number of his friends, including Kailem, a 19-year-old guy who passed away last week after a battle with Ewing Sarcoma.

https://www.snopes.com/cashews-equivalent-to-a-dose-of-prozac/	Are Two Handfuls of Cashews Equivalent to a Dose of Prozac for Depression?	false	['antidepressants', ' dangerous memes', ' david avocado wolfe', ' depression', ' newz magazine']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/9n36j	2016/12/30	SEND Pinterest Google Skype Reddit-Cashew nuts are one of the healthiest foods in the world. Unfortunately, not many of you know the numerous benefits they offer, and only a very small percentage of the natural medicines comprehensive database is dedicated to them.Countries like Nigeria, Tanzania, Mozambique and Brazil are the biggest producers of cashew nuts, mostly due to the fact that they need hot and humid climate in order to grow.Health Benefits of Cashew NutsCashew nuts are rich in vitamins, soluble dietary fiber, minerals and many phytochemicals that prevent diseases, including cancers. Cashews are also rich in calories, about 50 grams of these favorable foods contain 275 calories.These beneficial nuts provide numerous essential vitamins, including pantothenic acid or vitamin B5, pyridoxine or vitamin B6, thiamin or vitamin B11 and riboflavinThe aforementioned vitamins are crucial for metabolism of fat, protein and carbs at a cellular level. On the other hand, niacin improves the protection against pellagra or dermatitis.Furthermore, B6 is extremely beneficial for our health for it significantly lowers the chances of developing sideroblastic anemia and homocystinuria. Only 3.5 Oz (100 gr) of these nuts provide about 30% of daily recommended levels of B6 (that’s about 0.147 mg).Moreover, cashews are also rich in essential minerals. Some of the most useful minerals found in cashew nuts are potassium, manganese, copper, selenium, magnesium, zinc and iron. Only a handful of these nuts on a daily basis can provide the necessary amount of these extremely needed minerals and protect you from deficiency- related diseases.For instance, copper acts as a co-factor for many important enzymes, like superoxide dismutase and cytochrome c- oxidase. Zinc, on the other hand, plays the same role together with enzymes that are responsible for the regulation of the growth and progress of digestion, gonadal function and DNA synthesis. Selenium is a very important micronutrient and it works as a co-factor for antioxidant enzymes like Glutathione peroxides, known as one of the strongest antioxidants in human body.Monounsaturated fatty acids which are in high quantities in these nuts are extremely good for the heart health, as palmitoleic and oleic acids. They belong to the group of essential fatty acids that can increase the level of good HDL cholesterol and decrease the level of harmful LDLcholesterol in our blood. In addition, as shown by many scientific studies, the so-called Mediterranean diet which is mostly based on monounsaturated fatty acids supports the blood lipid profile, and protect our system from strokes and coronary artery diseases.Furthermore, cashews also contain a small quantity of one very important pigment of flavonoid antioxidants, called zeaxanthin, which is selectively absorbed inside the retinal macula in our eyes. This pigment provides protective and antioxidant UV ray filtering features, and it also protects from ARMD or age-related macular degeneration in old people.How Treat Depression Naturally – A Basic Guide to Cashew NutritionCashew nuts are more than great source of tryptophan, which is a vital amino acid our body needs to take it throughout the food. This amino acid helps children develop and grow, regulates mood, balances our behavior, improves sleep and can significantly lower the level of stress, anxiety and depression.Just two handfuls of cashews contain somewhere between 1.000 and 2.000 mg of tryptophan. This compound has been proven to be as equally successful as prescription antidepressants. The best thing about treating depression with cashews is that you will surely avoid side effects that are usually caused by antidepressants. Of course, this is yet another thing big pharma carefully hides from us.According to FDA Deputy Commissioner for Policy’s David Adams, who was part of the Drug Information Association Annual Meeting back in 1993, we need to pay close attention to the things happening around the legal arena and dietary supplements. If producers of natural remedies manage getting the support, there will most likely be a completely new class of products, which will be competing with the already existing drugs. This is why we need a special law that will have the function to regulate the supplements.In addition, back in 1993, FDA Dietary Task Force has released a report saying that the selling and existence of dietary supplements will not jeopardize efforts for creating new drugs.Sponsored by Revcontent

The 2003 painting by Simmie Knox shows a smiling Clinton sporting one of her signature pantsuits, standing by a table with her book, “It Takes a Village,” by her side.ADVERTISEMENTThe White House calls this year’s theme “The Gift of the Holidays,” one that “reflects on not only the joy of giving and receiving, but also the true gifts of life, such as service, friends and family, education, and good health.”Supersized versions of the presidential pooches, Bo and Sunny, greet guests in the East Wing Hallway. The first dog-inspired creations, which measured slightly taller than ITK’s towering 5’4” frame, were crafted from more than 25,000 yarn pom-poms.A tree adorned with gold stars represents “The Gift of Service,” which pays homage to first lady Michelle ObamaMichelle LeVaughn Robinson Obama Michelle Obama celebrates success of ‘Black Panther’ How textbooks shape teachers — not just their students Michelle Obama dedicates Valentine's Day playlist to Barack Obama MORE and Dr. Jill Biden’s Joining Forces initiative, aimed at supporting military service members and their families. Kiosks with touch screens can be used to pen a note to send to troops.Another snowy display might prove more controversial. Not only do snowmen occupy the space next to the Clinton portrait — they line the entire hall.Similar snowmen stoked fear among the Washington press corps last year, when ITK tweeted a picture of a countless number of ever-smiling figures peering into the White House from outside. Bloomberg White House correspondent Justin Sink dubbed the frozen creatures “nightmare fuel.”But everything is awesome in the State Dining Room, with 56 gingerbread houses — one for each state and territory — created out of Legos. South Dakota’s gingerbread house features a pretty impressive Lego version of Mount Rushmore. More than 200,000 of the colorful blocks were used to decorate the room, and Lego master builders spent 500 hours designing and crafting the structures.In the Green and Red rooms, visitors can find a seasonal ode to Michelle Obama’s “Let’s Move!” anti-childhood obesity initiative, with wreaths made of lemons and garlands created using limes. The fruit-filled rooms also feature gift boxes made out of cranberries.This year’s White House gingerbread house was whipped up using 150 pounds of gingerbread on the inside and 100 pounds of bread dough on the outside. The behemoth baked good also includes 20 pounds of gum paste, 20 pounds of icing and 20 pounds of sculpted sugar pieces.A sugary sweet Bo and Sunny stand outside the massive confection, along with a giant gingerbread man and woman. The gingerbread woman is seen holding a gingerbread baby.But even the spicy-sweet smell of the sugar-coated display couldn’t get one journalist salivating over the gigantic treat. “Can we all accept now that gingerbread is only good as a building material?” a photographer quipped. 
https://www.snopes.com/bill-oreilly-beaten/	Bill O’Reilly in Critical Condition After Being Attacked by ‘Tolerant’ Liberals?	false	"[""america's last line of defense"", "" bill o'reilly""]"	http://www.newsweek.com/	http://www.newsweek.com/bill-oreillys-podcast-defiant-ever-dull-never-589662	2017/05/09	"By Alexander NazaryanOn 4/25/17 at 12:05 PMBill O'Reilly on the set of his show ""The O'Reilly Factor"" in New York on March 17, 2015. Brendan McDermid/ReutersShareU.S.Last week, Bill O’Reilly returned from a European vacation to find that he had been fired from Fox News for a history of alleged sexual misbehavior that is impressively wide-ranging, even for the Viagra warehouse that has functioned for near decades as the mouthpiece of the Republican Party.This week, O’Reilly left for vacation again; his destination this time was not Italy but the Isle of Unreality, a remote location favored by right-wingers seeking to escape lawsuits and facts.No longer will O’Reilly be a factor, so to speak, in the fortunes of the right-wing cable news channel that brought his visage, puckered with outrage, into the homes of millions. Even as advertisers fled his show over the past two months, he crushed the competition like a Republican congressman in Texas, drawing 3.8 million per night viewers in early April. Now, all he has is a measly podcast, No Spin News, and a website that does an excellent impression of 1999.Keep up with this story and more by subscribing nowO’Reilly’s first post-firing podcast went live on Monday. Television endowed O’Reilly with a kind of gleeful menace that was weirdly captivating for those of us who disagreed with him on everything, including the title of “journalist” he gave himself; unseen, he loses power—and seems to know it. Yet at heart, the project is the same, a promise of “no spin” bolstered by sturdy beams of vitriol and misinformation.O’Reilly began with pure, uncut, right-into-your-bloodstream spin, also known as damage control. “I am sad that I am not on television anymore,” he said. “I was surprised how it all turned out.” He may mean that he thought the $13 million he and Fox News paid out to various accusers ensured their silence. Or maybe he thought that a recent endorsement from Donald Trump—“I don't think Bill did anything wrong”—would save him.But O’Reilly really wasn’t going to spend all his podcast time talking about that unseemly business, not with the forces of liberalism amassing at the borders of Real America. There was much news to cover, many spins to un-spin or stop the spins from spinning or cause to the spins to spin in a countervailing motion, thereby creating a spin-neutral zone. He began by denouncing numbers, specifically those tied to President Trump’s approval ratings. If those numbers seem low, he explained, it’s not because Trump has been an ineffectual, easily distracted head of state but because the mainstream media “deceive” Americans “on a daily basis.”I can’t claim to be a regular Fox News viewer, but I’ve seen and heard enough of O’Reilly (Mom loves the guy…) to know that something was amiss on this podcast. The day’s news was a slab of red meat, but instead of tearing into it, O’Reilly timidly nibbled at the edges. When I hear the boredom in O’Reilly’s voice, I worry for the future of the Republic.“Don’t react to these polls,” he advised Trump, like a weary coach telling his charges to hustle. O’Reilly had to know that Trump had already reacted to those polls on Twitter (you can imagine how), so why offer political advice that’s not only hackneyed but outdated?Little else about the 20-minute show was remarkable—which was the most remarkable thing about it. Without much gusto, he covered the French election (“Marnie” Le Pen) and conservative commentator Ann Coulter’s feud with the University of California at Berkeley (“a place I would never in a million years go to”).“Interesting,” he said of the Berkeley issue. “Very, very interesting.” To show just how interesting it was, he followed with a long “um…”Frankly, I could have used a little, um, spin. In what I take as an ominous sign, the word of the day flashed in a banner atop the O’Reilly website. The word on Monday was sciolistic, which means “concerned with or comprehending only what is apparent or obvious; not deep or penetrating emotionally or intellectually.”Was some dastardly young web editor trolling O’Reilly? Or was O’Reilly nobly unspinning himself? The latter is unlikely. Like the man in the Oval Office, O’Reilly never backs down when presented with evidence of his own misconduct or deception. To the contrary, both men puff up their chests and grow indignant, mistakenly thinking that they stand on high ground, when they are in fact treading along the crumbling edge of a cliff.“I’m very confident the truth will come out,” O’Reilly said at the opening of his podcast.It already has, Bill."

Pedophiles to FBI?	false	['fake news', ' harvey weinstein', ' hollywood', ' neon nettle', ' sexual assault']	https://www.nytimes.com/	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html	2017/10/21	Harvey Weinstein Paid Off Sexual Harassment Accusers for DecadesImageHarvey Weinstein apologized for behavior that he said “has caused a lot of pain.”CreditJean Baptiste LaCroix/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesBy Jodi Kantor and Megan TwoheyOct. 5, 2017Update: The Weinstein Company’s board has fired Harvey Weinstein after reports of sexual harassment complaints against him. Find more coverage here .Two decades ago, the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein invited Ashley Judd to the Peninsula Beverly Hills hotel for what the young actress expected to be a business breakfast meeting. Instead, he had her sent up to his room, where he appeared in a bathrobe and asked if he could give her a massage or she could watch him shower, she recalled in an interview.“How do I get out of the room as fast as possible without alienating Harvey Weinstein?” Ms. Judd said she remembers thinking.In 2014, Mr. Weinstein invited Emily Nestor, who had worked just one day as a temporary employee, to the same hotel and made another offer: If she accepted his sexual advances, he would boost her career, according to accounts she provided to colleagues who sent them to Weinstein Company executives. The following year, once again at the Peninsula, a female assistant said Mr. Weinstein badgered her into giving him a massage while he was naked, leaving her “crying and very distraught,” wrote a colleague, Lauren O’Connor, in a searing memo asserting sexual harassment and other misconduct by their boss.“There is a toxic environment for women at this company,” Ms. O’Connor said in the letter, addressed to several executives at the company run by Mr. Weinstein.An investigation by The New York Times found previously undisclosed allegations against Mr. Weinstein stretching over nearly three decades, documented through interviews with current and former employees and film industry workers, as well as legal records, emails and internal documents from the businesses he has run, Miramax and the Weinstein Company.During that time, after being confronted with allegations including sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact, Mr. Weinstein has reached at least eight settlements with women, according to two company officials speaking on the condition of anonymity. Among the recipients, The Times found, were a young assistant in New York in 1990, an actress in 1997, an assistant in London in 1998, an Italian model in 2015 and Ms. O’Connor shortly after, according to records and those familiar with the agreements.In a statement to The Times on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Weinstein said: “I appreciate the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it. Though I’m trying to do better, I know I have a long way to go.”He added that he was working with therapists and planning to take a leave of absence to “deal with this issue head on.”Lisa Bloom, a lawyer advising Mr. Weinstein, said in a statement that “he denies many of the accusations as patently false.” In comments to The Times earlier this week, Mr. Weinstein said that many claims in Ms. O’Connor’s memo were “off base” and that they had parted on good terms.ImageSome of Mr. Weinstein’s films include, from left to right, “Sex, Lies, and Videotape,” “Pulp Fiction” and “Good Will Hunting.”He and his representatives declined to comment on any of the settlements, including providing information about who paid them. But Mr. Weinstein said that in addressing employee concerns about workplace issues, “my motto is to keep the peace.”Ms. Bloom, who has been advising Mr. Weinstein over the last year on gender and power dynamics, called him “an old dinosaur learning new ways.” She said she had “explained to him that due to the power difference between a major studio head like him and most others in the industry, whatever his motives, some of his words and behaviors can be perceived as inappropriate, even intimidating.”Though Ms. O’Connor had been writing only about a two-year period, her memo echoed other women’s complaints. Mr. Weinstein required her to have casting discussions with aspiring actresses after they had private appointments in his hotel room, she said, her description matching those of other former employees. She suspected that she and other female Weinstein employees, she wrote, were being used to facilitate liaisons with “vulnerable women who hope he will get them work.”The allegations piled up even as Mr. Weinstein helped define popular culture. He has collected six best-picture Oscars and turned out a number of touchstones, from the films “ Sex, Lies, and Videotape ,” “ Pulp Fiction ” and “ Good Will Hunting ” to the television show “ Project Runway .” In public, he presents himself as a liberal lion, a champion of women and a winner of not just artistic but humanitarian awards.In 2015, the year Ms. O’Connor wrote her memo, his company distributed “ The Hunting Ground ,” a documentary about campus sexual assault. A longtime Democratic donor, he hosted a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton in his Manhattan home last year. He employed Malia Obama, the oldest daughter of former President Barack Obama, as an intern this year, and recently helped endow a faculty chair at Rutgers University in Gloria Steinem’s name. During the Sundance Film Festival in January, when Park City, Utah, held its version of nationwide women’s marches, Mr. Weinstein joined the parade.ImageHarvey Weinstein and Hillary Clinton in 2012. Mr. Weinstein held a fund-raiser for Mrs. Clinton at his Manhattan home last year.CreditLarry Busacca/Getty Images“From the outside, it seemed golden — the Oscars, the success, the remarkable cultural impact,” said Mark Gill, former president of Miramax Los Angeles when the company was owned by Disney. “But behind the scenes, it was a mess, and this was the biggest mess of all,” he added, referring to Mr. Weinstein’s treatment of women.Dozens of Mr. Weinstein’s former and current employees, from assistants to top executives, said they knew of inappropriate conduct while they worked for him. Only a handful said they ever confronted him.Mr. Weinstein enforced a code of silence; employees of the Weinstein Company have contracts saying they will not criticize it or its leaders in a way that could harm its “business reputation” or “any employee’s personal reputation,” a recent document shows. And most of the women accepting payouts agreed to confidentiality clauses prohibiting them from speaking about the deals or the events that led to them.Charles Harder, a lawyer representing Mr. Weinstein, said it was not unusual to enter into settlements to avoid lengthy and costly litigation. He added, “It’s not evidence of anything.”At Fox News, where the conservative icons Roger E. Ailes and Bill O’Reilly were accused of harassment, women have received payouts well into the millions of dollars. But most of the women involved in the Weinstein agreements collected between roughly $80,000 and $150,000, according to people familiar with the negotiations.In the wake of Ms. O’Connor’s 2015 memo, some Weinstein Company board members and executives, including Mr. Weinstein’s brother and longtime partner, Bob , 62, were alarmed about the allegations, according to several people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In the end, though, board members were assured there was no need to investigate. After reaching a settlement with Mr. Weinstein, Ms. O’Connor withdrew her complaint and thanked him for the career opportunity he had given her.“The parties made peace very quickly,” Ms. Bloom said.Through her lawyer, Nicole Page, Ms. O’Connor declined to be interviewed. In the memo, she explained how unnerved she was by what she witnessed or encountered while a literary scout and production executive at the company. “I am just starting out in my career, and have been and remain fearful about speaking up,” Ms. O’Connor wrote. “But remaining silent is causing me great distress.”In speaking out about her hotel episode, Ms. Judd said in a recent interview, “Women have been talking about Harvey amongst ourselves for a long time, and it’s simply beyond time to have the conversation publicly.”A Common NarrativeMs. Nestor, a law and business school student, accepted Mr. Weinstein’s breakfast invitation at the Peninsula because she did not want to miss an opportunity, she later told colleagues. After she arrived, he offered to help her career while boasting about a series of famous actresses he claimed to have slept with, according to accounts that colleagues compiled after hearing her story and then sent on to company executives.“She said he was very persistent and focused though she kept saying no for over an hour,” one internal document said. Ms. Nestor, who declined to comment for this article, refused his bargain, the records noted. “She was disappointed that he met with her and did not seem to be interested in her résumé or skill set.” The young woman chose not to report the episode to human resources personnel, but the allegations came to management’s attention through other employees.Across the years and continents, accounts of Mr. Weinstein’s conduct share a common narrative: Women reported to a hotel for what they thought were work reasons, only to discover that Mr. Weinstein, who has been married for most of three decades, sometimes seemed to have different interests. His home base was New York, but his rolling headquarters were luxury hotels: the Peninsula Beverly Hills and the Savoy in London, the Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc near the Cannes Film Festival in France and the Stein Eriksen Lodge near the Sundance Film Festival.ImageThe Peninsula Beverly Hills, a hotel where Mr. Weinstein has been accused of sexually harassing women in the entertainment industry.CreditFG/Bauer-Griffin, via Getty ImagesWorking for Mr. Weinstein could mean getting him out of bed in the morning and doing “turndown duty” late at night, preparing him for sleep. Like the colleague cited in Ms. O’Connor’s memo, some junior employees required to perform those tasks said they were disturbing.In interviews, eight women described varying behavior by Mr. Weinstein: appearing nearly or fully naked in front of them, requiring them to be present while he bathed or repeatedly asking for a massage or initiating one himself. The women, typically in their early or middle 20s and hoping to get a toehold in the film industry, said he could switch course quickly — meetings and clipboards one moment, intimate comments the next. One woman advised a peer to wear a parka when summoned for duty as a layer of protection against unwelcome advances.Laura Madden, a former employee who said Mr. Weinstein prodded her for massages at hotels in Dublin and London beginning in 1991, said he had a way of making anyone who objected feel like an outlier. “It was so manipulative,” she said in an interview. “You constantly question yourself — am I the one who is the problem?”Oct. 5, 2017“I don’t know anything about that,” Mr. Weinstein said.Most women who told The Times that they experienced misconduct by Mr. Weinstein had never met one another. They range in age from early 20s to late 40s and live in different cities. Some said they did not report the behavior because there were no witnesses and they feared retaliation by Mr. Weinstein. Others said they felt embarrassed. But most confided in co-workers.Ms. Madden later told Karen Katz, a friend and colleague in the acquisitions department, about Mr. Weinstein’s overtures, including a time she locked herself in the bathroom of his hotel room, sobbing. “We were so young at the time,” said Ms. Katz, now a documentary filmmaker. “We did not understand how wrong it was or how Laura should deal with it.”Others in the London office said the same. “I was pretty disturbed and angry,” said Sallie Hodges, another former employee, recalling the accounts she heard from colleagues. “That’s kind of the way things were.”The human resources operation was considered weak in New York and worse in London, so some employees banded together in solidarity. “If a female executive was asked to go to a meeting solo, she and a colleague would generally double up” so as not to be alone with Mr. Weinstein, recalled Mr. Gill, the former president of Miramax Los Angeles.Many women who worked with Mr. Weinstein said they never experienced sexual harassment or knew of anyone who did, and recalled him as a boss who gave them valuable opportunities at young ages. Some described long and satisfying careers with him, praising him as a mentor and advocate.But in interviews, some of the former employees who said they had troubling experiences with Mr. Weinstein asked a common question: How could allegations repeating the same pattern — young women, a powerful male producer, even some of the same hotels — have accumulated for almost three decades?“It wasn’t a secret to the inner circle,” said Kathy DeClesis, Bob Weinstein’s assistant in the early 1990s. She supervised a young woman who left the company abruptly after an encounter with Harvey Weinstein and who later received a settlement, according to several former employees.Speaking up could have been costly. A job with Mr. Weinstein was a privileged perch at the nexus of money, fame and art, and plenty of his former assistants have risen high in Hollywood. He could be charming and generous: gift baskets, flowers, personal or career help and cash. At the Cannes Film Festival, according to several former colleagues, he sometimes handed out thousands of dollars as impromptu bonuses.Mr. Weinstein was a volcanic personality, though, given to fits of rage and personal lashings of male and female employees alike. When a female guest of his had to wait for a hotel room upgrade, he yelled that Ms. O’Connor would be better off marrying a “fat, rich Jewish” man because she was probably just good for “being a wife” and “making babies,” she wrote in her memo. (He added some expletives, she said.) His treatment of women was sometimes written off as just another form of toxicity, according to multiple former employees.In the fall of 1998, a 25-year-old London assistant named Zelda Perkins confronted Mr. Weinstein. According to former colleagues, she and several co-workers had been regularly subjected to inappropriate requests or comments in hotel rooms, and she was particularly concerned about the treatment of another woman in the office. She told Mr. Weinstein that he had to stop, according to the former colleagues, and that she would go public or initiate legal action unless he changed his behavior.Steve Hutensky, one of Miramax’s entertainment lawyers, was dispatched to London to negotiate a settlement with Ms. Perkins and her lawyer. He declined to comment for this article.Ms. Perkins, now a theater producer in London, also declined to comment for this article, saying that she could not discuss her work at Miramax or whether she had entered into any agreements.Months after the settlement, Mr. Weinstein triumphed at the Oscars, with “ Life Is Beautiful ” and “ Shakespeare in Love ” winning 10 awards. A few years later, Mr. Weinstein, who had produced a series of British-themed movies, was made a Commander of the British Empire, an honorary title just short of knighthood.‘Coercive Bargaining’For actors, a meeting with Mr. Weinstein could yield dazzling rewards: scripts, parts, award campaigns, magazine coverage, influence on lucrative endorsement deals. He knew how to blast small films to box office success, and deliver polished dramas like “The King’s Speech” and popular attractions like the “Scary Movie” franchise. Mr. Weinstein’s films helped define femininity, sex and romance, from Catherine Zeta-Jones in “Chicago” to Jennifer Lawrence in “Silver Linings Playbook.”ImageThe actress Ashley Judd in the 1997 film “Kiss the Girls.” Ms. Judd said that Mr. Weinstein sexually harassed her two decades ago in his room at the Peninsula.CreditParamount Pictures, via PhotofestBut movies were also his private leverage. When Mr. Weinstein invited Ms. Judd to breakfast in Beverly Hills, she had been shooting the thriller “ Kiss the Girls ” all night, but the meeting seemed too important to miss. After arriving at the hotel lobby, she was surprised to learn that they would be talking in his suite; she decided to order cereal, she said, so the food would come quickly and she could leave.Mr. Weinstein soon issued invitation after invitation, she said. Could he give her a massage? When she refused, he suggested a shoulder rub. She rejected that too, she recalled. He steered her toward a closet, asking her to help pick out his clothing for the day, and then toward the bathroom. Would she watch him take a shower? she remembered him saying.“I said no, a lot of ways, a lot of times, and he always came back at me with some new ask,” Ms. Judd said. “It was all this bargaining, this coercive bargaining.”To get out of the room, she said, she quipped that if Mr. Weinstein wanted to touch her, she would first have to win an Oscar in one of his movies. She recalled feeling “panicky, trapped,” she said in the interview. “There’s a lot on the line, the cachet that came with Miramax.”Not long afterward, she related what had happened to her mother, the singer Naomi Judd, who confirmed their conversation to a Times reporter. Years later, Ashley Judd appeared in two Weinstein films without incident, she said. In 2015, she shared an account of the episode in the hotel room with “ Variety ” without naming the man involved.ImageIn 1997, Mr. Weinstein reached a settlement with the actor Rose McGowan after an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival. She had just appeared in the movie “Scream,” above.CreditDimension Films, via PhotofestIn 1997, Mr. Weinstein reached a previously undisclosed settlement with Rose McGowan, then a 23-year-old-actress, after an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival. The $100,000 settlement was “not to be construed as an admission” by Mr. Weinstein, but intended to “avoid litigation and buy peace,” according to the legal document, which was reviewed by The Times. Ms. McGowan had just appeared in the slasher film “ Scream ” and would later star in the television show “Charmed.” She declined to comment.Increased ScrutinyJust months before Ms. O’Connor wrote her memo, a young female employee quit after complaining of being forced to arrange what she believed to be assignations for Mr. Weinstein, according to two people familiar with her departure. The woman, who asked not to be identified to protect her privacy, said a nondisclosure agreement prevented her from commenting.Soon, complaints about Mr. Weinstein’s behavior prompted the board of his company to take notice.In March 2015, Mr. Weinstein had invited Ambra Battilana, an Italian model and aspiring actress, to his TriBeCa office on a Friday evening to discuss her career. Within hours, she called the police. Ms. Battilana told them that Mr. Weinstein had grabbed her breasts after asking if they were real and put his hands up her skirt, the police report says.The claims were taken up by the New York Police Department’s Special Victims Squad and splashed across the pages of tabloids, along with reports that the woman had worked with investigators to secretly record a confession from Mr. Weinstein. The Manhattan district attorney’s office later declined to bring charges.But Mr. Weinstein made a payment to Ms. Battilana, according to people familiar with the settlement, speaking on the condition of anonymity about the confidential agreement.The public nature of the episode concerned some executives and board members of the Weinstein Company. (Harvey and Bob Weinstein together own 42 percent of the privately held business.) When several board members pressed Mr. Weinstein about it, he insisted that the woman had set him up, colleagues recalled.Ms. Battilana had testified in court proceedings against associates of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy who are accused of procuring women for alleged sex parties, and the Italian news media also reported that, years ago, Ms. Battilana accused a septuagenarian boyfriend of sexual harassment, a complaint that was apparently dismissed. Ms. Battilana did not respond to requests for comment. Her lawyer, Mauro Rufini, could not be reached for comment.After the episode, Lance Maerov, a board member, said he successfully pushed for a code of behavior for the company that included detailed language about sexual harassment.Then Ms. O’Connor’s memo hit, with page after page of detailed accusations. In describing the experiences of women at the company, including her own, she wrote, “The balance of power is me: 0, Harvey Weinstein: 10.”She was a valued employee — Mr. Weinstein described her as “fantastic,” “a great person,” “a brilliant executive” — so the complaint rattled top executives, including Bob Weinstein. When the board was notified of it by email, Mr. Maerov insisted that an outside lawyer determine whether the allegations were true, he said in an interview.ImageMr. Weinstein in 1999 with the winners of the best-picture Oscar for “Shakespeare in Love.”CreditHector Mata/Agence France—PresseBut the inquiry never happened. Mr. Weinstein had reached a settlement with Ms. O’Connor, and there was no longer anything to investigate.“Because this matter has been resolved and no further action is required, I withdraw my complaint,” Ms. O’Connor wrote in an email to the head of human resources six days after sending her memo. She also wrote a letter to Mr. Weinstein thanking him for the opportunity to learn about the entertainment industry.Rachel Abrams and William K. Rashbaum contributed reporting.

Use of Bluetooth-equipped devices has stretched across the globe, yet the technologys origins and name can be traced to an engineer obsessed with making computers function using as little energy as possible.Power is one of the key attributes. Battery life is life. Its the life of the product. To ignore that is totally unacceptable. You have to design things to work efficiently, but more importantly, do nothing efficiently, said Jim Kardach, retired chief power architect at Intel.Originally intended as a wireless replacement for cables to connect phones, headsets, computers, keyboards and mice, Bluetooth technology has proliferated over the past decade, allowing devices in close proximity to connect while using very little battery power.The headsets are ubiquitous, but according to the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) they are only one of many product types that make up the 9 billion Bluetooth devices in the world today. That number keeps growing. Over the next 2 years, annual Bluetooth device shipments are expected to double from 2 to 4 billion, according to ABI Research.Intel mobile computing engineer Jim Kardach was instrumental in bringing together Ericsson, IBM, Intel, Nokia and Toshiba to form the Bluetooth SIG in 1998. That group created the universal standard that is used by more than 17,000 member companies.Kardach recalls playing the role of instigator and mediator among the founding companies, but says the group quickly agreed on a common goal to create a small, low-power consuming, low-cost, short-range radio with built-in security and the ability to connect ad hoc with other devices. Inspired by a book about Vikings that he was reading at the time, he came up with the Bluetooth name.Just days before he retired in December, Kardach reflected on his 27-year career at Intel, including the genesis of Bluetooth, the many low-power design breakthroughs that led to 100 patents and his work on the first notebook system-on-chip (SoC) sold in the 1980s by Intel called the 386SL/486SL.How did you get involved with the creation of Bluetooth?I got the assignment in 1997 when my boss at the time came up to me and said, Youre finishing up the ACPI stuff, can you figure out how to integrate wireless into the notebook?We got together Ericsson, Nokia, Toshiba and IBM. That probably represented 60 percent of both the cellphone and notebook markets at the time. The key was to define the goals of what we wanted to do. We formed a SIG, all agreeing that we wanted to build this universal, very low-cost, private, wireless cable.We did it under an open IP (intellectual property) policy, allowing us to take the best pieces from everywhere and put them together. We had goals on what we wanted this thing to cost and strategies for it being built on a bulk CMOS process, which hadnt been done before. It had security, privacy and had to work across the world, so we picked the ISM band, which required fixing some of the regulatory issues around it. We had a term sheet that everyone agreed to and we put it together. Intel became the leader simply because we had IBM and Toshiba who didnt trust each other, and Ericsson and Nokia who didnt trust each other, so we were kind of the Switzerland.How does a chief power architect look at things?The idea for the Bluetooth name came from Jim Kardach of Intel, who was reading a historical novel about Vikings and King Harald Bluetooth at the time.Power is one of the key attributes. Battery life is life. Its the life of the product. To ignore that is totally unacceptable. You have to design things to work efficiently, but more importantly, do nothing efficiently. Those are the two rules of power management.We rely on architectural designs to lower power use. We design chips to turn things off and back on only when theyre needed. We architect things to minimize latency and anticipate when something is needed so it gets turned on just in time.We used to rely on randomness, like when you drive to work and hope to miss all of the red lights, but more recently weve purposely tried to line up activities in order to create big idle gaps between these activities. If the idle gaps are long enough, we can shut off all of the power. For example, we now have special offloading accelerators that run to do specialized media loads and then be able to put the rest of the platform to a low-power state, which means 98 percent of it is powered off.Hardware not designed for power management can be like crying babies that wake up the whole house. They ping memory every couple of milliseconds or microseconds, keeping the CPU out of its low-power state. This can keep memory and the busses between them alive. A Bluetooth radio should require about a milliwatt of power, but when you put it on a USB plug, because of the way the bus was architected, it generates an extra 6 watts of power by pinging memory every millisecond. These are things we want to catch up front when architecting for good power management.The fourth-generation Intel Core processors that use an SoC design are coming out soon. Whats the advantage of SoCs over traditional CPU designs?SoC allows you to do things that arent possible if you have a handful of chips from different venders. We have the advantage of doing our own chipsets and CPUs, which allows us to design power management between them and the rest of the platform.In the 1980s I worked on the 3SL and 4SL SoCs. We were doing it in an era where we were cramming hundreds of thousands of transistors on a die and now we can fit billions. We can now take advantage of Moores Law and increased capacity that were getting from bigger wafers and smaller transistors. This lets us integrate more capabilities into a small chip. Having an SoC allows us to bring power management across the platform.With the 3SL, we added new operating modes to the CPU that pulled some power management underneath the operating system. This work is still used today. To design an SoC, sometimes you have to trade off time to market but you can really take advantage of them to manage power consumption.This content was originally published on the Intel Free Press website.'

https://www.snopes.com/media/notnews/strapon.asp	Was a Florida Teacher Suspended After a Shocking Sex Ed Demonstration?	false	['common core', ' infowars', ' national report', ' not necessarily the news']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/Zhdna	2017/09/03	6th Graders Taught How to Use Strap-On DildoExplicit: 11-12 year olds given sex toy lesson in Jacksonvilleby Paul Joseph Watson | September 15, 20149,23530931Shocking images out of a classroom in Jacksonville, Florida illustrate how 11-12 year olds in 6th grade are being taught how to use strap-on dildos amidst a debate about sexual content finding its way into other Common Core subjects, material which has been attacked by some as pornographic.The pictures were taken by a student with a cellphone camera. They show a teacher demonstrating how to use a strap-on sex toy in a number of different positions.In one image, the teacher even shows how to insert the strap-on while her buttocks are in the air and her legs up over her head.In another image, the woman shows the children how to wear a harness to which the strap-on is attached.Clinton Middle School in Duval County hired 39-year-old Sharon Mercer to teach the sex education class but after the photos emerged she was suspended and the school refused further comment. Mercer claimed her suspension was an act of “bigotry” because she was a “proud member of the LGBTQ community.”Newly implemented Common Core educational standards have been assailed for their attempt to create a lowest common denominator form of teaching which many assert only works to dumb down lessons and prevent smart students from excelling.The teaching of so-called “alternative” sexual lifestyles is being practiced in many states under Common Core as a result of sexual content finding its way into other subjects. A school district in Arizona banned a Common Core-approved book last year after it was found to contain sexually explicit passages that described scenes of bondage.Common Core, which is being federally imposed on states across the nation, is a huge shift in teaching which opponents assert will eviscerate critical thinking and generally lower standards in the name of inclusiveness and political correctness. Numerous examples have emerged of Common Core style exam questions which only serve to cause more confusion and frustration.Perhaps the most infamous example of how Common Core will manifest itself in America’s schooling system was illustrated by a bizarre video in which a Common Core curriculum director said that 3 x 4 = 11 could be considered a correct answer so long as students could explain how they reached that number.Common Core’s sex education content has also faced fierce criticism, with one group even claiming that it represents “pornography” which serves to desensitize children to sexual contact and could lead to an increased chance of molestation within the schooling system.Common Core approved book aimed at 11th graders contains sexually explicit scenes of bondage.“What is taught includes teaching inappropriate sexuality skills, that shouldn’t even be taught in college,” writes Joseph R. John . “According to child psychologists, the children are not mentally equipped to understand the detailed sexual indoctrination starting in kindergarten, they are indoctrinated in sexual practices that they should never be exposed to.”“There is a heavy socio political content of sex throughout Common Core curriculum being taught in every grade and in every subject, the student is taught that there is a sameness of gender, there is no longer simply boys and girls according to Common Core,” notes John. “The sexual content of Common Core crosses into every curriculum taught, from teaching sexuality skills in sex education courses by specially skilled and trained sex education teachers. Sexual activities and content in included in every subject taught. Sex is taught in the English curriculum, is included in the language curriculum, sex is woven into the science curriculum, in the math curriculum, in the social studies curriculum, and of course in biology.”As the backlash grows, more and more states are considering abolishing Common Core altogether, with Indiana’s decision earlier this year to ditch the program seen as a victory for conservatives.FOLLOW Paul Joseph Watson @ https://twitter.com/PrisonPlanet*********************Paul Joseph Watson is the editor at large of Infowars.com and Prison Planet.com .  Print this page.

The area is known to be the home of several gators, although there have been few cases of anyone receiving serious injuries from gator attacks in the area. That said, approaching a wild gator to take a photo is definitely not recommended.“I’ve lived in Pensacola all my life,” said one witness, who was walking her dogs along the trail, “but never have I seen anyone take such a big risk, and for so little.” According to the witness, the New Zealand tourist, who is yet to be formally named, deviated from the trail despite being warned by several locals that the gator may attack. “She risked her life to take a photo with a gator? It’s madness, why would you do a thing like that?”Numerous onlookers were horrified as the woman approached a gator that was resting on the edge of the trail in a patch of sun. “I pleaded with her to get back onto the trail,” said one male witness, “but she said she was just going to take a selfie and told me not to worry about it.” The woman proceeded to take out her phone and prepare for the selfie, but moments later the alligator lashed out, covering the distance between itself and the tourist in seconds.Related Articles23 Women Inappropriately Dressed For Walmart?These content links are provided by Content.ad .

We saw the gator grab her between his jaws, and there was a sharp cry as he dragged her into the bushes, and then just a strange stillness.” The authorities were summoned almost immediately but nothing could be done. “A few hours later we found a purse which we believe belonged to the victim, but no sign of her body has been found.”The identity of the New Zealand woman who perished in the attack has not yet been revealed, although it is believed she was visiting relatives in Pensacola. Authorities have reminded tourists to the region to not take any risks and be aware of the dangers posed by alligators. “For some visitors who are unfamiliar with the strength and speed of these animals, they may be complacent and not appreciate how dangerous they can be. We want to urge tourists to take precautions, and don’t risk your life over getting a photo with an alligator, as it might just kill you.”In other news making headlines, a 29-year old Alabama woman has been hailed as a hero after she was able to fight off a man during an attempted rape. However, her story has sparked some controversy after it emerged that she cut off the rapist's genitals and forced him to eat them.Popular Stories"

His decision comes after a shooting at a high school in nearby Parkland, Fla. left 17 dead and others injured.Courtesy of Ben DickmannBen Dickmann has been hunting since he was a child. The 40-year-old Florida man enjoyed going out on the gun range to practice firing at targets and was the proud owner of an AR-57, a semi-automatic rifle.But, after 17 people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School by a former student using a semi-automatic rifle, Dickmann, who lives just over 30 minutes away in Fort Lauderdale, did something unexpected.Dickmann turned in his AR-57 to the sheriff's office and asked them to destroy it. He posted about it on Facebook, and that post has now gone viral. It's been shared more than 100,000 times.Dickmann spoke to NPR's Michel Martin about his love of the firearm and why he decided to give it up.Interview HighlightsOn the decision to turn in his AR-57It's come after a lot of soul searching. Everybody always says - you know, it's the big argument right now - everybody's offering thoughts and prayers but nothing else. And I thought, well, this is something I can do that I think is right. And it's something I can do that might spark a change. You know, my whole goal was maybe to inspire one friend on my Facebook page to do the same thing. And maybe that friend would inspire one other person. And who knows? I totally didn't expect for this to go the way it did and as fast as it did.On the issue of obtaining a concealed carry/weapon permitThe concealed weapons permit program here in the state of Florida, as far as I'm concerned, is a joke. Literally, it's three hours of PowerPoint, and then you go down to the range with a very, very low caliber handgun, and you have to put five out of 10 rounds on a paper plate at 5 feet. Probably half the class that I had are people that had never touched a gun before in their life.On the challenge to give up his AR-57After Las Vegas, I had thought long and hard about it, and thought, well, you know, it's not hurting anything sitting in my gun safe here. But it wasn't really until this last tragedy at Stoneman Douglas where it really hit home with us - and me.Actually, one of my friends on Facebook rather sarcastically said, well, if you really feel this way, why don't you go turn in your gun at Broward Sheriff's Office? I'll even drive you. And that's what spurred me to think. Even though he was being extremely sarcastic about it because he's a very staunch conservative, gun rights activist person, it kind of spurred me to say, you know what? Yeah, I'll do that.On what he plans to do nextFor me, to be honest, I'm not sure. It's a lot to process, and nothing that I had this grand master plan going into this for. So I'm happy that this sparked a debate and hopefully causes some action. I hope somebody - be it the students, be it the next generation - picks up the torch and does something.NPR's Digital News intern Asia Simone Burns produced this story for the Web.

Seven years ago, the 54-year-old social theorist embarked on a literary adventure, following a long-nursed hunch about Shakespeare’s true identity.Hudson had spent most of his adult life grappling with complex questions that straddled the fields of social theory and cognitive science, creating high-level strategic redesign for the energy, telecommunications, Internet, and public sectors.“Most of my work involved helping media companies rethink their industries,” says Hudson. “Now I’ve moved on to rethinking the Shakespearean industry.” With his life and plays comprising a billion-dollar global industry, says Hudson, the Bard has managed to secure a sublime place in literary history as well as an omnipresence in pop culture and media. “But, like all industries, it rests on certain assumptions,” says Hudson. It is these very assumptions — primarily about who the author of the plays really was — that Hudson set about to reinvent.Hudson had an uneasy feeling that there was more beneath the plays’ surface than was brought to light by scholars and historians. His search began in earnest after he enrolled in a postgraduate program at the Shakespeare Institute at the University of Birmingham — in Stratford-upon-Avon, naturally — where he spent four years delving into the texts.He gradually devised the latest approach to Shakespearean authorship, the Amelia Bassano Theory — recently recognized by the Shakespearean Authorship Trust as one of the top eight authorship theories.The figure of Amelia Bassano Lanyer had turned up before in Shakespearean scholarship. In 1973, celebrated historian A.L. Rowse identified her as the actual “Dark Lady” of Shakespeare’s famed sonnets. Bassano — known as the first woman in England to have published a book of original poetry (Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum, 1611), which has been interpreted as an early feminist critique of the Christian Gospels — was part of a family of Italian court musicians of Moroccan/Semitic ancestry who lived as clandestine Jews.Hudson explains that the unusual circumstances of Amelia’s upbringing accounted for her extraordinary education and literary sensitivity. By age seven, she was adopted by the Countess of Kent, who provided her with a well-rounded education, including studies in Greek, Latin, and the Bible. By 13, she became mistress to Lord Henry Hunsdon, the man in charge of the English theater and patron of the Lord Chamberlain’s Men — the company that performed Shakespeare’s works.The plays certainly suggest that their author had access to scholarly training as well as exposure to certain specific environments — all of which coincide with Amelia’s biography. The 2,000 musical references, for example, were her birthright; the hundreds of references to plants, law, military life, and falconry could likely be the result of her involvement with Hunsdon. Other subject matter in the plays echoes her childhood experiences.But most important, Hudson discovered her key “literary signatures” — in which Amelia left her name spread across various plays. Her married name Lanier — meaning falcon in French — is spread across the two different versions of The Taming of the Shrew. It is in the form of the central figure who is tamed like a falcon, together with her name Emila; her father’s name, Baptista, and her husband’s name, Alphonso. An Emillius and a Bassianus appear in Titus Andronicus as well. But the most important “signatures” are those created after her husband’s death, between 1622-23, when her full maiden name — Aemilia Johnson Willough(by) Bassanio — was spread across three Shakespearean plays, associated in each case with the standard image of the Renaissance poet. Such a circumstance had little chance of being a mere coincidence. “She so badly wanted us to notice them,” says Hudson, “but nobody ever did.”Something revolutionaryThe next step for Hudson was to bring his case to the theater-going public. The first play he selected as a vehicle for his theory was A Midsummer Night’s Dream; with its staging he intended to present the allegorical plot revealing the key subtextual layers indicative of Bassano’s Jewish authorship. The challenge was to find the right people to do the job and convince them that he was on to something revolutionary.Hudson is British, married to an American, and the couple often shuttles between London and New York. It was there, in the fall of 2006, that he set out to put together a theater group that had both the dramatic training and mental muscle to actualize his theories. After a few months, Hudson had on board Mahayana Landowne, a Yale Drama School-educated director. Next he enrolled in a “Shakespeare Boot Camp” workshop at the New Perspectives Theatre Company, where he befriended Jenny Greeman, an experienced actress and theater educator who was to become his assistant director. “I found his theory compelling,” said Greeman, “and the figure of Amelia Bassano is absolutely fascinating…. She is someone who needs to be spoken about much more. I am thoroughly ready to believe that she could have written these plays….”Translating Hudson’s esoteric theory into concepts and then into practice involved hours of improvisation between actors, directors, and dramaturge (Hudson’s official title). “I was happy to adopt a hands-off management style when it came to staging the plays and leave it to those who truly understood the physicality of the theater,” he said. Yet, when it came to selecting actors for his new troupe, The Dark Lady Players, he made a point of meeting extensively with each actor to ensure that they were willing to think about the plays allegorically and took a proactive role at the dramatic workshops.Lila Dupree, who played Theseus, feels that the DLP achieved a group dynamic unlike any she had experienced before. “It is definitely a struggle at times to condense things so that they will be visually clear and clean. With something this high-concept, you risk alienating the audience, so a lot of our process involves finding ways to break down that fourth wall, so to speak.”Dupree is one of about 15 actors in the troupe, representing an eclectic ‘melting pot’ of theatrical backgrounds. What they all share is Shakespearean training buttressed by a voracious appetite for intellectually rigorous work.The DLP is now testing its version of As You Like It in workshops. Also in the pipeline is Hudson’s biography of Amelia Bassano, as well as a documentary film deal. With all the exciting attention on the horizon, the troupe feels wholly committed to its mission of presenting new and thought-provoking interpretations of Shakespeare’s (or Bassano’s) plays. “We’ve learned a lot from our experience with Midsummer,” says Dupree, “and with As You Like It, we are ready to take it to the next level.”To order a DVD of the Dark Lady Players’ Midsummer Night’s Dream, e-mail Dark Lady Players .Daniela Amini is a New York-based freelance writer specializing in theater, opera, dance, and local news.Comedy as revengeIn staging Midsummer Night’s Dream, John Hudson’s objective was, first and foremost, to reveal the play as a Jewish satire rife with pointed references to Christian idolatry. In other words, “comedy as revenge.”John Hudson carried out a literary adventure and brought it to the stage.In his findings, each character is revealed to have a connection with a character in religious allegory, i.e., a “double” in the Roman/Christian world. Stanford University professor Patricia Parker had already shown that Puck carries the name of two devils, that Bottom represents Jesus (and, in the course of the play, undergoes a kind of “Passion”), and that Thisbe represents the Church. Hudson completed the puzzle to show that Oberon is the figure of Yahweh (God of the Jews), who is embroiled in the Jewish-Roman war against Titus Caesar (embodied by Titania) over the abduction of the true Jewish Messiah (the Iudean or ‘Indian’ boy); the “flower, love in idleness” (a pun on idolatry), represents the Gospels; and the end of the play is a Jewish apocalypse characterized by the distribution of dew — as in the Zohar.The Dark Lady Players debuted Midsummer Night’s Dream in March 2007 at the Abingdon Theatre Arts Complex near Times Square. The staging was never heavy-handed and there were some uproariously funny moments, punctuated by scenes of violent carnage and deep, spiritual pathos. The overall tone was of a promising marriage between strict comedy and strict tragedy.— DANIELA AMINIDark Lady eventsFrom the Dark Lady Players’ A Midsummer Night’s Dream: A Comic Jewish Satire, Kirsta Peterson, top, as Bottom/Pyramus and Megan McGrath, left, and Amanda Bruton as soldiers.

https://www.snopes.com/disney/parks/club33.asp	Questions About Disneyland’s Club 33, Answered	true	['club 33', ' disney lawsuits', ' disney parks', ' disney rumors', ' disneyland', ' theme parks']	http://www.disneytouristblog.com/	http://www.disneytouristblog.com/disneyland-bar-crawl-guide/	2007/08/27	Pin ItAlthough no alcohol is sold in Disneyland itself (except in Club 33), locations in Disney California Adventure, the Disney-owned hotels, and Downtown Disney serve alcohol. Here’s our guide to the best beer and mixed drinks available throughout Disneyland Resort.While it’s not as popular as Drinking Around the World at Epcot in Walt Disney World, leisurely afternoon spent exploring the various Disneyland Resort bars is a lot of fun. Plus, all of these bars are within a short walk of one another given Disneyland’s condensed footprint, so it’s easy to hit them all in one day.Some of the mixed drinks here might be off-menu at some locations, but they’re listed because the bartenders at the given location do a great job with these drinks. We try to give a couple suggestions for each location so that you don’t have to order a random drink off what I “lovingly” prefer to as the Generic DisneyParks® Drink Menu® .I loathe this menu of sugar-water and vibrantly color concoctions meant to appeal only to vacationers who don’t regularly drink. It is the epitome of what is wrong with the contemporary Disney theme parks: homogenization that has replaced unique experiences in the name of saving a few bucks because bean-counters either don’t understand the “Disney Difference,” or think most guests won’t notice, anyway. More importantly, if you’re someone who has the mental and physical fortitude to partake in a bar crawl, you will be largely unimpressed by these drinks. Plus, consuming more than a couple will make you sick to your stomach from an overdose of sugar.Because of this, we make recommendations that are either unique to each specific stop on our tour, or are drinks most bartenders at the locations in question know how to make. Order these, or order something else you enjoy that the bartender knows how to make. You order drinks off the Generic DisneyParks® Drink Menu® at your own peril.Obviously you should use your head when consuming alcohol. Eat a big early-lunch before you start, make sure to stay hydrated, and spread out your drinking. This is enough fun that it should be an all day event, so take your time. We recommend starting at around noon and concluding late in the evening.Every good bar crawl needs a good name, and we’re fresh out. Epcot has “Drinking Around the World,” which is a very solid name, but nothing spectacular for Disneyland sticks out like that. In lieu of something better, I’m going to call this the Disneyland Drinking Debauchery. Sounds a little more risque than it actually is, but I like alliterations.It’s scientifically proven that the best place to start the Disneyland Drinking Debauchery is in Disney California Adventure. Laugh if you want, but there is a very good reason for this: Disney California Adventure has some attractions that are enhanced with alcohol. Seriously, it’s like adding 3D to the Lion King. It started out great, but 3D really adds an element of “wow.”These alcohol-enhanced attractions are California Screamin’, Silly Symphony Swings, Goofy’s Sky School, and the Golden Zephyr. In other words, the stuff on Paradise Pier. “Science” is needed here because you need to consume the perfect amount of alcohol to enhance these experiences. Drink too little, and they’re the same as they normally are. Drink too much, and it’s Upchuck-City. Population: everyone in your general vicinity. Not a pretty picture. However, if you hit that slightly-buzzed sweet spot, these attractions are a lot more fun.Okay, let’s get started with the fun!Disney California AdventureCarthay Circle Lounge – Part of the all-new Buena Vista Street, Carthay Circle contains a restaurant and two lounges. The first lounge, 1901, is available only to “upgraded” Club 33 members.  The other lounge is where you’ll be stopping, and there’s no reason to be down about this if you’re not a Club 33 member (as is the case with 99.99999999999999999% of the population), because this lounge is spectacular.The decor is classy and elegant, and most importantly, the lounge has its own unique menu. There are several great options on this menu, with different types of custom ice (seriously) to boot! My personal favorite is the Carthay Manhattan. Sarah enjoys the Carthay Club Mojito. The Aviator Cocktail is a good, strong drink, too. Be careful when you step into Carthay Circle Lounge, as this could be the first and last stop on your Disneyland Debauchery Drinking tour. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as the drinks here are seriously good.Al Fresco Tasting Terrace – This location can be difficult to find. It’s a secluded area upstairs from Wine Country Trattoria. If you can’t find the staircase leading here, ask a Cast Member. It’s easier to find than it used to be, since changing over from the Al Fresco Lounge to the Tasting Terrace. Now featuring more tasting plates and a robust drink menu, things have improved, as you can read in our Al Fresco Tasting Terrace Review .Moreover, the views from this terrace into Cars Land are phenomenal. Here, we recommend one of the cheaper wine flights or the Widmer Hefeweizen . This is a wine bar, so I’d caution against straying from wines and beers. We’ve never had a good mixed drink here. In fact, the Irish Coffee Sarah once ordered here was about the most disgusting thing I’ve ever tasted, and was nothing like a traditional Irish Coffee. Fortunately, Al Fresco Tasting Terrace has come a long way since then, and it’s now one of our favorite spots in DCA.Bayside Brews – Bayside Brews is located near the Silly Symphony Swings, Golden Zephyr, and Goofy’s Sky School. Unsurprisingly, it serves beer. Although it’s just a little stand (if we stopped at every little beer kiosk in DCA, you’d end up in the hospital–fear not, this is one of only two that we hit), it is notable because it serves good beer as compared to other beer stands in Disneyland. We recommend grabbing a Sierra Nevada Torpedo IPA or whatever the Karl Strauss seasonal beer happens to be. The Torpedo IPA is definitely your best bet, and possibly the best beer you can find at Disneyland Resort.We highly recommend grabbing your brew from Bayside Brews, and then heading over to the actual bayside, to the secluded seating area under Silly Symphony Swings. Enjoy your beer there in peace while looking out over the water, and then head upstairs for the ride of your life on the swings!Cove Bar – The next stop is Cove Bar. Ahh, Cove Bar. In the original version of this Drinking Guide that we published in 2012, we regaled readers with tales of Cove Bar and its glorious Lobster Nachos. Prior to that post, we never had to wait to be seated at Cove Bar, always walking up and having our choice of seats.Shortly after that post, Cove Bar exploded in popularity. Now, we aren’t taking credit for that…nor are we taking blame. Irrespective of the reason, Cove Bar exploded in popularity, and a contributing factor was undoubtedly viral images of Lobster Nachos and colorful drinks on Instagram and Pinterest.Cove Bar began drawing lines rivaling those of Radiator Springs Races. The Lobster Nacho Revolution had begun. Fortunately, in early 2016, Disney opened an expanded seating area for Cove Bar, and now the waits have been reduced to more manageable times on most days (10-20 minutes).The bartenders are usually very entertaining and fun at the Cove Bar, so sitting at the bar can also be a good time. This should be your second food stop of the day (you should’ve eaten lunch before commencing the Disneyland Drinking Debauchery) and there is one thing you should absolutely order here: the Lobster Nachos. As we wrote in our Cove Bar Review , the Lobster Nachos are “a zen-like experience that makes you feel like there are little angels massaging your taste buds and tickling your stomach…a religious experience.”These are the most expensive thing on the bar menu, but they are so, so delicious. My drink of choice here is the Zombie , which can be made a few different ways. The bartenders here usually make it a dark green color, but don’t be surprised if it’s light. It does have some fruit juices in it, but it also is heavy on the rum (light, dark, and 151).The Cove Bar also has around 10 beers on tap, so pick one of those if you’re not down with the undead concoction.***Intermission***During the intermission, enjoy the Golden Zephyr, Silly Symphony Swings, and, if your stomach can handle it, California Screamin’ and Goofy’s Sky School. Return to the Disneyland Drinking Debauchery after enjoying these attractions.***Intermission***The Karl Strauss Beer Truck – This beer truck tucked away in Pacific Wharf at Disney California Adventure is our second of two kiosk style stops. As the name suggests, this truck serves Karl Strauss beer. As Disneyland Resort, for some reason, is very lacking on good craft beers, we recommend making a stop here. This should not be read as an endorsement of Karl Strauss beer, but comparatively speaking, it is fairly good. Tower 10 IPA and Red Trolley Ale are both good, or go for the seasonal option. This is one step we’d recommend skipping if you want to drink less and/or don’t care for beer. Alternatively, you can also stop at the nearby Rita’s Baja Blenders, Cocina Cucamonga, or Lucky Fortune Cookie for different options.Flo’s V8 Cafe – The latest addition to our list is quite possibly the best stop of all. If you’ve paced things really slowly, you might be here around sunset. That’s the perfect time to drink at Flo’s! Grab a Racer 5 IPA and head back to the outdoor seating area at the back of the restaurant. Here, you have a perfect view of the Cadillac Mountain Range and Radiator Springs Racers. There’s nothing quite like an early evening enjoying a beer and watching the cars fly by one of Imagineering’s masterpieces. You might just find yourself ending your debauchery here, as you get “stuck” at this spot for a couple of hours. Make no mistake–even though you’re not missing the mission, this is a noble feat.On your way to the next stops at Disney’s Grand Californian Hotel & Spa, pick up FastPasses for (hopefully) the late show of World of Color.Grand CalifornianHearthstone Lounge – Hearthstone Lounge has a pretty good selection of beers, with a lot of the standard choices available elsewhere from Karl Strauss and Sierra Nevada. You can also find some choices from Sam Adams and New Castle, among others, here. Here, we definitely recommend sitting at the bar or at least ordering from the bar. We’ve had inexperienced servers here in the general seating area who simply recommend “any of the good drinks on the menu” with the menu being the Generic DisneyParks® Drink Menu®. I typically opt for a Sierra Nevada here, whereas Sarah usually experiments with whatever “bartender’s choice.” These drinks have always tasted great, but beware, they can pack a punch!Napa Rose – Napa Rose is the best non-club restaurant at Disneyland Resort . It also has a pretty nice bar. Luckily, you don’t have to drop $50 on some filet to grab a beer here (although if you see or smell one, you might find yourself doing just that). I recommend the Franziskaner Hefe-Weisses here. It’s creamy and moderately thick, with a nutty flavor and slight banana undertone to it. Napa Rose is more well known for its world class wine collection, so if you’re into wine, you might go that route. Rather than taking my advice on that, ask the bartender or a server. All of the servers here are sommeliers, meaning they know a heck of a lot more about wine than me!Here, the plan offers some wild-card options. See the below “Other Stops” section if you have time in your crawl and want to make an additional stop.Hollywood Land Dance Party [Insert Name] Club – There is a drink station set-up each night for Mad T Party. It was previously End of Line Club, now it’s “Drink Me.” Who knows what it will be next. Regardless of the name, the idea remains the same: pricey light up drinks for clubin’. While the drinks are fairly expensive (over $10 for the light-up specialties) here to capitalize on the party-oriented audience, ours have always been surprisingly good. This is surprising because, given the location and target, we figured these would be watered-down sugar-drinks. The Glowjito Mojito and Digitini Martini are both good and offer light-up fun. To be fair, they are somewhat sugar-y, but the ones we’ve had (on several different nights) have always had some kick. I don’t know if this is just great luck or if it’s always this way. After grabbing a drink, join the other programs…or…tweedle dums(?) at elecTRONica or Mad T Party . Once the dance party concludes, use your FastPass for the late show of World of Color.Trader Sam’s – Enchanted Tiki Bar – After World of Color, the perfect way to cap off the evening is at the best bar in all of Disneyland Resort, Trader Sam’s. If you want a thorough review of Trader Sam’s, read this review where I offer heaping amounts of praise to Trader Sam’s . The CliffNotes version: Trader Sam’s is the coolest bar in Disneyland, with an intimate (47 person capacity) location that is packed with an astonishing amount of detail, interactive elements, and some fantastic drinks.Some of these drinks include the Adventurers Club Kungaloosh (a Walt Disney World classic), the HippopotoMai-Tai, Shrunken Zombie Head, Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Rum, Shipwreck on the Rocks, and the Uh Oa! The Uh Oa! can be shared by 2-4 people, has a cool tableside presentation, and is our favorite drink at Trader Sam’s. Trader Sam’s does serve some good beers as well, but this is one location where you should stick to mixed drinks because they’re really that good. If you stay for only one drink, you can add items in from the “Other Stops” list below, but we recommend spending a couple hours here soaking up the ambiance and ending your night here. It’s the perfect conclusion to Disneyland Drinking Debauchery.Other Stops – There are other places you can stop, but chances are, even with taking it slow and spreading out the festivities over the course of the entire day, eight stops will be the limit (or even too much) for most people. The stops above are our picks for the best drinking spots in Disneyland. However, since we heavily weigh ambiance, there might be some additional or alternative places that might appeal more to you personally, depending upon your preferences. Here’s our list of the best of the rest:
https://www.snopes.com/did-a-new-jersey-town-forbid-residents-from-criticizing-islam/	Did a New Jersey Town Forbid Residents From Criticizing Islam?	mfalse	['islamophobia', ' mosque', ' new jersey', ' sharia']	http://americannews.com/	http://americannews.com/us-town-forbids-citizens-criticizing-islam-muslims-residents-furious/	2017/08/08	ago 10According to reports from World Net Daily, a New Jersey township that was sued by a group of Muslims for refusing to approve a massive mosque project is now returning to court because of a settlement agreement that restricts anyone from commenting on “Islam” or “Muslims.”It’s important to note that a key tenet of Shariah bans any negative comments about the religion. According to the Thomas More Law Center who sued the township on behalf of two residents whose home is within 200 feet of the proposed mega-mosque, the settlement “reads more like an instrument of surrender.”The Islamic Society of Basking Ridge won a decision in federal court after its mosque proposal was rejected based on traffic and other concerns. The Township agreed on a $3.5. million payment and a “public hearing to approve the settlement.”Residents Christopher and Loretta Quick challenged the agreement, arguing it restricts speech and violates the Establishment Clause.“The Quicks reside within 200 feet of the proposed mosque construction in a zoned residential area,” Thomas More explained. “Yet, the settlement agreement prohibits them from describing the many unique features of Islamic worship which will impact the design of the building, traffic density, water and sewage, traffic control problems, road construction, and parking arrangements. According to the settlement agreement, ISBR is permitted to make statements concerning Christians and Jews and their places of worship, but in contrast, the agreement prohibits commentary relating to Islam or Muslims. In fact, ISBR has previously discussed the Christian and Jewish religions and their places of worship.”Richard Thompson, chief counsel for Thomas More, said the Islamic center “has taken the extraordinary step of concealing significant links on their website to a radical group named by the federal government as an unindicted co-conspirator in the largest terrorism financing trial in America history, the Islamic Society of North America (‘ISNA’).”Thompson said that while “claiming that the township had a religious animus against Muslims, ISBR hid from the public view its animus toward Christians and Jews, by not only hiding anti-Christian and anti-Semitic verses published on its website but also hiding its significant ties to ISNA. Instead of standing up to defend its citizens against ISBR’s hate-filled anti-Semitic and anti-Christian bias, the township colluded with ISBR’s ‘Civilization Jihad’ by capitulating to payment of millions of dollars to ISBR, allowing the construction of the new mosque and Islamic center in violation“ISBR is setting a dangerous unconstitutional precedent by abusing a court process to chill and trample on the First Amendment rights of private citizens whose only involvement was to speak out against the mosque at public hearings,” Thompson said earlier this year.He asked for the subpoenas to be thrown out “because the U.S. Supreme Court has held that speech at a public place on a matter of public concern is entitled to special protection.”0

Timothy A. Clary/AFP/GettyShareUpdated | Sure, it's been more than 340 days since Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton, but there's still one very narrow, highly unlikely and entirely unprecedented way that Clinton could become president.But you never know...In light of the ongoing probe into Russia collusion, Harvard University professor Lawrence Lessig posted on  Medium  a series of ""if/then"" scenarios that would lead to House Speaker Paul Ryan handing the White House keys to Clinton.Related: Hillary Clinton losing to Trump was like Jesus's crucifixionTo be clear, constitutional law expert Lessig is not calling for a Clinton ascendancy, but was merely playing out a hypothetical chain of events should a conspiracy be proven:If number 1: If Trump is definitively found to have colluded directly with Russia, he would be forced to resign or be impeached.If number 2: If Trump is removed, Vice President Mike Pence would become president.If number 3: If Pence becomes president, he should resign too, given that he benefited from the same help from Mother Russia.If number 4: If Pence resigns before appointing a vice president, Ryan would become president.If number 5: If Ryan becomes president, he should do the right thing  and choose Clinton for vice president. Then he should resign.""The answer seems unavoidable: He should nominate the person defeated by the treason of his own party, and then step aside and let her become the president,"" Lessig writes. ""Without doubt, if Ryan did the right thing, that would be the most extraordinary event in the history of America since the Confederate Army fired on Fort Sumter. But unlike that, this event would build the union, not divide it.""Lessig, who briefly ran for the Democratic nomination in 2015, adds that Clinton would then appoint Ryan to be veep out of political goodwill. Americans can only assume that while busy being a president who can read policy documents longer than one page , she'd stop her endless press tour and figure out how to keep the nation from getting nuked.Lessig apparently isn't the only one with Clinton on the brain. Clinton has made it clear she won't run for office again, telling CBS Sunday Morning that she's ""done with being a candidate."" But Trump himself tweeted about the possibility Monday.""I was recently asked if Crooked Hillary Clinton is going to run in 2020?"" he wrote . ""My answer was, 'I hope so!'""Only time will tell if the Russia cloud clears up by then.Story was updated to clarify that Lessig was not advocating for the ""if/then"" scenario, but merely laying it out."

The bodies and money trace back to an armored car robbery in Southeast New Mexico. He had the unit on an autopay contract but his credit card expired and due to a juxtoposed number…he never got the notice in the mail.”According to his secretary, John Lewis Prager, he first he heard of it was when it came over the police scanner in the Mayor’s office. “He suddenly had to go,” said Prager, visibly upset, “It’s the last time I’ve seen or heard from him. I’m guessing he knew what was about to happen and went to some other evil storage locker to cash out and escape.”The FBI thinks Prager is right. Foreman reportedly has more than a dozen storage units spread across Missouri and possibly hundreds around the country. He was spotted on surveillance cameras in Hamilton leaving a unit with a bag from an armored car:A bag that size could contain millions in $100 bills or bearer bonds. The FBI also suspects that Foreman has fake passports and various pre-planned escape routes. “Finding him won’t be easy,” said Slurryman, “but we won’t stop until we do.”The mayor’s job in Goose Rapids will revert to Foreman’s Deputy Mayor.
https://www.snopes.com/white-house-comment-shutdown/	Did President Trump Shut Down the White House Phone-In Comment Line?	mfalse	['barack obama', ' donald trump', ' white house']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/sN88i	2017/01/24	on January 23, 2017 4:56 pm·In another attempt to stifle freedom of expression, President Trump and his administration have dismantled the White House switchboard comment operating system. Instead, callers will be told to take their complaints and comments to Facebook and other White House social media platforms.When called, the White House switchboard states:“Thank you for calling the White House comments line. The comment line is currently closed but your comment is important to the President and we urge you to send us a comment online at www.WhiteHouse.gov/contact or send us a message through Facebook messenger.”Trump really is becoming the social-media president.Since the end of the transition, when the lines were apparently shut off, the Trump administration has been purging the White House website off all things that generally resemble the Obama White House — and thus anything that has to do with equality and inclusion. So this is just another instance of curtailing the openness of the people’s house.It seems that the 15 percent of American households without internet will not be able to have Trump hear their concerns, who promised to be a champion of all people and listen to their needs.There is no indication yet from the White House whether this is permanent or temporary, as the incoming administration settles into their positions.Still, there was no downtime for this crucial line of democracy when the Obama administration took over in 2009.Given the Trump administration’s penchant for lying and ignoring the people, this should come as no surprise. However, it should worry the public if no future action is taken to address this. The people’s house should be readily available at all times, in all fashions.It’s only day three, and Donald Trump and his team are showing a brazen disregard for the little things that make us great. When studying authoritarians, one must look at how the littlest of things change before their eyes.This might be one of them — a White House that doesn’t want to be bombarded with calls from an outraged public.Featured image by Ron Sachs via Getty ImagesShare this Article!

https://www.snopes.com/politics/quotes/adhd.asp	Dr. Leon Eisenberg — ADHD Is a ‘Fictitious Disease’?	mtrue	['adhd', ' leon eisenberg']	http://www.bmj.com/	http://www.bmj.com/content/339/bmj.b4615.short	2015/03/14	Ned StaffordTransformed child psychiatry by advocating research into developmental problemsEarly in his medical career, in the mid-1950s, Leon Eisenberg became fascinated with the childhood mind. Wanting to know more, he broke free from the shackles of the Freudian psychoanalytic dogma that dominated child psychiatry at the time to conduct groundbreaking biologically based research of childhood developmental problems. This research included the first randomised clinical drug trials in child psychiatry.“I think what Leon brought to the field was a different way of thinking—thinking out of the box,” said David DeMaso, chairman of psychiatry at Boston Children’s Hospital and professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. “He was thinking in terms of biology, of evidence based treatment, way before anybody else. His was a bio-psycho-social model at a time when psychoanalytical thinking was the norm.”Eisenberg’s direct involvement as a child psychiatry researcher was over by 1967, when he moved to Harvard Medical School as chief of psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital. But in a dozen years he had helped transform the discipline.Beginning in 1952 at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Eisenberg began a fellowship under Leo Kanner, the Austrian born child psychiatrist, who, in the early 1940s, first described autism. In a study of autistic adolescents published in 1956, Eisenberg recognised patterns of language use as the best predictor of prognosis. At the time, many patients who are now are diagnosed as having autism were thought to have mental retardation.He followed that paper with a barrage of papers on attention deficit disorder, learning delays, and other childhood problems. In a study of children otherwise developing normally, Eisenberg found that early reading difficulties increased the chances of later bad behaviour.His most revolutionary study came in 1962, when he launched the first randomised clinical drug trial in child psychiatry. In subsequent drug trials he showed that tranquillising drugs were inferior to placebo in the treatment of anxiety disorders and that stimulant drugs could be effective in controlling hyperactivity. Those studies were the first steps towards ever increasing use of drugs to treat child and adolescent disorders, a development that in recent years concerned Eisenberg.Drug companiesDeMaso, who in the late 1970s became one of Eisenberg’s many protégés, said that Eisenberg thought that many psychiatrists were being influenced by drug companies, adding, “He thought children are now being overdiagnosed with bipolar illness and then overmedicated.”Leon Eisenberg was born in Philadelphia on 8 August 1922, the oldest child of Russian immigrants. His father steered him from the beginning towards medical school. But despite near straight As in college, he was turned down by several medical schools because of his Jewish background. Finally, with help from a Pennsylvania state legislator who his father knew, he was admitted to the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.After graduating in 1946 as valedictorian of his class, he took a rotating intern position at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York city, where he became interested in psychiatry. He served two years as a captain in the US Army Medical Corps and in 1952 moved to Johns Hopkins, becoming chief of child psychiatry in 1961. He held the position until becoming chief of psychiatry in 1967 at Harvard, where his focus shifted to training new generations of researchers.Although Eisenberg has been widely recognised for his childhood research, the Harvard psychiatrist and anthropologist Arthur Kleinman thinks that his contributions from the 1970s onward are as important. Kleinman, a psychiatry resident in the 1970s under Eisenberg, said that he converted the department from a small group of mostly psychoanalysts to a diverse and vibrant national powerhouse that helped shape modern psychiatry. “He made that department,” Kleinman says. “He set the intellectual tone to be highly academic.”In 1968 Eisenberg also became a leading proponent of affirmative action for African Americans and other minorities at Harvard Medical School, guided by his own experiences of discrimination as a Jew in the 1940s.Social sciencesDuring the 1970s, Eisenberg advocated a closer relationship between medicine and the social sciences, which he thought would improve medical care by, as Kleinman put it, “bringing biology together with the social world.” In 1980 Eisenberg became founding chairman of Harvard’s department of social medicine, a position he held until 1991. Eisenberg was the ideal choice to guide the new department, said Kleinman, adding, “He had an omnivorous hunger for knowledge that went across the fields.”Eisenberg was honoured with numerous awards, including the distinguished service award and special presidential commendation from the American Psychiatric Association. He served from 1964 as mental health consultant to the World Health Organization in multiple capacities and was an honorary fellow of the UK Royal College of Psychiatrists.On 1 July this year, the Leon Eisenberg chair in child psychiatry at the Children’s Hospital Boston was officially launched, with DeMaso named as the first holder. Decades after his groundbreaking studies, he still yearned to better understand the childhood mind. “I was eating lunch with him about a year ago, and he told me that more child psychiatry research was needed,” said DeMaso. “He asked me, ‘What are you doing about encouraging your psychiatrists to do more research? They need to do more research. We need more research.’” And DeMaso dutifully followed the advice of his mentor. “We are going to do more research in child psychiatry,” he says. “We are planning to focus on training the next generation of child psychiatry researchers.”Eisenberg leaves his wife, Carola, former dean of students at Harvard Medical School and a cofounder of Physicians for Human Rights, two children from a previous marriage, and two stepsons.NotesCite this as: BMJ 2009;339:b4615Footnotes

I mean…they live in trailers by the water, right?”Clinton began to laugh but Maddow stopped her:“Madam Secretary, that’s not funny. There are 37 million people in the path of the worst storm our country has seen since Katrina and it will probably do more damage. That was callous and wrong. You’ve been poisoned. Not everything is politics.”Maddow cancelled the interview and agreed to bury the footage, but one sound engineer who is a true patriot managed to keep a copy:“As soon as I heard her say it I knew she screwed up real bad. She was talking to people backstage about running for president again in 2020. There ain’t no way she’s gonna run now. Not without making me a very rich man.”The engineer, who refused to be named, says he will hold onto the footage until he needs it to either “save the country or himself.” He says he’s made “arrangements” in case anything happens to him. Share This As American As Apple Pie Article Now!3.5k

There’s literally no water. The beach and ocean are gone.”He tweeted a follow-up video that showed how the water had retreated at a beach in Long Island, Bahamas.By playing this video you agree to Twitter's use of cookiesThis use may include analytics, personalization, and ads.Download“Basically, Hurricane Irma is so strong and its pressure is so low, it’s sucking water from its surroundings into the core of the storm,” Fritz wrote.“In the center of the storm, where there is extreme low pressure, water is drawn upward. Low pressure is basically a sucking mechanism — it sucks the air into it, and when it’s really low, it can change the shape of the surface of the ocean. As the storm draws water toward the center, it gets pulled away from the surroundings.”Wayne Neely, a forecaster with the Bahamas’ Department of Meteorology, warned residents of Long Island and Exuma, where water had also reportedly receded from the beaches, to be careful as the ocean returned back to high levels.“Care must be taken in this case because the water often returns with even greater fury,” Neely said in a Facebook post explaining the phenomenon.SECURITY WARNING: Please treat the URL above as you would your password and do not share it with anyone.

Dermatologist Dawn Marie Davies, from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, warns sunbed users could be putting themselves at risk of contracting the sexually transmitted infection, herpesGenital herpes is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another via skin-to-skin contact.It is commonly passed on through sex and oral sex.Once a person is infected with the virus it can reactivate every so often to cause a new episode of painful genital herpes.There is no complete cure for the infection - rather, a sufferer will be given treatment each time they suffer a flare up.

Ultraviolet light can theoretically kill germs, but it's not enough to kill germs on the tanning bed Dermatologist, Dawn Marie Davies  Bacteria that lies on a person's skin can easily be transferred to the bed, when a person is lying down.The heat - not high enough to kill the infection - allows the bacteria to develop to become stronger and more able to survive.When a person sweats, it provides a breeding ground for bacteria or viruses. It is then possible for the infection to transfer to another sunbed user, entering the body via a small cut or nick in the skin, often so small a person may be unaware.'Ultraviolet light can theoretically kill germs, but it's not enough to kill germs on the tanning bed,' Professor Davies warned.'What's interesting is that when you use the ultraviolet light over and over again - and the tanning bed lights are on for multiple hours a day - if the bacteria or virus is exposed to some antiseptic but not enough to kill it, or some light but not enough to kill it, it can grow stronger and then it becomes resistant.'  GENITAL HERPES: A HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS, INCURABLE STI    Genital herpes is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another via skin-to-skin contact.It is commonly passed on through sex and oral sex.Once a person is infected with the virus it can reactivate every so often to cause a new episode of painful genital herpes.A recurrence of the virus is often triggered by being unwell, stress, drinking excess alcohol, exposure to ultraviolet light, for example, using sunbeds, and having a weakened immune system.   Herpes is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another via skin-to-skin contact. Professor Davies warns that the virus can remain on tanning beds, infecting other sunbed users Symptoms of genital herpes include:small blisters that burst to leave red, open sores around your genitals, thighs and buttocksblisters and ulcers on the cervixvaginal discharge in women pain passing urine a general feeling of being unwell, with aches, pains and flu-like symptoms These symptoms may last up to 20 days, but the sores will eventually scab and heal without scarring.Although the initial symptoms of genital herpes clear up, the virus remains dormant.It can be reactivated, causing recurrences, which are usually shorter and less severe.

General MacArthur's Thayer Award Speech -- Duty, Honor, Country (1962)

 The address by General of the Army Douglas MacArthur to the cadets of
the U.S. Military Academy in accepting the Sylvanus Thayer Award on 12 May 1962
is a memorable tribute to the ideals that inspired that great American soldier. For as long as other Americans serve their country as courageously and honorably
as he did, General MacArthur's words will live on. General MacArthur's service to his country spanned  the years from
1903, when he was graduated from the Military Academy, to 5 April 1964 , when he
died in Washington, D.C., at the age of 84. He was recognized early in his
career as a brilliant officer and was advanced to brigadier general in 1918. Twelve years later he was named Chief of Staff of the Army, and in 1937 he
retired. Recalled to active duty during World War II, he was commander of the
Southwest Pacific Area during the greater part of the war. His wartime triumphs
were followed by service as supreme commander of the Allied occupation forces in
Japan. When the Korean conflict erupted, he also commanded the United Nations
forces in Korea. He completed his active military service in 1951. Before being laid to rest in Norfolk, Va., General MacArthur's body lay
in state in New York City and in the Capitol rotunda in Washington, while a
grateful Nation paid its tribute in sorrow. Duty, Honor, Country

 No human being could fail to be deeply moved by such a tribute as this
[Thayer Award]. Coming from a profession I have served so long and a people I
have loved so well, it fills me with an emotion I cannot express. But this
award is not intended primarily to honor a personality, but to symbolize a great
moral code-a code of conduct and chivalry of those who guard this beloved land
of culture and ancient descent. For all hours and for all time, it is an
expression of the ethics of the American soldier. That I should be integrated
in this way with so noble an ideal arouses a sense of pride, and yet of
humility, which will be with me always. Duty, honor, country:  Those three hallowed words reverently dictate what
you ought to be, what you can be, what you will be. They are your rallying
point to build courage when courage seems to fail, to regain faith when there
seems to be little cause for faith, to create hope when hope becomes forlorn. Unhappily, I possess neither that eloquence of diction, that poetry of
imagination, nor that brilliance of metaphor to tell you all that they mean. The unbelievers will say they are but words, but a slogan, but a flamboyant
phrase. Every pedant, every demagogue, every cynic, every hypocrite, every
troublemaker, and, I am sorry to say, some others of an entirely different
character, will try to downgrade them even to the extent of mockery and
ridicule. But these are some of the things they do. They build your basic character. They mold you for your future roles as the custodians of the Nation's defense. They make you strong enough to know when you are weak, and brave enough to face
yourself when you are afraid. What the Words Teach

 They teach you to be proud and unbending in honest failure, but humble and
gentle in success; not to substitute words for actions, not to seek the path of
comfort, but to face the stress and spur of difficulty and challenge; to learn
to stand up in the storm, but to have compassion on those who fall; to master
yourself before you seek to master others; to have a heart that is clean, a goal
that is high; to learn to laugh, yet never forget how to weep; to reach into the
future, yet never neglect the past; to be serious, yet never to take yourself
too seriously; to be modest so that you will remember the simplicity of true
greatness, the open mind of true wisdom, the meekness of true strength. They give you a temperate will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of
the emotions, a freshness of the deep springs of life, a temperamental
predominance of courage over timidity, of an appetite for adventure over love of
ease. They create in your heart the sense of wonder, the unfailing hope of what
next, and joy and inspiration of life. They teach you in this way to be an
officer and a gentleman. And what sort of soldiers are those you are to lead? Are they reliable? Are they brave? Are they capable of victory? Their story is known to all of you. It is the story of the American
man-at-arms. My estimate of him was formed on the battlefield many, many years
ago, and has never changed. I regarded him then, as I regard him now, as one of
the world's noblest figures; not only as one of the finest military characters,
but also as one of the most stainless. His name and fame are the birthright of every American citizen. In his
youth and strength, his love and loyalty, he gave all that mortality can give. He needs no eulogy from me; or from any other man. He has written his own
history and written it in red on his enemy's breast. But when I think of his patience in adversity of his courage under fire and
of his modesty in victory, I am filled with an emotion of admiration I cannot
put into words. He belongs to history as furnishing one of the greatest
examples of successful patriotism. He belongs to posterity as the instructor of
future generations in the principles of liberty and freedom. He belongs to the
present, to us, by his virtues and by his achievements. Witness to the Fortitude

 In 20 campaigns, on a hundred battlefields, around a thousand camp fires, I
have witnessed that enduring fortitude, that patriotic self-abnegation, and that
invincible determination which have carved his statue in the hearts of his
people. From one end of the world to the other, he has drained deep the chalice of
courage. As I listened to those songs [of the glee club], in memory's eye I
could see those staggering columns of the first World War, bending under soggy
packs on many a weary march, from dripping dusk to drizzling dawn, slogging
ankle deep through the mire of shell-pocked roads to form grimly for the attack,
bule-lipped, covered with sludge and mud, chilled by the wind and rain, driving
home to their objective, and for many to the judgment seat of God. I do not know the dignity of their birth, but I do know the glory of their
death. They died, unquestioning, uncomplaining, with faith in their hearts, and
on their lips the hope that we would go on to victory. Always for them: Duty, honor, country. Always their blood, and sweat, and
tears, as we sought the way and the light and the truth. And 20 years after, on
the other side of the globe, again the filth of murky foxholes, the stench of
ghostly trenches, the slime of dripping dugouts, those boiling suns of
relentless heat, those torrential rains of devastating storms, the loneliness
and utter desolation of jungle trails, the bitterness of long separation from
those they loved and cherished, the deadly pestilence of tropical disease, the
horror of stricken areas of war. Swift and Sure Attack

 Their resolute and determined defense, their swift and sure attack, their
indomitable purpose, their complete and decisive victory - always through the
bloody haze of their last reverberating shot, the vision of gaunt, ghastly men,
reverently following your password of duty, honor, country. The code which those words perpetuate embraces the highest moral law and
will stand the test of any ethics or philosophies ever promulgated for the
things that are right and its restraints are from the things that are wrong. The soldier, above all other men, is required to practice the greatest act of
religious training--sacrifice. In battle, and in the face of danger and death,
he discloses those divine attributes which his Maker gave when He created man in
His own image. No physical courage and no greater strength can take the place
of the divine help which alone can sustain him. However hard the incidents of
war may be, the soldier who is called upon to offer and to give his life for his
country is the noblest development of mankind. You now face a new world, a world of change. The thrust into outer space
of the satellite, spheres, and missiles marks a beginning of another epoch in
the long story of mankind. In the five or more billions of years the scientists
tell us it has taken to form the earth, in the three or more billion years of
development of the human race, there has never been a more abrupt or staggering
evolution. We deal now, not with things of this world alone, but with the illimitable
distances and as yet unfathomed mysteries of the universe. We are reaching out
for a new and boundless frontier. We speak in strange terms of harnessing the
cosmic energy, of making winds and tides work for us, of creating unheard of
synthetic materials to supplement or even replace our old standard basics; to
purify sea water for our drink; of mining ocean floors for new fields of wealth
and food; of disease preventatives to expand life into the hundred of years; of
controlling the weather for a more equitable distribution of heat and cold, of
rain and shine; of spaceships to the moon; of the primary target in war, no
longer limited to the armed forces of an enemy, but instead to include his civil
populations; of ultimate conflict between a united human race and the sinister
forces of some other planetary galaxy; of such dreams and fantasies as to make
life the most exciting of all times. And through all this welter of change and development your mission remains
fixed, determined, inviolable. It is to win our wars. Everything else in your
professional career is but corollary to this vital dedication. All other public
purposes, all other public projects, all other public needs, great or small,
will find others for their accomplishment; but you are the ones who are trained
to fight. The Profession of Arms

 Yours is the profession of arms, the will to win, the sure knowledge that
in war there is no substitute for victory, that if you lose, the Nation will be
destroyed, that the very obsession of your public service must be duty, honor,
country. Others will debate the controversial issues, national and international,
which divide men's minds. But serene, calm, aloof, you stand as the Nation's
war guardian, as its lifeguard from the raging tides of international conflict,
as its gladiator in the arena of battle. For a century and a half you have
defended, guarded, and protected its hallowed traditions of liberty and freedom,
of right and justice. Let civilian voices argue the merits or demerits of our processes of
government:  Whether our strength is being sapped by deficit financing indulged
in too long, by Federal paternalism grown too mighty, by power groups grown too
arrogant, by politics grown too corrupt, by crime grown too rampant, by morals
grown too low, by taxes grown too high, by extremists grown too violent; whether
our personal liberties are as thorough and complete as they should be. These great national problems are not for your professional participation
or military solution. Your guidepost stands out like a ten-fold beacon in the
night:  Duty, honor, country. You are the leaven which binds together the entire fabric of our national
system of defense. From your ranks come the great captains who hold the
Nation's destiny in their hands the moment the war tocsin sounds. The long, gray line has never failed us. Were you to do so, a million
ghosts in olive drab, in brown khaki, in blue and gray, would rise from their
white crosses, thundering those magic words: Duty, honor, country. Prays for Peace

 This does not mean that you are warmongers. On the contrary, the soldier
above all other people prays for peace, for he must suffer and bear the deepest
wounds and scars of war. But always in our ears ring the ominous words of
Plato, that wisest of all philosophers: ""Only the dead have seen the end of
war."" The shadows are lengthening for me. The twilight is here. My days of old
have vanished--tone and tint. They have gone glimmering through the dreams of
things that were. Their memory is one of wondrous beauty, watered by tears and
coaxed and caressed by the smiles of yesterday. I listen vainly, but with
thirsty ear, for the witching melody of faint bugles blowing reveille, of far
drums beating the long roll. In my dreams I hear again the crash of guns, the rattle of musketry, the
strange, mournful mutter of the battlefield. But in the evening of my memory
always I come back to West Point. Always there echoes and re-echoes: Duty,
honor, country. Today marks my final roll call with you. But I want you to know that when
I cross the river, my last conscious thoughts will be of the corps, and the
corps, and the corps. I bid you farewell. The text of this speech is reproduced from Department of Defense
Pamphlet GEN-1A, US Government Printing Office, 1964. The address by General of the Army Douglas MacArthur to the cadets of
the U.S. Military Academy in accepting the Sylvanus Thayer Award on 12 May 1962
is a memorable tribute to the ideals that inspired that great American soldier. For as long as other Americans serve their country as courageously and honorably
as he did, General MacArthur's words will live on. General MacArthur's service to his country spanned  the years from
1903, when he was graduated from the Military Academy, to 5 April 1964 , when he
died in Washington, D.C., at the age of 84. He was recognized early in his
career as a brilliant officer and was advanced to brigadier general in 1918. Twelve years later he was named Chief of Staff of the Army, and in 1937 he
retired. Recalled to active duty during World War II, he was commander of the
Southwest Pacific Area during the greater part of the war. His wartime triumphs
were followed by service as supreme commander of the Allied occupation forces in
Japan. When the Korean conflict erupted, he also commanded the United Nations
forces in Korea. He completed his active military service in 1951. Before being laid to rest in Norfolk, Va., General MacArthur's body lay

Founded to test tactics, techniques, procedures and equipment, HMX-1 has since then, become synonymous with helicopter transport of the President of the United States.In 1957, rotary wing movement of the President, Vice President, and other important personnel originated, as President Dwight D. Eisenhower – away on vacation – was urgently needed back at the White House. What would have been a two hour motorcade trip was reduced to a seven minute helicopter ride. On that day, HMX-1 earned its most prestigious of missions – direct support of the President.In addition to Presidential and VIP support, the “Nighthawks” of HMX-1 maintains the role as the primary Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) unit for Marine assault support helicopters and related equipment. Indeed, the same pilots and aircrew supporting the President are often testing and evaluating aircraft and systems used by the Fleet Marine Forces. HMX-1 aircraft and Marines also support the Marine Corps Combat Development Command in the development of helicopter tactics, techniques and landing force equipment, as well as for student demonstrations and helicopter indoctrination. The squadron currently operates a fleet of “White Top” VH-3D ""Sea King"" and VH-60N ""White Hawk” and the “Green Top” MV-22B ""Osprey"".Welcome Aboard"

Many individuals are incidentally exposed to secondhand cannabis smoke, but little is known about the effects of this exposure. This report examines the physiological, subjective, and behavioral/cognitive effects of secondhand cannabis exposure, and the influence of room ventilation on these effects.MethodsNon-cannabis-using individuals were exposed to secondhand cannabis smoke from six individuals smoking cannabis (11.3% THC) ad libitum in a specially constructed chamber for one hour. Chamber ventilation was experimentally manipulated so that participants were exposed under unventilated conditions or with ventilation at a rate of 11 air exchanges/hour. Physiological, subjective and behavioral/cognitive measures of cannabis exposure assessed after exposure sessions were compared to baseline measures.ResultsExposure to secondhand cannabis smoke under unventilated conditions produced detectable cannabinoid levels in blood and urine, minor increases in heart rate, mild to moderate self-reported sedative drug effects, and impaired performance on the Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST). One urine specimen tested positive at using a 50 ng/mL cut-off and several specimens were positive at 20 ng/mL. Exposure under ventilated conditions resulted in much lower blood cannabinoid levels, and did not produce sedative drug effects, impairments in performance, or positive urine screen results.ConclusionsRoom ventilation has a pronounced effect on exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke. Under extreme, unventilated conditions, secondhand cannabis smoke exposure can produce detectable levels of THC in blood and urine, minor physiological and subjective drug effects, and minor impairment on a task requiring psychomotor ability and working memory.Keywords: Cannabis, Marijuana, THC, Exposure, Secondhand, Cognitive1. INTRODUCTIONCannabis is the most widely used illicit drug globally ( World Health Organization, 2014 ). The most popular route of administration is smoking, which often occurs indoors, in automobiles, or in other areas where ventilation is limited or variable. Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive component of cannabis, is present in both mainstream smoke (inhaled by the user) and sidestream smoke (dispersed into environment; Cone et al., 1987 ; Fehr and Kalant, 1972 ; Matthais et al., 1997 ). Metabolism of THC yields the psychoactive metabolite, 11-hydroxy-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (11-OH-THC), which is present in blood after active or passive exposure to cannabis smoke ( Huestis et al., 1992 ; Moore et al., 2011 ). THC and 11-OH-THC have similar behavioral effects, but 11-OH-THC levels peak later than THC levels after cannabis exposure ( Hollister and Gillespie, 1975 ; Huestis et al., 1992 ; Järbe et al., 1994 ; Kosersky et al., 1974 ; Lemberger et al., 1973 ). Metabolism of 11-OH-THC yields 11-nor-9-carboxy- Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH). THC-COOH is non-psychoactive, but its long half-life (~140 hours) makes it a common biomarker in urine testing for cannabis use.Many individuals are passively exposed to secondhand cannabis smoke given the current prevalence and patterns of cannabis use, however, there has been little controlled research examining the consequences of secondhand exposure. Most research on secondhand cannabis smoke exposure has focused on detection of cannabinoids (e.g., THC, 11-OH-THC, THC-COOH) in various biological matrices. Cone and Johnson (1986) exposed five healthy men to passive smoke from either 4 or 16 cannabis cigarettes (2.8% THC) in a small, enclosed room for one hour each day on six consecutive days. This secondhand smoke exposure reliably produced detectable levels of cannabinoids in urine and plasma, which varied in an orderly relation to dose (i.e., cannabinoid levels were higher after exposure to smoke from 16 cannabis cigarettes vs. 4 cigarettes). Similar results were obtained from studies using comparable designs (i.e., secondhand cannabis smoke exposure in small closed rooms or motor vehicles; Law et al., 1984 ; Mason et al., 1983 ; Mørland et al., 1985 ; Perez-Reyes et al., 1983 ).At least four limitations impede interpretation of these studies with regard to current real-world secondhand cannabis smoke exposure scenarios. First, exposure in these studies always occurred under the “extreme” conditions (i.e., in small spaces without ventilation). Because secondhand cannabis exposure in the real world occurs under conditions with different degrees of air ventilation (e.g., in rooms with air conditioning or open windows, or outdoors), research examining the effects of ventilation on exposure levels is needed. Second, the average potency of “street” cannabis has increased more than 3-fold in the time since these studies were conducted (sinsemilla cannabis seized from 2002–2008 by federal and state law enforcement agencies in the U.S. averaged 11.1% to 11.9% THC; Mehmedic et al., 2010 ). To our knowledge, only one controlled study has examined passive exposure to higher potency cannabis (10.4% THC) that more closely resembles street cannabis available today ( Niedbala et al., 2005 ). A more thorough examination of secondhand exposure using higher potency cannabis is needed to better model passive exposure to today’s cannabis and its potential effects on drug test results. Third, only one study has reported both physiological and subjective effects of secondhand cannabis exposure ( Cone and Johnson, 1986 ). Cone and Johnson (1986) reported that secondhand cannabis exposure had no systematic effects on heart rate or blood pressure, and that participant’s ratings of subjective drug effects increased significantly after exposure to smoke from 16 cannabis cigarettes relative to placebo ratings. These effects were most pronounced during the first hour after exposure, and resolved within three hours. Fourth, no prior studies have evaluated the effects of secondhand cannabis smoke exposure on behavioral/cognitive performance. Expanded research on the effects of secondhand cannabis smoke exposure in the areas outlined above is timely and warranted.The present study was conducted to examine the influence of variations in cannabis potency (5.3% THC vs. 11.3% THC) and in room ventilation (unventilated vs. standard residential ventilation) on the effects of secondhand cannabis smoke exposure. The primary objective of the study was to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of cannabinoids in various biological matrices following secondhand smoke exposure in order to inform federal workplace drug testing standards. A detailed report of the urine cannabinoid concentrations has been previously published ( Cone et al., 2015 ). Here, we report the outcomes of pharmacodynamic assessments, cannabinoid concentrations in whole blood, and provide a brief summary of the urine results. Data analysis was restricted to comparisons of the ventilated vs. unventilated sessions with the same potency of cannabis (11.3% THC) because over 40% more 11.3% THC cannabis was consumed than 5.3% THC cannabis (14.4 grams total vs. 10.2 grams total) in comparable (unventilated) study sessions. The different levels of cannabis consumption between these 2 conditions preclude our ability to validly compare the effects of cannabis potency on study outcomes, particularly pharmacodynamic measures. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate the effect of room ventilation on secondhand cannabis smoke exposure and is among the few secondhand cannabis smoke studies to examine pharmacodynamic outcomes or utilize cannabis with a potency that is representative of current “street” cannabis.2. METHODS2.1. Participants2.1.1. RecruitmentFrequent cannabis users and cannabis nonusers were recruited from the greater Baltimore, MD area via media advertising and word-of-mouth communication. Interested participants completed a screening session to determine eligibility. Participants provided written informed consent during the screening session. The Institutional Review Board at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine approved this study.2.1.2. SmokersCannabis users were eligible to participate as smokers if they: (1) were 18–45 years old, (2) reported using cannabis at least two times per week throughout the past 90 days, (3) provided a urine specimen that was positive for THC-COOH and negative for other drugs of abuse at screening and on the day of each study session, (4) had a negative breath alcohol reading at screening and on the day of each study session, (5) had a body mass index of 19–34 kg/m2, (6) were judged to be in good general heath based on physical examination, and (7) were not pregnant or nursing. Cannabis users were encouraged to participate in all three of the exposure sessions as a means of reducing between-session variability in smoke exposure among nonsmokers. Smokers were instructed to remain abstinent from cannabis overnight prior to exposure sessions.2.1.3. NonsmokersIndividuals who were not current cannabis users were eligible to participate in the study if they: (1) were 18–45 years old, (2) reported cannabis use at least once in their lifetime, but not within the prior 6 months, (3) provided a urine specimen that was negative for drugs of abuse at screening and on the day of study admission, (4) had a negative breath alcohol reading at screening and on the day of participation, (5) had a BMI ranging from 19–34 kg/m2, (6) were judged to be in good general heath based on a full physical examination, and (7) were not pregnant or nursing. Each nonsmoker participated in only one exposure session due to concern that residual effects of cannabis exposure in one session might influence results of subsequent sessions. Because the primary aim of this study was to examine the pharmacokinetic profile of secondhand cannabis smoke exposure, we restricted the nonsmoker group to individuals who were not current cannabis users so that they would not have residual cannabinoids in biological matrices (e.g., urine, saliva) at baseline.2.2. Experimental ProcedureThree secondhand cannabis exposure sessions were conducted at the Johns Hopkins University Bayview campus. The first session involved exposure to cannabis containing 5.3% THC in an unventilated environment, the second session involved exposure to cannabis containing 11.3% THC in an unventilated environment, and the third session involved exposure to cannabis containing 11.3% THC in a ventilated environment. We only describe results from the second and third sessions here.Smokers and non-smokers arrived at approximately 0700 hours on session days. Drug and alcohol testing was conducted upon arrival to confirm that participants still met study eligibility requirements regarding substance use. Smokers were reminded of abstinence requirements the day before each session took place, and study staff met with active smokers when they arrived on session days to check for signs of recent cannabis use (e.g., bloodshot eyes, odor of cannabis smoke) to verify reported abstinence. Nonsmokers were required to urine test negative for cannabis. Nursing staff placed an intravenous catheter in the non-dominant arm of each participant for repeated blood sampling. Tobacco and caffeine use was not permitted during study sessions. One nonsmoker was a daily tobacco user, and was provided with nicotine patches in order to reduce the potential effect of nicotine withdrawal on study outcomes.After completing baseline assessments, 6 cannabis smokers and 6 nonsmokers entered a specially constructed smoke exposure chamber (approximately 0900 hours). The chamber measured 10 ft. × 13 ft. (3.05 m × 3.96 m) with a 7 ft. (2.13 m) ceiling, was constructed using a combination of Plexiglas and aluminum support beams, and incorporated an adjustable ventilation/exhaust system. Smokers and nonsmokers sat around a table in alternating seats. All participants wore protective clothing over their normal clothes (disposable booties, jumpsuits) during the exposure session, and were provided with swimming goggles to prevent eye irritation from accumulated smoke.During the unventilated exposure session, ducts at both the intake and exhaust manifolds of the chamber were capped, eliminating the inflow/outflow of air. During the ventilated session a central air conditioning unit fed cool air through a 9.5 in2 (24 cm2) intake register at one end of the chamber. On the opposite end, air was exhausted through a 9.5 in2 (24 cm2) register into a ventilation shaft that contained a motorized fan. The ventilation system was calibrated to achieve an airflow rate of 11 air-exchanges/hour, which is consistent with residential ventilation standards based on the size of the chamber. Other than the differences in ventilation and select study participants, both session protocols were identical.Each smoker was provided with 10 cannabis cigarettes obtained from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Drug Supply Program and a CReSS Pocket smoking topography device (Borgwaldt KC, Richmond, VA, USA). Each cannabis cigarette contained approximately 1 gram of high potency (11.3% THC) cannabis. The door to the chamber was sealed using magnetic strips around the frame of the door at the start of each 60-minute exposure session. Active smokers were instructed to smoke the provided cannabis cigarettes ad libitum through the CReSS device, which measured the number of puffs taken, puff volume, and other parameters of smoking behavior. Participants were instructed to remain seated for the entirety of the session, but were allowed to engage in leisure activities (e.g., talking, reading, using personal electronic devices, etc.). Research staff monitored the exposure session from outside the chamber to ensure nonsmokers did not actively inhale from the cannabis cigarettes and that smokers only consumed cigarettes from their own supply. Pulse oximeters were used to monitor blood oxygen concentration of study participants every 15 minutes to ensure an adequate oxygen supply was maintained in the chamber.After 60 minutes the door to the exposure chamber was opened; participants then exited the chamber, immediately discarded protective clothing, and washed their hands and face to minimize contamination of biological samples collected after exposure. Participants then proceeded to a large room where they completed study assessments at regular intervals for 8 hours post-exposure among smokers and 34 hours post-exposure among non-smokers.2.3. Assessments2.3.1. Measures of cannabis exposureThe total weight of cannabis cigarettes, including butts and loose plant material, was obtained for each participant prior to and immediately after each session to determine the amount of cannabis combusted. We examined CReSS data on total puff volume to assess temporal characteristics of cannabis consumption. Biological samples (blood, urine, saliva, hair) were obtained for 8-hours post exposure among smokers and for up to 34 hours among nonsmokers. Whole blood specimens (10 mL) were obtained from indwelling venous catheters using grey-top vacutainer blood collection tubes at baseline, immediately after exiting the smoke chamber (Time “0”) and 0.5 (30 minutes), 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 22, 26, 30, and 34 hours after exposure. Spot urine specimens were collected hourly for the first 4 hours and then pooled specimens were obtained for hours 6–8, 8–10, 10–12, 12–22, 22–26, 26–30, and 30–34. Quantitative testing for cannabinoids (THC, 11-OH-THC, THC-COOH) in whole blood was conducted by Immunalysis Corp (Pomona, CA) using LC/MS/MS, with a 0.5 ng/mL limit of quantitation. Urinalysis testing for THC-COOH was performed by Clinical Reference Laboratory (Lenexa, KS) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) with cut-offs of both 20 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL and confirmatory GS/MS with a 0.75 ng/mL limit of quantitation (see Cone et al., 2015 ).2.3.2. Physiological AssessmentsHeart rate (BPM) and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mm/hg) were measured using automated monitors while participants were in the seated position at baseline, immediately after exiting the smoke exposure chamber (Time “0”), and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 22, 26, 30, and 34 hours post-exposure.2.3.3. Self-Report AssessmentsParticipants completed a 15-item Drug Effect Questionnaire (DEQ) to assess subjective ratings of drug effects. Individual items on the DEQ included three ratings of drug effects (“do you feel a drug effect?,” “do you feel a pleasant drug effect?,” “do you feel an unpleasant drug effect?”) and twelve ratings of behavioral/mood states often associated with cannabis intoxication (“sick”, “heart racing”, “anxious”, “relaxed”, “paranoid”, “tired”, “alert”, “irritable”, “vigorous”, “restless”, “hungry/have munchies”, “craving cannabis”). Participants rated each item using a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) anchored with “not at all” on one end and “extremely” on the other. The DEQ was administered at baseline and at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 22, 26, 30, and 34 hours post-exposure.2.3.4. Behavioral/Cognitive AssessmentsParticipants completed three different computerized behavioral tasks to assess aspects of psychomotor/cognitive performance known to be sensitive to the acute effects of smoked cannabis and relevant to functioning in the workplace and/or operating a motor vehicle or heavy machinery ( Hooker and Jones, 1987 ; Wilson et al., 1994 ). Study participants completed each task three times during the screening visit while under the supervision of study staff in order to ensure proper understanding and minimize the influence of practice effects on task performance during the study, and were administered at baseline and at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 hours post-exposure.2.3.4.1. Divided Attention Task (DAT; Casswell and Marks, 1973 )On this task, participants simultaneously tracked a central stimulus and monitored peripheral stimuli. The central stimulus was a diamond that moved back and forth horizontally across the computer screen. Participants were instructed to track this stimulus using the computer mouse while monitoring a target digit at the lower center of the computer screen. Peripheral stimuli were digits (1–9) that appeared in each of the four corners of the screen. Participants were instructed to click the computer mouse once each time one of the digits in the corners of the screen matched the target digit. Task duration was 6 minutes. Primary outcomes on the DAT are the number of correct peripheral targets identified, reaction time (milliseconds) on correct responses, and mean distance (number of pixels) of cursor from the central stimulus.2.3.4.2. Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST; McLeod et al., 1982 )On this task, participants viewed a series of nine geometric patterns. Each pattern was numbered (1–9) and consisted of three highlighted squares on a 3×3 grid. When the number associated with a particular pattern appeared on the center of the screen, participants were instructed to replicate the shape of that pattern using the an assigned 3×3 section of the computer keyboard. Task duration was 90 seconds. Primary outcomes of the DSST were total number of trials attempted, total number correct, and percentage of attempted trials completed correctly.2.3.4.3. Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT; Gronwall et al., 1977 )On this task, participants were presented with a string of single digit integers on the computer screen. Participants were instructed to calculate the sum of each successive pair of integers presented and select the correct answer from a list of choices displayed on the screen using the computer mouse. These integers appeared on the screen every 2.8 seconds during the initial battery of 30 trials. Following a 30 second break, integers appeared every 2.4 seconds during the second battery of 60 additional trials. Task duration was 5 minutes. Primary outcomes on the PASAT were total number of trials correct, and reaction time (milliseconds) on correct items.2.4. Data AnalysisDemographic variables were compared between smokers and nonsmokers, and between nonsmokers in unventilated and ventilated sessions using independent-samples t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. We limited analyses to the time window when subjective and behavioral/cognitive effects were likely to be observed because of the abundance of zero or near-zero blood cannabinoids levels and subjective drug effect ratings at later post-exposure time points. To select this window, we plotted levels of THC and of 11-OH-THC in whole blood at baseline and during the first four hours post-exposure to examine total intoxicant exposure during the post-exposure timeframe when effects are typically present. Blood cannabinoid levels peaked immediately after exposure and declined to below the level of quantitation by 90 minutes post-exposure among nonsmokers. DEQ ratings of “feel drug effect” appeared to parallel changes in blood cannabinoid levels among both smokers and nonsmokers (see Figure 1 ). Consequently, we limited outcome analyses of physiological, subjective, and behavioral/cognitive effects to the first hour after cannabis exposure.Figure 1Whole blood THC levels, whole blood 11-OH-THC levels, heart rate (BPM) and DEQ visual analog scale ratings (VAS, 0–100) of “feel drug effect” among smokers and nonsmokers in unventilated and ventilated study conditions. Error bars ...We fit mixed effects regression models ( Gueorguieva and Krystal, 2004 ) to assess differences between baseline and the first hour post-exposure for each measure. This model allowed us to compare the mean difference between baseline values and post-exposure values while accounting for (1) within-subject variability among post-exposure time points collected during the first hour after exposure within each session, and (2) between-session variability among baseline measures and post-exposure measures for the five active smokers who completed both exposure sessions. Data from active smokers who participated in multiple sessions were analyzed together and are presented together because their levels of cannabinoid exposure did not significantly differ as a function of room ventilation (see Figure 1 ). The absence of significant effects of cannabis exposure on heart rate among active smokers using mixed effects regression models that included data from the first hour post exposure prompted follow up comparisons between heart rate at baseline and heart rate at Time 0 using a second set of mixed effects regression models in order to examine if any transient effects on heart rate were present in smokers and in nonsmokers. Smokers and nonsmokers were not compared. Data on smokers are presented to serve as a reference for evaluating the levels of biological exposure and corresponding drug effects among nonsmokers. All statistical tests were two-tailed, and significance was determined at p < 0.05.3. RESULTS3.1. ParticipantsTable 1 shows demographics of the nineteen participants (7 smokers and 12 nonsmokers) who completed the high potency (11.3% THC) unventilated and ventilated sessions of the study. Seven smokers were included in analyses because one of the original six participants who completed the unventilated session withdrew from the study and was replaced. There were no significant differences between these groups on any of the variables examined.Demographic characteristics among smokers, nonsmokers in the unventilated session, nonsmokers in the ventilated session. Average grams of cannabis consumed per study session among smokers.3.2. Exposure Session ConditionsSmokers consumed a considerable amount of cannabis in both the unventilated (14.4 grams total) and ventilated (16.5 grams total) exposure sessions. The chamber was visibly very smoky during the unventilated session (became difficult to see through to the opposing wall clearly; see Figure 2 in Cone et al., 2015 ). Cannabis smoke was visible during the ventilated session, but it did not obstruct chamber transparency. CReSS data were available for 10/12 smoking bouts (one CReSS device malfunctioned in the unventilated session and the battery died for one unit during the ventilated session). Data on puff volume indicated that smokers consumed 34% less cannabis during the second 30 minutes of the exposure period than during the first 30 minutes. Participants tolerated both study sessions well, with some complaints of mild eye irritation during the unventilated session, mainly among participants who did not wear or removed their protective eye goggles.3.3. Effects of Cannabis Exposure on Cannabinoid Levels in Blood and Urine3.3.1. SmokersFigure 1 shows mean blood THC levels, blood 11-OH-THC levels, heart rate, and ratings of “feel drug effect” among smokers and nonsmokers at baseline and during the first four hours after exposure. All smokers had detectible levels of THC (mean 4.5 ng/ml) and 11-OH-THC (mean 2.4 ng/ml) at baseline, though all reported overnight abstinence and did not show any evidence of recent cannabis use (e.g., cannabis odor, bloodshot eyes). Blood levels of THC and 11-OH-THC peaked immediately following exposure in both sessions (means of 20.7 ng/ml and 5.6 ng/ml, respectively), and returned to baseline within 4 hours.3.3.2. Nonsmokers3.3.2.1. Unventilated SessionNone of the nonsmokers in the unventilated session had detectable blood cannabinoids at baseline, but all six had detectible levels of THC following secondhand smoke exposure. Levels peaked immediately following exposure (Time 0 mean = 3.2 ng/ml), and remained detectible (>0.5 ng/mL) for 1–3 hours post-exposure. Only one participant had detectible levels of 11-OH-THC following exposure. One urine specimen tested positive in accordance with federal drug testing guidelines (screen with ELISA >50 ng/ml THC-COOH and confirmed with GC/MS >15 ng/ml THC-COOH) 4 hours post-exposure. Using a lower cut-off that is common in some commercial drug testing programs (ELISA >20 ng/ml THC-COOH; GC/MS > 15 ng/mL), 4 of 6 nonsmokers produced urine samples that screened and confirmed positive with a window of detection that ranged from 2 to 22 hours post-exposure.3.3.2.2. Ventilated SessionNone of the nonsmokers in the ventilated session had detectable blood cannabinoids at baseline. Four of the six nonsmokers had detectible levels of blood cannabinoids immediately following exposure. These levels were lower than those observed in the unventilated session (Time 0 mean = 0.7 ng/ml), and were not detectable after Time 0. None of these participants had detectible levels of 11-OH-THC following exposure. No urine samples collected from nonsmokers in the ventilated session screened positive, even using the lower (ELISA >20 ng/ml) cut-off level.3.4. Physiological Effects3.4.1. SmokersTable 2 shows detailed outcomes and results from analyses comparing baseline values to values from the first hour post-exposure for physiological, subjective, and behavioral/cognitive study measures. No significant effects on heart rate were observed using the mixed effects regression model that compared baseline to the first hour post exposure (see Table 2 ). Follow-up analyses that compared baseline heart rate to heart rate at Time 0 indicated no main effect of ventilation condition [beta = 1.21 (SEM = 3.33), p = 0.72], a significant main effect of time, [beta = 10.00 (SEM = 3.20) p = .002), and no ventilation condition by time interaction [beta = −4.83 (SEM = 4.53), p = 0 .29]. These results indicate that heart rate was significantly higher at Time 0 compared with baseline (heart rate increased from 66.8 BPM vs. 76.8 BPM in the unventilated session, and 70.0 BPM vs. 75.2 BPM in the ventilated session following cannabis exposure) and that there was no statistically significantly difference in the effect of time on heart rate between the unventilated and ventilated conditions. A modest but statistically significant reduction in systolic blood pressure was observed after cannabis use among smokers (see Table 2 ). No effect on diastolic blood pressure was observed.Physiological, subjective, and behavioral/cognitive measures among smokers in both sessions, nonsmokers in the unventilated session, and nonsmokers in the ventilated session at the baseline assessment (pre) and the average of assessments during the first ...3.4.2. Nonsmokers3.4.2.1. Unventilated SessionNo significant effect on heart rate was observed with the initial fixed effect regression model comparing baseline heart rate to heart rate during the first hour post exposure (see Table 2 ). Follow up analyses comparing baseline heart rate to heart rate at Time 0 indicated a small, but statistically significant increase in heart rate [65.7 BPM vs. 71.7 BPM, beta = 6.00 (SEM = 2.78) p = 0.03]. There was a non-significant trend toward increased systolic blood pressure following exposure and no effect on diastolic blood pressure (see Table 2 ).3.4.2.2. Ventilated SessionNo significant effects on heart rate or blood pressure were observed (see Table 2 ).3.5. Subjective Effects3.5.1. SmokersRatings of “drug effect,” “pleasant drug effect,” “relaxed,” “vigorous,” and “hungry/have munchies” were significantly higher than baseline during the hour following cannabis exposure. Craving for cannabis was significantly lower than baseline during this period. All of these effects resolved (i.e., returned to baseline) within 4 hours.3.5.2. Nonsmokers3.5.2.1. Unventilated SessionRatings of “drug effect,” “pleasant drug effect,” “tired,” and “hungry/have munchies” were significantly higher than baseline during the hour post exposure. Ratings of “alert” and “vigorous” were significantly lower. These effects resolved within 1.5 hours post exposure.3.5.2.2. Ventilated sessionRatings of “hungry/have munchies” increased significantly from baseline during the first hour post exposure. No other subjective ratings showed significant changes.3.6. Behavioral/Cognitive Effects3.6.1. SmokersAverage cursor distance from target increased significantly from baseline during the first hour post exposure on the DAT, indicating decreased tracking accuracy. Performance did not differ from baseline on any other measures examined.3.6.2. Nonsmokers3.6.2.1. Unventilated sessionThe number of DSST patterns attempted increased significantly from baseline during the hour post-exposure, but the percentage of attempted patterns that were completed correctly decreased significantly. There were no significant changes in total number correct on the DSST or performance on the DAT or PASAT.3.6.2.2. Ventilated sessionThe number of DSST patterns attempted and the number completed correctly increased significantly from baseline during the hour post exposure without a change in percent correct. Total number correct on the PASAT also increased significantly from baseline. Reaction time on the PASAT did not change, nor did performance on the DAT.4. DISCUSSIONThis report describes the first study of which we are aware to examine the influence of room ventilation on secondhand exposure to cannabis smoke, and the first study to examine the effects of secondhand cannabis smoke exposure on behavioral/cognitive performance. Exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke in an unventilated chamber the size of a small room produced minor increases in heart rate, mild to moderate subjective drug effects, and minor, but detectible, levels of performance impairment on some behavioral/cognitive assessments. The time course of these effects paralleled the levels of psychoactive cannabinoids in blood and was followed by detectable levels of THC-COOH in urine. The THC-COOH concentration in one specimen was sufficient to trigger a positive urine drug screen at a cut-off of >50 ng/ml (i.e., the cut-off recommended for use by the SAMHSA mandatory guidelines for federal workplace drug testing programs), and multiple positive urine results were observed for four participants using a more stringent cut-off of >20 ng/ml, which is used by some commercial/private workplace drug testing programs, within a day of exposure. Ventilating the exposure chamber in a manner that approximated standard residential heating or air conditioning units dramatically reduced levels of exposure among nonsmokers, evidenced by much lower (in some cases undetectable) levels of cannabinoids in blood and urine and the absence of subjective and behavioral/cognitive effects.We observed some notable patterns in subjective drug effects. First, the effects reported by nonsmokers in the unventilated condition were small in magnitude and predominantly sedative in nature (increased ratings of “tired” decreased ratings of “alert” and “vigorous”). In contrast, the subjective effects reported by active smokers were larger in magnitude and not exclusively sedative (increases in both “relaxed” and “vigorous”). Differential effects after smoking high-potency cannabis (9.75% and 23.12% THC) have been reported elsewhere in the literature (e.g., decreases in both “alertness” and in “calmness”; Hunault et al., 2014 ). Second, although absolute levels were low, the rise and fall of blood cannabinoid levels observed in nonsmokers following exposure in the unventilated condition paralleled the time course of subjective effects. Because nonsmokers in the ventilated condition did not report subjective drug effects, it is unlikely that the subjective intoxication reported by nonsmokers after the unventilated session was the result of social contagion, since nonsmoking participants were around equivalently-intoxicated active smokers during both study sessions while assessments were being completed. Furthermore, in a prior study of controlled smoked cannabis in our laboratory, subjective drug effects remained elevated from baseline an hour after exposure, while mean plasma THC levels had returned to baseline (about 7 ng/mL) ( Milman et al., 2014 ; Vandrey et al., 2013 ). Indeed, blood cannabinoid concentrations typically peak immediately after inhalation and degrade rapidly, and do not necessarily reflect levels of intoxication (see Hollister et al., 1981 ). However, the influence of expectancy effects resulting from the smokiness of the chamber in the unventilated session was not controlled for, may have affected results, and should be considered when interpreting these outcomes.Nonsmokers in the ventilated session did not have detectable levels of cannabinoids in blood beyond the initial 30 minutes following the exposure period, did not screen positive on urine tests, and did not report significant increases in subjective drug effects except for “hungry/have munchies.” Because this increase did not correspond with any other ratings of drug effect, we interpret the increase in hunger as unrelated to cannabis exposure (lunch hour was approaching). These findings suggest that ventilation dramatically reduces secondhand smoke exposure, even when large quantities of cannabis (~16.5 grams) are smoked in relatively small spaces in a short amount of time. Although room ventilation reduced levels of exposure among nonsmokers, ventilation appeared to have very little effect on levels of cannabinoids in blood or subjective effects among smokers. Smokers consumed an average of 2.6 grams of cannabis each through active smoking, thus, the comparatively small amounts of THC absorbed passively by smokers in the unventilated condition were likely not sufficient to produce additional effects.The finding that exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke under extreme unventilated conditions can produce minor, but detectible impairments in performance on a task that measures psychomotor ability and working memory is novel. Passive exposure increased speed of responding but decreased accuracy, reflecting speed-accuracy trade-offs that are consistent with the effects of THC on behavioral/cognitive performance observed among infrequent cannabis users (e.g., Curran et al., 2002 ). In addition, individuals in the ventilated session showed post-exposure increases in both speed and accuracy on the DSST, and increases in accuracy on the PASAT. The lack of such practice effects among individuals in the unventilated condition may be further evidence of impaired performance, but that cannot be determined with confidence based on the design and small sample size of the present study.Interestingly, although smokers consumed large quantities of cannabis, had increased blood cannabinoid levels, and reported moderate to high levels of subjective effects, the expected increase in heart rate commonly associated with cannabis use was relatively small and only very minor signs of decreased performance on one measure of behavioral/cognitive performance (i.e., the DAT) were observed. This may reflect pharmacodynamic tolerance, as all of the active smokers were chronic heavy cannabis users. It is also possible that larger effects on heart rate and performance were missed. Smokers consumed cannabis over a 60-minute time period, and consumed 34% less cannabis during the second 30 minutes of the exposure period than during the first 30 minutes. Thus, it is possible that more robust physiological changes occurred and smokers were impaired during the exposure period, but this impairment resolved prior to post-exposure testing. The effects of cannabis smoking on heart rate may resolve within 45 minutes of smoking ( Vandrey et al., 2013 ; Cooper and Haney, 2014 ), and heart rate was assessed 30, 60, and 90 minutes after many of the active smokers had ceased intensive smoking. The fact that significant differences in heart rate were observed among smokers when comparing baseline to Time 0, but not when comparing baseline to the first hour post exposure suggests that any effects on heart rate were transient. Although acute THC has been shown to reliably produce cognitive/working memory impairment (see Ranganathan and D’Souza, 2006 for review), many of these studies recruited infrequent or moderate cannabis users. Heavier users may show little if any impairment ( Ramaekers et al., 2009 ). Alternatively, the absence of observed cognitive effects may be the result of acute tolerance within study sessions. Additional research evaluating the effects of cannabis on working memory with infrequent users as smokers utilizing the current study procedure would help with interpretation of these results.The results of this study must be considered in light of its limitations. First, we did not conduct a placebo exposure session (i.e., session where cannabis devoid of THC was smoked), making it impossible to determine whether the subjective and behavioral/cognitive effects observed among active smokers and among nonsmokers in the unventilated session were the result of THC exposure or of expectancy. The design of this study would make a placebo session difficult, as active smokers would likely recognize 0% THC cannabis as placebo during the study session. Thus, it would be unlikely they would smoke sufficient quantities, and likely that they would be vocal about the absence of drug effects during the study session, thereby unblinding nonsmokers. There were a relatively small number of participants in each study session, and all participants were exposed to cannabis smoke and completed assessments simultaneously in the same laboratory room. As a result, it is possible that subjective and behavioral/cognitive effects reported by non-smokers may have been influenced by suggestibility or study demand characteristics. However, the finding that nonsmokers in the ventilated session did not show any drug effects, and that the effects observed among nonsmokers in the unventilated session closely paralleled levels of cannabinoids in blood indicate these effects may be the result of passively-absorbed THC. In addition, the experimental conditions created here do not reflect the full spectrum of secondhand cannabis smoke exposure scenarios that occur outside of the laboratory, and should not be interpreted to reflect normative conditions. This study models two scenarios of acute exposure in an enclosed room. The size of room, amount of cannabis consumed, duration of exposure, and frequency of such exposure are all variables that likely would influence outcomes in the real world. That said, several study participants reported previous secondhand exposure experiences that resembled the unventilated study condition, which indicates our exposure model has some degree of ecological validity. Furthermore, testing the effects of passive exposure among a balanced sample of women and men should be regarded as a strength because it speaks to the generality of our results.In conclusion, this study indicates that absorption of cannabinoids can result from secondhand exposure to cannabis smoke. Room ventilation had a significant impact on the degree of cannabinoid absorption and on resultant pharmacodynamic effects. Nonsmokers exposed under unventilated conditions reported low to moderate levels of sedative drug effects that corresponded with minor impairment in cognitive performance, while nonsmokers exposed under ventilated conditions reported no significant subjective effects and did not have impairment in cognitive performance. These results suggest that extreme conditions like those examined in this study may result in biological exposure sufficient to produce measureable subjective effects, decreases in behavioral/cognitive performance, and could produce a positive drug test result within a short window of time following exposure.​Exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke results in absorption of cannabinoids.Secondhand exposure can produce mild subjective and behavioral/cognitive effectsRoom ventilation ameliorates the effects of secondhand cannabis smoke exposure.AcknowledgmentsRole of Funding SourceFunding for this project was provided by SAMHSA.

I am not a doctor or a scientist or a chemist. I just don’t want what happened to my daughter to happen to anyone else.If you have elementary age kids, you are probably familiar with the current slime obsession. My daughter and her friends became obsessed with it a few months ago and couldn’t get enough of it. So much so that they decided they would start making it themselves at home, a simple endeavor providing you have the right ingredients.Basically, homemade slime consists of:BoraxShaving CreamFood Coloring (optional)You might have also heard how stores can’t even keep enough glue in stock. True story… we had a horrible time finding Elmer’s Glue at our local Walmart, Hobby Lobby and Target.There are variations of the above for sure, but these ingredients are what my daughter and her friends were using to create their slime.We are a pretty healthy family. We get our flu shots each year and my kids have never had strep or flu or bronchial illnesses. They have never had more than your basic cold that lasted a few days. When my 12 year old got sick, we thought it was the same basic cold. Symptoms were the same: cough, sore throat, stuffy nose. She was also complaining about headaches and general achiness. Assuming her symptoms would be relieved in a few days, we didn’t pay them much mind. Unfortunately, they didn’t go away. At all. Weeks later, we were still left wondering what on earth was going on. To the doctor we went. We had her take a throat culture, check her lungs, and ears and sinuses. She found nothing. Other than your basic cold symptoms, there wasn’t anything wrong with her on the surface.You know how as a parent you just kind of the get the feeling that there is more to something than meets the eye? My husband was actually the one who connected the dots. He told me one night, “Do you think it could have something to do with the slime she’s been making?”It was like a lightbulb went off. It kind of made sense all of a sudden. From that moment, we banned her from making, holding, touching or even looking at that darn slime.The very next day, her headache went away. Her throat didn’t hurt anymore. She still had some congestion, but wasn’t coughing. Two days later, the congestion started going away. She was breathing better and talking better. No more achiness.What the what??? Could the homemade slime have been poisoning my daughter?Then this article started to make it around on some of my friends’ Facebook feeds: Schoolyard Slime Craze Risk to Children Says Experts .So I started to investigate a little more about what on earth my child was getting into. What I found out was disturbing.BORAX – From the website, CQ Concepts :Boric acid, sodium borate, and sodium perborate are estimated to have a fatal dose from 0.1 to 0.5g/kg. These substances are toxic to all cells, and have a slow excretion rate through the kidneys. Kidney toxicity is the greatest, with liver fatty degeneration, cerebral edema, and gastroenteritis. Boric acid solutions used as an eye wash or on abraded skin are known to be especially toxic to infants, especially after repeated use due to its slow elimination rate.GLUE – From the website, Mediline Plus :Symptoms of breathing in (“sniffing”) glue fumes may include:AnxietyConvulsions (from breathing in large amounts)Drunk, dazed, or dizzy appearanceExcitability
https://www.snopes.com/america-first-ku-klux-klan-slogan/	Was ‘America First’ a Slogan of the Ku Klux Klan?	true	['america first', ' coin', ' kkk', ' ku klux klan', ' political slogans', ' trump administration']	http://time.com/	http://time.com/4309786/read-donald-trumps-america-first-foreign-policy-speech/	2018/02/09	By Ryan Teague BeckwithUpdated: April 27, 2016 1:37 PM ETRepublican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump outlined an “America first” foreign policy approach in what was billed as a major address at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C.Here is a full transcript of the speech.Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you, and thank you to the Center for National Interest for honoring me with this invitation. It truly is a great honor. I’d like to talk today about how to develop a new foreign policy direction for our country, one that replaces randomness with purpose, ideology with strategy, and chaos with peace.TRUMP: It’s time to shake the rust off America’s foreign policy. It’s time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold, something we have to do. The direction I will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle. My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people and American security above all else. It has to be first. Has to be.That will be the foundation of every single decision that I will make. America…(APPLAUSE)America first will be the major and overriding theme of my administration. But to chart our path forward, we must first briefly take a look back. We have a lot to be proud of.In the 1940s we saved the world. The greatest generation beat back the Nazis and Japanese imperialists. Then we saved the world again. This time, from totalitarianism and communism. The Cold War lasted for decades but, guess what, we won and we won big. Democrats and Republicans working together got Mr. Gorbachev to heed the words of President Reagan, our great president, when he said, tear down this wall.(APPLAUSE)History will not forget what he did. A very special man and president. Unfortunately, after the Cold War our foreign policy veered badly off course. We failed to develop a new vision for a new time. In fact, as time went on, our foreign policy began to make less and less sense. Logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, which led to one foreign policy disaster after another.They just kept coming and coming. We went from mistakes in Iraq to Egypt to Libya, to President Obama’s line in the sand in Syria. Each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper. Very bad. It all began with a dangerous idea that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interests in becoming a western democracy.We tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed. Civil war, religious fanaticism, thousands of Americans and just killed be lives, lives, lives wasted. Horribly wasted. Many trillions of dollars were lost as a result. The vacuum was created that ISIS would fill. Iran, too, would rush in and fill that void much to their really unjust enrichment.They have benefited so much, so sadly, for us. Our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster. No vision. No purpose. No direction. No strategy. Today I want to identify five main weaknesses in our foreign policy.First, our resources are totally over extended. President Obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy. He’s crippled us with wasteful spending, massive debt, low growth, a huge trade deficit and open borders. Our manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching $1 trillion a year.We’re rebuilding other countries while weakening our own. Ending the theft of American jobs will give us resources we need to rebuild our military, which has to happen and regain our financial independence and strength. I am the only person running for the presidency who understands this and this is a serious problem.I’m the only one — believe me, I know them all, I’m the only one who knows how to fix it.(APPLAUSE)Secondly, our allies are not paying their fair share, and I’ve been talking about this recently a lot. Our allies must contribute toward their financial, political, and human costs, have to do it, of our tremendous security burden. But many of them are simply not doing so.TRUMP: They look at the United States as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us. In NATO, for instance, only 4 of 28 other member countries besides America, are spending the minimum required 2 percent of GDP on defense. We have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes, missiles, ships, equipment, building up our military to provide a strong defense for Europe and Asia.The countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense, and if not, the U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves. We have no choice.(APPLAUSE)The whole world will be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and security. A Trump administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded, and funded beautifully.Thirdly, our friends are beginning to think they can’t depend on us. We’ve had a president who dislikes our friends and bows to our enemies, something that we’ve never seen before in the history of our country. He negotiated a disastrous deal with Iran, and then we watched them ignore its terms even before the ink was dry. Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon, cannot be allowed. Remember that, cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.(APPLAUSE)And under a Trump administration, will never, ever be allowed to have that nuclear weapon.(APPLAUSE)All of this without even mentioning the humiliation of the United States with Iran’s treatment of our ten captured sailors — so vividly I remember that day. In negotiation, you must be willing to walk. The Iran deal, like so many of our worst agreements, is the result of not being willing to leave the table.When the other side knows you’re not going to walk, it becomes absolutely impossible to win — you just can’t win. At the same time, your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them. You’ve made that agreement, you have to stand by it and the world will be a better place. President Obama gutted our missile defense program and then abandoned our missile defense plans with Poland and the Czech Republic. He supported the ouster of a friendly regime in Egypt that had a longstanding peace treaty with Israel, and then helped bring the Muslim Brotherhood to power in its place.Israel, our great friend and the one true democracy in the Middle East has been snubbed and criticized by an administration that lacks moral clarity. Just a few days ago, Vice President Biden again criticized Israel, a force for justice and peace, for acting as an impatient peace area in the region.President Obama has not been a friend to Israel. He has treated Iran with tender love and care and made it a great power. Iran has, indeed, become a great, great power in just a very short period of time, because of what we’ve done. All of the expense and all at the expense of Israel, our allies in the region and very importantly, the United States itself.We’ve picked fights with our oldest friends, and now they’re starting to look elsewhere for help. Remember that. Not good.Fourth, our rivals no longer respect us. In fact, they’re just as confused as our allies, but in an even bigger problem is they don’t take us seriously anymore. The truth is they don’t respect us. When President Obama landed in Cuba on Air Force One, to leader was there, nobody, to greet him.Perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of Air Force One. Then amazingly, the same thing happened in Saudi Arabia. It’s called no respect. Absolutely no respect.TRUMP: Do you remember when the president made a long and expensive trip to Copenhagen, Denmark, to get the Olympics for our country, and after this unprecedented effort, it was announced that the United States came in fourth — fourth place? The president of the United States making this trip — unprecedented — comes in fourth place. He should have known the result before making such an embarrassing commitment. We were laughed at all over the world, as we have been many, many times.The list of humiliations go on and on and on. President Obama watches helplessly as North Korea increases its aggression and expands further and further with its nuclear reach. Our president has allowed China to continue its economic assault on American jobs and wealth, refusing to enforce trade deals and apply leverage on China necessary to rein in North Korea. We have the leverage. We have the power over China, economic power, and people don’t understand it. And with that economic power, we can rein in and we can get them to do what they have to do with North Korea, which is totally out of control.He has even allowed China to steal government secrets with cyber attacks and engaged in industrial espionage against the United States and its companies. We’ve let our rivals and challengers think they can get away with anything, and they do. They do at will. It always happens. If President Obama’s goal had been to weaken America, he could not have done a better job.Finally, America no longer has a clear understanding of our foreign policy goals. Since the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the Soviet Union, we’ve lacked a coherent foreign policy. One day, we’re bombing Libya and getting rid of a dictator to foster democracy for civilians. The next day, we’re watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls and absolutely falls apart. Lives lost, massive moneys lost. The world is a different place.We’re a humanitarian nation, but the legacy of the Obama-Clinton interventions will be weakness, confusion and disarray, a mess. We’ve made the Middle East more unstable and chaotic than ever before. We left Christians subject to intense persecution and even genocide.(APPLAUSE)We have done nothing to help the Christians, nothing, and we should always be ashamed for that, for that lack of action. Our actions in Iraq, Libya and Syria have helped unleash ISIS, and we’re in a war against radical Islam, but President Obama won’t even name the enemy, and unless you name the enemy, you will never ever solve the problem.(APPLAUSE)Hillary Clinton also refuses to say the words radical Islam, even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees coming into our country. After Secretary Clinton’s failed intervention in Libya, Islamic terrorists in Benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave Americans. Then, instead of taking charge that night, Hillary Clinton decided to go home and sleep. Incredible.Clinton blames it all on a video, an excuse that was a total lie, proven to be absolutely a total lie. Our ambassador was murdered and our secretary of state misled the nation. And, by the way, she was not awake to take that call at 3 o’clock in the morning. And now ISIS is making millions and millions of dollars a week selling Libya oil. And you know what? We don’t blockade, we don’t bomb, we don’t do anything about it. It’s almost as if our country doesn’t even know what’s happening, which could be a fact and could be true.TRUMP: This will all change when I become president.To our friends and allies, I say America is going to be strong again. America is going to be reliable again. It’s going to be a great and reliable ally again. It’s going to be a friend again. We’re going to finally have a coherent foreign policy based upon American interests and the shared interests of our allies.(APPLAUSE)We’re getting out of the nation-building business and instead focusing on creating stability in the world. Our moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the water’s edge. We need a new rational American foreign policy, informed by the best minds and supported by both parties, and it will be by both parties — Democrats, Republicans, independents, everybody, as well as by our close allies.This is how we won the Cold War and it’s how we will win our new future struggles, which may be many, which may be complex, but we will win if I become president.(APPLAUSE)First, we need a long-term plan to halt the spread and reach of radical Islam. Containing the spread of radical Islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the United States and indeed the world. Events may require the use of military force, but it’s also a philosophical struggle, like our long struggle in the Cold War.In this, we’re going to be working very closely with our allies in the Muslim world, all of which are at risk from radical Islamic violence, attacks and everything else. It is a dangerous world, more dangerous now than it has ever been.We should work — thank you.(APPLAUSE)We should work together with any nation in the region that is threatened by the rise of radical Islam. But this has to be a two-way street. They must also be good to us. Remember that. They have to be good to us, no longer one way. It’s now two-way. And remember, us and all we’re doing, they have to appreciate what we’ve done to them. We’re going to help, but they have to appreciate what we’ve done for them. The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland. There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. For every case known to the public, there are dozens and dozens more. We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies. We have no idea where these people are coming from. There’s no documentation. There’s no paperwork. There’s nothing. We have to be smart. We have to be vigilant.A pause for reassessment will help us to prevent the next San Bernardino or frankly, much worse. All you have to do is look at the World Trade Center and September 11th, one of the great catastrophes, in my opinion, the single greatest military catastrophe in the history of our country; worse than Pearl Harbor because you take a look at what’s happened, and citizens were attacked, as opposed to the military being attacked — one of the true great catastrophes.And then there’s ISIS. I have a simple message for them. Their days are numbered. I won’t tell them where and I won’t tell them how. We must…(APPLAUSE)… we must as a nation be more unpredictable. We are totally predictable. We tell everything. We’re sending troops. We tell them. We’re sending something else. We have a news conference. We have to be unpredictable. And we have to be unpredictable starting now.But they’re going to be gone. ISIS will be gone if I’m elected president. And they’ll be gone quickly. They will be gone very, very quickly.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Secondly, we have to rebuild our military and our economy. The Russians and Chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability, but look at what’s happened to us. Our nuclear weapons arsenal, our ultimate deterrent, has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal. And it has to happen immediately. Our active duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today. The Navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during this same period of time. The Air Force is about one-third smaller than 1991. Pilots flying B-52s in combat missions today. These planes are older than virtually everybody in this room.And what are we doing about this? President Obama has proposed a 2017 defense budget that in real dollars, cuts nearly 25 percent from what we were spending in 2011. Our military is depleted and we’re asking our generals and military leaders to worry about global warming.We will spend what we need to rebuild our military. It is the cheapest, single investment we can make. We will develop, build and purchase the best equipment known to mankind. Our military dominance must be unquestioned, and I mean unquestioned, by anybody and everybody.But we will look for savings and spend our money wisely. In this time of mounting debt, right now we have so much debt that nobody even knows how to address the problem. But I do. No one dollar can be wasted. Not one single dollar can we waste. We’re also going to have to change our trade, immigration and economic policies to make our economy strong again. And to put Americans first again.This will ensure that our own workers, right here in America, get the jobs and higher pay that will grow our tax revenues, increase our economic might as a nation, make us strong financially again. So, so important. We need to think smart about areas where our technological superiority, and nobody comes close, gives us an edge.This includes 3D printing, artificial intelligence and cyber warfare. A great country also takes care of its warriors. Our commitment to them is absolute, and I mean absolute. A trump administration will give our servicemen and women the best equipment and support in the world when they serve and where they serve. And the best care in the world when they return as veterans and they come back home to civilian life. Our veterans…(APPLAUSE)Our veterans have not been treated fairly or justly. These are our great people and we must treat them fairly. We must even treat them really, really well and that will happen under the Trump administration.(APPLAUSE)Finally, we must develop a foreign policy based on American interests. Businesses do not succeed when they lose sight of their core interests and neither do countries. Look at what happened in the 1990s. Our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania — and this was a horrible time for us — were attacked. and 17 brave sailors were killed on the USS Cole.And what did we do? It seemed we put more effort into adding China into the World Trade organization, which has been a total disaster for the United States. Frankly, we spent more time on that than we did in stopping Al Qaida. We even had an opportunity to take out Osama bin Laden and we didn’t do itAnd then we got hit at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Again, the worst attack on our country in its history. Our foreign policy goals must be based on America’s core national security interests. And the following will be my priorities.In the Middle East our goals must be, and I mean must be, to defeat terrorists and promote regional stability, not radical change. We need to be clear sighted about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies. And believe me, we have groups that no matter what you do, they will be the enemy.TRUMP: We have to be smart enough to recognize who those groups are, who those people are, and not help them. And we must only be generous to those that prove they are indeed our friends.(APPLAUSE)We desire to live peacefully and in friendship with Russia and China. We have serious differences with these two nations, and must regard them with open eyes, but we are not bound to be adversaries. We should seek common ground based on shared interests.Russia, for instance, has also seen the horror of Islamic terrorism. I believe an easing of tensions, and improved relations with Russia from a position of strength only is possible, absolutely possible. Common sense says this cycle, this horrible cycle of hostility must end and ideally will end soon. Good for both countries.Some say the Russians won’t be reasonable. I intend to find out. If we can’t make a deal under my administration, a deal that’s great — not good, great — for America, but also good for Russia, then we will quickly walk from the table. It’s as simple as that. We’re going to find out.Fixing our relations with China is another important step — and really toward creating an even more prosperous period of time. China respects strength and by letting them take advantage of us economically, which they are doing like never before, we have lost all of their respect.We have a massive trade deficit with China, a deficit that we have to find a way quickly, and I mean quickly, to balance. A strong and smart America is an America that will find a better friend in China, better than we have right now. Look at what China is doing in the South China Sea. They’re not supposed to be doing it.No respect for this country or this president. We can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways. If need be, that’s what’s going to have to happen.After I’m elected president, I will also call for a summit with our NATO allies and a separate summit with our Asian allies. In these summits, we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments, but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges. For instance, we will discuss how we can upgrade NATO’s outdated mission and structure, grown out of the Cold War to confront our shared challenges, including migration and Islamic terrorism.(APPLAUSE)I will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative. But if America fights, it must only fight to win.(APPLAUSE)I will never sent our finest into battle unless necessary, and I mean absolutely necessary, and will only do so if we have a plan for victory with a capital V.(APPLAUSE)Our goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction. The best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy. With President Obama and Secretary Clinton we’ve had the exact opposite — a reckless, rudderless and aimless foreign policy, one that has blazed the path of destruction in its wake.After losing thousands of lives and spending trillions of dollars, we are in far worst shape in the Middle East than ever, ever before. I challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy vision of Obama/Clinton. It has been a complete and total disaster.I will also be prepared to deploy America’s economic resources. Financial leverage and sanctions can be very, very persuasive, but we need to use them selectively and with total determination.TRUMP: Our power will be used if others do not play by the rules. In other words, if they do not treat us fairly. Our friends and enemies must know that if I draw a line in the sand, I will enforce that line in the sand. Believe me.(APPLAUSE)However, unlike other candidates for the presidency, war and aggression will not be my first instinct. You cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy. A superpower understands that caution and restraint are really truly signs of strength. Although not in government service, I was totally against the war in Iraq, very proudly, saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East. Sadly, I was correct, and the biggest beneficiary has been has been Iran, who is systematically taking over Iraq and gaining access to their very rich oil reserves, something it has wanted to do for decades.And now, to top it off, we have ISIS. My goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations. That’s why I also look and have to look for talented experts with approaches and practical ideas, rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect resumes but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war. We have to look to new people.(APPLAUSE)We have to look to new people because many of the old people frankly don’t know what they’re doing, even though they may look awfully good writing in the New York Times or being watched on television.Finally, I will work with our allies to reinvigorate Western values and institutions. Instead of trying to spread universal values that not everybody shares or wants, we should understand that strengthening and promoting Western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world than military interventions.(APPLAUSE)These are my goals as president. I will seek a foreign policy that all Americans, whatever their party, can support, so important, and which our friends and allies will respect and totally welcome. The world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become allies, that’s what we want. We want them to be our allies.We want the world to be — we want to bring peace to the world. Too much destruction out there, too many destructive weapons. The power of weaponry is the single biggest problem that we have today in the world.To achieve these goals, Americans must have confidence in their country and its leadership. Again, many Americans must wonder why we our politicians seem more interested in defending the borders of foreign countries than in defending their own. Americans…(APPLAUSE)Americans must know that we’re putting the American people first again on trade.(APPLAUSE)So true. On trade, on immigration, on foreign policy. The jobs, incomes and security of the American worker will always be my first priority.(APPLAUSE)No country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first. Both our friends and our enemies put their countries above ours and we, while being fair to them, must start doing the same. We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism. The nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony. I am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down and will never enter…(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: And under my administration, we will never enter America into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs.(APPLAUSE)NAFTA, as an example, has been a total disaster for the United States and has emptied our states — literally emptied our states of our manufacturing and our jobs. And I’ve just gotten to see it. I’ve toured Pennsylvania. I’ve toured New York. I’ve toured so many of the states. They have been cleaned out. Their manufacturing is gone.Never again, only the reverse — and I have to say this strongly — never again; only the reverse will happen. We will keep our jobs and bring in new ones. There will be consequences for the companies that leave the United States only to exploit it later. They fire the people. They take advantage of the United States. There will be consequences for those companies. Never again.Under a Trump administration, no American citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of a foreign country.(APPLAUSE)I will view as president the world through the clear lens of American interests. I will be America’s greatest defender and most loyal champion. We will not apologize for becoming successful again, but will instead embrace the unique heritage that makes us who we are.The world is most peaceful and most prosperous when America is strongest. America will continue and continue forever to play the role of peacemaker. We will always help save lives and indeed humanity itself, but to play the role, we must make America strong again.(APPLAUSE)And always — always, always, we must make, and we have to look at it from every angle, and we have no choice, we must make America respected again. We must make America truly wealthy again. And we must — we have to and we will make America great again. And if we do that — and if we do that, perhaps this century can be the most peaceful and prosperous the world has ever, ever known. Thank you very much, everybody. I appreciate it. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)

https://www.snopes.com/david-clarke-military-medals/	Does Sheriff David Clarke Wear ‘Fake’ Military Medals?	false	['david clarke', ' donald trump', ' outrage', ' salon', ' stolen valor']	http://americannewsx.com/	http://americannewsx.com/hot-off-the-press/another-unqualified-bigoted-fraud-joining-440s-cabinet-sheriff-david-clarke/	2017/05/23	May 21, 2017 Laura Keeling Gun Violence , News , Op/Ed , Politics , Racism 0Sheriff Clarke, self-declared Trump appointee, brings more plagiarism and less valorTrump advocate, controversial Milwaukee County Sheriff, David Clarke, announced on Wednesday that he has been appointed as an  Assistant Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.  Though, there has been no corroboration of his appointment, as of yet, from the White House. As we’ve observed from previous appointments, Trump requires neither qualifications, experience nor training in the specific field, only undying loyalty to him. In the area of undying loyalty, Clarke excels. In the arena of qualifications and experience, he leaves much to be desired.In fact, CNN reported today that the sheriff had plagiarized portions of his Master’s thesis on US security. In fact, there were 47 incidents in his thesis of direct quotes from sources being included in his text without quotation marks. Clarke had been awarded the degree from the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. He is not the first of Trump’s cabinet picks to have had plagiarism troubles, either, but the fourth . In his short tenure, Betsy DeVos, Neil Gorsuch, Monica Crowley and even Trump’s wife have all been accused of plagiarism.The specific position for which Clarke is reportedly being considered is Assistant Secretary in the Office of Partnership and Engagement where his primary function will be “to serve as liaison with state, local and tribal law enforcement and governments.” This is a position for which Clarke is uniquely unqualified. He’s a staunch conservative who’s made no bones about his intense dislike of Liberals/Democrats saying :“The only time I’d only reach across the aisle to a Democrat is to grab them by the throat.”This is not the attitude of a person who will be open to listening and considering different or opposing ideas or positions. What type of relationship does Trump think Clarke will have with Democrats or even moderate Republicans with this hard-line stance? Or does Trump even know what the position requirements are? Knowing Trump, probably not. Trump apparently thinks he’s “diversifying his cabinet.” It’s the diversity of ideas that’s important, not diversity in skin color.Clarke, like his hero Trump, is also impulsive. He, too, shoots from the hip spewing fact-free rhetoric from questionable sources or making claims that have already been debunked. His attacks on Black Lives Matter have been copious, vitriolic and unrelenting, but rarely based on facts.Following the shooting of two police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge, he claimed that America was at war and that BLM was the enemy. However, the police chiefs in both cities had, after conducting a thorough investigation, publicly stated that neither perpetrator had been associated with Black Lives Matter. What the shooters did have in common was that both were ex-military, Afghan war veterans . It’s much more like likely that both were suffering from untreated PTSD than anything else. But, that doesn’t fit Sheriff Clarke’s hate-filled rhetoric, so he ignored it. Or, perhaps he never even considered PTSD as an option since he, like Trump, has never served in the military. Which brings me to my final point.Stolen Valor:2/ Look at this fucking guy's uniform. You see all that shit pinned all over his dress uniform jacket? That's not supposed to be there. pic.twitter.com/0QZlBxQjI8— Charles Clymer (@cmclymer) May 17, 2017Clarke loves posing with his chest full of medals except they’re neither military nor law enforcement. They have more in common with Army/Navy Store designer decorations for the chicken hawk out to impress the gullible than any sort of service. Several veterans have called him on this blatant attempt at passing himself off as a military hero. Just as he’s not a military hero, he’s not a law enforcement hero either if deaths within the jails you oversee is a measure. Four inmates died in the Milwaukee county jails in 2016. One from being denied water for 7 days.Clarke is also the subject of several lawsuits, as covered by Snopes.com, many stemming from unnecessary deaths under his watch. He also favors attacking the press if they dare report the truth about him. You can see why Trump would want him in his cabinet, though the White House does seem to be casting doubt on the appointment that Clarke is claiming:DHS has not confirmed that Clarke has been offered a position with the department. On 17 May 2017, the department’s official Twitter account posted :[Senior] positions are announced when made official by the [Secretary]. No such announcement w/ regard to the Office of Public Engagement has been made.Clarke is an uncaring, unfeeling, unyielding, uncompromising, old fashioned misogynist who embarrasses himself with his inability to adapt to changing times, situations or updated facts. Put it all together, a perfect fit for the Trump administration.

(Michael Desmond / CBS)Even thoughhas evidently canceled ""Mike & Molly,"" network brass has decided the topic is off-limits.But that's not stopping unhappy cast members from sounding off.Rondi Reed, the veteran stage actress who plays the tough mother to Chicago cop Mike Biggs (Billy Gardell), reported in a Facebook  post last week that ""Mike & Molly"" will come to an end with season 6, which will air early next year. Shooting on the sitcom will finish in late January, she wrote, and only 13 episodes will be completed rather than the 22 originally ordered.""The network has its reasons, and I will not get into a debate, discussion, or campaign to get them to change their minds,"" Reed wrote, adding that executive producerChuck Lorreand studio Warner Bros. Television tried to find another home for the show but had no luck.""It is a fact and we have known for a few weeks,"" Reed wrote. Indeed, Gardell tweeted on Dec. 3 that fans would soon see ""our last episodes,"" although the tweet did not make the same splash that Reed's post did.Melissa McCarthy, the film star who plays Mike's wife, ex-teacher Molly Flynn,  tweeted Monday that she was ""shocked and heartbroken"" when CBS canceled the show.Ratings for ""Mike & Molly"" have tapered since season 1, although not alarmingly so. Season 5 averaged a still-respectable 9.9 million total viewers in live + same day viewing, according to Nielsen. However, production costs rise substantially the longer a show is on the air, partly because of prenegotiated cast salary increases. That's why even modestly falling ratings can spell the end for an aging show.Typically in a case like this, the network would announce the show's termination well in advance of the final episode, giving the cast members and creators plenty of time to ruminate in the media and take a victory lap before the series finale.But CBS has apparently decided that's not happening this time. Network spokespersons had no comment to the cast's posts and tweets. CBS would not even confirm that the show is ending.Why not? That will have to remain open to speculation, unless Reed or someone else wants to start discussing things.What do you think of ""Mike & Molly"" ending its run?Twitter:  @scottcollinsLATALSO:"
https://www.snopes.com/politics/sexuality/doping.asp	Is ‘Abortion Doping’ a Real Practice?	unproven	['moral outrage', ' olympics']	https://www.nytimes.com/	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/sports/olympics/russia-doping-olympics.html?_r=0	2017/12/11	Bring on the comeuppance. The remaining big question, with the I.O.C.’s beleaguered president Thomas Bach expected to make an announcement on Tuesday, is whether there should be any Russian athletes in Pyeongchang. Should some be allowed to compete as individuals without any of the nationalistic trappings after proving they are subject to strict drug-testing regimens? Richard Pound, the senior I.O.C. member, thinks not. “I think it has gone too far, and the government shows no contrition or recognition regarding the established facts,” Pound said in an email message on Saturday. With Russian leader Vladimir V. Putin having suggested that he would resist sending athletes to compete as neutrals, Pound thinks the message from the I.O.C. “The I.O.C. needs to take control of the situation, rather than allow the Russians to pre-empt it by walking away,” Pound said. A 75-year-old Canadian tax lawyer and former Olympic swimmer, Pound has been one of the key figures in the fight to make Russia accountable. He was chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency commission that first confirmed the scale of Russian cheating in track and field in November 2015 in the wake of a report by the German television network ARD. “It’s worse than we thought,” Pound said then before also making it clear that he hoped the Russians would take the hint, make the necessary institutional and cultural changes and not be banned from the upcoming Olympics. A blanket ban could generate legal appeals. For Pound to advocate such a penalty represents a significant hardening in his position. And though he is the only I.O.C. member to have taken this stance publicly, one suspects Bach and many of his lieutenants were feeling rather embittered themselves as they listened to Vitaly Mutko last week. Mutko, the former Russian sports minister now in charge of organizing the FIFA World Cup in Russia in 2018, engaged in a filibuster devoted to denial at a FIFA news conference in which he lashed out at the I.O.C. and others and continued to reject the notion of state involvement in Russian doping. If this was contrition, it certainly did not sound like it. Nor does it help that Mutko, one of the alleged overseers of the doping effort in Sochi, actually got a promotion after those Games and is now deputy prime minister. But more earnest attempts at kowtowing could be forthcoming, perhaps even a rapid marginalization of Mutko, which the I.O.C. would likely perceive as too little too late. For now, the lobbying is accelerating. Yevgenia Medvedeva, the Russian who has dominated women’s figure skating since the Sochi Games, is expected to give a speech to the I.O.C. executive board as part of the Russian delegation to Tuesday’s meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland. Medvedeva would be one of the main attractions in Pyeongchang if allowed to compete. Meanwhile, the leaders of three international winter sports federations — ice hockey, luge and curling — have made it clear that they do not support a blanket ban on Russian athletes in Pyeongchang.

The trouble is that in Russia’s situation, individual clemency would seem more a case of not sanctioning the few for the actions of the many. The numbers are stunning, and they continue to tick upward. The I.O.C. has now retroactively banned 25 Russians who competed in the Sochi Games for doping offenses, stripping 11 medals, and it is not over yet. As of Sunday, 99 Russians had been disqualified from all past Olympics: more than three times the total of any other nation. Collective punishment already applies in other instances in sports. Consider relay team members who are stripped of medals because of a teammate’s doping violation; or athletes who have been forced to comply with their nation’s Olympic boycotts. There have been plenty of lost generations for both just causes and more dubious causes. In Pound’s veteran view (he has been an I.O.C. member since 1978), the Russian situation has much in common with the I.O.C. banning South Africa — and all of its athletes — from the Olympics from 1964 through 1988 because of the nation’s segregationist apartheid policies. “At a certain point, everyone in Russia is part of the corrupted system and must suffer the consequences of such involvement,” Pound said. “The I.O.C. The I.O.C. already has missed one opportunity to send an unmistakably strong message to Russia and the athletes it has defrauded: declining to ban the Russian team from last year’s Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Instead the I.O.C., citing the need to complete its own investigations, left it up to individual federations to make the call. Track and field’s governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations, was the only one that banned the Russian team, although it did allow one Russian athlete, long jumper Darya Klishina, to take part as an independent athlete because she had been based outside of Russia and was subject to extensive international antidoping controls. With Russia still banned from track and field this year, Klishina was part of a delegation of 19 authorized neutral athletes who competed in the world championships in London in August. That presumably would be the template if the I.O.C. does the expected and allows independent Russian athletes but no Russian team in Pyeongchang. It would be, as it was in London, an odd arrangement: muted celebrations, laps of honor without flags, the Olympic anthem on the podium. But in Russia and elsewhere, the medals won by neutrals would still be perceived as Russian medals. That is if Putin allowed neutrals to compete: something he has said would be “humiliation for the country” and something he is presumably not eager to accept with Russian presidential elections coming in March. “You probably cannot divorce this issue from the dynamics and politics of the presidential election,” said Michael Payne, the global sports consultant and former I.O.C. marketing director. But Bach and the I.O.C. can no longer be concerned with Russian politics or Putin’s credibility at this very late stage in the Games. The future of their own organization and their own credibility is too much at stake. Based on what they and we now know, the I.O.C. must, at the very least, ban Russia from Pyeongchang. Don’t be shocked if it follows Pound’s advice and bans the Russians, too. A version of this article appears in print on December 5, 2017, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: Russian Doping: The Case for Barring a Nation Entirely.
https://www.snopes.com/noonan-on-trump/	Peggy Noonan on Donald Trump	attribution-false	['donald trump', ' peggy noonan']	https://www.reddit.com/	https://www.reddit.com/r/forwardsfromgrandma/comments/3g2lt8/fwd_fw_trump_things_you_might_not_know/	2016/01/12	Something to think about! As candidates for president emerge it is important to know where each stands on issues that are important to AMERICA. The USA cannot afford to make another mistake in electing an anti-American Socialist, someone with a poor track record of public service, or someone who values illegal invaders more than hard-working, loyal Americans and her military. Trump, hopefully, is waking some of the RINOs up.  The criticisms of Trump are amazingly​ missing something. They are​ lacking in ​negative stories from those who work for him or have had business dealings with him. After all the employees he’s had and all the business deals he’s made there is a void of criticism. In fact, long term employees call him a strong and merciful leader and say he is far more righteous and of high integrity​ than people may think​. And while it may surprise many, he’s actually humble when it comes to his generosity and kindness. A good example is a story that tells of his limo breaking down on a deserted highway outside of New York City. A middle-aged couple stopped to help him and as a thank you he paid off their mortgage, but he didn’t brag about that. Generous and good people rarely talk of charity they bestow on others.​But as much as all this is interesting, the real thing that people want to know is what Donald Trump’s plan is for America. It’s funny how so many people say they don’t know what it is, or they act like Trump is hiding it. The information is readily available if people would just do a little homework. But, since most Americans won't do their own research, here, in no particular order, is an overview of many of Trump's positions and plans: 1.) Trump believes that America should not intervene militarily in other country’s problems without being compensated for doing so. If America is going to risk the lives of our soldiers and incur the expense of going to war, then the nations we help must be willing to pay for our help. Using the Iraq War as an example, he cites the huge monetary expense to American taxpayers (over $1.5 trillion, and possibly much more depending on what sources are used to determine the cost) in addition to the cost in human life. He suggests that Iraq should have been required to give us enough of their oil to pay for the expenses we incurred. He includes in those expenses the medical costs for our military and $5 million for each family that lost a loved one in the war and $2 million for each family of soldiers who received severe injuries. 2.) Speaking of the military, Trump wants America to have a strong military again. He believes the single most important function of the federal government is national defense. He has said he wants to find the General Patton or General MacArthur that could lead our military buildup back to the strength it needs to be. While he hasn’t said it directly that I know of, Trump’s attitude about America and about winning tells me he’d most likely be quick to eliminate rules of engagement that handicap our military in battle. Clearly Trump is a “win at all costs” kind of guy, and I’m sure that would apply to our national defense and security, too. 3.) Trump wants a strong foreign policy and believes that it must include 7 core principles (which seem to support my comment in the last point): ·     American interests come first.  Always. No apologies.·     Maximum firepower and military preparedness.·     Only go to war to win.·     Stay loyal to your friends and suspicious of your enemies.·     Keep the technological sword razor sharp.·     See the unseen. Prepare for threats before they materialize.·     Respect and support our present and past warriors. 4.) Trump believes that terrorists who are captured should be treated as military combatants, not as criminals like the Obama administration treats them. 5.) Trump makes the point that China’s manipulation of their currency has given them unfair advantage in our trade dealings with them. He says we must tax their imports to offset their currency manipulation, which will cause American companies to be competitive again and drive manufacturing back to America and create jobs here.  Although he sees China as the biggest offender, he believes that America should protect itself from all foreign efforts to take our jobs and manufacturing. For example, Ford is building a plant in Mexico and Trump suggests that every part or vehicle Ford makes in Mexico be taxed 35% if they want to bring it into the U. S., which would cause companies like Ford to no longer be competitive using their Mexican operations and move manufacturing back to the U. S., once again creating jobs here. 6.) Trump wants passage of NOPEC legislation (No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act – NOPEC – S.394), which would allow the government to sue OPEC for violating antitrust laws. According to Trump, that would break up the cartel. He also wants to unleash our energy companies to drill domestically (sound like Sarah Palin’s drill baby, drill?) thereby increasing domestic production creating jobs and driving domestic costs of oil and gas down while reducing dependence on foreign oil. 7.) Trump believes a secure border is critical for both security and prosperity in America. He wants to build a wall to stop illegals from entering and put controls on immigration. (And he says he’ll get Mexico to pay for the wall, which many have scoffed at, but given his business successes I wouldn’t put it past him.) He also wants to enforce our immigration laws and provide no path to citizenship for illegals. 8.) Trump wants a radical change to the tax system to not only make it better for average Americans, but also to encourage businesses to stay here and foreign businesses to move here. The resulting influx of money to our nation would do wonders for our economy. He wants to make America the place to do business. He also wants to lower the death tax and the taxes on capital gains and dividends. This would put more than $1.6 trillion back into the economy and help rebuild the 1.5 million jobs we’ve lost to the current tax system. He also wants to charge companies who outsource jobs overseas a 20% tax, but for those willing to move jobs back to America they would not be taxed. And for citizens he has a tax plan that would allow Americans to keep more of what they earn and spark economic growth. He wants to change the personal income tax to:·     Up to $30,000 taxed at 1%·     From $30,000 to $100,000 taxed at 5%·     From $100,000 to $1,000,000 taxed at 10%·    $1,000,000 and above taxed at 15% 9.) Trump wants Obamacare repealed. He says it’s a “job-killing, health care-destroying monstrosity” that “can’t be reformed, salvaged, or fixed.” He believes in allowing real competition in the health insurance marketplace to allow competition to drive prices down. He also believes in tort reform to get rid of defensive medicine and lower costs. 10.) Trump wants spending reforms in Washington, acknowledging that America spends far more than it receives in revenue.  He has said he believes that if we don’t stop increasing the national debt once it hits $24 trillion it will be impossible to save this country. 11.) Even though he says we need to cut spending, he does not want to harm those on Medicare, Medicaid, or Social Security. He believes that the citizens have faithfully paid in to the system to have these services available and that the American government has an obligation to fulfill its end of the bargain and provide those benefits. Therefore, he wants to build the economy up so that we have the revenue to pay those costs without cutting the benefits to the recipients. He disagrees with Democrats who think raising taxes is the answer and says that when you do that you stifle the economy. On the other hand, when you lower taxes and create an environment to help businesses they will grow, hire more workers, and those new workers will be paying taxes that become more tax revenue for the government. 12.) Trump also wants reform of the welfare state saying that America needs “a safety net, not a hammock.” He believes in a welfare to work program that would help reduce the welfare roles and encourage people to get back to work. And he wants a crackdown on entitlement fraud. 13.) Trump believes climate change is a hoax. 14.) Trump opposes Common Core. 15.) Trump is pro-life, although he allows for an exception due to rape, incest, or the life of the mother. 16.) Trump is pro 2nd Amendment rights. 17.) Trump’s view on same-sex marriage is that marriage is between a man and a woman, but he also believes that this is a states rights issue, not a federal issue. 18.) Trump supports the death penalty. Trump believes that there is a lack of common sense, innovative thinking in Washington (Hmmm… looks like he believes in horse sense!). He says it’s about seeing the unseen and that’s the kind of thinking we need to turn this country around. He tells a personal story to illustrate the point: “When I opened Trump National Golf Club at Rancho Palos Verdes in Los Angeles, I was immediately told that I would need to build a new and costly ballroom. The current ballroom was gorgeous, but it only sat 200 people and we were losing business because people needed a larger space for their events. Building a new ballroom would take years to get approval and permits (since it’s on the Pacific Ocean), and cost about $5 million. I took one look at the ballroom and saw immediately what needed to be done. The problem wasn’t the size of the room, it was the size of the chairs. They were huge, heavy, and unwieldy. We didn’t need a bigger ballroom, we needed smaller chairs! So I had them replaced with high-end, smaller chairs. I then had our people sell the old chairs and got more money for them than the cost of the new chairs. In the end, the ballroom went from seating 200 people to seating 320 people. Our visitors got the space they desired, and I spared everyone the hassle of years of construction and $5 million of expense.  It’s amazing what you can accomplish with a little common sense.    On top of his saving years of construction and $5 million in expenses, he also was able to keep the ballroom open for business during the time it would have been under remodeling, which allowed him to continue to make money on the space instead of losing that revenue during construction time. Donald Trump’s entire life has been made up of success and winning. He’s been accused of bankruptcies, but that’s not true.  He’s never filed personal bankruptcy. He’s bought companies and legally used bankruptcy laws to restructure their debt, just as businesses do all the time. But he’s never been bankrupt personally. He’s a fighter that clearly loves America and would fight for our nation.  Earlier I quoted Trump saying, “I love America. And when you love something, you protect it passionately – fiercely, even.”   We never hear that from Democrats or even from most Republicans.  Donald Trump is saying things that desperately need to be said but no other candidate has shown the fortitude to stand up and say them.  Looking over this list of what he wants for America I see a very necessary set of goals that are long past due. Before we criticize someone because the media does, maybe we should seriously consider what he has to offer.

Thanks to the generous support of local sponsors, this year's festival promises to be a community celebration that continues to provide needed resources to local charitable organizations. More... About the Song ""Jingle Bells,"" the now world famous holiday tune, was composed at the Simpson Tavern in Medford, Massachusetts in 1850 by James Pierpont (1822-1893). The tavern stood at the site which is now 19 High Street in Medford Square. The song was composed in the presence of Mrs. Otis Waterman, who later verified the location of the song's composition. In 1857, James Pierpont, while living in Georgia, copyrighted ""Jingle Bells."" The lyrics of the song tell of the sleigh rides held on Salem Street in the early 1800s.

Doctors on the case at Southern Utah Medical Center say that Cameron is “in the advanced stages” and that if they can find a cure, they’ll have less than a day to administer it:“The problem is, there’s no research on the disease because not enough people have it. I mean, sure there would be enough data to do an analysis and it’s a fairly simple organism causing it, but still…why develop something that will do nothing but cost the shareholders money. To save a dozen people?”Cameron’s family has asked for privacy. His sister, the famous actress sister, the beautiful Candace Cameron, said he probably contracted the disease while on mission in Western Africa:“Kirk was there and he heard of someone with the disease and he wanted to meet him. Ironically he was convinced that anyone who was afflicted with such a rare and deadly pathogen had to be chosen by God to be struck down.We haven’t ruled out that Kirk has a secret sin and is paying for it with his life. His maker may want to see him sooner than later. Ultimately we’re hoping that he is cured by a miracle.”Cameron isn’t expected to make it through the night.

https://www.snopes.com/politics/conspiracy/guillotines.asp	Did the U.S. Government Purchase 30,000 Guillotines?	false	['guillotines']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/HWmri	2013/06/22	Video courtesy of:  FBCFilmsHB 1274 authorizes the state of Georgia to execute citizens by guillotine:Georgia House of Representatives – 1995/1996 Sessions HB 1274 – Death penalty; guillotine provisions Code Sections – 17-10-38/ 17-10-44 A BILL TO BE ENTITLED AN ACT1- 1 To amend Article 2 of Chapter 10 of Title 17 of the Official1- 2 Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to the death penalty1- 3 generally, so as to provide a statement of legislative1- 4 policy; to provide for death by guillotine; to provide for1- 5 applicability; to repeal conflicting laws; and for other1- 6 purposes.1- 8 The General Assembly finds that while prisoners condemned to1- 9 death may wish to donate one or more of their organs for1-10 transplant, any such desire is thwarted by the fact that1-11 electrocution makes all such organs unsuitable for1-12 transplant. The intent of the General Assembly in enacting1-13 this legislation is to provide for a method of execution1-14 which is compatible with the donation of organs by a1-15 condemned prisoner.source:  http://www.cephas-library.com/nwo/nwo_guillotine_provisions_in_georgia.htmlOne question to consider:If Georgia was planning to utilize guillotines as a method of execution, how could this be carried out without purchasing guillotines?NOTE: Special Agent Ted Gunderson wrote the original of this article prior to his death in 2011.http://www.myfoxmemphis.com/story/18527976/former-memphis-fbi-chief-diesby, Ted Gunderson (Retired FBI Agent)Think about this; Why does the US government need 30,000 Guillotines and over 600 Million rounds of hollow point bullets?There are over 800 prison camps in the United States. All fully operational and ready to receive prisoners. They are all staffed and even surrounded by full-time guards. But they are all empty. These camps are to be operated by FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) should Martial Law need to be implemented in the United States and all it would take is a presidential signature on a proclamation and the attorney general’s signature on a warrant to which a list of names is attached. Ask yourself if you really want to be on THE list.The Rex 84 Program was established on the reasoning that if a “mass exodus” of illegal aliens crossed the Mexican/US border, they would be quickly rounded up and detained in detention centers by FEMA. Rex 84 allowed many military bases to be closed down and to be turned into prisons. Operation Cable Splicer and Garden Plot are the two sub programs which will be implemented once the Rex 84 program is initiated for its proper purpose. Garden Plot is the program to control the population. Cable Splicer is the program for an orderly takeover of the state and local governments by the federal government. FEMA is the executive arm of the coming police state and thus will head up all operations. The Presidential Executive Orders already listed on the Federal Register also are part of the legal framework for this operation.The camps all have railroad facilities as well as roads leading to and from the detention facilities. Many also have an airport nearby. The majority of the camps can house a population of 20,000 prisoners. Currently, the largest of these facilities is just outside of Fairbanks, Alaska. The Alaskan facility is a massive mental health facility and can hold approximately 2 million people. Now let’s review the justification for any actions taken. Executive Orders associated with FEMA that would suspend the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. These Executive Orders have been on record for nearly 30 years and could be enacted by the stroke of a Presidential pen:EXECUTIVE ORDER 10990 allows the government to take over all modes of transportation and control of highways and seaports.EXECUTIVE ORDER 10995 allows the government to seize and control the communication media.EXECUTIVE ORDER 10997 allows the government to take over all electrical power, gas, petroleum, fuels and minerals.EXECUTIVE ORDER 10998 allows the government to seize all means of transportation, including personal cars, trucks or vehicles of any kind and total control over all highways, seaports, and waterways.EXECUTIVE ORDER 10999 allows the government to take over all food resources and farms.EXECUTIVE ORDER 11000 allows the government to mobilize civilians into work brigades under government supervision.EXECUTIVE ORDER 11001 allows the government to take over all health, education and welfare functions.EXECUTIVE ORDER 11002 designates the Postmaster General to operate a national registration of all persons.EXECUTIVE ORDER 11003 allows the government to take over all airports and aircraft, including commercial aircraft.EXECUTIVE ORDER 11004 allows the Housing and Finance Authority to relocate communities, build new housing with public funds, designate areas to be abandoned, and establish new locations for populations.EXECUTIVE ORDER 11005 allows the government to take over railroads, inland waterways and public storage facilities.EXECUTIVE ORDER 11051 specifies the responsibility of the Office of Emergency Planning and gives authorization to put all Executive Orders into effect in times of increased international tensions and economic or financial crisis.EXECUTIVE ORDER 11310 grants authority to the Department of Justice to enforce the plans set out in Executive Orders, to institute industrial support, to establish judicial and legislative liaison, to control all aliens, to operate penal and correctional institutions, and to advise and assist the President.EXECUTIVE ORDER 11049 assigns emergency preparedness function to federal departments and agencies, consolidating 21 operative Executive Orders issued over a fifteen year period.EXECUTIVE ORDER 11921 allows the Federal Emergency Preparedness Agency to develop plans to establish control over the mechanisms of production and distribution, of energy sources, wages, salaries, credit and the flow of money in U.S. financial institution in any undefined national emergency. It also provides that when a state of emergency is declared by the President, Congress cannot review the action for six months. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has broad powers in every aspect of the nation. General Frank Salzedo, chief of FEMA’s Civil Security Division stated in a 1983 conference that he saw FEMA’s role as a “new frontier in the protection of individual and governmental leaders from assassination, and of civil and military installations from sabotage and/or attack, as well as prevention of dissident groups from gaining access to U.S. opinion, or a global audience in times of crisis.” FEMA’s powers were consolidated by President Carter to incorporate the National Security Act of 1947 allows for the strategic relocation of industries, services, government and other essential economic activities, and to rationalize the requirements for manpower, resources and production facilities. 1950 Defense Production Act gives the President sweeping powers over all aspects of the economy. Act of August 29, 1916 authorizes the Secretary of the Army, in time of war, to take possession of any transportation system for transporting troops, material, or any other purpose related to the emergency. International Emergency Economic Powers Act enables the President to seize the property of a foreign country or national. These powers were transferred to FEMA in a sweeping consolidation in 1979.If playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.Your browser doesn't support full screen.

He mocks conservatives, so therefore he’s a fantastic astrophysicist! He thinks people who believe in God are idiots, so therefore he’s a fantastic astrophysicist! He’s on PBS, so therefore he’s a fantastic astrophysicist! I wouldn’t exactly say this emperor has no clothes, but I would say this emperor might have only a speedo and a wristband. Maybe some sunglasses. Snarky science is not better science.I could be wrong. Seriously. He might be the bee’s knees of cosmology. I’m just suggesting that Tyson — and other similar science celebs like Bill Nye and Richard Dawkins — may be a bit overestimated because the zeitgeist likes their conclusions. They are scientists on the leading edge of culture, but are they actually on the leading edge of science, too? It would be interesting to discover from the true and quiet humble giants of scientific thought — those not seeking television shows, book deals, and societal approbation — where these celebrity-scientist hybrids rank.I’ve listened to Neil deGrasse Tyson before. And what I observe is a smart guy who consistently enjoys asserting his intellectual supremacy over others more than he actually likes educating. In one of his worse moments, Tyson mocked a 12-year-old girl who suggested she’d like to live on Jupiter. He ridiculed her in the midst of a crowd, then later, several times, on Twitter. That told me everything I needed to know about Neil deGrasse Tyson.For that moment he was just a horse’s astrophysicist.Associated Press award-winning columnist Neal Larson of Idaho Falls is also the author of “Living in Spin.” He is a conservative talk show host on KID Newsradio 590 AM, 106.3 and 92.1 FM, and also at www.kidnewsradio.com . “The Neal Larson Show” can be heard weekday mornings from 8 to 10.

When Edison was seven his family moved to Port Huron, Michigan. Edison lived here until he struck out on his own at the age of sixteen. Edison had very little formal education as a child, attending school only for a few months. He was taught reading, writing, and arithmetic by his mother, but was always a very curious child and taught himself much by reading on his own. This belief in self-improvement remained throughout his life.Edison began working at an early age, as most boys did at the time. At thirteen he took a job as a newsboy, selling newspapers and candy on the local railroad that ran through Port Huron to Detroit. He seems to have spent much of his free time reading scientific, and technical books, and also had the opportunity at this time to learn how to operate a telegraph. By the time he was sixteen, Edison was proficient enough to work as a telegrapher full time.The development of the telegraph was the first step in the communication revolution, and the telegraph industry expanded rapidly in the second half of the 19th century. This rapid growth gave Edison and others like him a chance to travel, see the country, and gain experience. Edison worked in a number of cities throughout the United States before arriving in Boston in 1868. Here Edison began to change his profession from telegrapher to inventor. He received his first patent on an electric vote recorder, a device intended for use by elected bodies such as Congress to speed the voting process. This invention was a commercial failure. Edison resolved that in the future he would only invent things that he was certain the public would want.Edison moved to New York City in 1869. He continued to work on inventions related to the telegraph, and developed his first successful invention, an improved stock ticker called the ""Universal Stock Printer"". For this and some related inventions Edison was paid $40,000. This gave Edison the money he needed to set up his first small laboratory and manufacturing facility in Newark, New Jersey in 1871. During the next five years, Edison worked in Newark inventing and manufacturing devices that greatly improved the speed and efficiency of the telegraph. He also found to time to get married to Mary Stilwell and start a family.In 1876 Edison sold all his Newark manufacturing concerns and moved his family and staff of assistants to the small village of Menlo Park, twenty-five miles southwest of New York City. Edison established a new facility containing all the equipment necessary to work on any invention. This research and development laboratory was the first of its kind anywhere; the model for later, modern facilities such as Bell Laboratories, this is sometimes considered to be Edison's greatest invention. Here Edison began to change the world. Edison's first phonograph - 1877.NPS PhotoThe first great invention developed by Edison in Menlo Park was the tin foil phonograph. The first machine that could record and reproduce sound created a sensation and brought Edison international fame. Edison toured the country with the tin foil phonograph, and was invited to the White House to demonstrate it to President Rutherford B. Hayes in April 1878.Edison next undertook his greatest challenge, the development of a practical incandescent, electric light. The idea of electric lighting was not new, and a number of people had worked on, and even developed forms of electric lighting. But up to that time, nothing had been developed that was remotely practical for home use. Edison's eventual achievement was inventing not just an incandescent electric light, but also an electric lighting system that contained all the elements necessary to make the incandescent light practical, safe, and economical. After one and a half years of work, success was achieved when an incandescent lamp with a filament of carbonized sewing thread burned for thirteen and a half hours. The first public demonstration of the Edison's incandescent lighting system was in December 1879, when the Menlo Park laboratory complex was electrically lighted. Edison spent the next several years creating the electric industry. In September 1882, the first commercial power station, located on Pearl Street in lower Manhattan, went into operation providing light and power to customers in a one square mile area; the electric age had begun. An early sketch from a laboratory notebook of an electric lightbulb.NPS PhotoThe success of his electric light brought Edison to new heights of fame and wealth, as electricity spread around the world. Edison's various electric companies continued to grow until in 1889 they were brought together to form Edison General Electric. Despite the use of Edison in the company title however, Edison never controlled this company. The tremendous amount of capital needed to develop the incandescent lighting industry had necessitated the involvement of investment bankers such as J.P. Morgan. When Edison General Electric merged with its leading competitor Thompson-Houston in 1892, Edison was dropped from the name, and the company became simply General Electric.This period of success was marred by the death of Edison's wife Mary in 1884. Edison's involvement in the business end of the electric industry had caused Edison to spend less time in Menlo Park. After Mary's death, Edison was there even less, living instead in New York City with his three children. A year later, while vacationing at a friends house in New England, Edison met Mina Miller and fell in love. The couple was married in February 1886 and moved to West Orange, New Jersey where Edison had purchased an estate, Glenmont, for his bride. Thomas Edison lived here with Mina until his death.When Edison moved to West Orange, he was doing experimental work in makeshift facilities in his electric lamp factory in nearby Harrison, New Jersey. A few months after his marriage, however, Edison decided to build a new laboratory in West Orange itself, less than a mile from his home. Edison possessed both the resources and experience by this time to build, ""the best equipped and largest laboratory extant and the facilities superior to any other for rapid and cheap development of an invention "". The new laboratory complex consisting of five buildings opened in November 1887. A three story main laboratory building contained a power plant, machine shops, stock rooms, experimental rooms and a large library. Four smaller one story buildings built perpendicular to the main building contained a physics lab, chemistry lab, metallurgy lab, pattern shop, and chemical storage. The large size of the laboratory not only allowed Edison to work on any sort of project, but also allowed him to work on as many as ten or twenty projects at once. Facilities were added to the laboratory or modified to meet Edison's changing needs as he continued to work in this complex until his death in 1931. Over the years, factories to manufacture Edison inventions were built around the laboratory. The entire laboratory and factory complex eventually covered more than twenty acres and employed 10,000 people at its peak during World War One (1914-1918).After opening the new laboratory, Edison began to work on the phonograph again, having set the project aside to develop the electric light in the late 1870s. By the 1890s, Edison began to manufacture phonographs for both home, and business use. Like the electric light, Edison developed everything needed to have a phonograph work, including records to play, equipment to record the records, and equipment to manufacture the records and the machines. In the process of making the phonograph practical, Edison created the recording industry. The development and improvement of the phonograph was an ongoing project, continuing almost until Edison's death.While working on the phonograph, Edison began working on a device that, ""does for the eye what the phonograph does for the ear"", this was to become motion pictures. Edison first demonstrated motion pictures in 1891, and began commercial production of ""movies"" two years later in a peculiar looking structure, built on the laboratory grounds, known as the Black Maria. Like the electric light and phonograph before it, Edison developed a complete system, developing everything needed to both film and show motion pictures. Edison's initial work in motion pictures was pioneering and original. However, many people became interested in this third new industry Edison created, and worked to further improve on Edison's early motion picture work. There were therefore many contributors to the swift development of motion pictures beyond the early work of Edison. By the late 1890s, a thriving new industry was firmly established, and by 1918 the industry had become so competitive that Edison got out of the movie business all together.The success of the phonograph and motion pictures in the 1890s helped offset the greatest failure of Edison's career. Throughout the decade Edison worked in his laboratory and in the old iron mines of northwestern New Jersey to develop methods of mining iron ore to feed the insatiable demand of the Pennsylvania steel mills. To finance this work, Edison sold all his stock in General Electric. Despite ten years of work and millions of dollars spent on research and development, Edison was never able to make the process commercially practical, and lost all the money he had invested. This would have meant financial ruin had not Edison continued to develop the phonograph and motion pictures at the same time. As it was, Edison entered the new century still financially secure and ready to take on another challenge.Edison's new challenge was to develop a better storage battery for use in electric vehicles. Edison very much enjoyed automobiles and owned a number of different types during his life, powered by gasoline, electricity, and steam. Edison thought that electric propulsion was clearly the best method of powering cars, but realized that conventional lead-acid storage batteries were inadequate for the job. Edison began to develop an alkaline battery in 1899. It proved to be Edison's most difficult project, taking ten years to develop a practical alkaline battery. By the time Edison introduced his new alkaline battery, the gasoline powered car had so improved that electric vehicles were becoming increasingly less common, being used mainly as delivery vehicles in cities. However, the Edison alkaline battery proved useful for lighting railway cars and signals, maritime buoys, and miners lamps. Unlike iron ore mining, the heavy investment Edison made over ten years was repaid handsomely, and the storage battery eventually became Edison's most profitable product. Further, Edison's work paved the way for the modern alkaline battery.By 1911, Thomas Edison had built a vast industrial operation in West Orange. Numerous factories had been built through the years around the original laboratory, and the staff of the entire complex had grown into the thousands. To better manage operations, Edison brought all the companies he had started to make his inventions together into one corporation, Thomas A. Edison Incorporated, with Edison as president and chairman. Edison was sixty-four by this time and his role with his company and in life began to change. Edison left more of the daily operations of both the laboratory and the factories to others. The laboratory itself did less original experimental work and instead worked more on refining existing Edison products such as the phonograph. Although Edison continued to file for and receive patents for new inventions, the days of developing new products that changed lives and created industries were behind him.In the 1915, Edison was asked to head the Naval Consulting Board. With the United States inching closer towards the involvement in World War One, the Naval Consulting Board was an attempt to organize the talents of the leading scientists and inventors in the United States for the benefit of the American armed forces. Edison favored preparedness, and accepted the appointment. The Board did not make a notable contribution to the final allied victory, but did serve as a precedent for future successful cooperation between scientists, inventors and the United States military. During the war, at age seventy, Edison spent several months on Long Island Sound in a borrowed navy vessel experimenting on techniques for detecting submarines.Edison's role in life began to change from inventor and industrialist to cultural icon, a symbol of American ingenuity, and a real life Horatio Alger story. In 1928, in recognition of a lifetime of achievement, the United States Congress voted Edison a special Medal of Honor. In 1929 the nation celebrated the golden jubilee of the incandescent light. The celebration culminated at a banquet honoring Edison given by Henry Ford at Greenfield Village, Ford's new American history museum, which included a complete restoration of the Menlo Park Laboratory. Attendees included President Herbert Hoover and many of the leading American scientists and inventors.The last experimental work of Edison's life was done at the request of Edison's good friends Henry Ford, and Harvey Firestone in the late 1920s. They asked Edison to find an alternative source of rubber for use in automobile tires. The natural rubber used for tires up to that time came from the rubber tree, which does not grow in the United States. Crude rubber had to be imported and was becoming increasingly expensive. With his customary energy and thoroughness, Edison tested thousands of different plants to find a suitable substitute, eventually finding a type of Goldenrod weed that could produce enough rubber to be feasible. Edison was still working on this at the time of his death.During the last two years of his life Edison was in increasingly poor health. Edison spent more time away from the laboratory, working instead at Glenmont. Trips to the family vacation home in Fort Myers, Florida became longer. Edison was past eighty and suffering from a number of ailments. In August 1931 Edison collapsed at Glenmont. Essentially house bound from that point, Edison steadily declined until at 3:21 am on October 18, 1931 the great man died.Last updated: February 26, 2015"

Stay over 180 days would therefore require a visa.Trump says this measure is to strengthen trade between the United States and Pakistan.However, Pakistanis who hold dual nationality will be banned from entering the United States if their other passport is from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen — the seven Muslim-majority countries “of concern”.It has emerged that trade and bilateral visa deals have been discussed by Trump and Pakistani Diplomats in the States.A source at the White House has hinted that Trump may revoke Australia’s opportunity of traveling to the United States without visas after cancelling all trade deals with the country.Allowing Pakistanis to the United States freely is not the only order signed into force by Trump since assuming office. He has signed five new executive orders – including one to expedite environmental review and approval of high-priority infrastructure projects.President Donald Trump signed executive orders to advance the construction of the controversial Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines.He also signed an executive order on Monday barring federal funds from organizations that promote abortion around the world, including the International Planned Parenthood Federation, in what activists say is the president’s first major pro-life action while in office.No more funds for Abortion-promotion organizationsThe policy, known as the Mexico City Policy or the Global Gag Rule, was first ushered in under Ronald Reagan and bars federal funds from going to foreign organizations that perform abortions overseas or lobby for the practice’s legalization in other countries.He has formally withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal on Monday, distancing America from its Asian allies as China’s influence in the region rises.Fulfilling a campaign pledge to end American involvement in the 2015 pact, Trump signed an executive order in the Oval Office pulling the United States from the 12-nation TPP.Donald Trump signs a visa-free travel policy for Pakistan added by onFebruary 11, 2016
https://www.snopes.com/sarah-palin-blames-mexican-muslims/	Sarah Palin Blames ‘Mexican Muslim’ Immigration for Fort Lauderdale Shooting?	false	['muslims', ' sarah palin']	http://politicono.com/	http://politicono.com/palin-blames-florida-shooting-obamas-policy-allowing-mexican-muslims-walk-freely-streets/	2017/01/12	Palin Blames Florida Shooting On “Obama’s Policy Of Allowing Mexican Muslims To Walk Freely On Our Streets”Written by Alex Stevan January 6th 2017(Photo Credit: Fox News)Five people have been shot dead by a gunman at Fort Lauderdale airport in Florida, say officials. It happened at the baggage claim area in Terminal 2, just before 1300 local time (1800 GMT), the airport confirmed. Five people were killed, eight injured and one person was unharmed in custody, said police and local officials. Hundreds of people were standing on the tarmac outside the terminal as dozens of police cars and ambulances rushed to the scene. A witness told MSNBC that the gunman was a “slender man” who was wearing a Star Wars T-shirt. Florida Senator Bill Nelson told media that the gunman has been identified as Esteban Santiago, but that has not been confirmed by law enforcement.Former half-term governor of Alaska Sarah Palin took to the press to offer her thoughts and prayers to the families of the victims, but also used the opportunity to once again criticize former President Barack Obama’s policy on illegal immigration. “First of all, I’d like to offer my condolences to the families of the victims of the Fort Lauderdale terrorist attack, as well as my support to those who have been injured in the incident,” she said. “Make no mistake – this was a full-on terrorist attack, the likes of which we’ve had several in the past months and years. These lone-wolf terrorist attacks have today become a danger far greater than any terrorist cell that might be planning an attack on U.S. soil. It is terrible that we are faced with such an unpredictable network of individuals who will stop at nothing in order to harm innocent civilians.”She added, “However, don’t be fooled by the idea that there was no stopping this sort of escalation of terrorist violence. We could have prevented all of this 8 years ago, but unfortunately, the citizens of this country – more specifically, true, conservative Americans were outvoted by those who believed Barack Obama was the right choice for president. Eight years later, I’m sad to say America is choking on terrorism, racial issues and gender catastrophes the likes of which are unknown in its recent history. Not only were the liberals not right; they have single-handedly surrendered this country into the hands of a man who’s done more damage to it than any Bush, Reagan or Stalin, for that matter, ever could.”“It is Barack Obama’s policy of allowing Mexican Muslims to walk freely on our streets that has caused so much death and destruction recently, including this latest incident which has taken 5 innocent lives,” she continued. “Think about that for a second. Why were Mexican Muslims even allowed to walk our streets in the first place, I ask you? They’re, like, double the threat – they’re half Muslim, which means that they hate all of America by default, and the other half is Mexican, which means they can be very hard-working, but at the same time, they’re also very jealous of white people. And if, by some miracle, you were to add just an ounce of Germanic heritage to that, you’d have Hitler in the mix as well. That means they’d be the ultimate killing machine. They should have been incarcerated from the beginning. Instead, we’re left with this situation.”“I guarantee you no potential gunman would have ever seen the light of day other than through prison bars if anyone other than Barack Obama had been president. All Muslim Mexicans would be scrutinized several times, compared to normal Muslims and Mexicans, the majority of whom would only be subjected to one scrutinization process yearly. Instead, they were left to their own twisted behavior under the excuse of civil liberties, and what happened? We had the Orlando gay club massacre, and now Fort Lauderdale. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out there’s a pretty obvious pattern here. And you better believe there’s more of them coming. So, when the next one happens, I’m not even going to look into who or what the shooter was. I’m directly going after Obama for carelessness on the job and dereliction of duty. Because, he was many things as president, but a patriot was not one of them,” Palin concluded.Most Popular >>

The American military has, characteristically, co-opted this information--and the related technology--for its own ends, developing two secret, and originally unrelated, programs.  One, Project Scoop, was set up to carefully harvest new and deadly pathogens from space for future use in the Cold War. The other, Project Wildfire, was charged with figuring out how to deal with alien organisms should they happen to make it to Earth.  The two projects collide when a mysterious space capsule recovered by the puzzled inhabitants of tiny Piedmont, Ariz., (population: 48) turns out to be the latest Scoop satellite--newly returned from a disastrously successful mission.  Only two of the locals, a crying baby and a crotchety old man, escape the wave of sudden and bizarre deaths that follows.The events at Piedmont activate Project Wildfire, throwing together a team of four brilliant and idiosyncratic scientists.  The team descends into a laboratory bunker that's been painstakingly designed to allow a rigorous, wide-ranging and cutting-edge study of lethal organisms in total isolation.  Unfortunately, a simple but important imperfection in this splendid bunker mirrors the fallibility of the scientists working in it.This is a story not of machines and computers, but of men who must deal with a heart-stopping crisis. Told in retrospect, as if the events described were a matter of record, The Andromeda Strain cagily discloses the scientists' mistakes as well as their breakthroughs. As the pressure builds and the clock ticks down, readers are left in anxious suspense over how these remarkable men at the end of their rope will prevent total catastrophe.Mixing suspense and science fictionMichael Crichton's The Andromeda Strain is a science fiction landmark. On its surface, it's the prototype of the techno-thriller, the forerunner not only of Richard Preston's The Hot Zone but also of Tom Clancy and Dean Koontz. It's also, at its core, one of the purest specimens of science fiction on bookshelves today.  This book explores not imagined worlds in far-off galaxies, but where science leads humanity, and where humanity leads science.Crichton crafts a story that's unhurried but immediate, carefully researched but with an everyday plausibility that strikes close to home.  There's nothing extraneous: even where he seems to dally for a moment, he's surreptitiously building the story around readers brick by brick, shunting them deeper into the tale.  His cleanness and clearness in exposing the raw humanity of his characters pays off in a climax that feels like a shot of adrenaline.Crichton's effort to explain technologies that were new or theoretical in 1969 ought to make the narration feel quaint and dated.  Instead, these explanations are written in such a way that the advanced capabilities of the Wildfire laboratory are placed in context, allowing readers to react to each innovation with contemporary eyes.  This is the key to making a techno-thriller, which might have fallen flat over time (once things like computer time-sharing were old news), into an engrossing time capsule not only of technologies but of attitudes and expectations.  (The complete absence of substantive female characters, while troubling, may be viewed in this context as well: The scientific establishment's boy's-club mentality was still a potent force in 1969.)Compared with the turgid, commercial works of today, The Andromeda Strain stands out as a singular achievement both for science fiction and for Crichton himself.For any fan of taut, suspenseful science fiction, The Andromeda Strain is a must-read. -- Mark
https://www.snopes.com/robert-gallo-invented-hiv-aids/	Did the Man Who Discovered the HIV Virus Confess to ‘Inventing’ It?	false	['aids', ' anti news network', ' conspiracy theories', ' fake news', ' hiv', ' robert gallo', ' your news wire']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/K4IWw	2017/06/12	 Post Views: 29,290Dr. Gallo: “I Invented AIDS To Depopulate Humanity”:Dr. Robert Gallo, the scientist credited with ‘discovering’ the HIV virus in 1984, has admitted that he created AIDS in order to reduce the world’s population. In 1984, Gallo filed a U.S. patent application for his invention of the HIV/AIDS virus.Dailypost.co.za   reports:Normally, when a patent is filed and approved, as Dr. Gallo’s was, anyone who uses the product or invention owes a royalty payment to the artificer.Thus, holding the intellectual property laws to their fullest interpretations, one must solely marvel why Dr. Gallo has yet to file a proceedings seeking to recover damages from the usage of his invention? As odd as this state of affairs could sound, it bears need for extra scrutiny.The scientific evidence is complete and compelling, the AIDS Virus is a designer bi-product of the U.S. Special Virus program. The Special Virus program was a federal virus development program that persisted in the U.S from 1962 until 1978…..The U.S. Special Virus was then added as ‘compliment’ to vaccinum inoculations in Africa and Manhattan. Shortly thereafter the world was engulfed with mass infections of somebody’s animal virus that differed from any illustrious human sickness, it was highly contagious and additional significantly,A review of the Special Virus Flow Chart (“research logic”) reveals the United States was seeking a ‘virus particle’ that might negatively impact the defense mechanisms of the system. The program sought to modify the ordination of the virus particle during which to splice in associate degree animal “wasting disease” referred to as “Visna”.According to the Proceedings of the us of America, AIDS is an biological process, laboratory development of the peculiar Visna Virus, first detected in Icelandic sheep. Recently, American and world scientists ensure with 100 percent certainty the laboratory genesis of AIDS.This fact is more underscored once one reviews the ‘multiply-spliced’ nature of the HIV ‘tat’ sequence and Dr. Gallo’s 1971 Special Virus paper, “Reverse Transcriptase of Type-C virus Particles of Human Origin”.Dr. Gallo’s 1971 Special Virus paper is identical to his 1984 announcement of AIDS. Upon further review the record reveals that he filed his patent on AIDS, before he made the announcement with Secretary troubler. Earlier this year, Dr. Gallo conceded his role as a ‘Project Officer’ for the federal virus development program, the Special Virus.The Flow Chart of the program and the 15 progress reports are undeniable proof of the United States’ game to cull world populations via the unleashing of a stealing biological organism that may ‘waste’ humanity.In light of this true genesis of the world’s most divesting biological scourge, it is the u. s. that owes ‘royal’ payments to the innocent victims. Each associated each victim of AIDS is worthy of a proper apology and a way of economic closure for an invention of death and despair, perpetrated by the United States.The eyes of the world are upon the overall Accounting Office’s Health Care Team, under the direction of William J. Scanlon. Between 1964 and 1978, the secret federal virus program spent $550 million dollars of payer cash to create AIDS. It is now necessary to pay no matter it takes to dismantle associate invention that has junction rectifier to the best crime against humanity within the history of the globe.

This week, the states Republican-led senate passed the so-called Mississippi Church Protection Act which would militarize the states churches while also walking back gun regulations and stripping away oversight.The bill would allow churches to create security programs and designate and train members to carry concealed weapons. It would provide criminal and legal protections to those serving as church security.The bill also would allow concealed carry in a holster without a permit in Mississippi, expanding a measure passed last year that allowed concealed carry without a permit in a purse, satchel or briefcase, and another recent law that allows open carry in public.The bill also seeks to prohibit Mississippi officials from enforcing any federal agency regulations or executive orders that would violate the state constitution  an attempt to federal gun restrictions not passed by Congress.Mississippi church goers will now get to assign church members as security which can carry concealed weapons without permits and are protected from legal liability if their actions result in death based on a designation of justifiable homicide  the same legal standing that we afford police officers on duty.@pourmecoffee It passed pic.twitter.com/H8WvOdHFA4 pourmecoffee (@pourmecoffee) March 30, 2016What could go wrong?Much of this baffling new legislation is in direct response to NRA lobbying directives to erode existing gun laws in order to create a polite society of heavily-armed citizens. Exploiting tragedy (and ignoring irony) the NRA has used recent mass shootings to push for more guns, not less.

Data suggests that as the number of guns increase, the risk of someone being shot by those guns also increases. Places with a lot of good guys with guns tend to have higher incidences of gun injuries. Go figure. At the same time, anecdotal evidence supports these warnings as well. Weve seen that guns in churches often lead to disastrous accidents, while at the same time not once stopping a mass shooting in a house of worship.With the removal of even permit requirements, Mississippi is planning on handing over the power of life and death to a bunch of untrained, untested amateurs who wont even have the risk of prosecution keeping their index finger off the trigger.

									 Update 12:20 pm 11/09/16: You can read our retraction and apology here. Update 11:16 AM 11/09/16: We have received reports that “pro-life” was removed from Trump’s list of policies several days ago or, counter to our understanding when this was published, may never have been there at all. Other pro-life content seems to have been removed from Trump’s site between Nov 6 and today. We will update further as soon as we have anything clearer than that. I mentioned this in my earlier post but I need to emphasize it right now. Less than half a day after Donald J. Trump was elected president of the United States, he removed the words “pro-life” from his list of policies on his official website. Have a look for yourself. Yes. The man who was always pro-abortion, who conveniently discovered the value of unborn human life after announcing his candidacy for president, has removed “pro-life” from his policies less than a day after using the pro-life movement and getting what he wanted from them. Congratulations to all of the staunch conservative “pro-lifers” who decided this was their one issue and the only way to achieve it was to vote Republican. Congratulations to everybody who called me a pro-abort when I said that ‘pro-life” leaders needed to repent of their Republican idolatry. He used you and dumped you, just as Steel Magnificat and anyone else with more sense than gravel predicted from the beginning. Now you know what his ex wives feel like. I hope you feel filthy. You elected a pro-abortion philandering racist narcissist, because you thought it was the only way to be “pro-life.”
	

	
You sold your birthright for a bowl of lentils and now you don’t get to eat the lentils either. I wonder if the disgraced perpetrator of public sacrilege Father Frank Pavone, who devoted the past year to getting Trump elected and who is currently under investigation by his bishop for desecrating a naked dead infant and a holy altar, still thinks he’s going to be put on Trump’s Catholic advisory board. As I’ve previously stated, if anyone wants to join with me in forming a movement that actually respects all life from conception until natural death, I’m keen, but I feel like I should never use “pro-life” without scare quotes again. The “pro-life” movement as it stands today is nothing but a group of Republican shills and they’ve gotten exactly what they deserved.

https://www.snopes.com/john-mccain-fire-uss-forrestal/	Did John McCain Cause a Fire Aboard the USS Forrestal that Killed 134 People?	false	['john mccain', ' uss forrestal', ' uss forrestal fire']	https://www.dailykos.com/	https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2008/9/12/596595/-	2017/10/24	"In 1967, the USS Forrestal suffered near catastrophic damage from a fire that raged on-board for nearly two days. John McCain was stationed on the Forrestal at the time and was quite likely responsible for the fire that killed 134 sailors and injured 62 others. Hot dog pilots were well known for their ""wet-starts,"" a process which allows fuel to build up in the engine before hitting the plane's start switch. The result of the wet-start is a long flame erupting from the tail of the plane. It was done simply for effect, a showy procedure meant to draw attention to the pilot. On June 29, 1967, John McCain is alleged to have used a wet-start to ""shake up"" a pilot in the plane behind him. The result was a fired rocket, dropped bombs and a fire that raged for nearly two days. 134 sailors lost their lives and another 62 were badly injured. McCain never had to answer for the incident. His father and grandfather were Navy admirals with a great deal of sway. Three months after the Forrestal disaster McCain was shot down over North Vietnam. You know the rest of the story. Is this man a maverick or a dangerous lunatic? Should we wait until he is president to know the answer?"

Secret Service agents rushed the stage to protect the billionaire business mogul.Thomas Dimassimo was identified as the barrier jumper. He was charged with inducing panic and disorderly conduct, Montgomery County Sheriff Phil Plummer said.Trump’s path continued onto Kansas City, Mo. where he was interrupted numerous times. At least seven individuals stalled the rally in the first few minutes.""I think they're Bernie [Sanders] supporters,"" Trump said of the protesters, pointing to at least one protester the Republican frontrunner said was holding a sign in support of the Democratic presidential candidate.Trump canceled his rally at the University of Illinois at Chicago on Friday after violence broke out in the arena where he was scheduled to speak. He spoke later to Fox News, saying he canceled the event because he didn’t want to see “people get hurt.”He said he made the decision to cancel after meeting with law enforcement authorities. Trump also said his First Amendment rights had been violated.Hours earlier, Trump supporters and opponents stood calmly in a line together waiting to get inside. Police horses and barricades kept the bulk of the demonstrators across the street.Trump opponents were protesting what they called his divisive comments, particularly about Muslims and Mexicans. Dozens of UIC faculty and staff had petitioned university administrators to cancel the rally, citing concerns it would create a ""hostile and physically dangerous environment.""At one point, nearly 20 officers who had been manning barricades suddenly bolted for an intersection across a street bridge over a freeway -- where protesters shouted at and jostled with police already there. An officer was seen walking from that intersection with blood on his head.For Sunday, Trump is expected to make a stop in Bloomington, Illinois. He is expected to be met with more protests and local officials said they would be deploying extra police.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Advertisement"

As a teen, he dreamed of becoming an anthropologist and later an illustrator, which his father, the owner of a stationery store, called ""not a proper occupation."" But Lucas is sure that the Force was always with him. ""I believe that even if I had become an anthropologist, I still would've started making movies and ended up right where I am now,"" he says. ""This path has been too strongly etched, and it's too winding."" While he has been wandering, we've been wondering:

Q: You're only now making the beginning of the Star Wars series. Why didn't you start with the beginning in 1977, instead of with Episode IV? A: Originally when I wrote Star Wars, it was meant to be one episode of a Saturday-matinee serial and you came in in the middle of it. I wrote a couple of screenplays, and they got very big, so I took the first act and made a movie out of that, but I swore to make the rest of the movie in three parts. In order to do that, I had to write a back story, so I said maybe I'll do the prequels. Q: You started out as an avant-garde director. How did you end up making movies for 12-year-olds? A: American Graffiti got so successful, I thought, Gee, making films for younger people actually is not a bad thing. I've always been very curious about culture, how a society develops its own equilibrium. I realized we were out of equilibrium at some point. We had reached a period in terms of our society of not having a mythology, a code that you pass down to the next generation. Friendship is valuable, honor is valuable. There wasn't a movie genre like that aimed at younger people, the 12-year-olds coming of age. Q: The morals we learn from Darth Vader's lifeabout letting go and making amendsare dominant themes in 12-step programs. Did you ever go through recovery for drugs or alcohol? A: I never did drugs. Drinking was never a problem. But I've done a lot of research, and those [morals] are very valid. The interesting thing about the 12 steps is that they work, and not just for addictive people. I'm very interested in psychology. I dabble in that stuff with my friends. I spend most of my fun time arguing, pontificating, discussing those things. Q: What religion are you? A: I was raised Methodist. Now let's say I'm spiritual. It's Marin County. We're all Buddhists up here. Q: Do you read reviews? A: I gave up reading reviews a long time ago. It's become a medium that is more like gossip. Q: Do you read about Star Wars on the Internet? A: When I was working on Phantom Menace, I saw a lot of the Internet stuff. I lasted about six weeks. Q: Why do the women in your movies have such crazy hairdos? A: In the 1977 film, I was working very hard to create something different that wasn't fashion, so I went with a kind of Southwestern Pancho Villa woman revolutionary look, which is what that is. The buns are basically from turn-of-the-century Mexico. Then it took such hits and became such a thing. In the new trilogy, the same thing applies, to try and do something timeless. I'm just basically having a good time.

The victims, all black men in their early 20s, were torn limb from limb and fed to Scott’s impressive collection of deadly reptiles.While she refused to answer questions, her lawyer did disclose that Ms. Scott was the victim of several black men in her early 20s:“One left when she got pregnant, forcing her to abort. One took everything she owned and slipped out in the middle of the night and the last one, when she told him about her misfortune and told him she wanted to go slow, raped her and got away with it.My client has a reason to dislike young, attractive black men.”Some would agree. Most would also say that just because you’re the victim of hood rats and thugs doesn’t give you the right to go and murder people. Maybe if it were self-defense, but she lured all of her subsequent victims with marijuana and home cooking. She recorded every moment.The case against her will certainly ruin Senator Montgomery, as much of the carnage happened when he was the governor of Delaware right in the Executive Mansion. The Delaware Attorney general says she will definitely be seeking the death penalty. Join America's Last Line of Defense And Share This Article Now!2.3k

Read moreStrange is facing a runoff election on Tuesday for the GOP nomination to hold the seat he was appointed to in February. The former state attorney general was handed the seat after former senator Jeff Sessions was appointed attorney general by Trump. Strange is currently trailing in the polls against Roy Moore, an ardent social conservative who has twice been removed as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court.The race has become a top priority for Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and a superPAC affiliated with him will spend over $9m on Stranges behalf. The Alabama senator is seen as reliable vote for Republican priorities while Moore has mused about making homosexual conduct illegal and suggested that the terrorist attacks of 11 September may have been divine retribution for the United States turning away from God. The campaign has largely focused on McConnell. Moore has attacked the Senate majority leader as a creature of the swamp that Trump wishes to drain while Strange has tried to distance himself from the Kentucky Republican. Strange went as far as to assert in his brief introductory remarks on Friday night that Trump was backing him so that he could have the votes in the Senate to stand up to Mitch McConnell. The President later asserted that Strange didnt know the Senate majority leader. Trump repeatedly praised Strange and often calling the 69ft senator Big Luther. However, he did note that Moore, who has been backed by a number of prominent conservatives including former Trump aide Steve Bannon, was a good man and that he would campaign for him if the former chief justice won on Tuesday. Instead of direct criticism, Trump simply claimed Moore would a face a difficult general election in deep red Alabama. He said Moore has a very good chance of not winning a general election. Trump also dwelled on the political risk he was taking backing Strange, insisting that the media would attack him if the Alabama Republican lost.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Senator Strange prepares to introduce the President Trump during the rally in Huntsville. Photograph: Marvin Gentry/ReutersIn between his praise of Strange, Trump touched on a smorgasbord of topics. He renewed his criticism of Kim Jong-un, whom he called both Rocket Man and Little Rocket Man and warning of the risk posed by North Koreas nuclear program and its recent threats to test a hydrogen bomb. Now hes talking about a massive weapon exploding over the Pacific Ocean, which causes calamity. Where the plume goes, so goes cancer, so goes tremendous problems. However, Trump confidently said Im going to handle it.Hours after John McCain torpedoed Republican hopes to repeal and replace Obamacare, Trump expressed his disappointment. He said McCains opposition was totally unexpected and terrible. He also chided the Arizona Republican for what he saw as hypocrisy. Repeal and replace, John McCain if you look at his last campaign its all about repeal and replace and thats fine, we still have a good chance [of repealing and replacing Obamacare. He described his attempts to court senators on health care, saying Im on the phone screaming at people all day long for weeks.Trump also returned to some of his favourite topics. He talked at length about the wall he hopes to build on the Mexican border, insisting it needed to be see-through. Trump said this was because drug dealers are currently using catapults to send 100 pound bags of drugs over the existing concrete wall and they are landing on peoples heads in the United States. He also responded the familiar cheers of lock her up directed at Hillary Clinton by telling the crowd you gotta speak to Jeff Sessions about that.The president also dwelled on NFL players who take a knee during the National Anthem in peaceful protest. He asked the crowd, Wouldnt you love one of the NFL owners when someone disrespects our flag, get that son of a bitch off the field right now. He told attendees, If you see it, leave the stadium, I guarantee things will stop. Since 2016, a number of African American NFL players have taken a knee during the National Anthem. It was spurred by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick who was the first to do so in protest what he saw as oppression of people of color. Several other players have since followed suit and it has sparked national controversy.Trumps visit to Alabama comes just four days before the primary runoff and only hours after Ben Carson, a member of Trumps cabinet, issued a quasi-endorsement of Moore. In a statement issued by Moores campaign, Trumps secretary of housing and urban development said Judge Moore is a fine man of proven character and integrity, who I have come to respect over the years.

Maybe I am the best Conspiracy theorist the world has ever seen. I hold a golden nugget of secret super classified information. I am going to spill a small bean of the master plan. It is up to the second best conspiracy theorist to find my jar. So we all talk about the illuminati but what do we actually know. I for one can tell you every women that gives birth to a child is actually an officer in the illuminati procreation wing of the establishment. They are made to breed on a pure and mixed illuminati new arian order. This order is being brainwashed by there mothers. The mothers are created around the Atlantic ocean where the lizard people from Planet X landed and still live . These lizard people are actually close relatives to the bildenbergers who made the shell corporation in contract with the lizard people. Its actually very easy because the lizardpeople live in the ground the have created an easy to mine and easy to create power source named OIL. What I am trying to say is that the lizard people produce oil which is not a fossil fuel in contract with the Bilderbergers to create a dependency around the world. Without us knowing we are actually enslaved by the lizard people. If we look close in the religions there is a little hint at who could be the lizard people. Ask yourself who has all the oil also who covers a part of their civilization in burkas to cover up there lizardpeople like trait from the rest of the humanity?"

I used to tease him, saying he looked like one and that he’d find his soulmate in the jungle. Never would I have thought he would be sexually assaulted by one ”– Kelly O’Reilly, motherThe young man was quickly brought back to a missionary hospital near Kalimantan where he lay unconscious for many hours and where doctors found traces of internal bleeding.Kelly O’Reilly, the victim’s mother, says she used to tease him, telling her son he looked like a orangutan, but she never suspected he would be sexually assaulted by one, she told reporters in tearsFamiliar traitsKekbek Mahlouiak, one of the tour guides present on the dramatic trip, says he has warned various tourists to be careful around the animals.“I specifically told him to wear a hat and hide his orange hair, that it could entice the orangutans. I’m not surprised of what has happened, I warned him many times. He did not listen,” he told local reporters.“It is very dangerous for people with orange hair, the males get very excited. A male followed us deep into the jungle many kilometers, he was very aggressive. There is nothing I could do,” he added.An isolated incidentA spokeswoman for the Borneo Tourism Board said it is the first time an orangutan has physically assaulted a tourist on one of their jungle treks.“We are deeply horrified and saddened by the whole affair. We have offered the young victim a free tour if he ever wishes to come back again and will provide increased security for our travelers in the future,” she added.A similar incident was previously reported in a Jakarta zoo in 2014, when a young red-haired woman was hospitalized after an orangutan broke out of its cage and tried to mate with the visitor, resulting in the death of the animal by zoo employees.

Babcock By Charles R. Babcock May 28, 1992The net worth of Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary increased significantly over the past two years to nearly $700,000, according to a financial statement the Democratic presidential candidate released yesterday.An 84 percent increase in the value of their investment portfolio and including the couples' $180,200 in retirement plans in their assets accounted for most of the change, campaign aide Betsey Wright said. Their net worth at the end of 1989 was $418,692.The statement shows the Clintons' personal wealth, though more than that of most Americans, is far less than that of his likely rivals in the presidential race, Texas businessman Ross Perot and President Bush.Perot's fortune has been estimated at more than $2 billion. Bush released a detailed financial statement recently indicating his net worth is about $3.7 million, including $1.3 million in a blind trust and the $2.2 million value of his home in Kennebunkport, Maine. Bush listed no liabilities.The Clinton statement said that as of Dec. 31, 1991, the couple had assets of $862,980 and liabilities of $165,603. The assets were listed as $158,056 in cash, $387,077 in investments, including stocks and partnerships, the $180,200 in the retirement plans, an $80,000 interest in a condominium and $57,647 in personal property.The debts were a $64,848 mortgage for half-interest in a Little Rock condominium they own with Hillary's parents and a $100,755 bank loan from the 1990 governor's race. The campaign committee will pay back the gubernatorial loan, Wright said.Two years ago, the Clintons released a net worth statement listing assets of $489,692 and a single liability, the then-$71,000 mortgage. Listed separately at the time were retirement accounts totaling about $124,000.According to federal tax returns they made public, the Clintons' total income for 1991 was $234,428, up 19 percent from 1989.politicsGet 2016 Olympics updates by emailOur best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox.post_newsletter333
https://www.snopes.com/reddit-rape-guidelines/	Does a Meme Accurately Advise Sexual Assault Victims?	mixture	['rainn', ' rape', ' rape awareness', ' rape kits', ' rape prevention', ' reddit']	https://www.reddit.com/	https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/6r36zm/these_guidelines_on_what_to_do_after_rape_or/	2017/08/02	Who the fuck would report being raped by a girl. I was raped by a female. I never reported it. I got made fun of for it, ridiculed for it, had a q-tip shoved up my urethra for it(medical test). It doesn't phase me emotionally that it happened, but when a guy is passed out on a couch and some bitch wakes him up a little drags him to a closet when he can't stand up straight and has no idea what is happening, throws him on the floor and then touches his dick until it's hard and then fucks his semi unconscious body all the while everyone at the party is completely aware of exactly what was happening and instead they just find the situation fucking hilarious. So when that guy wakes up at 4am naked covered in blood(from a nosebleed from falling down on the way to closet) with no idea what happens and calls a friend for a ride and all they do is make fun of them for fucking a fat girl then yeah, maybe that guy develops some anger issues. I was raped. Half the people that read this won't believe me. The other half will just say you shouldn't have gotten that drunk or that it's impossible to get a boner if you're unconscious. The worst part is the double standards. All the girls and guys saw me getting dragged into a closet. All of them saw her leave and me stay in there. And the only reaction was laughter and ridicule. And I don't even want to know what would have happened if I called the cops from that bum fuck college town and told them I got raped. They would have made a laughing stock at me. If I made a big deal at a university? I would have been denigrated and abused and insulted to no end. There is no avenue to report female on male rape. Had I been a girl and some guy dragged me into a closet, the people at that house would have probably murdered the guy. I'm not emotionally scarred or anything but it irritates  me when people make light of this issue. I was raped and there was nothing I could do about it after the fact. Other than get an STD test, which sucked so much.

https://www.snopes.com/trump-leaks-classified-info/	Trump Leaks Classified Info After Intelligence Briefing	false	['classified information', ' donald trump', ' national security', ' saudi arabia']	https://www.washingtonpost.com/	https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/29/clinton-and-trump-will-soon-receive-classified-briefings-heres-how-that-works/	2016/07/30	"At some point, perhaps as early as next week, federal agents will sit down with Donald Trump and tell him classified information about the government and our foreign-policy efforts. For Democrats, this is a point of both anguish and political calculation. Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid has suggested that Trump's murky ties to foreign interests and general inability to not speak his mind should be reason enough for the people briefing him to simply make things up. On the Republican side, there are similar calls to ban Hillary Clinton from being briefed, including by Trump, pointing to her use of a personal email server while she served as secretary of state. And here's the thing: If he wanted to, President Obama could deny either or both of them the now-traditional briefings. The process doesn't work the way you might think. For one thing, the briefings are not legally mandated. They are a courtesy provided by the sitting president, nothing more. In an email, historian Michael Beschloss explained that the process began with President Harry Truman. In 1952, as Truman was preparing to leave the White House, he ordered that the CIA brief Dwight Eisenhower and Adlai Stevenson ""so that they would campaign with greater insight and also know key national security players once elected."" (A bigger problem, he notes, for Stevenson, a governor, than Eisenhower, who'd commanded the Allied invasion of Normandy.) No president has to do it; presidents a century ago didn't. For another, the briefings are not an ongoing series of updates about everything affecting our foreign policy. They aren't as regular or as detailed as the Presidential Daily Brief, for example. It's at most a couple of in-person meetings between the candidate, a staffer and representatives of the American intelligence community. Lanhee Chen, who worked as the chief policy adviser to Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign, spoke with The Washington Post by phone on Thursday. Chen was the one staffer that attended Mitt Romney's two briefings four years ago. The former secretary of state, senator and first lady is the Democratic nominee for president. Wait 1 second to continue. ""The nominee has access to one, maybe two or three [briefings] upon request, but that's it,"" Chen said. ""Because it's not like you have a ton of time to sit there and get briefed every day anyway."" ""The briefings have to take place in SCIFs"" — sensitive compartmented information facilities — ""or secure conferencing facilities that the government has, so it's not like you can just get the briefing on the campaign bus,"" he said. ""We had two briefings: One was at the federal building in Los Angeles in September, and the second was a few weeks later at a secure facility in the Washington, D.C., metro area. That was it."" The number and content of those briefings are negotiated between the campaign and the White House. A memorandum of understanding is drafted between the two parties to formalize the agreement, but Chen notes that the process was remarkably easy and cordial — particularly given that the administration that was briefing Romney was also in the process of trying to defeat him electorally. The briefings themselves Chen described as a sort of presentation followed by a question-and-answer period. ""It is, as I understand it, the same team of briefers from the intelligence community that prepare the briefing for the candidate"" as those who do the president's daily briefing, Chen said. ""But the level of detail as well as the amount of information covered is not the same. It is meant to be a background briefing more than anything else."" The information that's presented is tailored to what the candidate would like to know; as you might expect, there are no handouts. It's worth noting that, while these are the only formal briefings, there was information shared by the federal government with the Romney campaign outside of the scope of national security. As Hurricane Sandy approached that fall, Chen said, the campaign was given emergency-response information from the Federal Emergency Management Administration and the Department of Homeland Security. Businessman Donald Trump officially became the Republican nominee at the party’s convention in Cleveland. Wait 1 second to continue. In order to participate in the briefings, Chen had to complete paperwork to grant him top-secret security clearance, which he held through the end of the campaign. Romney didn't, Chen said. ""The assumption is that a certain amount of sensitive information can be shared with the nominee because the nominee has been publicly vetted,"" Chen said. Both GOP vice-presidential nominee Rep. Paul D. Ryan and Romney had held or did hold security clearance (Romney's stemming from his time managing the 2002 Winter Olympics), but if they hadn't — like Trump — they would not have had to submit the same documentation. ""The information we received was obviously classified,"" he said, ""but I don't believe that that information was of the same scope and specificity that the president or vice president or other national security leaders get once they're actually in office."" He also indicated that the people conducting the briefing were more than capable of understanding what sorts of boundaries to information-sharing shouldn't and wouldn't be crossed. For those worried about a candidate getting access to information and then using it in the campaign, it has happened — or so Richard Nixon believed. Beschloss related a story about the 1960 election, pitting John F. Kennedy against Nixon, who was then serving as vice president to Eisenhower, known colloquially as ""Ike."" In 1960, Ike had JFK briefed by CIA Director Allen Dulles. That fall, JFK publicly called for US-backed “freedom-fighters” to invade Castro’s Cuba. Nixon was furious, presuming that Dulles had told JFK about the CIA-backed invasion then being planned (the record is unclear about what exactly Dulles told JFK about this), and that JFK had gone ahead and publicly called for something he knew the CIA was secretly planning. Nixon said in his book ""Six Crises"" that, to protect the operation’s secrecy, he felt compelled in his TV debates against JFK to denounce the idea of such an invasion, which he did — handing JFK the potent Cuba issue, so he felt. Also Nixon was angry at Dulles for not using his briefing of JFK to definitively knock down the idea of a Missile Gap — notion that USSR was soaring ahead of US in missiles — leaving JFK free to use this important issue in the campaign. Nixon felt that Dulles did so deliberately in order to cultivate JFK and get reappointed to the CIA, which he was. It left Nixon forever suspicious of the CIA and its ability to foil him politically (a refrain you can hear on the Nixon tapes when he was President). Chen doesn't figure that concerns about either of the current nominees potentially using information to their advantage (or letting something slip) will cause the Obama administration to avoid briefing a candidate or skip the briefings entirely. He notes that what is disclosed is up to the administration, and how it is disclosed is up to people briefing the candidates who are well aware of the risks of sharing information — and how to nuance what's said. But he also notes that the process of national security briefings is a small part of what makes presidential transitions smooth and conflict-free.""There is a lot of discretion, comity and professional courtesy involved in how it all works. But it did all work,"" he said. ""It sort of gave me even more faith in the nature of our democratic system,"" Chen said, ""that there could be this kind of information-sharing and civil dialogue, even in the heat of a very, very difficult campaign."" Or put another way: The briefings are a well-controlled feature to our democracy, not a bug."

This type of thing happens from time to time: A little kid finds a gun, fires it, and hurts or kills himself or someone else. These cases rarely bubble up to the national level except when someone, like a parent , ends up dead.But cases like this happen a lot more frequently than you might think. After spending a few hours sifting through news reports, I've found at least 43 instances this year of somebody being shot by a toddler 3 or younger. In 31 of those 43 cases, a toddler found a gun and shot himself or herself.In August, for instance, a 21-month-old in the St. Louis area found a loaded handgun at his grandmother's house and shot himself in the torso. His mother took him to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Earlier in the year a Michigan 3-year-old found a loaded .40-caliber handgun in a closet while his dad and brother were outside. He shot himself in the head and died before rescue workers arrived.[ This is what one year of gun deaths in America looks like ]The stories go on and on like this: Roughly once a week this year, on average, a small child has found a gun, pointed it at himself or someone else, and pulled the trigger. Boys are disproportionately likely to do this: I could find only three cases where a girl under the age of 4 wounded someone with a gun. In 13 of the 43 total incidents, a child's self-inflicted injuries were fatal. In two other cases, another person died after being shot by a toddler: a father in Alabama , and a 1-year-old in Ohio .In one instance, a 3-year-old managed to wound both of his parents with a single gunshot at an Albuquerque motel. Shootings by toddlers have happened in 24 states so far this year. Missouri has seen the most, with five separate incidents. Florida has had four. Texas, three. Due to the low number of total cases and the isolated nature of these incidents I'd caution against drawing broad conclusions from the map above. But it is worth noting that the shootings don't necessarily follow broader population trends. California, the most populous state in the nation, hasn't had any. Nobody has been shot by a toddler in New England or the Upper Midwest.These numbers are probably an undercount. There are likely instances of toddlers shooting people that result in minor injuries and no media coverage. And there are probably many more cases where a little kid inadvertently shoots a gun and doesn't hit anyone, resulting in little more than a scared kid and (hopefully) chastened parents.Notably, these numbers don't include cases where toddlers are shot, intentionally or otherwise, by older children or adults. Dozens of preschoolers are killed in acts of homicide each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . But I haven't included those figures here.[ How often do children in the U.S. unintentionally shoot and kill people? We don’t know. ]These cases are invariably referred to as ""accidents"" in media reports. But as Everytown for Gun Safety, a group that advocates for stricter gun laws, argues, many incidents like this are preventable. In a study of accidental shootings by children of all ages (not just toddlers), they estimate that ""more than two-thirds of these tragedies could be avoided if gun owners stored their guns responsibly and prevented children from accessing them.""There are policy and technical responses to preventable childhood gun deaths as well. States and localities could require guns to be locked up at home, a policy supported by 67 percent of Americans . Various types of smart gun technology, which prevent anyone other than their owners from firing a given gun, exist as well . But gun lock requirements and smart guns have been vehemently opposed by the National Rifle Association and its allies.Instead, the NRA continues to promote a response that seeks to solve gun problems with more guns , and aims to broaden the saturation of firearms in nearly every sphere of public and private life, from homes to schools to churches to bars to airports and beyond. In a country with more guns than people , it's only natural that a certain number of small children are going get their hands on an unsecured firearm, with tragic consequences.[ Guns in America: For every criminal killed in self-defense, 34 innocent people die ]Depending on where you stand on gun policy, you may feel that 13 dead toddlers in 10 months is too many.

(Courtesy: Brittany Mann)There was no halftime show under the Friday night lights at Mississippi’s Brandon High School — the marching band had been benched.The band was ordered off the field because the Christian hymn “How Great Thou Art” was a part of their halftime show — in violation of a federal court order.Click here to join Todd’s American Dispatch - a MUST-READ for Conservatives!  “The Rankin County School Board and District Office are very saddened students will not be able to perform their halftime show they have worked so hard on this summer,” the district wrote in a statement to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.In 2013 a student sued the district over a series of Christian meetings that had been held on school property, the newspaper reported. The district later settled the lawsuit and acknowledged they had violated the student’s First Amendment rights.  In July, U.S. District Court Judge Carlton Reeves ruled the district had violated the agreement after a Christian minister delivered a prayer at an awards ceremony.  Judge Reeves, who was appointed to the bench by President Obama, came down hard on the school district — ordering them to pay thousands of dollars in fines. He also warned the district that future violations would cost them $10,000.“Defendants are permanently enjoined from including prayer, religious sermons or activities in any school sponsored event including but not limited to assemblies, graduations, award ceremonies, athletic events and any other school event,” the order reads.Word about the band getting benched spread across the town quicker than kudzu. I must have received emails and Facebook messages from nearly the entire state - from Desoto County to Yazoo City.   Something must be done to right this wrong, people said. A message had to be sent to the likes of Judge Reeves. Locals  gathered in coffee shops and garages to devise their plan. And what they did — would become known as the musical shot heard around the world.During halftime of Friday night’s game - a lone voice began to sing the forbidden song.“Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee,” the singer sang.Brittany Mann was there and she witnessed the entire moment of defiance. “We were just sitting there and then one by one people started to stand,” she told me. “At first, it started out as a hum but the sound got louder and louder.”She said it was a “truly incredible” moment to watch hundreds of people singing together in the stadium. “At that moment I was so proud of my town - coming together and taking a stand for something we believe in,” she said. “It breaks my heart to see where our country is going — getting farther and farther away from the Christian beliefs that our country was founded on.”  I suspect Miss Brittany wasn’t the only one who felt a sense of pride in the Magnolia State on that warm summer night.   “We may be pictured as toothless, barefoot, uneducated people around the country, but we are far from it,” nearby resident Mandy Miller told me. “I’m from Mississippi and I’m not ashamed to take a stand.”  Oh what a sight it must have been — as hundreds and hundreds of people stood together and with one voice — sent a message to Judge Reeves.“This is the kind of thing that makes me proud to be from the South,” Miss Mandy told me. “We are getting tired of being told to sit down and shut up. People are ready to fight back.”Miss Mandy is absolutely right. The time has come to stand up to the secularists.The time has come to put an end to their cultural jihad. I hope the Rankin County School Board will reconsider its decision and allow the marching band to resume performing “How Great Thou Art.”    And should Judge Reeves make good on his threat to financially punish the school district, I will personally pay the $10,000 fine. Todd Starnes is host of Fox News & Commentary.

https://www.snopes.com/judi-dench-harvey-weinstein-tattoo/	Does Judi Dench Have a Harvey Weinstein Tattoo?	false	['harvey weinstein', ' judi dench', ' judi dench tattoo']	https://www.nytimes.com/	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html	2017/10/09	An investigation by The New York Times found previously undisclosed allegations against Mr. Weinstein stretching over nearly three decades, documented through interviews with current and former employees and film industry workers, as well as legal records, emails and internal documents from the businesses he has run, Miramax and the Weinstein Company. During that time, after being confronted with allegations including sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact, Mr. Weinstein has reached at least eight settlements with women, according to two company officials speaking on the condition of anonymity. Among the recipients, The Times found, were a young assistant in New York in 1990, an actress in 1997, an assistant in London in 1998, an Italian model in 2015 and Ms. O’Connor shortly after, according to records and those familiar with the agreements. In a statement to The Times on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Weinstein said: “I appreciate the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it. I am a 28 year old woman trying to make a living and a career. Harvey Weinstein is a 64 year old, world famous man and this is his company. The balance of power is me: 0, Harvey Weinstein: 10. Lisa Bloom, a lawyer advising Mr. Weinstein, said in a statement that “he denies many of the accusations as patently false.” In comments to The Times earlier this week, Mr. Weinstein said that many claims in Ms. O’Connor’s memo were “off base” and that they had parted on good terms. He and his representatives declined to comment on any of the settlements, including providing information about who paid them. Ms. Though Ms. O’Connor had been writing only about a two-year period, her memo echoed other women’s complaints. Mr. Weinstein required her to have casting discussions with aspiring actresses after they had private appointments in his hotel room, she said, her description matching those of other former employees. The allegations piled up even as Mr. Weinstein helped define popular culture. He has collected six best-picture Oscars and turned out a number of touchstones, from the films “Sex, Lies, and Videotape,” “Pulp Fiction” and “Good Will Hunting” to the television show “Project Runway.” In public, he presents himself as a liberal lion, a champion of women and a winner of not just artistic but humanitarian awards. In 2015, the year Ms. O’Connor wrote her memo, his company distributed “The Hunting Ground,” a documentary about campus sexual assault. A longtime Democratic donor, he hosted a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton in his Manhattan home last year. He employed Malia Obama, the oldest daughter of former President Barack Obama, as an intern this year, and recently helped endow a faculty chair at Rutgers University in Gloria Steinem’s name. During the Sundance Film Festival in January, when Park City, Utah, held its version of nationwide women’s marches, Mr. Weinstein joined the parade. “From the outside, it seemed golden — the Oscars, the success, the remarkable cultural impact,” said Mark Gill, former president of Miramax Los Angeles when the company was owned by Disney. “But behind the scenes, it was a mess, and this was the biggest mess of all,” he added, referring to Mr. Weinstein’s treatment of women. Dozens of Mr. Weinstein’s former and current employees, from assistants to top executives, said they knew of inappropriate conduct while they worked for him. Only a handful said they ever confronted him. Mr. Weinstein enforced a code of silence; employees of the Weinstein Company have contracts saying they will not criticize it or its leaders in a way that could harm its “business reputation” or “any employee’s personal reputation,” a recent document shows. And most of the women accepting payouts agreed to confidentiality clauses prohibiting them from speaking about the deals or the events that led to them. Charles Harder, a lawyer representing Mr. Weinstein, said it was not unusual to enter into settlements to avoid lengthy and costly litigation. I am a professional and have tried to be professional. I am not treated that way however. I am sexualized and diminished. At Fox News, where the conservative icons Roger E. Ailes and Bill O’Reilly were accused of harassment, women have received payouts well into the millions of dollars. But most of the women involved in the Weinstein agreements collected between roughly $80,000 and $150,000, according to people familiar with the negotiations. In the wake of Ms. O’Connor’s 2015 memo, some Weinstein Company board members and executives, including Mr. Weinstein’s brother and longtime partner, Bob, 62, were alarmed about the allegations, according to several people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In the end, though, board members were assured there was no need to investigate. After reaching a settlement with Mr. Weinstein, Ms. O’Connor withdrew her complaint and thanked him for the career opportunity he had given her. “The parties made peace very quickly,” Ms. Bloom said. Through her lawyer, Nicole Page, Ms. O’Connor declined to be interviewed. In the memo, she explained how unnerved she was by what she witnessed or encountered while a literary scout and production executive at the company. “I am just starting out in my career, and have been and remain fearful about speaking up,” Ms. O’Connor wrote. In speaking out about her hotel episode, Ms. Ms. Nestor, a law and business school student, accepted Mr. Weinstein’s breakfast invitation at the Peninsula because she did not want to miss an opportunity, she later told colleagues. After she arrived, he offered to help her career while boasting about a series of famous actresses he claimed to have slept with, according to accounts that colleagues compiled after hearing her story and then sent on to company executives. “She said he was very persistent and focused though she kept saying no for over an hour,” one internal document said. Ms. Nestor, who declined to comment for this article, refused his bargain, the records noted. “She was disappointed that he met with her and did not seem to be interested in her résumé or skill set.” The young woman chose not to report the episode to human resources personnel, but the allegations came to management’s attention through other employees. Across the years and continents, accounts of Mr. Weinstein’s conduct share a common narrative: Women reported to a hotel for what they thought were work reasons, only to discover that Mr. Weinstein, who has been married for most of three decades, sometimes seemed to have different interests. His home base was New York, but his rolling headquarters were luxury hotels: the Peninsula Beverly Hills and the Savoy in London, the Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc near the Cannes Film Festival in France and the Stein Eriksen Lodge near the Sundance Film Festival. Working for Mr. Weinstein could mean getting him out of bed in the morning and doing “turndown duty” late at night, preparing him for sleep. Like the colleague cited in Ms. O’Connor’s memo, some junior employees required to perform those tasks said they were disturbing. In interviews, eight women described varying behavior by Mr. Weinstein: appearing nearly or fully naked in front of them, requiring them to be present while he bathed or repeatedly asking for a massage or initiating one himself. The women, typically in their early or middle 20s and hoping to get a toehold in the film industry, said he could switch course quickly — meetings and clipboards one moment, intimate comments the next. One woman advised a peer to wear a parka when summoned for duty as a layer of protection against unwelcome advances. Laura Madden, a former employee who said Mr. Weinstein prodded her for massages at hotels in Dublin and London beginning in 1991, said he had a way of making anyone who objected feel like an outlier. “It was so manipulative,” she said in an interview.                 The New York Times received the following statement from Harvey Weinstein responding to allegations about his treatment of women in Hollywood. “I don’t know anything about that,” Mr. Weinstein said. Most women who told The Times that they experienced misconduct by Mr. Weinstein had never met one another. They range in age from early 20s to late 40s and live in different cities. Some said they did not report the behavior because there were no witnesses and they feared retaliation by Mr. Weinstein. Others said they felt embarrassed. But most confided in co-workers. Ms. Madden later told Karen Katz, a friend and colleague in the acquisitions department, about Mr. Weinstein’s overtures, including a time she locked herself in the bathroom of his hotel room, sobbing. “We were so young at the time,” said Ms. Katz, now a documentary filmmaker.

Others in the London office said the same. “I was pretty disturbed and angry,” said Sallie Hodges, another former employee, recalling the accounts she heard from colleagues. The human resources operation was considered weak in New York and worse in London, so some employees banded together in solidarity. “If a female executive was asked to go to a meeting solo, she and a colleague would generally double up” so as not to be alone with Mr. Weinstein, recalled Mr. Gill, the former president of Miramax Los Angeles. Many women who worked with Mr. Weinstein said they never experienced sexual harassment or knew of anyone who did, and recalled him as a boss who gave them valuable opportunities at young ages. Some described long and satisfying careers with him, praising him as a mentor and advocate. But in interviews, some of the former employees who said they had troubling experiences with Mr. Weinstein asked a common question: How could allegations repeating the same pattern — young women, a powerful male producer, even some of the same hotels — have accumulated for almost three decades? “It wasn’t a secret to the inner circle,” said Kathy DeClesis, Bob Weinstein’s assistant in the early 1990s. She supervised a young woman who left the company abruptly after an encounter with Harvey Weinstein and who later received a settlement, according to several former employees. Speaking up could have been costly. A job with Mr. Weinstein was a privileged perch at the nexus of money, fame and art, and plenty of his former assistants have risen high in Hollywood. He could be charming and generous: gift baskets, flowers, personal or career help and cash. At the Cannes Film Festival, according to several former colleagues, he sometimes handed out thousands of dollars as impromptu bonuses. Mr. Weinstein was a volcanic personality, though, given to fits of rage and personal lashings of male and female employees alike. When a female guest of his had to wait for a hotel room upgrade, he yelled that Ms. O’Connor would be better off marrying a “fat, rich Jewish” man because she was probably just good for “being a wife” and “making babies,” she wrote in her memo. (He added some expletives, she said.) His treatment of women was sometimes written off as just another form of toxicity, according to multiple former employees. In the fall of 1998, a 25-year-old London assistant named Zelda Perkins confronted Mr. Weinstein. According to former colleagues, she and several co-workers had been regularly subjected to inappropriate requests or comments in hotel rooms, and she was particularly concerned about the treatment of another woman in the office. She told Mr. Weinstein that he had to stop, according to the former colleagues, and that she would go public or initiate legal action unless he changed his behavior. Steve Hutensky, one of Miramax’s entertainment lawyers, was dispatched to London to negotiate a settlement with Ms. Perkins and her lawyer. He declined to comment for this article. Ms. Perkins, now a theater producer in London, also declined to comment for this article, saying that she could not discuss her work at Miramax or whether she had entered into any agreements. Months after the settlement, Mr. Weinstein triumphed at the Oscars, with “Life Is Beautiful” and “Shakespeare in Love” winning 10 awards. A few years later, Mr. Weinstein, who had produced a series of British-themed movies, was made a Commander of the British Empire, an honorary title just short of knighthood. For actors, a meeting with Mr. Weinstein could yield dazzling rewards: scripts, parts, award campaigns, magazine coverage, influence on lucrative endorsement deals. He knew how to blast small films to box office success, and deliver polished dramas like “The King’s Speech” and popular attractions like the “Scary Movie” franchise. But movies were also his private leverage. When Mr. Weinstein invited Ms. Judd to breakfast in Beverly Hills, she had been shooting the thriller “Kiss the Girls” all night, but the meeting seemed too important to miss. After arriving at the hotel lobby, she was surprised to learn that they would be talking in his suite; she decided to order cereal, she said, so the food would come quickly and she could leave. Mr. Weinstein soon issued invitation after invitation, she said. Could he give her a massage? When she refused, he suggested a shoulder rub. She rejected that too, she recalled. He steered her toward a closet, asking her to help pick out his clothing for the day, and then toward the bathroom. Would she watch him take a shower? she remembered him saying. “I said no, a lot of ways, a lot of times, and he always came back at me with some new ask,” Ms. Judd said. To get out of the room, she said, she quipped that if Mr. Weinstein wanted to touch her, she would first have to win an Oscar in one of his movies. She recalled feeling “panicky, trapped,” she said in the interview. Not long afterward, she related what had happened to her mother, the singer Naomi Judd, who confirmed their conversation to a Times reporter. Years later, Ashley Judd appeared in two Weinstein films without incident, she said. In 2015, she shared an account of the episode in the hotel room with “Variety” without naming the man involved. In 1997, Mr. Weinstein reached a previously undisclosed settlement with Rose McGowan, then a 23-year-old-actress, after an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival. The $100,000 settlement was “not to be construed as an admission” by Mr. Weinstein, but intended to “avoid litigation and buy peace,” according to the legal document, which was reviewed by The Times. Ms. McGowan had just appeared in the slasher film “Scream” and would later star in the television show “Charmed.” She declined to comment.             Got a confidential news tip?             The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists. Just months before Ms. O’Connor wrote her memo, a young female employee quit after complaining of being forced to arrange what she believed to be assignations for Mr. Weinstein, according to two people familiar with her departure. The woman, who asked not to be identified to protect her privacy, said a nondisclosure agreement prevented her from commenting. Soon, complaints about Mr. Weinstein’s behavior prompted the board of his company to take notice. In March 2015, Mr. Weinstein had invited Ambra Battilana, an Italian model and aspiring actress, to his TriBeCa office on a Friday evening to discuss her career. Within hours, she called the police. Ms. Battilana told them that Mr. Weinstein had grabbed her breasts after asking if they were real and put his hands up her skirt, the police report says. The claims were taken up by the New York Police Department’s Special Victims Squad and splashed across the pages of tabloids, along with reports that the woman had worked with investigators to secretly record a confession from Mr. Weinstein. The Manhattan district attorney’s office later declined to bring charges. But Mr. Weinstein made a payment to Ms. Battilana, according to people familiar with the settlement, speaking on the condition of anonymity about the confidential agreement. The public nature of the episode concerned some executives and board members of the Weinstein Company. (Harvey and Bob Weinstein together own 42 percent of the privately held business.) When several board members pressed Mr. Weinstein about it, he insisted that the woman had set him up, colleagues recalled. Ms. Battilana had testified in court proceedings against associates of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy who are accused of procuring women for alleged sex parties, and the Italian news media also reported that, years ago, Ms. Battilana accused a septuagenarian boyfriend of sexual harassment, a complaint that was apparently dismissed. Ms. Battilana did not respond to requests for comment. Her lawyer, Mauro Rufini, could not be reached for comment. After the episode, Lance Maerov, a board member, said he successfully pushed for a code of behavior for the company that included detailed language about sexual harassment. Then Ms. O’Connor’s memo hit, with page after page of detailed accusations. She was a valued employee — Mr. Weinstein described her as “fantastic,” “a great person,” “a brilliant executive” — so the complaint rattled top executives, including Bob Weinstein. When the board was notified of it by email, Mr. Maerov insisted that an outside lawyer determine whether the allegations were true, he said in an interview. But the inquiry never happened. Mr. Weinstein had reached a settlement with Ms. O’Connor, and there was no longer anything to investigate. “Because this matter has been resolved and no further action is required, I withdraw my complaint,” Ms. O’Connor wrote in an email to the head of human resources six days after sending her memo. She also wrote a letter to Mr. Weinstein thanking him for the opportunity to learn about the entertainment industry. Rachel Abrams and William K. Rashbaum contributed reporting. Grace Ashford contributed research.

It is the main component ofplant cell walls, and the basic building block for many textiles and for paper. Cotton is the purest natural form of cellulose. In the laboratory, ashless filter paper is a source of nearly pure cellulose. Cellulose is a natural polymer, a long chain made by the linking of smaller molecules. The links in the cellulose chain are a type of sugar: ß-D-glucose. Two unlinked molecules of ß-D-glucose are pictured at right . The sugar units are linked when water is eliminated by combining the -OH group and H highlighted in gray. Linking just two of these sugars produces a disaccharide called cellobiose . Cellulose is a polysaccharide produced by linking additional sugars in exactly the same way. The length of the chain varies greatly, from a few hundred sugar units in wood pulp to over 6000 for cotton.The cellulose chain bristles with polar -OH groups. These groups form many hydrogen bonds with OH groups on adjacent chains, bundling the chains together. The chains also pack regularly in places to form hard, stable crystalline regions that give the bundledchains even more stability and strength. Cellulose is a major component of wood. Cellulose fibers in wood are bound in lignin, a complex polymer. Paper-making involves treating wood pulp with alkalisor bisulfites to disintegrate the lignin, and then pressing the pulp to matte the cellulose fibers together. Cellulose is found in large amounts in nearly all plants, and is potentially a major food source. Unfortunately, human beings lack the enzymes necessary to cleave the linkages between the sugars in cellulose. In fact, crystallite cellulose is added to some foods to reduce the caloric value. NotesGlucose is a six-carbon sugar that comes in two forms with different optical activity. The ß form, pictured above, has the hydroxide group on carbon 1 on the same face of the ring as the -CH2OH group. The  form has the same hydroxide group on the opposite face from the -CH2OH group. Sucrose, or table sugar, is the most familiar disaccaride, made by linking the sugars glucose and fructose in a different way. References and bibliographyC.

About 15 viewers called in to complain following the transmission on Thursday night, while 50 others had already contacted Channel 4 to register their disgust before it was even aired. Conservative MP Ann Widdecombe was one of those who had condemned the Beijing Swings documentary, which featured extreme art  in China, as ""hideous"" before it was shown. An estimated 900,000 tuned in to see the documentary, which went out at 2300 GMT on Thursday. It was beaten in the ratings by the 1997 movie Beverly Hills Cop II, which attracted 3.4 million viewers. Beijing Swings featured footage of a man drinking wine that had an amputated penis added to it, as part of an investigation into extreme practices in China. Cannibalism. The documentary also included stills of artist Zhu Yu biting into the body of a stillborn baby. A Channel 4 spokesman said that while it takes all comments and complaints seriously, it stands by its decision to broadcast the programme. The artist,  Zhu Yu, was quoted as saying: ""No religion forbids cannibalism. ""Nor can I find any law which prevents us from eating people. I took advantage of the space between morality and the law and based my work on it."" Mr Yu, who is a Christian, claims religion plays a major role in his work. But before seeing the show, Ms Widdecombe said: ""This programme sounds hideous."" The documentary's presenter, Sunday Times art critic Waldemar Januszczak, defended the documentary on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'Deluded'. While he did not defend Mr Yu's practice, he said: ""It is worth trying to understand why China is producing the most outrageous, the darkest art, of anywhere in the world."" The Chinese embassy in London also reportedly also condemned the programme. Mr Yu's performance show, Eating People, was originally shown in 2000. It has been shown at the Third Shanghai Biennale in China. Mr Yu's work is part of a wave of extreme art that has swept contemporary Chinese artistic circles. The ministry of culture cracked down on what it termed ""shock art"" after the country was announced as the host to hold the 2008 Olympics.

https://www.snopes.com/hurricane-irma-hitting-miami-airport/	Hurricane Irma Floods Miami International Airport?	false	['dan scavino', ' hurricane irma', ' mexico', ' miami', ' tropical storm lidia', ' trump administration']	http://www.miamiherald.com/	http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article172268857.html	2017/09/11	September 09, 2017 01:58 PMSAINT-LOUIS-DU-NORD, HaitiThe morning after Hurricane Irma skirted Haiti’s northern coast , Artis Esperance walked his farm land and tried to salvage what the menacing Category 5 storm — and thieves — hadn’t already claimed.For the second time in 11 months , Mother Nature had dealt a crippling blow to Haiti. Last year, it was the slow-moving and powerful Hurricane Matthew, which made landfall on Haiti’s southern tip. It wiped out farms and livestock in the southwest and Grand’Anse and here in the northwest with its 145-mph winds and heavy rains.Now, a record-breaking Irma, en route to the Turks and Caicos and Bahamas before turning toward Florida, had blown away what little produce he and other farmers in the region had managed to grow.“This storm didn’t even leave one tree with food on it for us to eat,” said an exasperated Esperance, 41, holding a rusty machete in one hand and an overripe breadfruit in the other, not far from one of his farms. “This has taken food out of the mouths of my children.”Never miss a local story.Sign up today for a free 30 day free trial of unlimited digital access.SUBSCRIBE NOWThough Haiti was spared a direct hit from Irma and the fallout is nowhere near the magnitude of Matthew’s 546 dead and $2.8 billion in washed-out roads, collapsed bridges and destroyed crops, the frustration and fears for some in its path are no less.“We didn’t have people who died, but homes and farms were destroyed,” Esperance said. “Just because you don’t see a lot of damages, it doesn’t mean that we haven’t been left deeper in misery.”The northwest, which was already one of the poorest regions of the poverty-stricken country along with the northeast, was overlooked after Matthew, with attention focused more on the harder-hit Grand’Anse and southwest regions. Northwest farmers, left to fend for themselves, struggled to rebuild, replanting banana, avocado and yam crops to make ends meet.Then came the worst storm ever recorded in the Atlantic. Irma flooded northern villages from as far west as Môle-Saint-Nicolas to as far east as Ounaminthe on the Haiti-Dominican Republic border. In between, it ripped off roofs, damaged roads and cut off connections between major cities and farming communities.“If this hurricane had come with a lot of rain, a good amount of people here would be dead,” said Neckson Joseph, 21, a motorcycle taxi driver. “There wasn’t a lot of rain, but there was this strong wind. We had this kitchen outside, covered with aluminum. It didn’t even leave a beam standing.”Joseph was among scores of storm survivors standing near the banks of a swollen Rivière des Barres in Saint-Louis-du-Nord, a coastal village east of Port-de-Paix, the capital of the northwest. The rising river connects the northwest to the north. Seven communities in the northeast still remained flooded days after Irma’s passage.Joseph said Irma had felled banana trees, thrown breadfruit and avocados to the ground and swallowed homes along the coast. It also left the coastal villages of Anse-à-Foleur and Côte-de-Fer, and Borgne in the mountains, inundated and cut off from Saint-Louis-du-Nord and Port-de-Paix. The storm also washed out the parts of the road that leads to Jean-Rabel and Môle-Saint-Nicolas in the far west.“If you really want to see what this storm did, just go walk through the rural outskirts,” Joseph said pointing to the rural inlands on the other side of the Rivière des Barres.But much closer than that, just west of the Riviere des Barres in Trois Rivières at the entrance of Port-de-Paix, entire banana fields lay in ruin, barely matured plantains strewn on the ground.“We don’t have any farm,” Camelia Ambroz, 70, said as she and her husband, Charite Almeus, 78, tried to salvage what they could as they walked through soggy, fallen banana branches. “It took everything.”The couple, who work the land for someone else, said the crops were new, planted shortly after Matthew destroyed the last crop, and had only needed two more months to mature.Related stories from  Miami HeraldPhoto gallery: Hurricane Irma in Haiti | Sat., Sept. 9, 2017“When you’re poor and you don’t have anything,” Almeus said, “this is what allows you to live. But what can you do? It’s God’s work and you have to accept it.”Fritz Jean, an economist who was appointed as prime minister last year but forced to step down after parliament refused to ratify his governance plan for the country, said the vicious cycle of disaster upon disaster in Haiti is making Haitians poorer — and not just farmers.In the case of farmers, it is leading to “uncertainty in regard to the agricultural production cycle,” he said. “The peasant knows less and less when to sow [and] less and less land becomes available.”On Friday, when Irma’s red alert — Haiti’s highest level of threat — was finally lifted and a contingent of U.N. Brazilian peacekeepers, making the 200-mile trek from Port-au-Prince, rolled into the northwest, the non-profit group Action Against Hunger warned that a fair amount of the population living in the five regions affected by Irma will feel the impact.The damages will be extremely difficult for vulnerable, small-scaled farmers in the northwest, the group said.“These small-scale farmers have no other source of income. If they lose their primary and only source of income, they are left with nothing,” said Mathieu Nabot, Action Against Hunger’s country director. “They have no backup. That is the reason why the impact is strong in the northwest.”Nabot said that although Irma’s effects are “less dramatic and less visual” than Matthew — which left entire farms under water and coconut trees bent over in the southwest and Grand’Anse — the storm will make life even more difficult. People in the northwest, whether they’re farmers or urban dwellers, are extra vulnerable because of a lack of infrastructure, basic services and economic opportunities in the area.“Irma is coming after Matthew and Matthew has had a real impact on the ability of people to meet their basic needs in its immediate aftermath,” Nabot said. “They are not yet out of this crisis phase.”Earlier this week, Haitian Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant announced that he had formed a commission to assess Irma’s full impact. The assessment is scheduled to roll out Saturday. The government also tapped Action Against Hunger to coordinate the humanitarian response in collaboration with it and other partners.Charite Louis, an agronomist who works for Haiti’s food security unit, said he suspects at least 30,000 people will be in need of rapid assistance.“While it didn’t have the intensity they anticipated, the agriculture sector was hit and the people in that sector are most impacted,” he said. “Some are looking at a total loss... People’s economic means, already fragile, will take a huge hit.”Long before Matthew left more than 800,000 Haitians in need of emergency food assistance and the El Niño drought phenomenon plunged Haiti into its worst food insecurity crisis in 15 years , the northwest suffered from long dry spells that led to growing food insecurity and deeper poverty despite its potential for fishing and agriculture.As recently as February, the food insecurity unit classified the northwest as being in an economic and food security crisis. As a result, Nabot said, the focus has to be not just on the emergency response but on supporting farmers over the long term, to help strengthen their economic security and ability to cope with shocks.“Whatever the crisis, whatever the shock, whatever the [strength] of the hurricane, it will have an impact,” Nabot said. “If not a major or visual one like St. Maarten, it will have an impact on their economic security, that’s for sure.”

Not CNN, not MSNBC, and not even Fox News has covered this story in depth—it’s high time that this go viral, so that the people of America know what’s happening right under our noses.2A News , a popular second amendment rights news outlet, reports:“On Wednesday, Oregon Governor Kate Brown signed into law a democrat-sponsored gun confiscation bill, permitting Oregon judges to order guns to be confiscated under an “Extreme Risk Protection Order”, based on hearsay evidence, and before the gun owner is permitted a hearing to challenge the order.The law is based on Oregon  Senate Bill 719  and was passed by Oregon democrats despite widespread condemnation by constitutional scholars and gun rights groups. All but 4 democratic senators voted in favor of the bill, while every republican senator but one voted against the bill.The sole “token” republican voting for the bill, Sen. Brian Boquist (R-Dallas, Oregon), claimed the law would “reduce veteran suicides”, and it was under that noble-sounding purpose that Democrat legislators steamrolled the bill through the legislative process.Paul Phillips, President of Oregon Gun Owners, noted the hypocrisy and the underlying purpose of the bill. The bill, he says, will do little to prevent ‘suicides’.What it will actually do, under the guise of ‘suicide prevention’, is deprive Oregon gun owners of their legal rights under the second amendment. Gun confiscations, he says, will be “based on hearsay evidence alone, and the firearm owner is not [even] privy to a fair trial.”„advertisement - story continues belowThis is how these bloody democrats always put freedom destroying laws into place. They appeal to our feelings, and lie to us, making us think that the law will prevent some sort of damage or evil from being done—when in reality, it’s only infringing upon our rights.Many have already contacted Governor Kate Brown here , to give her a piece of their mind. We, the people of America, must STAND UP against this tyranny! Millions of men shed blood to give us the rights that we have, and we must NOT let their sacrifices go in vain.advertisement - story continues belowI am calling upon every single American man, woman, and child, to help this article go viral. Every single person in this great country should know about what’s going on right underneath our noses, at this very moment. It’s time for the people to wake up, and snap out of our complacency.

https://www.snopes.com/jared-kushner-go-saudi-arabia-doesnt-extradition-treaty-us/	Did Jared Kushner Go to Saudi Arabia Because it Doesn’t Have an Extradition Treaty With the US?	false	['jared kushner', ' mueller', ' palmer report', ' russia investigation']	https://archive.fo/	https://archive.fo/f26gK	2017/10/31	Linkedin Google Whatsapp Pinterest Reddit Stumbleupon Buffer Tumblr Pocket Line-When Robert Mueller begins slapping handcuffs on the first batch of Donald Trump’s co-conspirators tomorrow, will Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner be among them? No one seems to know for sure. Suffice it to say, however, that Kushner is suddenly acting more than a bit suspiciously. In fact, Kushner just boarded a commercial jet and secretly left the country – and Trump’s White House is refusing to answer any questions about what’s going on.Kushner flew to Saudi Arabia, in what was clearly supposed to be a secret trip, as the White House refuses to say why he went there or what he did once he got there. He supposedly returned to the United States on Saturday night, according to a Politico report ( link ) – but considering the suspicious circumstances, that too could be a cover story; there’s no known proof that he actually did return to the U.S. There are scattered reports that Kushner may have had dinner with Ivanka Trump in Washington on DC on Saturday night, which we’re still working to track down.This raises a number of questions. Kushner was accompanied by a deputy national security adviser, so this doesn’t appear to have been some harebrained attempt at fleeing the country. That would have been a phenomenally stupid idea anyway. Although Saudi Arabia does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, it’s far too close of an ally to want to provide such controversial refuge. But this may have been a (perhaps mis-timed) attempt at conveniently being out of the country as Robert Mueller begins making arrests.In any case, Donald Trump’s White House’s refusal to answer any questions about Jared Kushner’s trip makes it all the more suspicious. If this were a legitimate diplomatic mission, it would be easy for the White House to provide a plausible explanation for the trip. Instead the obfuscation strongly suggests that Kushner staged the trip as some kind of bizarre response to the impending arrests.Help fund Palmer Report:Thanks for reading Palmer Report.

The 80-year-old also says she believes that President Trump might be forgetting to take his pills.I dont recognize the Donnie whos in the White House right now, added Judge Trump Barry, who friends describe as very loyal to her younger brother.Donnie was never a smart boy, no matter what he tells you. In fact, the neighborhood kids used to call him Donnie Dimwit. But recently he seems to be operating at an even lower IQ, and thats not good for the country.Asked what she thought might be behind Trumps recent mental decline, the judge answered thoughtfully: Look, its a tough job, made even tougher by the fact that Donnie is always trying to prove his value, competence, and strength. He acts like a hooligan, but its a cover-up  hes really insecure and very tender underneath that stern facade. Frankly, I always thought he was gay. Donnie used to run around in mothers dressing gowns, always wanted to take a bubble bath, and he had more talent for interior design than construction. When Daddy finished a residential building project, it was always little Donnie who insisted on choosing the drapes. My point is, I dont think the daily demands of the presidency align with his softer sensibilities...and now hes cracking under the pressure.She was also asked what she thought of her brothers performance as president one year into his term.I generally dont like it when witnesses come into my courtroom and plead the Fifth. But in this case, with that question, I am compelled to do so.

The Hillary supporters main subject was about how Hillary “Tells The Truth”. I was trying to explain to her how Hillary lies over and over. She then turned the subject into saying “So does everyone even Bernie”After about an hour of asking her to show any REAL proof of Bernie lying she gave up and said “Look it up your self” and “I don’t have time for you”. (These statements come after 2 hours of conversation).My last comment was going to be, “Clearly you can’t post any proof nor can I because he never lies”.But when I hit enter I got this popup. I though it was just a glitch, so I refreshed the page but same thing happened??? I clicked the link and was sent to a Facebook appeal form. I filled it out saying “I have done nothing wrong” A few hours went by and I got an email titled “Your Facebook appeal PLEASE READ”It was not from abuse@facebook.com or any of the Facebook email addresses so I first thought spam, then I was like how can anyone know I’m blocked from posting anything on Facebook besides me?The email was a guy saying he works for Facebook and to contact him via Skype. This was extremely weird, but I was curious to see where this was going.I added him on Skype. He accepted me right away and said “I’m going to tell you something you may or may not believe. All I ask is you do not share my email or Skype.I replied back “Ok but why not just contact me via a fake email and Skype then?”He said “They are fake but I still feel I could be traced”I said “Fair enough, but what is this all about?”He said “I work for Facebook, and I’m reaching out to people who have been blocked on Facebook after posting keywords like #FeelTheBern” At this point I’m kinda freaking out………  How does anyone know I have been blocked from posting? They also have my personal email and know about me posting #FeelTheBern. He then began to explain to me Facebook is actively and automatically blocking millions of accounts with a algorithm that detects people who post keywords like #FeelTheBurn. I for example was banned from posting anything for 30 days due to the fact I posted #FeelTheBernHe also said Quote: “In a staff briefing everyone was told to deny any appeal that happened due to posting political opinions”(As he laughed and said these members are banned due to spamming give them time to calm down). I asked him why not go public with a widely viewed TV network or huge websites like HuffingtonPost?He said: I have emailed a few local news TV stations plus all the big well known websites and 100’s of Facebook users, yet I haven’t seen this story get viral.I told him most likely the reason huge websites or news stations won’t talk about it is because they are scared to post something without having a face to back it up with.But I understand why he is scared to come out.He can be sued for breach of contractHe will lose his good paying jobHe would never be hired after leaking company information I promised I would do my best to get this information out to the world. This is insane! I knew the corrupt corporations ran the media but I never thought it would get down to blocking people from Facebook.What can you do?Share this post on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc.Contact HuffingtonPost asking them to reply to the emails sent.Contact Woodland Hills, CA. News station ABC7 to reply to the emails sent.  We can not let this subject get swept under the rug. This is a 1000 times worse then corrupt corporations running Fox News. This is like YouTube or Google removing any blog or video that says anything good about Bernie.

I had sex with him when he was 14 years old. The baby came out fine. Just to let you know, I also have three (3) daughters who are thirteen (13), fourteen (14), and sixteen (16).My son is a great dad and also a great boyfriend to me. This all started when I realized that I started to get feelings for him I decided to have a one and one talk with him. I told him “mommy loves you more than what it means to just be a mommy to you”. I also told him that “mommy likes you just like how a girl from school likes you.I explained everything to him and got him to understand and he felt the same way as I did as he began to ask questions. He asked “so does that mean that we can kiss and hold hands like boyfriend and girlfriend?” I told him yes and even sex.Long story short, he asked me if we can have a baby and I agreed and so we did. I love him and know that he is the best man for me.so is this an awful April Fools Joke?

Rather than face the backlash and vindictive response from the Trump administration to his requests to play ball, Schumer will resign, deny all of the allegations and spend the next 7 1/2 years under investigation by Trey Gowdy.This was a great move by Trump. Not only does he get rid of a huge political opponent, he shows America that our elected officials can be compromised and forced to do as they’re told. No more of this pussyfooting around with majority votes and filibusters…either get in line of get out.

In fact, there is a reason. $500,000 of them in fact.Transparency website Glass Tabletop revealed Saturday that just before the Friday evening vote, Schumer received three separate campaign donation from Immigration for Everyone, the Council for Alien Rights, and the Southern Border Defense Fund — three groups that regularly push for complete amnesty for all illegals.Thanks to this donation and his hatred of President Trump, Schumer was more than willing to encourage his fellow Democrats to vote against keeping the government open. 90% of them listened. Only five Democrats summoned enough patriotism to vote FOR America.2018 is our chance to reaffirm that we want Donald Trump’s America — that we want freedom and democracy and rule of law. It’s time for us to not be willing to settle for a majority. We must completely take Congress from the hands of the Democrat Party.AMERICA FIRST!

They do think so. That was in situations when I had seen some stupid ones. It's an epidemic and it is created. They can't think and they can't figure out any truths. They are also so controlled by their parents.I also think alot of that control is in our schools.jay • 3 weeks agothe devices which are hurting us are the ones we hold near our bodies. I see no proof in the research I've looked at that cell towers are doing damage.https://www.google.fr/url?s...they're using doses of 30 mw/cm2. A 500 watt (legal maximum) cell tower at 100 meters from your body is dealing you .4 micro (not milli) watts. This dose is 75,000 times smaller than what they gave the rats. At 1 km, it's reduced again by a factor of 100, 7.5 million times less than what they do to these rats.your telephone when far from the tower will broadcast at 2 watts maximum (europe).If it's noisy near you, you'll be holding it right against your head, but let's say it's at 1cm from your ear and 3 cm from your brain (biologists help out there?), That means 17 mw/cm2, or nearly the dose given the rats who were clearly damaged by it.So unless you live right next to a cell tower, there's no comparison between what it does to you and what you do to yourself when you use your own cell phone.That headphone they give you with your cell phone really can save you some headaches.a 1m usb cable for a wifi device with your laptop computer will increase the distance between your gonads and the radio source from 10 cm to 1 meter. This will reduce your exposure by 99%. 1 mw will make a good connection in most rooms, but your internet supplier probably sent you a device which you can't control and is probably at least at 100 mw.All of the wifi equipment has the capability of reducing the output power, but most products won't give you access to that. If you buy something compatible with the open-source wifi projects like tomato and dd-wrt, you can take the control back from these lame vendors who deny you access to the very product they are selling you.Some wifi cards built in to laptops can be reduced, some can't. They give relative power outputs but not many give the absolute power. You can usually turn it down to where the connection works poorly and then bring it back up a bit, but it's more effective to use a network cable or at least a usb wifi and an extension cable to get it away from your body.Alex Bock • 3 weeks agoThey are unnatural frequencies big or small. They do mess up our natural circadian rhythm and alter hormonal secretions. Melatonine is basically stopped when we have EMR coming from wifi or any pulsed waved magnetic signals i.e. bluetooth . Just because they fry rats with these things doesn't mean they aren't doing damage to us. If you watch the trailer of the new documentary ""generation zapped"" you will hear how we are being radiated millions of times over from just decades ago. Do you ever look outside and see the HAARP clouds? They're basically spraying the air everyday and much of these clouds take on altered shapes. These cell phones towers are orchestrating those events. Look into 5g and how basically all the signals will share signals with each other to overlap our countries. You're grossly underestimating the power of these devices. Wifi routers are problematic enough and to equate cell phone towers as ""safe"" is lunacy.insightz • 3 weeks agoDid I just say seven and a half meters? A cell tower's actual ""security"" distance could be as little as two meters:No wonder people are getting cancer left and right or going insane.jay • 2 weeks agohave you seen any studies comparing microwaves at these low powers and a.m. radio at 50,000 watts? or fm?insightz • 3 weeks ago> A 500 watt (legal maximum) cell tower at 100 meters from your body is dealing> you .4 micro (not milli) watts. This dose is 75,000 times smaller than what they> gave the rats.As much as I would like to agree with you, the argument about the perceived safety of cell towers doesn't check out with reality. Show me someone who lives within the reach of just one cell tower. Since you referenced Europe, here it comes: the ""security distance"" to a cell tower in Germany can be as little as 7 and a half meters in the main direction:http://emf2.bundesnetzagent...If you live in a city, several of these monsters will be right over your head, sending 500 Watt each through your brain day and night. When you zoom into the above map within any major German city you will find not one but several cell towers within the 1km perimeter that you referenced. I am attaching an image from the official database of the German Ministry of networking Bundesnetzagentur for Hamburg (the main central station at Hachmannplatz 16, 20099 Hamburg).https://uploads.disquscdn.c...Even if you were to live on a boat in the middle of that lake on the map, you still couldn't get away from the compounded effect of the EMFs. They don't just magically stop their emissions at the 1km mark. You get them all.This isn't even taking account of the ""smart"" grid's ""smart"" meters with their EMFs, dozens of which will be soon installed in each house across Europe (no opt-outs allowed, as we know Europe). Nor does it account for your neighbors' wireless routers that can rob you of your sleep and sanity.It's not only about the Wattage, it's also about the FREQUENCY. Any source of EMFs is introducing damaging noise that disrupts our sensitive signalling in DNA replication, not to mention thinking. If a cell phone can catch a Bluetooth signal from another floor, how much more sensitive are our brains. Our brains run on far weaker electric signalling; any noise will disrupt that.So no, you are wrong on the exposure levels. Wishful thinking.jay • 2 weeks agoanother problem with your reasoning is that the cell towers in the city would necessarily be way under the maximum, if not, they would be tripping over their own feet. More cell towers means less max power, but perhaps more average power that you receive on your body, but it's still thousands of times less than you're getting from your own cell phone.That's why I don't have a cell phone. Do you use one?jay • 2 weeks agoYou call it wishful thinking. I call it the inverse square law. For you the inverse square law would seem to be some strange fictional beast. If you were right and I were wrong then we'd all be having houses with no electrical wires as wireless electricity would be perfected with zero power loss and what's more, with your reasoning, one wireless power supply could give full power to an infinite number of devices thus ending any energy shortages on earth with one < 100 dollar device.Tula Turan • 3 weeks agoYou OMIT to mention that this ""gender fluid""/LGBTQ brainwashing is first received in kindergarten and then in schools. THAT is where the damage is embedded into the childrens minds...IE via ""Education"", and the State CONSENTS to it.Govinda-Terryl • 3 weeks agoSick fantasies of the ego.

https://www.snopes.com/refugee-tb-rates-in-san-diego/	Are Refugee Tuberculosis Rates in San Diego ‘More Than 100 Times Greater’ Than the National Average?	false	['breitbart', ' el cajon', ' san diego', ' starbucks', ' tuberculosis', ' university of california-san diego']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/ILsJU	2017/08/17	SIGN UP FOR THE BREITBART EMAIL NEWSLETTERSIGN ME UPStarbucks Holds Hiring Event for Refugees in San Diego, TB Rates Among Highest in CountryAPby Michael Patrick Leahy 8 Aug 2017 47268 Aug, 20178 Aug, 2017Starbucks held a hiring event exclusively for refugees in El Cajon, California on Tuesday, part of its recently announced commitment to hire more than 10,000 refugees over the next five years.El Cajon is located in San Diego County, where more than 20,000 refugees have have been resettled by the federal government in the past nine and a half years since the beginning of Fiscal Year 2008.A 2013 study from a research team led by Dr. Timothy Rodwell , “an associate professor and physician in the Division of Global Health at UCSD [University of California at San Diego]” that “analyzed data from LTBI [latent tuberculosis infection] screening results of 4,280 refugees resettled in San Diego County between January 2010 and October 2012,” noted that “San Diego County, in California, is a leading refugee resettlement site, and it also has one of the highest rates of active TB in the country, with an incidence rate of 8.4 cases per 100 000 people in 2011.” (The incidence rate in the entire population in the United States in 2016 was 2.9 per 100,000 ).The study, which was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health, found  that, of the 4,280 refugees resettled in San Diego County during the 34 months beginning in January 2010:Nine hundred sixteen refugees (21.4%) in the study had a positive QFT-GIT result (Table 1). Of those, 823 (89.8%) had a normal chest radiograph and were diagnosed with LTBI (Figure 1). Sixty-one (6.7%) did not receive a chest radiograph; 14 (1.5%) had an abnormal result that was consistent with active TB; and 18 (2.0%) had an abnormal result that was not consistent with active TB.In other words, the incidence of active TB among the 4,280 refugees who were resettled in San Diego County between January 2010 and October 2012 was 327 per 100,000, more than 100 times greater than the incidence of active TB among the entire population of the United States in 2016.About four percent of the entire population of the United States tests positive for latent TB infection. Around 10 percent of those with LTBI will develop active TB at some point in their lives. The triggering mechanism to activate latent TB is not entirely understood, but high levels of stress, crowded living situations, poor public health practices, the presence of other diseases that lower the immune system, and behavioral conduct–such as smoking–appear to increase the chances of activation.The 21.4 percent of refugees in the San Diego County study who tested positive for latent TB infection is about five times the national average.Breitbart News contacted Starbucks to learn if their refugee hiring process will include mandatory testing for latent and active TB, but has not received a response.The Starbucks refugee hiring event will be held at the San Diego offices of the International Rescue Committee, one of the top nine voluntary agencies (VOLAGS) that are paid over $1 billion each year to resettle refugees in the United States.KGTV  reported :About 30 Starbucks managers will conduct on-the-spot interviews at the International Rescue Committee’s office located at 131 E. Main Street in El Cajon from 11 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 8. Applicants are encouraged to visit Starbucks online career center prior to the event and bring resumes along with them. The store managers will talk to the refugee applicants about what it’s like to work for Starbucks and review qualifications for the barista position.The world’s largest coffee chain said it would focus initial efforts on markets where refugee need is greatest and there’s a store base to meet the need.According to state and federal data, San Diego fits the bill.No other California county has received more refugees during the past decade than San Diego county.In 2016, San Diego settled 3,100 refugees, along with 520 military interpreters on special immigrant visas.California, like most states, requires TB testing for health care workers . Employees of restaurants are not required by California law to be tested for TB prior to hiring.Read More Stories About:P.S.

https://www.snopes.com/run-over-trump-protesters/	Did a Car Run Over Trump Protesters on a Highway?	mfalse	['brazil', ' protests', ' trump administration']	https://archive.is/	https://archive.is/SS2cL	2017/05/02	  You can see protesters in this undated and unknown video (posted by the Facebook group “ Trump Supporters ”) blocking a highway. It looks like a protest in Brazil. It’s unknown what they’re protesting, but one can take a good guess. You can see what looks like a black flag waving.At some point, one frustrated driver approaches the crowd, who descends on the car, seeming to try to push it away.The driver then backs up for a second and floors it … running over several protesters in the process. At least one of them lies motionless on the highway.We may learn more about this video soon but one thing is for sure.Things are getting out of control.Ads by Revcontent

https://www.snopes.com/chester-bennington-and-chris-cornell-murdered/	Were Chester Bennington and Chris Cornell Murdered to Cover Up a Pedophile Ring?	false	['chester bennington', ' chris cornell', ' conspiracy theories', ' pizzagate']	http://yournewswire.com/	http://yournewswire.com/chester-bennington-murdered/	2017/07/21	Dude, I don’t care what side you’re on, that pic is fucking hilarious.Wolf HunterPs, when you get to Hell I hope Lucifer stops picking on Hitler and shoves pineapples up your ass, backwards!And then fucks you in the face.Wolf HunterPss,  Christian is his name you moronic jizz biscuit. It’s like me saying that your linked to all the diseased, festering, scabed over cocks in the world because your real name is COCK WOLF! So suck a gitchy and choke on it’s flem.Peace out cock breath.tankritWell that’s clearly not how police investigations work, and considering it’s already been ruled a suicide, I’m don’t think I’m jumping the gun when a fake news website posts an unsourced  claim that police opened a murder investigation, great try though maybe you’ll sound smart next time.Wigginhttp://heavy.com/news/2017/07/chester-bennington-murdered-murder-hoax-internet-your-news-wire/Sam YoungSuicides can be set up. It’s not fake news or even a stretch of the imagination that police investigate suicide as murder? Grow up or at least shut the fuck up you are part of the problemBob PapadazzioNo, it’s not that big of a stretch to think police can investigate suicide as murder… but it IS a stretch AND fake news to say that’s what’s happening here, as there is no investigation.tankritCould you please show your work on how you figured I’m part of the problem with people killing themselves by pointing out that a junk website made up the claim that police opened a murder investigation into someones death? And don’t worry, “I’m not so good at thinking” is a totally acceptable answer.Sam YoungYou are part of the problem because you want to cast aside anything that points to the satanic cults which run the world and spread evil. Just think for 5 seconds what if he was actually killed and then was set up as suicide. Then have all media shout out he killed himself before anyone can be told the truth….. I’m actually quite good at thinking. You on the other hand have a closed mind which cannot be expected to think critically. “Fake news” was a term invented so that all points of referenence in the internet however true they may be can be thrown in the junk pile and ignored. I’m sorry to say you lack the basic ability to think bigger than the small world you are spoon fedtankritI mean, I am part of the satanic cult that runs the world, but we only sacrifice babies not grown adults, geeze man.Sam YoungWhy are you reading and commenting on fake news?Clare OechsleAbsolutely agree, and I believe there may be some truth to this story, after all, how many careers would it wreck and how much money they would all lose if they were exposed? sad, sad, sad, alllll around,,,horrific,,,,KeyranStill does not mean every one that dies is fucking murdered …why don’t any of you fuck wits ask Milo the names of the people he watched molesting “very young” boys at the LA party ?He said he had been to loads of parties like that … he also said “very young” which differs from what he said was “OK” as in 12-13 year olds …ASK HIM … GO ONDMEno one says everyone who dies is murdered. you are literally the only person who said that.Sam YoungWtf are you even talking about?Daniel Richardsno one said there weren’t pedophiles dumb shit, the FAKE NEWS is the fucking retarded tin fool hat CONSPIRACY THEORY that they where murdered by the pedophiles, instead of just accepting the FACTS that these guys where DEPRESSED and KILLED THEMSELVES, take off your tin foil hat retardSam YoungThey could have been killed by illuminati you have no way to prove one way or the other. Go research more man for fucks sakeDaniel RichardsILLUMINATI, for fucks sake dude lay off the crack pipe and take off the tin foil hat.Sam YoungFor lack of a better word. I’m referring to the groups who worship satin. In this context the pedophile rings coming to light. Research for a minute you will find that 100% factual he is related to John podesta, could even be the one who molested him. I wear no hats, why are you here?concernedofessexi worship velvet, satin not so much.Sam YoungYeah, autocorrect is hilarious just like your commentDaniel Richardsgroups who worship a type of fabric? I think you mean SATAN, even then do you honestly believe there is an ALL POWERFUL pedophile protecting Satan worshiping group behind the deaths of these singers and that is more believable then the idea they where depressed and killed themselves, seriously LISTEN TO WHAT YOU ARE SAYING.Sam YoungThe Satan worshippers ARE the pefophiles. And if you’d rather believe that a successful father of 6 would up and kill binaries after buying a house then you are entitled to your opinion. But I’m not wrong just cuz you disagree. And I don’t know anything for sure but the fact is neither do you. You can’t prove me wrong and you can’t prove yourself right. A lot of questionable things surrounding these deaths. Both wives do not believe the suicide narrative.Daniel RichardsNO FAMILY EVER “believes the suicide narrative” if they did then they have to accept the fact they missed the warning signs, denial doesn’t equal Conspiracy MURDER plot.http://www.yoyo.com mellyMy, aren’t you the little professional armchair psychologist?CaliGalPublic schools as well.Brian MartinYou’re an ignorant little pompous wind bag you know that? You don’t know the truth unless you’re now saying you murdered him and want to be a suspect. I suggest you shut itDun-dun-dun-DunurSounds like you’re apart of the cover-up buddyTheWHITEManThere is a vast conspiracy of pedophiles in all the upper class circles, politicians, corporate leaders, bankers, and entertainment leaders.If you think powerful people won’t murder someone to keep their filthy secrets you are naive.Izzy BoldenLaw and Order SVUCaliGalLaw enforcement, judges, public school personnel, daycare center personnel–the love of money anyone can be bought and those that can’t go “suicide’Jessica BrysonSo what side r u on is the question I find myself asking….UlandaWhen a man appears to have fought for his life and has multiple injuries, suicide is not my first suspicion and I tell you this as someone who has had a more than 20yr career in crime photography for a unit in the Justice Department tasked with priority crimes. This is irregular and it is the facts that should consume you, not the notion that you “should never take news from unofficial sources”. This lack of questioning thought is why we are surrounded by zombies and drones in the first place. Mental laziness!Christian ThomasYes, Ulanda.  And that people will take orders from “authority” without ever questioning the morality of what they have been instructed to do.  The drones are out in force on YNW today.andi naderulanda you are so spot on .well doneBob PapadazzioThis is more an issue of “you should never take news from disreputable sources that are just putting up sensationalist bullshit headlines to draw clicks”.CincinnatiChris had what, 9 broken ribs?  And trauma to the back of his head?  He suicided himself?  Now this?  Is it true that Chris and his wife had a foundation to help kids who were victims of abuse?  If so, sorry, these two close “suicides” don’t pass the smell test.Bob PapadazzioThe autopsy report, if memory serves, said he had four fractures on one side and five directly adjacent on the other side. All of these were in the anterior region… which does, in fact, typically produce multiple fractures when they’re the portion of the rib that snaps during hard compressions. It is for this reason that the broken ribs are noted under the “evidence of treatment” portion of the autopsy rather than “evidence of injury”. The autopsy report also mentions no head trauma other than the ligature furrow that developed on the back due to swelling with the ligature against it.CaliGalThe police and the coroner is covering or not telling the public the truth.Ulandaall deaths are just “DEATH INVESTIGATIONS’ until evidence can show conclusively the cause of death. Only then will it be ruled murder or suicide so you’re totally jumping the gun.  It has not yet been ruled a suicide because the investigation is not complete.  His friend just got “suicided”. Both of them “happens” to work at exposing pedophilia in a powerful industry, both their families suspect foul play, both have injuries not consistent with suicide. Now why the fuck do you want to silence people asking questions? Why are you feeling threatened by it?  There is PLENTY motive for those implicated in pedophilia to murder to protect themselves.  Now all I have to ask is why you oppose investigation of such?Ulanda’s New HusbandGet em Ulanda! Jump on their chests with both feet girl. The naysayers most likely have a child under the computer desk tied to the leg while posting. Make their asses bleed sugar!DMESo sad that you are incapable of forming an original thought. Or even thought itself.https://www.facebook.com/jared.bond.754 JaredI don’t know about the accuracy of this article, but just based on seeing recent footage of Chester, I am 95% sure it was not suicide.  No hint of depression, no hint of alcoholism or drug abuse or insanity…. just ridiculous to think so.  He really seemed like one of the most positive, happy, and stable people around.Bob PapadazzioAs a psychiatrist, I feel obliged to tell you that you can’t diagnose someone by viewing recent footage of them. That’s not how psychology works.http://www.yoyo.com mellyAs someone who pretends to be something they are not while posting on Internet discussions, I feel obligated to tell you that you’re not the least bit good at pretending, “Bob”.Bob PapadazzioBy all means, I welcome you to cite any peer-reviewed psychiatric study that says it’s acceptable practice to diagnose someone you’ve never personally evaluated.CaliGalAnd you posing as a mad dog in a photograph is also “highly unethical and dishonest!”Bob PapadazzioAd hominem makes for a weak argument.http://www.yoyo.com mellyBy all means, I welcome you to out yourself, right here, right now.

As you can see Melly, it is both utterly insane and based on zero logic. You are so invested in this world of fairy tales that you seem to be deeply defensive of them. Go read some real media, talk to some people outside your caravan park, you may feel better for it.http://www.yoyo.com mellyIf you were paying the least little bit of attention, fool, you’d understand a troll when you see one. Just be quiet.poMelly, that doesn’t even make sense. You were wrong.Dave GreenlawThis is fake and messed uplimnIt sounds plausible to me.   There are an abundance of pedophiles with lots of money and power in the world who would not hesitate to destroy anyone trying to expose their perversions.Dave GreenlawEvery reliable source I’ve seen on the internet state it’s been ruled a suicide.limnI dont know what you consider ‘reliable’ as far as news sources go.   I tend to follow the motives.  What reasons could someone so well liked and wealthy have for wanting to throw their life away ?  It doesn’t add up .  Besides they both made enemies by trying to expose pedophiles.Goon KnightYou think this article is reliable?limnI dont judge sources.  I take things at face value.   People who only attempt to read things that confirm their own bias tend to jump as any opposing theories as ‘fake news’.   I’d rather think outside the box than be an establishment drone.Hell2PayYou should always judge sources. Always.limnSorry Hell,  character assassination ain’t my game.  If a book as nutty as the bible has some ounce of wisdom that may make sense to me, why should i not take it into consideration?  Inasmuch as it’s full of contradictions.      What i’m saying,  if a serial killer admits that 2 + 2 = 4, i’m not going to deny this simply because of  a knee jerk reaction to disagree with the PoS simply because it would be the more popular thing to do.trehow about u prove that the bible has contradictionsJames Dore@tre Genesis 1 and Genesis 2, game set, match. I win already and that’s just the first two chapters of the Bible.http://www.yoyo.com mellyRight. And every Official Source has been poisoned by America’s Information State.So who do YOU believe? Do tell….Hell2PayMany times, “Outside of the box” is incorrect. As you state, leads to confirmation bias.http://www.yoyo.com mellyI don’t think anybody said “outside the box” leads to “confirmation bias”. That doesn’t even make sense.JosephineI’m with limn. Question everything. Accept nothing at face value. Most MSM is propaganda to manipulate us to a certain end. I find it effective to ask Qui bono?  Who benefits — to determine motivation.Christian Thomascui bonohttp://www.trinityspiritualservices.com DominiqueWell for someone who’s following the motives, you’ve sure as hell ignored a glaring one in his motive to kill himself on his dead friend’s birthday the very year that friend took his own life. This is a man who struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction as well as mental illness. To ignore that in favor of motives that appeal to you emotionally is very troubling.limnWhat’s troubling is that we live in a world where whistleblowers are treated like criminals if not outright killed.  There’s probably a link to them exposing pedophiles and human trafficking , which the Clinton foundation is involved with, and their convenient deaths before exposing that dark world of pedophilia.Sam YoungI agree with you 100% it’s a strange coincidence since they were set to expose pedophile ringJames DoreLimm is right. hell there was one reporter in particular who was suicided by the government for exposing the government and military shipping in and distributing cocaine during the Iran ContratankritClearly, your wild speculation is more reliable than people with actual information. How can I subscribe to your news feed?Adam PhillipsWell looked and rich go about as far as having sex with a deaf girl when severe depression comes into play.It’s made many people do so many more “out of character” acts than drugs, alcohol, and perceived anonymity combined.How many confirmed suicides are there when those closest to the person state the person was always happy, they had no idea they were suffering, weren’t depressed, etc?Do I believe there’s pedophilia in the entertainment industry and every other facet of life? Absolutely. Do I believe that just because Chester is dead by suicide the two must be linked? No. That’s a fallacy of circumstance and composition that require a very large leap of faith vs Chester killed himself on his recently deceased best friend’s birthday because he was severely depressed and saw no other option to quell his pain.It sucks, but just admitting you have any sort of mental health issue… Especially if you’re rich and famous, is beyond taboo and frowned upon by society. Society would say, poor famous multi millionaire, you have it all but you can’t balance the chemicals in your brain correctly? What’s wrong with you… People would do anything to have 1 percent of what you do, quit bitching and make another record. So, they go on, not seeking help because they’re afraid of the stigma that comes along with it.The only one pulling the strings here, was Chester, and his tormented mind. Maybe now things are peaceful for him… Even with people searching for answers so hard they invent murder mysteries to cope with losing an icon of their’s.Sam YoungYou can’t be 100% sure he wasn’t murdered and Chester was the only one pulling strings. You don’t know for sureAdam PhillipsAnd to over simplify by saying the ONLY thing that could add up to this result is a shadow organization of diaper snipers killing them is severe tunnel vision at best… There are literally limitless possible scenarios, the pedo ring being 1 of the more unlikely.Occam’s razor. I mean for all we know, it was terrorists because Chester spoke out on the Manchester attacks, it could be Ted Nugent because Chester and Chris both spoke out against animal cruelty…See how easy it is to create a story that’s certified bullshit? All I need to do is come up with a name like lieutenant Brian Roberts, and say he thinks it was the NRA that did it. It was confirmed by sources within or close to the police. They’re looking at every angle so believe my diatribe about a psychotic big trophy hunter and his special ops murder team being the cause. I mean there’s 1 or 2 things (which I won’t spell out) that don’t add up. I’ll add a couple fancy sceiency sounding things like forensics and bullistics, and the casamir effect not being what we would expect.And without giving any info or adding anything to the discussion, I’ve created an angry mobJoseph C. StonerEven tho the sources may be reliable, you can never trust anything/anyone 100%. If it is something this serious, then the media could’ve been A: paid off, or B: said what the people with power and money wanted them to say. Honestly, we will never know in  this circumstance unless someone admits to killing him. Chester isn’t here to say whether it was a murder or suicide.Desiree GlennJoseph C. Stoner, that is the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard. With a story this big, if this all were true, there isn’t a person in this world rich enough to pay off all of the media. The media would make more sales from the breaking news than however much they would be paid by the unknown source.I firmly believe in conspiracies. But this is absolutely 100% FAKE NEWS!! The police force would not accept the liability of hiding a massive conspiracy like this. The media could never be paid off for a story this big. And Cornells family and Benningtons family certainly would not keep their mouths shut!! For someone to even go there while the family and the world, for that matter, is grieving and mourning the loss is just straight up FUCKED UP!! Despicable!!Sam YoungYes the pedophile ring has more than enough money to pay off all the media. They have plants in the media tho so it’s not always paying off. Don’t underestimate how much money they have. This is not fake news. There is a lot of fake news out there but this is not an example. Police force is infiltrated too. Of course the government lies. What’s more fucked up is that he may have actually been killed because he was going to expose pedophiles. They don’t want to be exposed. They have more money than you can even imagine.The Power Ranger ™“Kid, I own the police!”-Remember that line from Back to the Future 2?It’s because it’s true.The police (especially big city cops) are so easy to corrupt, own and be pay off that the power brokers on top have them in their pocket.You’re an idiot…simple as that. You’re deliberately choosing to not believe it because it makes you uncomfortable or you’re a PEDOPHILE yourself. Corey Feldman exposed the same deal.  There’s ample amount of documentaries online about about pedophiles in politics and in Hollywood as well as countless other celebrity testimonies supporting this. You, my friend, are a fool. And your a fool who’s choosing to blind yourself to the truth.Or….you’re a chicken loving homo yourself? Either way, you sound like your SICK.John QYou’re saying nobody has the money to pay off the media? Maybe you should do some research and see who owns the media? Maybe who is the richest people in the world? Maybe the people who have so much money that every dollar in your pocket is an IOU to their family. The people who are above the government. Who possibly own the government. You sir need to do some research before spouting out nonsense you have no knowledge about. Wake the sheep.Sam YoungEvery reliable source could very well be unrelieable. They could be paid off or in some other way threatened to lieJames Doremany of those reliable sources also have direct ties with the very industries they were going to expose.Goon KnightSo? How does it makes this possibly true? No wonder we have Trump. And in blaming the stupid people in both sides of the aisle.limnWho said it was true?  If police have generated enough evidence to warrant suspicion then it should be investigated.Mister SmithGoon Knight is further proof that abortion should always be legal no matter what!Goon KnightYou’re proof that a walking abortion is real.Sam YoungOf course it’s possible. Open your eyes buddy your brainwashed.Goon KnightJust because something is possible doesn’t mean it happened, moron. And I’m not brainwashed if I don’t believe in some bullshit article that’s nothing but made up hearsay.Daniel Gaines Jryou mean no wonder we had that POS obama.Sam YoungThis is not fake.schnappz2016How on earth would you prove that is even a plausible theory? Surely not off the back of this obviously flawed article?Mark_TrailIt makes sense that this news story would be trolled by those who choose to protect pedos. It would almost be obligatory, like Bennington thought it was his obligation to expose pedos. One thing’s for sure; Bennington won’t be exposing pedos now.“Ridicule is man’s most potent weapon.” ~Saul Alinsky~Goon KnightHow is anybody here supporting pedos, you dumb cunt? Where’s this magic black book? Why didn’t Cornell give it to the proper authorities? Why didn’t Chester show it to anybody or mention it?concernedofessexthere are definitely more potent weapons than ridicule. Sarcasm, cross-bows, stupidity. To name but 4.4thCavScoutWhat did he know about Hillary Clinton? *snickers*Lalanea Little-Tobeleri can give u a hint to that…look at what record label both Chris & Chester were with…..& then look at whos names are tied into that label nunya bussinessInterscope, WMG, Geffen RecordsJosephineDo you think the record label had an insurance policy on Chester that was worth more now than LP latest record? Hybrid theory was certified Diamond. No subsequent albums have accrued that. Yet Chester’s voice was the gold mine.Alicia Clarkmy prayers go up for his family. May he rest in peace. God’s speedThe TruthIt’s very likely that Chris and Chester were both murdered for wanting to expose the ring.  Those speaking out against it are either trolls paid to deflect the issues and attack those wanting to eradicate violence and evil against other human beings or are people that need to wake up.  The irrefutable proof is there and it’s a shame that the truth will come out only by inferring it as opposed to it being reported….then again, isn’t that the world we’re living in now?  Doesn’t mean we have to drink the lie infested Kool Aid though.Goon KnightNo the fuck it’s not.The REAL TruthTHE TINFOIL HAT IS STRONG WITH THIS ONEJosephineWhat a thoughtful and totally original distraction statement! Did you come up with that one on your own?  Oh wait, the CIA came up with the method of discrediting people as “conspiracy theorists.”izzysykopthYeah and with screen names like ‘the real truth’ it’s all one can do to stomach their blather…. Dude is probably part of the pedo ring…Joe Ayersizzysykopth is a nsme I would trust for factual information.

https://www.snopes.com/mark-zuckerberg-resignation/	Did Mark Zuckerberg Announce His Resignation from Facebook?	false	['ecomaxx', ' facebook', ' get ink news', ' mark zuckerberg']	https://archive.is/	https://archive.is/LSajx	2017/03/14	"GIFT IDEASMark Zuckerberg Disgusted With Social Media; Set To Leave Facebook Later This Year(ET, Tuesday, March 14, 2017) - Mark Zuckerberg helped to create a whole new world when he unveiled Facebook in 2004. Barely 20 years old, the fresh faced college student knew he had something special with his technological find. But even this genius had no way to predict how Facebook would change the world.Now, just 17 years later, this 32-year-old billionaire is ready to give it all up? Why? According to those closest to the developer, Zuckerberg is disgusted with the way the public has used and abused the platform. “He wanted to create a way for people to connect; not tear them apart,” explained one colleague.Since its inception, Facebook has enjoyed a wild ride of success. With more than 1.2 billion people logging on every single day, one would think that Zuckerberg fulfilled his dream of global connection. But, according to friends and coworkers, that wasn’t at all what Zuckerberg had in mind when he and a group of friends built the concept (and the reality) of the famous site back in their Harvard dormitory.“What Mark wanted most was to bring the world together. It’s not good enough if it brings along some people and leaves others behind.” And when it comes to using the platform he created to bully or disparage others, Zuckerberg is completely disgusted. “He hates the way some users utilize the platform to bring others down or even to circulate false accounts of events or history.”While Facebook itself begins a new chapter in harnessing its platform for the betterment of society, focusing on remaking the site in order to offer global connectedness while fighting isolationism and social ills. Although a manifesto recently released by Zuckerberg himself outlines a long-term plan by his company to revamp the site and “focus on social infrastructure for the community for supporting us, for keeping us safe, for informing us, for civic engagement, and for inclusion of all,” many behind the scenes say that the Facebook founder has no intention of being a part of the changes and will announce his exit from Facebook in the coming months.Since marrying wife Priscilla Chan M.D., in 2012, Zuckerberg has discovered a new passion: for eradicating disease and living a healthier lifestyle. A pediatrician who specializes in childhood disease, Chan convinced her husband last year to fund the Chan-Zuckerberg initiative, whose main focus is health and education. The initiative has also cited a long-term goal of working towards eradicating all disease by the end of the 21st century.Zuckerberg wants to focus on helping peopleThe daughter of Chinese refugees, Chan is a big believer in Traditional Chinese Medicine and holistic health regimes. She believes that western medicine is incomplete, only striving to treat illness, rather than get to its root cause and cure it. Using a combination of traditional healthcare approaches that date back centuries, in conjunction with modern technology and understanding of disease, Chan and Zuckerberg hope to find cures for thousands of disease now plaguing our society.While working so hard to find the key to unlocking the answers to curing disease in our lifetime, Zuckerberg and Chan discovered something they hadn’t expected: the fountain of youth. While investigating several all-natural holistic remedies for curing skin cancer, Chan stumbled across a new way to care for the skin. While it may not have been the cancer answer she sought, Chan did learn that the ingredients her researchers were using did seem to push back the hands of time, making the skin look younger, smoother and healthier.Mark and wife Priscilla are embarking on a joint business ventureEnthralled by the discovery, Chan put a team of researchers on the case, seeing how much they could learn about these all-natural ingredients. It took them months, but what they ultimately invented was amazing: creams and lotions that can strip away decades of skin damage, returning the skin to a more youthful state. Those who initially used the cream reported looking 10-15 years younger in less than a month!Understanding the full implications of their discovery, Chan quickly patented the invention and talked to her husband about funding the new project. Not really interested in the attention putting their names on the product would create (after all, they wanted this product to speak for itself), the couple decided to release their new skin car line without their name or their endorsement.So what is this amazing skin care line? You can find it under the name: EcoMaxx Skin Care. Since its release earlier this year, EcoMaxx has enjoyed a surge in popularity as celebrities flock to their skin care specialists for the cream.“It doesn’t matter how old they are, this cream smooth those lines; lightens dark sports; and simply makes your look younger,” said one popular actress. “Who need plastic surgery with this cream?”With popularity soaring, EcoMaxx is now releasing two new anti-aging products called EcoMaxx Ageless Moisturizer and EcoMaxx Ageless Eye Revitalizer . Aimed at woman of all ages, this expansion to the product line is expected to be as big a hit as the original age defying lotion.CELEBRITIES LOVE ECOMAXX“Zuckerberg is a genius! He changed the world with Facebook and now he’s changing the world of skincare. Since discovering EcoMaxx I don’t use any other brands anymore, EcoMaxx is far superior to all other anti-aging creams on the market.” - Katy Perry“With a busy lifestyle I noticed signs of premature aging starting to creep onto my skin. I was meeting with Mark and casually mentioned my troubled skin when he told me was creating a skincare line. I’ve been using it for a few weeks now and my skin is already 100x better.” - Selena Gomez“I met Mark during an interview and afterwards he secretly divulged his plans to create a skincare line with Priscilla. Of course I was interested and as a result he ended up sending me a few samples right before they launched. The EcoMaxx cream is hands down the best anti-aging cream I’ve ever used.” - Oprah Winfrey“Surely you’ve all seen those memes of how much I’ve aged since I started office? Since leaving the office I finally have time to do something about it and thanks to Mark and Priscilla, I’ve found a way. I use EcoMaxx morning and night!” - Barack Obama“I had the pleasure of interviewing Prsicilla and afterwards she kindly gave me some samples of their new skincare line to try out. I hate to say it, but I am in love with these creams. Nothing else I’ve used even compares to how effective EcoMaxx is.” - Savannah GuthrieZUCKERBERG GIVES PRODUCTS AWAY FOR FREE!So, what if you aren’t rich or famous? Chan and Zuckerberg don’t care. After all, they are already worth more than $556 billion.“We aren’t in this to make a fortune,” Chan told a friend recently. “We already have amassed a fortune. I just want to help people.”That is why she is now offering readers the opportunity to experience the joys of younger looking skin for FREE!The only cost to you is a $4.95 shipping and handling fee, so you can try the EcoMaxx Ageless Moisturizer and EcoMaxx Ageless Eye Revitalizer have it delivered right to your front door.

https://www.snopes.com/man-ejaculating-boss-coffee/	Was a Man Accused of Ejaculating in His Boss’ Coffee Daily for Four Years?	false	['coffee', ' semen', ' world news daily report']	https://archive.is/	https://archive.is/NIyS6	2017/06/15	initialinitialinitialsinitial TweetNewark, New Jersey | A man was arrested on his work site this morning after it was discovered that he was ejaculating in his employer’s coffee every morning.38-year old Lewis Williams spent the last four years working as the personal assistant of Ms. Linda Moore, executive president of the DANCO engineering firm.Among his tasks as Ms. Moore’s assistant, he was to take her phone calls, set her schedule and bring her a cup of coffee to her desk every day when she arrived at work.After a dispute with his boss this morning, Mr. Williams admitted in front of a dozen coworkers, that he had ejaculated in her coffee “hundreds of time”.According to Brian Little, an intern who witnessed the entire scene, Lewis Williams showed no remorse while he confessed his crime.“He almost looked proud when he told her: ‘I’ve been eating your shit for four years, but all this time, you’ve been drinking my cum!’ He then smiled and explained everything.” The angry employee explained that he had been putting “extra cream” in Ms. Moore’s coffee,  five days a week and over many years.After his confession, his colleagues called the police and Mr. Williams was arrested on the site.A total of 910 criminal charges has been filed against him, including 860 charges of sexual assault. If found guilty on all charges, he could face up to 1070 years in prison.Newark Police Chief Barry Connell says the accused confessed more than 800 crimes, making him the most prolific sexual offender in American history.Lewis William’s motivations when he committed his crimes remain unclear, but there certainly was some animosity between him and his boss.Some of his colleagues have told reporters that he was deeply misogynic and found it humiliating to take orders from a woman all day.Some other employees, however, have suggested that Ms. Moore was often “aggressive, dominating and verbally abusive” with the accused and he may have acted as some sort of “self-defense”.
https://www.snopes.com/united-airlines-remove-assad/	Pentagon Awards Contract to United Airlines to Forcibly Remove Assad?	false	['bashar al-assad', ' duffel blog', ' pentagon', ' united']	http://www.duffelblog.com/	http://www.duffelblog.com/2017/04/pentagon-awards-contract-united-airlines-forcibly-remove-assad/	2017/04/11	Share TweetWASHINGTON — The Pentagon announced Tuesday it had awarded a sole-source contract to United Airlines for work related to the forcible removal of President Bashar al-Assad from Syria.The contract, worth $2.1 billion, tasks the airline company with locating Assad, grabbing him from his seat in the presidential palace, and “dragging him out of Damascus by his arms.” The contract also notes that Assad should be “ asked several times, politely ” to give up his seat of power, though if he refuses, United workers should bloody his nose up a bit, according to the posting at FedBizOpps.The award comes just days after President Donald Trump authorized the launch of cruise missiles at a Syrian air base, in response to Assad’s use of chemical weapons. Two Navy ships launched 59 Tomahawk missiles into Syria, which destroyed roughly 20% of its operational aircraft and a Green Beans Coffee shop being used by the Russian army.Soon after the strikes, some in the Trump White House began calling for regime change in Syria. Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters that peace in Syria “could not be achieved” with Assad remaining in power.Though US military officials have struggled in recent months with a plan for removing Assad, United Airlines cleared its final hurdle for the military’s request for proposal on Monday, when it ordered police officers to forcibly remove a passenger from a flight that was overbooked.Monday’s test run was “more successful than we could have hoped,” said Charlie Hobart, a spokesman for United.United will be sending one of its aircraft to Damascus sometime next week, where it will land and carry out the plan called for in the contract.It’s not yet clear whether United employees will actually carry out the forcible removal of Assad. One source said it’s possible the company may subcontract that portion of the work requirement to the Chicago Police Department, Wells Fargo, or Comcast.Recommended For You:

https://www.snopes.com/ufo-portal-cern/	FALSE: UFO Over CERN	false	['porta', ' section 51', ' ufo', ' video', ' viral videos']	http://www.section51-ufo.com/	http://www.section51-ufo.com/2015/12/ufo-entering-interdimensional-portal-over-geneva-switzerland-dec-2015.html	2016/01/08	UFO entering Interdimensional Portal over Geneva SWITZERLAND - Dec 2015 !!!December 7 2015December 2015 - Geneva, Switzerland. US tourists filmed UFO/strange orb entering Interdimensional Portal in the sky of Geneva, just over CERN area.The CERN project site is located in Geneva, Switzerland. The CERN functions as a Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the largest and most powerful particle accelerator in the World. A collider is the basic tool of particle physics. You take a stream of particles, accelerate them to really high kinetic energy levels, and initiate a collision to slam them into a target. Depending intensity of the experiment, all sorts of peculiar things can happen.As of in 2015, CERN reached levels of double potency over the 10 Tev barrier of dark matter – the theoretical minimal energy of formation of a ‘bag of strangelets’ and ‘micro-black holes’.More people have become more aware of the CERN project aggressive ambitions to explore the unknown ‘dark universe” many have pointed to signs that have people troubled if not terrified by the parade of symbolism used at the CERN facility itself. At CERN headquarters a symbol of Shiva, the (Hindu God of Destruction) dancing the cosmic dance of death and destruction can be clearly seen at the CERN facility. Is this a Symbolic declaration of CERN’s ultimate intention to bring on a new age of destruction to this planet?“The men who would play God, in searching for the God particle, are truly going to find more than they bargained for as they open the gates of hell” Stephen Quayle warns, “they will find inter-dimensional beings who have a taste for human flesh and humanities destruction. Most scientists, in lacking an understanding of the ‘supernatural entities’ that are going to confront them, are way beyond their ability to comprehend, let alone control, the forces of Pandora’s box that will be released.”Yet, on September 23, 2015, the 70th year of Jubilee, at beginning of the Fall equinox, and after the passage of 70 generations since the great flood that enveloped the whole planet CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC) research facility will initiate a monumental step into the unknown.A massive portal constructed by leading world scientists will be prepared to cause a much more intense particle collision that will rival the moment of the “big bang.” As a result a possible gateway for “dark matter” or alternate inter-dimensions can be perhaps initiated by CERN’s intense particle collision capability. This activity may indeed usher in a new age for all humanity and even this planet.Therefore, despite concerns and warnings from other leading science and theological experts a transcending portal will be left wide open and we have no way of knowing what will come forth from this massive particle collision induced gateway. In regards to the acknowledged revitalization of the CERN project mission to open an inter-dimensional portal many have become concerned, some fearful, others filled with curious intrigue over this date of September 23, 2015. However, only time will tell the significant impact 9/23 will have on humanity or on this planet.Therefore, As Sergio Bertolucci clearly stated publicly CERN is meant to open a gateway for “dark matter” and usher in the possibility of beings from alternate dimensions to emerge from it. These recent revelations about the CERN developments prove to us the scientific community is no longer able to explain ‘reality’ without looking at the ‘supernatural’.Hence, with this pronouncement of CERN’s pending capability to serve as a portal or doorway for “dark matter” humanity must buckle their seat belts for the new age to come by this imposing dabble with darkness.“For as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man” (Matt. 24: 37)Moreover, serious scientists regularly discuss the possibility of other dimensions and “wormholes” in books and on scientific documentaries for TV. In the bestselling book Hyperspace Michio Kaku refers to Flight 19 and the Bermuda Triangle :“Ever since Flight 19, a group of U.S. military torpedo bombers, vanished in the Caribbean 30 years ago, mystery writers too have used higher dimensions as a convenient solution to the puzzle of the Bermuda Triangle, or Devil’s Triangle. Some have conjectured that airplanes and ships disappearing in the Bermuda Triangle actually entered some sort of passageway to another world.”Could UFOS use interdimensional portals opening up above earth ?Watch the VIDEO HERE !Subscribe to Section 51 !

For years we have received complaints from concerned parents saying that they didn’t want their children to be subjected to tattoos so this decision has been a longtime coming. We still value tattooed customers, we just want them to cover up before experiencing the Happiest Place on Earth.”Reactions on social media have, as one would expect, been very strong.“I used to bring my family to Disney every year!” Travis Barker tweeted this morning. “Now we will never go there again!!!! #knottsberryfarm4lyfe”Legally, Disney has the right to refuse entry to anyone they please because the parks are their private property. “While we respect individuals’ freedom of expression through tattoos, we do not think that ink has any place in the Magic Kingdom,” Engañar told Inked. “For those who didn’t bring long sleeves or have neck tattoos we opened gift shops in front of our gates so that they can buy a Disney sweatshirt or scarf to cover their tattoos up before entering our theme parks.”For years it has been rumored that Disney CEO Bob Iger has despised tattoos, not just for the aesthetic quality, but because of tattoo artists making money for inking Disney logos and characters without compensating his corporation.“Ownership of trademarks in this country means that nobody can profit off of your intellectual property,” he wrote in an internal memo that was leaked to Breitbart.com in 2014. “But I have seen thousands of Disney tattoos on patrons of our theme parks and I haven’t seen one dime coming from any of those tattoos. It is like we are being mocked in our own house.”Other than tattoos, Disney has also banned facial piercings other than earrings and nose studs. That means no lip, eyebrow, septum or dimple piercings. We asked Engañar if nose rings and ear plugs/tunnels were allowed but she didn’t understand what those were, so she said she wanted to “look into it.”Last year, Disney banned selfie sticks and hoverboards, but this is the first time the parks have restricted any form of body art or permanent cosmetics. We at Inked applauded Walt Disney World and Resort for backing the Florida Competitive Workforce Act which pushed for LGBT rights in the workplace but we strongly believe that the banning of visible tattoos is a severe discriminatory practice.Sadly, the parks are also removing seven of the pirates from their popular Pirates of the Caribbean ride because they have tattoos. “This is a zero tolerance policy beginning today, April 1st,” Engañar said. “Not even Johnny Depp will be allowed into our parks with short sleeves.”Available at INKEDSHOP.COM : Women’s Inked Logo V-Neck T-ShirtAnnounced today, Disney theme parks, including Walt Disney World Florida and Disneyland in Anaheim, are banning admittance to anyone with visible tattoos.

https://www.snopes.com/the-rock-running-for-president/	Is ‘The Rock’ Running for President?	false	['dwayne johnson', ' the rock']	http://www.pajiba.com/	http://www.pajiba.com/politics/here-is-the-only-way-out-of-this-dire-political-situation-america-is-in.php#.WJOH6Kj4RxM.facebook	2017/02/03	By Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson  | Politics | February  1, 2017 | Comments ()By Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson  | Politics | February  1, 2017 |Hi. My name is Dwayne Johnson. Many of you may know me better as The Rock.I am running for the President of the United States.I know that this may sound like a joke to many of you. But it’s not. I am throwing my hat in the ring for 2020. I am not running against Donald Trump. I am not running against whatever candidate the Democrats field. I am not running against anyone. I am running for the country. As an independent. I am running on a simple platform of compassion and civility.You may ask why someone who has never publicly expressed a political opinion is running for office, and I will tell you that is exactly why I am running for the Presidency. I do not owe any obligation to either party, so I do not need to feel beholden to either of their platforms or their ideologies. Mine, again, is a simple platform based on civility and compassion. It is based on a desire to lift everyone up — rich, poor, young, old, black, white, American born or foreign born, gay, straight or transgender — to bring us together again, to make this country whole.The fact that I have expressed so few political opinions I hope will help me in this effort because it is my hope not to advocate for the extreme positions of either party, but to find a middle ground between them both. It used to be possible to find some common ground, for each side to listen to each other, negotiate, and find a place in the middle that leaves everyone happy enough. I am running for the 70 percent of this country who wants to get along, who is willing to give a little to get a little. Who is nostalgic for dinnertime conversations that revolve around workdays or school, dance recitals, little league games, movies, TV shows, worship services, and celebrity gossip, instead of eating dinner fraught with anxiety about what’s going on in the news.I am someone who has worked successfully with people from both sides of the political spectrum and who, I believe, has gained the respect of people from all political stripes. I’ve been a popular college football player. I’ve been a popular professional wrestler, and I have been a popular actor, but I have also been careful never to let my ego get in the way. I have had a lot of box office hits, and I have had a lot of box office bombs, but I have never been defined by ratings, by the number of people who go see my movies, or by the crowds that came out to see me during my football and wrestling careers. I am the same, big-hearted, caring person every day, whether Hercules makes $10 million at the box office, or whether Fast & Furious 10 makes $100 million.There is one position where I will not bend, however, and that’s where it concerns compassion for everyone, from immigrants to low-income white people to the people of color in our cities, in our suburbs, and in rural America, to the people from abroad escaping poverty, famine, or brutal dictators. We live in a huge country, and there is plenty of space for everyone, and plenty of money and resources to go around, even if that means taking a little more from the extremely well off to help out the extremely unfortunate.As Commander in Chief, I will refashion foreign policy to align with my own personality: I will use my strength and might of our military to serve the big heart of the American public. It’s important that we stand up for the little guy, but that in doing so, never become bullies ourselves. Bullying and bluster is the surest sign of insecurity and weakness, and it is not who we are. It sure as hell isn’t who I am. We have to be better than that.Some of you may be wondering why I’ve announced my intention to run for the President of the United States only 12 days into the existing administration. There’s two reasons, actually. First of all, President Trump signed papers to begin his run for 2020 on Inauguration Day, so I am already 12 days behind!More importantly, however, is my hope to use my popularity, my broad demographic appeal, and my name recognition to shift focus away from the ugly partisanship going on in D.C. right now and onto the themes on which I plan to run. I intend to hit the campaign trail immediately, and it is my hope that whatever cultural capital I have accrued over the years fighting Hulk Hogan or Vin Diesel is enough to attract both crowds and the media. It is also my hope that those crowds and the media might begin to absorb some of the lessons about compassion and civility that I plan to impart and apply them long before our next election rolls around.I won’t run a negative campaign, because I don’t need to. I’m Dwayne Johnson. I will never begin a sentence with, “But my opponent …” I don’t need to tear anyone down in order to make myself look bigger.God has also blessed me with a smile that has a calming effect on those around me, and I hope to put it good use over the next four years as I tour this country in an effort to bring us all back together. I want to rebuild us around a very simple idea that that a difference of opinion does not have to separate us, that within most of us, there is goodness, that we can put that goodness to use, and that we are a better country when we are united than when we let our leaders divide us.I’m not asking for your vote now. I’m just asking you to listen. Give me four years to let me convince you that I deserve your vote before you make a decision. I’ll probably regret a few of the things I saw along the way, and in a campaign this long, there will probably be a backlash, and then a backlash to the backlash, but for the first three years, anyway, I’m not here to win your vote. I’m here to offer you hope, to remind you that there’s an alternative to this current political climate waiting in the wings.  I hope that I can offer you all a light at the end of the tunnel.I am Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, and I hope to be your next President of the United States. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless this country we love.Get entertainment, celebrity and politics updates via Facebook or Twitter .

Most PopularByRheanna O\'Neil BellomoJan 4, 2017 If you\'ve ever been on a bad date and needed an ""emergency"" excuse to walk out the door, then you\'ll be even more relieved by a new, helpful trend sweeping bars across the globe. Not only are waitstaff helping women flee a bad date, they want to help keep you out of harm\'s way.At Iberian Restaurant in St. Petersburg, FL, this means there is a discreet sign in the women\'s restroom that reads ""Is your Tinder date not who they said they were on their profile? Do you feel unsafe or even just a tad bit weird?"" If so, the sign advises, order an ""angel shot.""Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowWait, what is this mysterious drink? Well it\'s actually not booze at all. It\'s a code that will discreetly tell the bartender you need help, the Tampa Bay Times reports.Here\'s how it works: Order an angel shot neat and a bartender will escort you to your car. Ask for it with ice and the bartender will call a taxi or Uber for you. Order it with lime and the restaurant staff will call the police.Apparently this code word was inspired by a similar movement in London, where women are ""asking for Angela"" to signal an unsafe situation during a date. It was created by The Lincolnshire Rape Crisis, a support service for women and girls in East England.Most Populari saw this in a toilet and thought it was important and should be a thing everywhere not just lincolnshire !!!! pic.twitter.com/oO45I7gaJL strawberry girl (@iizzzzzi) October 18, 2016Between meeting a stranger from the internet for the first time, the rise of date-rape drugs, and just regularly being subjected to harassment on a daily basis, dates can be terrifying for women. (As Louis C.K. once put it, men are their No. 1 threat.) So a system like this, which would have to be different at every bar in order to work successfully, sounds ideal for daters everywhere.So far, Iberian Restaurant\'s owner Russell Andrade said no one has had to use the angel shot order. ""I\'m surprised to hear people are just talking about this,"" he told the Times. ""We didn\'t put the sign up for any attention. That sort of goes against the point.""From:  Delish More from Good Housekeeping: '"

As a former army officer, a father and business leader, I’ve heard the arguments from all sides. And, as CEO of a 163-year-old company whose products and presence rest at the intersection of culture and community in more than 110 countries around the world, I feel a tremendous responsibility to share our position on the issue, now, at a time when clarity is paramount. Providing a safe environment to work and shop is a top priority for us at Levi Strauss & Co. That imperative is quickly challenged, however, when a weapon is carried into one of our stores. Recently, we had an incident in one of our stores where a gun inadvertently went off, injuring the customer who was carrying it.So, while we understand the heartfelt and strongly-held opinions on both sides of the gun debate, it is with the safety and security of our employees and customers in mind that we respectfully ask people not to bring firearms into our stores, offices or facilities, even in states where it’s permitted by law. Of course, authorized members of law enforcement are an exception.With stores in Paris, Nice and Orlando, and the company’s European headquarters in Brussels, I’ve thought more about safety in the past year than in the previous three decades of my career because of how ‘close to home’ so many incidents with guns have come to impacting people working for this company.We operate in hundreds of stores across every state in the U.S., and laws are different in each one. We know that the presence of firearms in our stores creates an unsettling environment for many of our employees and customers. We also know that trying to enforce a ban could potentially undermine the purpose of the ban itself: safety. With that in mind we’ve made this decision as a business – a request not a mandate – and we sincerely hope responsible gun owners will respect our position. It boils down to this: you shouldn’t have to be concerned about your safety while shopping for clothes or trying on a pair of jeans. Simply put, firearms don't belong in either of those settings. In the end, I believe we have an obligation to our employees and customers to ensure a safe environment and keeping firearms out of our stores and offices will get us one step closer to achieving that reality.  Sincerely,President and Chief Executive Officer, Levi Strauss & Co.FollowFollowingUnfollowChip Bergh

He came during hunting season and there were a lot of out of town hunters there wearing camo. He assumed we dress like that all of the time. He incorrectly reported that the National Guard Armory was our school with bars on the windows and a cannon out front. He outed my gay uncle on CNN and even posted a pic of the store he owns and called him pot belly because he's is overweight. Several inconsistencies. He even snarked about our national forest. He came to dig, insinuate, humiliate, and poke fun at people without even seeing the beauty all around him. What a freaking joke!!!!

However, the most powerful benefit to come out of this common weed is something that medical researchers are super excited to have ""discovered"" - which is its potential to cure cancer!proverbsthirtyonewoman.blogspot.comThis potent root builds up blood and immune system- cures prostate, lung, and other cancers better than chemotherapy. According to Dr. Carolyn Hamm from the Windsor Regional Cancer Centre in Ontario, Canada, dandelion root extract was the only thing that helped with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. This form of cancer typically affects older adults.John Di Carlo, who at the time was a 72-year old cancer patient at the hospital, was sent home to live out his final days after all efforts failed to treat his leukemia. He told CBC News that he was advised to drink dandelion root tea as a last ditch effort. Perhaps it should have been the first option offered in his treatment plan, as his cancer went into remission only four months later! His doctors attributed this to the dandelion tea that he drank.Screenshot via YouTubeRecent studies have shown that dandelion root extract can work very quickly on cancer cells, as was evidenced in Di Carlo's case. Within 48 hours of coming into contact with the extract, cancerous cells begin to disintegrate. The body happily replaces these with healthy new cells.Further studies have concluded that the extract also has anti-cancer benefits for other types of cancer, including breast, colon, prostate, liver, and lung cancer! Dandelion root tea may not taste as pleasant as other teas, but it's certainly more pleasant than living with the side effects of chemotherapy or radiation treatments.Traditional cancer therapies harm the immune system by killing all cells, even the healthy ones. Dandelion root has the opposite effect - it actually helps boost your immune system and only targets the unhealthy cells. It's definitely a win-win situation!Dr. Hamm warns, however, that dandelion root extract can negatively impact the effects of chemotherapy. It's always best to consult with your doctor, and let them know any and all supplements or foods that you are consuming on a regular basis.Screenshot via YouTubeEven if you don't have cancer, eating the greens or drinking dandelion tea can still give you great health! For example, the roots and stems of dandelion can help fight diabetes. It does this by stimulating the pancreas to produce insulin, which in turn stabilizes the spikes in blood sugar levels.If you suffer from digestive issues or need to get rid of toxins, dandelion tea may be just what the herbal medicine doctor ordered! The liver aids the digestive system by producing bile, and it also filters the blood of chemicals and other impurities. According to Dr. Axe , the vitamins and minerals found in dandelions can help cleanse the liver and keep it in tip top shape. So by supporting your liver, you are actually creating better health!Screenshot via YouTubeDandelions are also high in antioxidants and vitamin C, which is crucial to helping your body fight off infections, such as the bacteria that cause urinary tract infections. If you suffer from frequent bouts of UTI, drinking dandelion tea on a daily basis may prevent it from happening ever again.Dandelion greens are bitter, but completely edible - as long as you get it from an area that hasn't been sprayed with chemicals. The greens are rich in fiber, which is great for intestinal health! High fiber diets have also been shown to reduce the risk of obesity, heart disease, and irritable bowel syndrome.The greens are also high in vitamin A - just one cup contains 100% of your recommended daily allowance. Vitamin A is critical for maintaining healthy vision, and it can also prevent premature aging of the skin.Since you probably aren't likely to eat an entire cup of bitter greens on its own, you can incorporate it into a morning smoothie. Just blend it up with your favorite fruit, which will offset the bitter taste.Screenshot via YouTubeSponsoredSECURITY WARNING: Please treat the URL above as you would your password and do not share it with anyone.

https://www.snopes.com/epidural-vaccine-targets-blacks/	Government Targeted Black Women with ‘Epidural Vaccine’	false	['fammtv']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/ZOjUB	2016/11/01	321 Comments An government anesthesiologist came out and said during the years of 2010-2014, the federal government knowingly injected mothers with a vaccine mixed in an anesthetic shot known as an Epidural. What was that vaccine? Well according to Henry Rothschild, (no relation to the Rothschild family allegedly) the vaccine is known as Terminar.Terminar which is Spanish for terminate, according to Mr. Rothschild Terminar was design to break down African American/Black women ovaries exposing them to different germs and multiple diseases which will likely produce a child with serious birth defects and serious illnesses.The government ran a secret operation releasing the anesthetic to predominately black areas. They figure it was best to distribute it through an Epidural so it will go unnoticed. Mr. Rothschild child is asking both black and white women to find out what illnesses may run in your family. If you received an Epidural between 2010-2014 and later gave birth anywhere from 2011 until present, if your child was born with any illness that's not normal this may be the reason why.Fammtv.com Up To The Second NewsLike34K
https://www.snopes.com/queen-elizabeth-remove-obamas-guest-list/	Did Queen Elizabeth Remove the Obamas from Royal Wedding Guest List?	false	['barack obama', ' fake news', ' just news usa', ' michelle obama', ' queen elizabeth', ' royal wedding', ' your news wire', ' yournewswire.com']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/1cJLE	2017/12/06	Queen Just Gave Michelle Royal Beatdown After She Tried To Sneak A Spot On Wedding Guest ListPosted on Author Jordan Hill  Comment(0)For eight years, Michelle Obama genuinely thought she was a queen and expected to be treated like one. Now that she’s a regular citizen, she’s having a hard time of letting go of her former status as the (failed) first lady and keeps trying to push her way into every major social scene where she doesn’t belong and is apparently not invited.When she heard the news that Prince Harry was marrying a black American girl, she assumed it was her place to be on that guest list, which has to be approved by the Queen of England herself. Michelle made a desperation move to sneak a spot on that exclusive guest list and as soon as the real queen found out what the wannabe royalty did, she delivered a brutal beatdown that was definitely deserved.As soon as the big news about the royal engagement of Prince Harry and an American actress Meghan Markle was announced, the Obamas saw an opportunity to edge their way into the elites, like a couple of desperate kids trying to hang with the popular crowd at school. Barack immediately got on social media to beat President Trump to the congratulatory punch. He has a lot more time on his hands than the Commander-in-Chief who is busy cleaning up his mess.Barack practically stalked the prince on Twitter and made a post within seconds of the news coming out, which perhaps had an undertone of letting the royals know that he and Michelle were available that day to attend.The Obamas know what they are doing when it comes to getting attention on themselves and this post was no exception. It garnered a whopping 1 million “likes” on it which both he and Michelle were likely elated about since the royal family was likely sure to see it.The exposure of this post sparked rumors that the Obamas would likely be added to the guest list in the current president and first lady’s place, the Independent reported. While Barack was making desperate tweets to secretly get on the guestlist, Michelle was doing something worse to shove the Trumps aside and ensure her spot, even though the honor is typically reserved for the current president and first lady.Michelle has been making the speaking engagement rounds lately to rack in hundreds of thousands of dollars to trash Trump. Her recent trip to Canada was no exception as she combined it with a hidden mission of getting to the royal wedding.The former first lady had been invited as the keynote speaker in addressing the “Economic Club of Toronto,” when she deviated from her planned remarks to double down on her and Barack’s desperate attempt to kiss up to the Queen of England.According to Page Six, Michelle took the opportunity to make fun of President Trump then immediately gushed over the queen. Both conversation deviations had no place in an event like this, but for calculated Michelle, it has a passive-aggressive purpose of saying that Trump wasn’t fit for her guest list, but since she loves the queen so much, she should get a spot.“After being introduced by Canada’s first lady, Sophie Trudeau, Obama told the crowd that it is ‘never a good idea’ to put your first thought in the morning on social media, and never a good idea to ‘tweet from bed,’ which appears to be one of the president’s favorite pastimes, presuming that he is actually in bed when he tweets at 3 a.m,” Page Six reported.“Going on about effective communication, and the importance of doing drafts, Obama went on, ‘Then you need to edit and spell-check it.’ The 45-minute conversation, hosted by the Economic Club of Toronto, flowed into a bunch of amusing side stories, including her memories of being awestruck when meeting Queen Elizabeth of England.”“’What do you do with the queen? I touched her. She touched me first,’ she said, adding that her dream dinner guest would be Jesus, whom she’d serve pizza.”It’s well known that the respect, proper etiquette, and holding a high-level of decorum is important to the royal family and by painting a picture that Trump can’t control himself, Michelle thought she was making him look like a bad person to have at the wedding.However, the bigger motive in her comments was to cover up her actual faux-pas with the Queen when, not surprisingly, brash Michelle showed a complete lack of respect and protocol when she got a little too touchy with her bullying her way into a hug and pushing her toward a chair, The Guardian previously reported.The Queen felt so grossly disrespected by Michelle that she royally snubbed the former first lady after the touchy-feely offense. When she flew into London with her mother and daughters in tow, expecting an audience with Queen Elizabeth only, she received a big slap-in-the-face instead, the Globe reported. Instead of spending the day with Michelle and her family who flew in to meet with her, the Queen ditched her and went off the horse race instead.Michelle may think she’s royalty and even try to act like it, but she’s got nothing on the actual Queen of England who’s the real deal and put her in her place when she changed plans. The Queen does what she wants which hopefully means that she kicks her off the coveted guest list too.

Hatch  said the chamber would focus on goals of reducing costs and increasing choice in health care, all with an eye toward majority support. At the same time, the Utah Republican acknowledged there would need to be compromises, which have been elusive so far.“Coupled with the constraints imposed by the budget reconciliation process, we must manage expectations and remain focused on the art of the doable as we move forward,” he said.Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said last week there was “no timeline” for moving forward with a Senate version of legislation to partially repeal and replace the Obama-era health care law, but the Texas Republican added that once they had 51 votes, the Senate would proceed.That won’t happen until senators and staff receive cost estimates from the Congressional Budget Office and understand the effect of the House-passed bill. This is because, in part, it would seem impossible to know if budgetary effects violate the Byrd Rule, which is key to reconciliation’s expedited floor procedure that allows a measure to pass the Senate without having to navigate a filibuster.All that could take weeks, and it is during this time that lawmakers are likely to see the presentation of the Trump administration’s first fully detailed budget request, with work beginning on fiscal 2018 spending on a truncated timeline.“I think that they are going to have a heck of a time coming to an agreement on their budget outline. Put aside the issues of what’s going to be put into the reconciliation package — in some ways that may be the easier part for them than actually putting the budget together,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen  said of the 2018 work.The Maryland Democrat, who joined the Appropriations Committee upon arrival in the Senate in January and who previously led Democrats on the House Budget Committee, questioned the feasibility of moving ahead on fiscal 2018 spending bills without a budget resolution.The timing of the fiscal 2018 budget resolution depends on what happens in health care debate. That’s because Republican leaders chose to use the fiscal 2017 budget resolution and the subsequent reconciliation instructions as the vehicle for their health care measure. If they were to pass a fiscal 2018 budget resolution, it could obviate the fiscal 2017 resolution. That’s important, because they want to use the fiscal 2018 resolution and its subsequent reconciliation process to tackle changing the tax code. In essence, health care needs to happen first, and it needs to happen before the current fiscal year is over Sept. 30, when the fiscal 2017 resolution expires. But it’s complicated because the fiscal 2018 budget resolution sets the top-line numbers for the appropriations process.So the process might be disjointed for as long as the health care debate goes on. Further complicating matters is that absent a new budget resolution’s top-line numbers, the automatic budget cuts known as sequestration bounce back, which would slash spending below levels generally acceptable to most members on both sides of the aisle.But Sen. Roy Blunt , the chairman of the Labor-HHS-Education subcommittee of Appropriations, suggested that members of that committee may get to work on the 12 Appropriations bills after Memorial Day.The Missouri Republican said he thought the process of crafting the fiscal 2017 omnibus was useful for the chairmen and vice chairmen at the Appropriations Committees on both sides of the Capitol because it handed them, “an opportunity to really work together and figure out how to negotiate a bill, which hadn’t happened in a while.”Cornyn echoed that sentiment, suggesting it might bode well for future spending discussions.“I think we should acknowledge that it actually represents a win, because it demonstrates the ability to negotiate something with Democrats in both houses of Congress that the White House agrees with, and there’s a lot of good things in there,” the Texas Republican said. “It’s always easy to find things to criticize in spending bills, but we’ve been forced to do this through an omnibus by the Democrats and this is the hand we’ve been dealt.”Cornyn was one of several Republicans to chastise Democrats for their opposition to calling up a standalone bill funding the Pentagon this year.“It’s not that I blame Mitch McConnell or anybody else. The Democrats would not allow us to move forward on the Defense appropriations bill. That’s got to stop. So, I just want everybody to have their say, have their amendments, get a vote and go back to normal order,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham , the State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee chairman. “We’re all in the same boat together. It’s not a good way to govern the country.”The South Carolinian ended up being one of the GOP appropriators to vote against the omnibus, citing key local concerns, including the status of the Export-Import Bank.It’s the nature of McConnell, who for years led Republicans on the subcommittee funding foreign operations, to want to prioritize appropriations bills, and Blunt said he expect the same in the upcoming summer when the Senate is not mired in the health care debate.“Many of the members will feel good about the ability to explain how we’ve prioritized. And I hope it drives more of an interest to have these bills actually on the floor,” Blunt said. “Some of our bills, I think, still could be ready to be on the floor in the June timeframe, and my guess is Sen. McConnell will want to allocate a lot of time to the appropriations process.”Sen. Patrick J. Leahy , the top Democrat on the Appropriations panel, signaled that he would be on board with such an effort.“It is my goal … to return to regular order, where we consider each appropriations bill in committee, debate each one publicly on the floor, and pass them individually. That is the way we should operate,” the longtime Vermont lawmaker said Thursday. “That is what the American people deserve. I look forward to working with the chairman to make this a reality when we turn, in very short order, to the fiscal year 2018 bills.”For Democrats, the wildcard won’t be Republican appropriators, but the Trump budget request — and the president himself.“I will say that it’s alarming to hear this president talk about a ‘good’ government shutdown. There are no good government shutdowns,” Van Hollen said, referring to a recent Trump tweet. “Normally, you would think only a hostile foreign power would want the United States government to shut down. It cost our economy $24 billion a few years ago for a 16-day shutdown.”Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android .

Meteorologists and weather science experts at the National Weather Service (NWS) say that there is a 99% chance that the we will start to see a massive cold-front sooner in the year than has ever happened, which will produce not just record-breaking snowfall, but according to Dr. Boris Scvediok, a doctor of global weather sciences, record shattering snow storms across the board, affecting the entire United States.“For the sake of comparison to the past winter, lets say that your area received a total of twenty inches of accumulative snow for the season. Because this year the snowfall is predicted to start by the end of September or the beginning of October, you can expect to multiply that number by up to five, ten, maybe even twenty times in some areas. In the worst zones, you could see 50 times the amount of snow you’ve had in the past. This is the type of winter the American public needs to prepare for. Several meteorologists are saying not to buy into what the models are showing. I can tell you from forty years of scientific weather research, they are doing you a disservice,” Dr. Scvediok told the Associated Press on Friday. “The Northeast, Ohio Valley, and Midwestern states will definitely get hit the hardest.”Edward F. Blankenbaker, Senior Administrator of Meteorologists, also told the media that this will be a once-in-a-lifetime kind of snowy winter.“Pretty much everyone will see snow like they never have in their lives. Most younger people don’t even know what an actual blizzard looks like, but by the end of March, they will be seasoned survivalists,” Blankenbaker said. “Everyone needs to make sure they have their weather emergency kits prepared and ready to go. There will undoubtably be mass power outages, which along with freezing temperatures and enough snowfall to immobilize entire cities, will most likely, and unfortunately, be a very dangerous recipe. Safety always comes first and the time to prepare is right now.”Thanks for the feedback! UndoWhat was wrong with this ad?InappropriateThanks for the feedback!

FDA spokesperson Rebecca Miller suggests alternatives in preparation of the coming months.“We are encouraging that you go out and purchase bulk amounts of dry, powdered milk which can be stored in your cupboards. This will prevent frantic trips to grocery stores and super markets as the onslaught of storms begin to fall upon your respected region.” Miller said. “As far as bread, we suggest you buy as much as you can efficiently store in your freezer. Bread can be frozen and thawed without compromising the integrity of its quality. Preparations such as these are crucial and the fact that technology has brought us to a time and place in which such events can be predicted is quite remarkable. So stock up on your powdered milk and fill your freezer with loaves of bread, because once the blankets of snow begin to fall, brave souls will confront the elements to raid stores of these products like some sort of scavenger hunt. Don’t be a part of the Snowpocolypse, it’s a dangerous battlefield of crazed shopping winter bitten weather zombies.”Stock up! Prices could more than triple in some locationsPublic safety organizations also encourage the masses to prepare themselves by obtaining proper necessities. James Satterfield from the National Fire and Safety Advisory Board says preparation can save lives. “Don’t wait until temperatures plummet into a freeze; obtain cold weather clothing and footwear, including wool thermal socks. It is also crucial to have plenty of batteries, candles, weather radios, you name it. Get prepared, it’s coming.” Satterfield stated. “First and foremost, make sure you have an effective plan in place to make sure you have plenty of bread and milk.”Dr. Scvediok says to be prepared for a storm that could come as early as the end of September, and plan for the entire winter season, which this year, he says, will more than likely spread into next June.
