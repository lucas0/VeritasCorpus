It was fitting that the quarterback capped off the weeks demonstrations, seeing as he was the one who launched the largest social justice protest the NFL has ever seen.But he was far from alone. Seventeen other players across the league joined him by kneeling or raising their fists during the playing of the national anthem before their games to draw attention to police brutality against minorities and spur conversations about social justice. The Seahawks Jeremy Lane opted to sit during the preseason, but joined in his teams demonstration of locking arms on Sunday instead.Here are a few striking photos that captured the moments.1.

The incident took place in the 6000 block of N. Ventura Canyon Avenue around 3:20 p.m. Friday, authorities said. Officials trying to determine if the man was electrocuted did not rule out the possibility of it being an unrelated medical event. Later, they seemed to indicate electricity may have played a factor in the worker’s demise. The man has not been identified by a neighbor said the man got out of an AT&T truck. The coroner will determine the man’s official cause of death.

During her meeting with the kittens, she made the sign for cat followed by baby  telling her trainers the kittens were now her adopted children. She also asked in sign language for one of the kittens to be placed on her head.Despite her huge hands being the size of the young cats, Koko was gentle with the tiny balls of fluff when they arrived in a cardboard box, carefully flicking a finger out to stroke them.   Maternal instinct: Koko is filmed signing 'cat' during the encounter. The gorilla's maternal and play instincts have apparently 'kicked in'   Communicating: This cradling motion is how Koko signifies the word baby, which she often signs, and carries her gorilla dolls the way gorilla mothers carry their babiesKoko was filmed being presented with a cardboard box containing the kittens, and taking a peek inside it, at the foundation's   base at Woodside, CaliforniaDespite her huge hands being the size of the animals, she was gentle with the tiny balls of fluff, carefully flicking a finger out to stroke them.Footage shows Koko taking her time before attempting to pick one of the kittens up - as if allowing them the chance to acclimatize to her first.She then scoops up a little grey kitten in her hand.After bringing the cat up to her face to take a closer look, the gorilla strokes its belly with her index finger before tucking it under her arm for a cuddle.RELATED ARTICLESPrevious12NextHeart-warming moment toddler giggles uncontrollably after...Artist creates the most amazing silhouettes you will ever...Dancing on air!

Koko has adopted these two kittens into her family, and it has energized her world.'Not only have Koko's maternal and play instincts kicked in, but she is signing more to her caregivers and generating new content every day that can be used by The Gorilla Foundation to create empathy for great apes.'The foundation noted that new content can have significant benefits to both endangered free-living great apes and those in captive environments.And that it encourages the development of two-way communication with their caregivers, something that Koko has had since she was a baby.Koko, who was born at San Francisco Zoo, has spent most of her life at The Gorilla Foundation in Woodside. According to the foundation's website, she spent a lot of her time with two male gorillas  - but did not initiate mating with either. She formed a 'sibling relationship' with one, which died in 2000, and is yet to show interest in mating with the other, despite getting along with them 'very well'.She is also living in an unnatural social situation - and attempts to bring other female gorillas into the family have apparently failed.

'We've known this for years, as she often signs the word BABY  and carries her gorilla dolls the way gorilla mothers carry their babies. 'She even pretends that her baby dolls can sign by molding their arms and hands in play or in response to questions.'Koko has also previously expressed a love for kittens, asking foundation workers for a cat for Christmas in 1984 via her 'sign language'. The gorilla's vocal and breathing behaviours associated with the ability to talk were thought to be impossible in her species.In the 1930s and 40s, a number of psychologists attempted to raise chimpanzees alongside human children, attempting and failing to teach them to speak. Since then it has been generally accepted that apes are not able to voluntarily control the sounds they produce or even their breathing.Experts also believed the vocal repertoire of each ape species to be fixed, so that they are unable to learn new sounds and breathing patterns.This would suggest the human ability to speak is unique. Postdoctoral researcher Marcus Perlman said: 'This idea says there's nothing that apes can do that is remotely similar to speech. 'And therefore, speech essentially evolved - completely new - along the human line since our last common ancestor with chimpanzees.' Dr Perlman, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, started research work at The Gorilla Foundation in 2010, where Koko has spent more than 40 years living immersed with humans and interacting for hours a day with psychologist Penny Patterson and biologist Ron Cohn.'I went there with the idea of studying Koko's gestures, but as I got into watching videos of her, I saw her performing all these amazing vocal behaviours,' he said. The vocal and breathing behaviours he saw were thought to be impossible, he said.Together with Nathaniel Clark of the University of California, Santa Cruz, he sifted 71 hours of video of Koko interacting and found repeated examples of her performing nine different voluntary behaviours that required control over her vocalisation and breathing.These were learned behaviours and not part of the typical gorilla repertoire, seemingly disproving previous theories.The researchers observed Koko blowing a 'raspberry' when she wanted a treat, blowing her nose into a tissue, playing wind instruments, blowing on a pair of glasses before wiping them with a cloth and mimicking phone conversations by chattering wordlessly into a telephone cradled between her ear and the crook of an elbow.'She doesn't produce a pretty, periodic sound when she performs these behaviours, like we do when we speak,' Dr Perlman says.'But she can control her larynx enough to produce a controlled grunting sound.' KOKO THE GORILLA WAS MOVED BY ROBIN WILLIAMS' DEATHNews of Robin Williams's untimely death last year hit Koko hard.The gorilla's handlers said she was moved nearly to tears by the news that her friend had passed away.In 2001, Williams visited the Gorilla Foundation centre and quickly befriended Koko, making her laugh for the first time in six months.When her carers explained to Koko, who is fluent in American Sign Language, that a friend of the center had died, she soon became sad and was pictured sitting hunched over with a quivering lip. In 2001, Robin Williams visited the Gorilla Foundation  and quickly befriended Koko, making her laugh for the first time in six monthsKoko even signed the words 'cry lip' - lip being her word for woman - as she watched staff reacting to the news.'She became extremely sad, Dr Penny Patterson wrote on Koko.org.Footage from the day Koko and Williams met is as uplifting as his suicide is tragic.The actor arrived there as a stranger to the gorilla with a personal interest in ape conservation. He left as Koko's friend. """

Every guest is allowed to bring a plus one. A few years ago, when I was new in town, I got invited by a good friend, I shouldn’t say his name I guess,” said Perry, who also explained that “each year a new host is selected for the following year by drawing straws, you know? It is the new host’s responsibility to provide the main course, and it has to be human. If he can’t find a suitable person to serve as the meal… Well the joke, I think it’s a joke, is that the host will be eaten instead!““I was a bit squeamish about the idea of going to this dinner party, but when I heard who else was going I jumped at the chance. I was like, ‘People die all the time and their bodies just go to waste. If we can use their organs for medical purposes why shouldn’t we eat their meat?'”Asked what happened at the dinner party, Perry explained, “It was a huge, lavish feast. Oh my god. The featured dish was what they called Foie Humaine. You guys should appreciate that, being French. It’s a pun on foie gras, get it? But instead of force-feeding a duck and then eating it’s liver, this was the liver of a human who had force-fed themselves on junk food.”“A fatty liver fit for the kings of Hollywood.”Describing herself as “not terribly fond of organ meats,” Perry passed on the liver dish, but did enjoy sampling human flesh during the multiple course Bacchanalian feast.“It tastes like pork,” the singer explained of human meat. “But a little bit bitter, stronger.”Katy Perry promoting Illuminati symbolism.Katy Perry’s cannibalistic confession is merely the latest in a long line of public dalliances the singer has shared with the dark side. After starting her career as a Christian country singer, the she reinvented her image as a raunchy pop star, flashing Satanic hand gestures and promoting Illuminati symbolism as she rode to the top of the charts.Since establishing herself in the global consciousness as a Devil-worshipping entertainer, Katy Perry has attempted to sugar coat her image, however the disturbing conversation she held with the French radio host suggests she is far from a reformed character, and she has openly embraced the darkest forces in our society.The incident has also sparked fears around the world that the Illuminati have moved onto the next phase of the masterplan, and have begun openly promoting dark spirituality as a viable religious choice for those seeking guidance.

https://www.snopes.com/trump-rolls-back-rules-protecting-elderly/	Did President Trump Roll Back Rules Protecting Elderly at Nursing Homes?	true	['elderly', ' nursing homes', ' obama administration', ' trump administration']	https://www.nytimes.com/	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/24/business/trump-administration-nursing-home-penalties.html	2017/12/28	Trump Administration Eases Nursing Home Fines in Victory for IndustryBy JORDAN RAUContinue reading the main storyPhotoSeema Verma, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has said that the agency’s regulations were “taking doctors away from what matters most: patients.” Credit Al Drago for The New York TimesThe Trump administration is scaling back the use of fines against nursing homes that harm residents or place them in grave risk of injury, part of a broader relaxation of regulations under the president.The shift in the Medicare program’s penalty protocols was requested by the nursing home industry. The American Health Care Association, the industry’s main trade group, has complained that under President Barack Obama, federal inspectors focused excessively on catching wrongdoing rather than helping nursing homes improve.“It is critical that we have relief,” Mark Parkinson, the group’s president, wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump in December 2016.Since 2013, nearly 6,500 nursing homes — four of every 10 — have been cited at least once for a serious violation, federal records show. Medicare has fined two-thirds of those homes. Common citations include failing to protect residents from avoidable accidents, neglect, mistreatment and bedsores.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe change in policy aligns with Mr. Trump’s promise to reduce bureaucracy, regulation and government intervention in business.Dr. Kate Goodrich, director of clinical standards and quality at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in a statement that unnecessary regulation was the main concern that health care providers raised with officials.“Rather than spending quality time with their patients, the providers are spending time complying with regulations that get in the way of caring for their patients and doesn’t increase the quality of care they provide,” Dr. Goodrich said.But advocates for nursing-home residents say the revised penalties are weakening a valuable patient-safety tool.“They’ve pretty much emasculated enforcement, which was already weak,” said Toby Edelman, a senior attorney at the Center for Medicare Advocacy.Medicare has different ways of applying penalties. It can impose a specific fine for a particular violation. It can assess a fine for each day that a nursing home was in violation. Or it can deny payments for new admissions.The average fine in recent years has been $33,453, but 531 nursing homes amassed combined federal fines above $100,000, records show. In 2016, Congress increased the fines to factor in several years of inflation that had not been accounted for previously.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe new rules have been instituted gradually throughout the year.In October, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services discouraged its regional offices from levying fines, even in the most serious health violations, if the error was a “one-time mistake.” The centers said that intentional disregard for residents’ health and safety or systemic errors should still merit fines.A July memo from the centers discouraged the directors of state agencies that survey nursing homes from issuing daily fines for violations that began before an inspection, favoring one-time fines instead. Daily fines remain the recommended approach for major violations discovered during an inspection.Newsletter Sign UpPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Please try again later.You are already subscribed to this email.Opt out or contact us anytimeDavid Gifford, the American Health Care Association’s senior vice president for quality, said daily fines were intended to prompt quick remedies but were pointless when applied to past errors that had already been fixed by the time inspectors discovered them.“What was happening is you were seeing massive fines accumulating because they were applying them on a per-day basis retrospectively,” Mr. Gifford said.But the change means that some nursing homes could be sheltered from fines above the maximum per-instance fine of $20,965 even for egregious mistakes.In September 2016, for instance, health inspectors faulted Lincoln Manor, a nursing home in Decatur, Ill., for failing to monitor and treat the wound of a patient whose implanted pain-medication pump gradually slipped over eight days through a ruptured suture and protruded from her abdomen. The patient died.The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services fined Lincoln Manor $282,954, including $10,091 a day for 28 days, from the time the nursing home noticed the problem with the wound until supervisors had retrained nurses to avoid similar errors. An administrative law judge called the penalties “quite modest” given the “appalling” care.The fines were issued before the new guidelines took effect; if the agency had issued a one-time fine, the maximum would have been less than $21,000.Lincoln Manor closed in September. Its owner could not be reached for comment, and his lawyer did not respond to an interview request.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAdvocates for nursing home residents say that relaxing penalties threatens to undo progress at deterring wrongdoing. Janet Wells, a consultant for California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform, said the changes come as “some egregious violations and injuries to residents are being penalized — finally — at a level that gets the industry’s attention and isn’t just the cost of doing business.”In November, the Trump administration exempted nursing homes that violate eight new safety rules from penalties for 18 months. Homes must still follow the rules, which are intended, among other things, to reduce the overuse of psychotropic drugs and to ensure that every home has adequate resources to assist residents with major psychological problems.In June , the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services rescinded another Obama administration action that banned nursing homes from pre-emptively requiring residents to submit to arbitration to settle disputes rather than going to court.“We publish nearly 11,000 pages of regulation every year,” the agency’s administrator, Seema Verma, said in a speech in October. That paperwork is “taking doctors away from what matters most: patients.”Janine Finck-Boyle, director of health regulations and policy at LeadingAge, a group of nonprofit nursing homes and other entities that care for older people, said the group’s members had been struggling to cope with regulations.“If you’re a 50-bed rural facility out West or in the Dakotas,” she said, “you don’t have the resources to get everything done from A to Z.”Jordan Rau is a senior correspondent for Kaiser Health News , a nonprofit news service covering health issues that is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation and not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.A version of this article appears in print on December 25, 2017, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Nursing Home Industry Wins As Penalties Are Relaxed.

While there was no confirmation, it was being tossed around that it was Barack looking to dump Michelle. This morning, a filing in the District Court of Cook County, Illinois confirmed that the couple is seeking divorce and that Barack is, in fact, the plaintiff.According to county docket D4610968L86, Barack Hussein Obama seeks dissolution of marriage from Michelle Obama on grounds of infidelity and irreconcilable differences. The infidelity, according to the Obama’s longtime housekeeper, Analita Consuelo Gonsales, isn’t recent but rather the revelation through a recent DNA test that Obama isn’t the biological father of Sasha or Malia.Gonsales said that it wasn’t really a surprise, because during an argument in 2003 Barack admitted to Michelle that he had faked all of his orgasms. Michelle, in turn, admitted that she had an affair with a biolab and that the children were actually the product of advanced genetic engineering. Apparently, Malia is secretly one of the most talented dulcimer musicians in the world and Sasha’s IQ is so high she’s a single lab accident away from being a supervillain and taking over the world.Obama, who suddenly feels like an outcast in a family of such amazing people, will step aside and even back Michelle’s 2020 run for president, but he will not agree to paying any form of support for Sasha, who is still a minor, mostly because she makes more money playing Texas Hold ’em in a month than he makes in a year.It’s lucky for us that we don’t have to have this kind of craziness in our White House anymore. Having a great, stable family like the Trumps is doing wonders for America.Join The Resistance And Share This Article Now!4.3k

While the concept of a child marrying an older man is creepy, isn’t it strange that these same people have nothing to say about Christian child marriages in the United States?On Friday, the New York Times published the heartbreaking story of Sherry Johnson.Subscribe to our Youtube ChannelJohnson was raped by a 20-year-old member of her church and became pregnant in Florida and learned very quickly that Christianity can be very cruel to its adherents.“It was forced on me,” she told the Times. See, authorities had begun sniffing around because she was pregnant with a 20-year-old’s child, so church official made the decision that the best way to avoid embarrassment was to marry her off to her rapist.Unfortunately, her parents were just devout enough to go along with this horrible plan:My mom asked me if I wanted to get married, and I said, ‘I don’t know, what is marriage, how do I act like a wife?’” Johnson remembers today, many years later. “She said, ‘Well, I guess you’re just going to get married.’”So she was. A government clerk in Tampa, Fla., refused to marry an 11-year-old, even though this was legal in the state, so the wedding party went to nearby Pinellas County, where the clerk issued a marriage license. The license (which I’ve examined) lists her birth date, so officials were aware of her age.Johnson was raped by both a minister and a parishioner, and the judge approved the marriage to the rapist who caused her to give birth at the age of 10 so that the investigation would end.“What we want is for you to get married,” the judge told her.“It was a terrible life,” Johnson says, noting that she missed school and spent her time changing diapers for what would eventually be nine children. Her husband would occasionally disappear and leave her to deal with everything.“They took the handcuffs from handcuffing him,” she says. How can this happen? Because it’s perfectly legal. In most states, it is perfectly legal for a man to marry a child. While some have at least passed laws limiting the age to 16 or 17 and above, most have no limit whatsoever.But Republicans are oddly resistant to progress. New Jersey lawmakers overwhelmingly passed a bill that would raise the age to 18, for instance. the bill made it to Gov. Chris Christie’s desk, but he vetoed it in the name of “religious freedom.”Child marriage, which the United States condemned in other countries as a “human rights abuse that contributes to economic hardship” in a State Department document last year, is a practice that must end.Featured image via The IndependentRelatedApparently the standard punishment is 'too harsh,' even though this man's actions are depraved beyond words.04/20/2017

The left isn’t that happy about the way he introduced the campaign, and told everyone that he dreams of big and safe America. Hillary’s supporters and the media came up with everything they could ever think of in order to get Trump out of the game. Not so fast, people! Your audio doesn’t mean a thing.Even Graham told everyone how he sees things, and that brought joy to everyone who cares about this country. Unlike people who hate Trump, he said a few good words that surprised us all. In a good way, of course. In your face, haters!Via Patriot JournalThey are epitome of hypocrisy. Most of the people decrying Trump give a pass to Bill Clinton, when as president he committed adultery with an intern. They continue to give a pass to Hillary, who protects her husband despite allegations of rape.And they ignore serious crimes Hillary committed when secretary of state.On the other hand, conservatives, who believe in such virtues as forgiveness, have been willing to look passed Trump’s remarks. We have enough common sense and decency to know everyone messes up, now and again, and needs our understanding and forgiveness.From Conservative Tribune:While the media couldn’t understand why, Rev. Franklin Graham did. He wrote a stirring Facebook post that moved Trump so much that he re-posted it on his Facebook account.“A lot of people are slamming evangelicals for supposedly giving Donald J. Trump a pass,” Graham began. “That’s simply not true. No one is giving him a pass. I’m certainly not, and I’ve not met an evangelical yet who condones his language or inexcusable behavior from over a decade ago.“However, he has apologized to his wife, his family, and to the American people for this. He has taken full responsibility. This election isn’t about Donald Trump’s behavior from 11 years ago or Hillary Clinton’s recent missing emails, lies, and false statements,” Graham continued.“This election is about the Supreme Court and the justices that the next president will nominate. Evangelicals are going to have to decide which candidate they trust to nominate men and women to the court who will defend the constitution and support religious freedoms.“My prayer is that Christians will not be deceived by the liberal media about what is at stake for future generations,” Graham added.The left don’t understand this, because they are mostly secular humanists. They are unable to appreciate such a powerful virtue as forgiveness, because they don’t believe in a God who can forgive our every trespass.They are under the delusion that you must be perfect or else. Either you live up to their warped standards or they’ll throw you under the bus. That’s what happened to Alec Baldwin a few years ago, when TMZ accused him of a homophobic remark. All his liberal buddies were quick to disown him, despite any real evidence.The left will never be able to understand, because they refuse to. They simply have their own agenda to protect, at all costs, and cannot conceive the ability to grow or change.Pro-Hillary Americans can’t understand that Trump is what this country needs. They are aware of his potential, but still refuse to admit it. Well, we know that, and we support Trump. Nobody cares about your opinion, Dems!What do you think about this?

Mary Lou Marzian, a Democrat from Louisville, proposed House Bill 369 in Feb. 2016 as a pointed statement to anti-abortion advocates, according to CBS News.The bill would have also required a man be married and make a sworn statement with his hand on a Bible that he will only use a prescription for a drug for erectile dysfunction when having sexual relations with his current spouse.My point is to illustrate how intrusive and ridiculous it is for elected officials to be inserting themselves into private and personal medical decisions, Marzian told Reuters.The proposal came days after Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican, signed an informed consent law requiring women to receive counsel from a doctor 24 hours before having an abortion.Marzian told the Louisville Courier-Journal that the bill was a form of protest against the intervention into womens health by a predominantly male General Assembly.'

https://www.snopes.com/trump-order-popular-vote-winner/	Did President Trump Sign an Executive Order Naming Himself the Popular Vote Winner?	false	['donald trump', ' political garbage chute', ' politicalgarbagechute.com', ' satire', ' voter fraud']	https://www.nytimes.com/	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/politics/trump-voting-fraud-false-claim-investigation.html?_r=0	2017/02/02	“All available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake,” Mr. Trump’s lawyers wrote in their response to recount petitions by Jill Stein, the Green Party presidential candidate. Mr. Spicer said the lawyers were referring only to states where Mr. Trump campaigned extensively. In Ohio, Secretary of State Jon A. Husted, a Republican, said Wednesday in an interview that there was “no evidence” that voter fraud was happening on a large scale. Edgardo Cortés, Virginia’s election chief, a Democrat, said there was “no basis” for the claims. And California’s Democratic secretary of state lashed out at the president for undermining confidence in the election system. “Free and fair elections are the bedrock of our democracy, and he’s taken a jackhammer to it with his irresponsible tweets,” said Alex Padilla, the state’s top election official. “Whatever proof or evidence he said he had, he clearly didn’t have.

An error has occurred. Please try again later. You are already subscribed to this email. Mr. Trump has repeatedly shifted his view of the election system. As a candidate, he frequently railed against what he called a “rigged” election. When he became president-elect, he complained about “serious voter fraud,” but later reversed himself and mocked Ms. Stein’s recount efforts as “a scam” and a waste of time and money. This week, he flip-flopped again, telling lawmakers at a White House reception that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote because millions of immigrants in the country illegally voted for her. Mr. Spicer declined to elaborate on what Mr. Trump meant but did not back away from the assertion. “The president does believe that,” Mr. Spicer said. “It’s a belief that he’s maintained for a while, a concern that he has about voter fraud. It remains unclear what form a federal investigation may take. While the F.B.I. has the authority to look into voter fraud, that appears not to be what the president has in mind. Mr. Spicer said it was too early to know, but mentioned the possibility of a task force or commission. He cited studies that he said showed that voter rolls contained the names of millions of people who should not be there because they had moved, were not citizens or had since died. But the author of one of those major studies said Wednesday that Mr. Spicer and the president appeared to be misunderstanding the numbers. David Becker, who for six years was in charge of the election initiative for the Pew Center on the States, said that voter rolls often had out-of-date information, but that there was virtually no evidence that many of those names were used to vote illegally. “It does exist, but it happens in very, very small numbers and nothing like what is claimed by the president,” Mr. Becker said. He said systems across the country to prevent voter fraud would have caught any huge effort to vote illegally. “We would have seen that well before the election,” he said. In Ohio, for example, a review of the state’s elections in 2012 and 2014 found that out of millions of votes cast, there were 667 allegations of fraud, of which just 149 were referred to law enforcement for investigation, Mr. Husted said. The Ohio review, which happens after every election, also found that 436 unauthorized immigrants were registered to vote and that 44 had voted. “Voter fraud exists. It’s not widespread or systemic,” said Mr. Husted, who said he had voted for Mr. Trump. Mr. Husted said he would be happy to share Ohio’s review of the 2016 election with the federal government when it was completed. And he said Mr. Trump could aid states by sharing government databases that could help them clean their voter rolls. In his Twitter message Wednesday, Mr. Trump suggested that a federal review could lead to improvements in voting procedures. But Democrats and voting experts criticized the president for focusing his allegations on voter fraud while resisting the intelligence community’s conclusions involving Russian hacking of the Democratic National Commitee and officials connected to Mrs. Clinton during last year’s election. “It’s more important that we investigate the known instances of election fraud, rather than imagined ones,” said Kim Alexander, the president of the California Voter Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to improving the voting process. “We have had an election that was compromised by foreign interests. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said the president should “knock this off” and move on. “This is going to erode his ability to govern this country if he does not stop it,” he said on CNN. And several Democratic lawmakers and state election officials said they suspected that Mr. Trump’s allegations were part of a plan by Republicans looking for reasons to justify new restrictions on voting to benefit their party, particularly targeting immigrants and African-Americans. “There has been a sustained effort across the country, rooted in similar conspiracies about voter fraud, to make it harder for Americans to vote,” Senator Dianne Feinstein of California said in a statement. Mr. Padilla, the California secretary of state, said he also worried that Mr. Trump’s repeated allegations about fraud would undermine the confidence that Americans had in the integrity of the voting system. “Stoking fear and concern is undermining people’s faith in our elections,” he said.

https://www.snopes.com/pacu-testicle-biting-fish/	Pacu of Lies — On the Trail of the Testicle-Biting Fish	mfalse	['lethal lurkers', ' pacu', ' piranha']	http://www.seriouslyfish.com/	http://www.seriouslyfish.com/species/piaractus-brachypomus/	2016/08/15	Characidae. Subfamily: SerrasalminaeDistributionNative to the Rio Orinoco and Amazon basins in Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil. Introduced populations are thriving in various parts of the world, mainly in Far Eastern countries such as China and Taiwan where it’s farmed for eating.HabitatInhabits main river channels and flood plains, moving into flooded forests during the rainy season. It tends to prefer shallow, slow-moving areas with overhanging or floating vegetation. Juveniles spend the first few months of life in the flood plains, where food is plentiful and predation is less of a danger.Maximum Standard LengthThe biggest wild fish recorded measured 35.2″ (88cm). Captive specimens tend to be a bit smaller than this, but expect it to reach at least 24″ (60cm).Aquarium Size Top ↑Sadly adults are all too often seen living in cramped conditions. If you want to house one of these for life you’re going to need an enormous tank measuring at least 120″ x 36″ x 36 (300cm x 90cm x 90cm) – 2550 litres, preferably larger. Youngsters can be grown on in smaller tanks but will grow quickly when well-fed.MaintenanceThe size of the tank and filtration used are much more important than the choice of decor. Strictly speaking, decor isn’t necessary for a tank containing an adult as it’s a very active species . At any rate try not to clutter up the tank space too much. There’s also little point adding plants as they’ll be eaten immediately. Opt for a few water-worn boulders and perhaps some large chunks of driftwood or beech branches. Ensure that any such furnishings are too heavy to be moved around or secured to the tank in some way.A large and efficient biological filter is needed to cope with the amounts of waste produced by a fish of this size. If possible choose a sump – type arrangement, as this allows most of the equipment to be located outside the tank . A large specimen can easily destroy glass heaterstats, thermometers etc. as it charges around. Otherwise, buy the biggest filter you can afford (pond filters are worth considering) and perform regular large water changes.Water ConditionsTemperature: 73 to 82°F (23 to 28°C)pH: It's an adaptable species provided extremes are avoided. Somewhere within the range 4.8 to 7.5 is ok.Hardness: 0 to 15°HDietStomach analyses of wild specimens show it to be primarily a herbivorous species , feeding on fruits, nuts and seeds. It is an opportunist, though, and also takes insects, zooplankton and small fish. In the aquarium offer it a varied diet consisting of quality dried pellets or floating sticks, along with plenty of fruit and vegetables. Spinach, lettuce leaves, and fruit and vegetables such as apple, banana, peach, grapes, courgette, peas, cabbage and carrot all work well.Behaviour and Compatibility Top ↑Small fish will likely be eaten but in general it’s quite peaceful with bigger species . It can bother sedentary or shy companions with its constant activity, though. Obviously a truly enormous tank is needed to incorporate it into a community . If this kind of space is available suitable tankmates include Arowana, other similarly-sized characins, big cichlids, and large catfish from the Pimelodid, Doradid and Loricariid groups.It’s a shoaling species when juvenile , becoming more solitary as it matures. It can be kept in a group in the aquarium , but again, this is largely dependant on the amount of space available. In smaller quarters adults can become a bit of a nuisance, chasing and nipping the fins of both its own kind and other species .Sexual DimorphismMature females are a little rounder-bellied than males.ReproductionNot achieved in the hobby, although it’s being bred in some numbers for food in both South America and various Far Eastern countries. The fish are often induced to spawn via the use of hormones.Notes Top ↑Know as the pirapitinga in its native countries, this is the one of the largest species of scaled fish found in the Amazon basin . This alone should tell you much of what you need to know about its suitability as an aquarium inhabitant. In reality it’s debatable as to whether the species should be considered an aquarium subject at all. While pacu rarely reach their maximum size in captivity, they’re still easily capable of growing to a couple of feet in length. The myth that fish will only grow to match the size of the tank they’re kept in is just that – a myth.Unfortunately it’s regularly offered for sale as a cute 2-3″ fish, often labeled with enticing names such as “vegetarian piranha” or even “red-bellied piranha” (pacu are included in the same subfamily as piranha and resemble them superficially). Juveniles of P. brachypomus are in fact patterned to mimic the real red-bellied piranha, Pygocentrus nattereri as a deterrent to potential predators.As a result many public aquaria have large displays of adult specimens that have been “donated” by fishkeepers, often to the extent where they refuse to accept any more. A more depressing, but equally common scenario is that the fish are dumped into rivers and ponds when they outgrow their tank . In colder climates they will obviously not survive, but populations exist in various states of the USA and several other countries as a result of releases by irresponsible aquarists. The species has subsequently been banned from sale by many wildlife authorities in the US.Pacu have developed amazing dentition to allow them to crush fruit, nuts and seeds. Their teeth are cusped and resemble human molars, and they also have very powerful jaws. Although they are rarely aggressive they can inflict a really nasty bite, so take care when performing tank maintenance.The species is widely used in aquaculture projects in South America. It’s ideally suited for the purpose, being tolerant of a wide range of water chemistry and possessing the ability to survive in oxygen-depleted conditions. Much research is being undertaken to find the most ecologically sound way of farming it, as it’s suffering from gross overfishing in many of its native waters. If wild stocks become further depleted, there could be serious implications not only for the species itself, but also entire ecosystems. The seeds of many of the fruits eaten by pacu are indigestible, and are excreted intact. Some experts believe the fish play a significant role in seed dispersal of plants from areas of flooded forest. Sustainable commercial farming of pacu is therefore considered a priority. Not only will this prevent further depletion of wild stocks, but it will provide an alternative source of income for farmers. The hope is that it may also encourage them to take up aquaculture instead of agriculture, which is having a devastating effect on many parts of the Amazon rainforest.As a food fish pacu is apparently very tasty. Its natural diet of fruit and nuts is said to enhance the flavour of the flesh. As the fish is so large cuts are often sold on the bone in a similar way to pork ribs. One further commercial use of the species is as a sport fish , both in its natural environment and artificially-stocked lakes. It’s been introduced into several Far Eastern countries for this purpose, including Thailand and Malaysia.No Responses to “Piaractus brachypomus (Red-bellied Pacu)”Leave a Reply

Will it be pre-empted by action of the DEA? June 28, 2016""Hey guys, soon we won't be raiding pot clinics!""Drug Enforcement Agents from the DEA conducting a raid in Los Angeles. The Federal Government will make Marijuana a Schedule Two drug on August 1, 2016, effectively legalizing weed throughout the US.The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration will reclassify marijuana as a ""Schedule Two"" drug on August 1, 2016, essentially legalizing medicinal cannabis in all 50 states with a doctor's prescription, said a DEA lawyer with knowledge of the matter.Update 6/28: The Recreational Marijuana Initiative qualifies for the California's November Ballot. Will it be pre-empted by action of the DEA?http://www.smobserved.com/story/2016/07/04/news/dea-source-confirms-schedule-ii-medical-marijuana-is-in-the-works/1562.htmlThe DEA Lawyer had told the lawyer representing a DEA informant of the DEA's plan to legalize medicinal cannibis nationwide on August 1, 2016. When questioned by our reporter, the DEA lawyer felt compelled to admit the truth to him as well.""Whatever the law may be in California, Arizona or Utah or any other State, because of Federal preemption this will have the effect of making THC products legal with a prescription, in all 50 states,"" the DEA attorney told the Observer. Federal Preemption is a legal doctrine that where the US Government regulates a particular field, State and local laws are overridden and of no effect.He explained that ""there are five DEA schedules. Nothing on Schedule One is ever legal, and that is where Cannabis is today. Schedule Two drugs are available with a prescription.""On Schedule Two, marijuana will join drugs like Percocet, Aderall, Oxycontin, Hydrocodone and other drugs that are legal, even common, with a prescription. There are also other drugs that are not on any schedules but that are illegal on a federal level, he said. Drugs like aspirin and ibuprofen are available over-the-counter.He opined that the 135 medicinal cannabis clinic owners in Los Angeles will no doubt oppose this move by the Federal government, because the rule change will eliminate any reason for people to visit medical marijuana clinics. But they needn't worry. ""In my opinion, CVS pharmacy, Rite-Aid and Walgreens will sell Schedule Two THC products similar to what users call ""edibles,"" but will not sell smokable weed because of the health risk smoking anything entails,"" said the DEA lawyer.The Los Angeles based DEA Attorney who spoke to us, asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to the press about the matter. He speculated that this action will be taken in the closing days of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, so as to motivate the Democratic base to turn out and vote for Hillary Clinton, and other down ballot candidates. She will certainly not reverse this policy decision taken in the waning days of the Barack Obama administration, he said. But Donald Trump might.""Marijuana enforcement is a big drain on DEA resources,"" he said was another reason for the change, noting that 75% of the American public favor the legalization of marijuana for medical use.Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson is in favor of legalizing marijuana and in fact owns a business which peddles pot in New Mexico.California will vote on November 7th, 2016, whether to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. Because of Federal preemption, the DEA's reclassification of cannabis as a Schedule Two drug, will have the legal effect of requiring a prescription in California--i.e., it will continue the status quo.Since the Golden State legalized medical marijuana almost 20 years ago, Federal authorities have occasionally raided medical marijuana clinics here. They have forced major banks, like Bank of America, to close clinic bank accounts. The Feds have even seized real estate belonging to landlords who rent space to pot clinics. The Federal war on medicinal marijuana will abruptly end on August 1, 2016.UPDATE 6/19 9 a.m. PDT: The Denver Post is now reporting that the DEA could reclassify Marijuana as a Schedule II drug, as early as July 1, 2016. https://www.denverpost.com/2016/06/17/how-the-dea-should-classify-marijuana/UPDATE 6/22: The DEA wants to remove the barriers to cannabis research, a spokesman told aNewDomain in a lengthy interview. http://anewdomain.net/2016/06/21/on-cannabis-rescheduling-questions-the-dea-responds-exclusive/8/01 is the new 4/20!Medical cannabis, or medical marijuana, can refer to the use of cannabis and its cannabinoids to treat disease or improve symptoms; However, there is no single agreed upon definition, says Wikipedia. The use of cannabis as a medicine has not been rigorously scientifically tested, often due to production restrictions and other governmental regulations. There is limited evidence suggesting cannabis can be used to reduce nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy, to improve appetite in people with HIV/AIDS, and to treat chronic pain and muscle spasms. Its use for other medical applications, however, is insufficient for conclusions about safety or effects.In California, there are ""weed doctors"" who will write a prescription for cannabis to anyone claiming to suffer from anxiety, which means they passout prescriptions for pot like chocolate bars at a Halloween party. As with so many other trends that started in California, expect to see medicinal marijuana sold in your town soon!Medical cannabis can be administered using a variety of methods, including liquid tinctures, vaporizing or smoking dried buds, eating cannabis edibles, taking capsules, using lozenges, dermal patches or oral/dermal sprays. Synthetic cannabinoids are available as prescription drugs in some countries; examples include: dronabinol and nabilone.Recreational use of cannabis is illegal in most parts of the world, but the medical use of cannabis is legal in certain countries, including Austria, Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands (where it is also legal recreationally), Portugal and Spain.In the United States, federal law outlaws all cannabis use, while 25 states and the District of Columbia no longer prosecute individuals for the possession or sale of medical marijuana, as long as the individuals are in compliance with the state's medical marijuana sale regulations.The DEA lawyer gave us his legal opinion that if you happen to live where recreational marijuana is now legal, i.e. Colorado or Washington State; after August 1, you will need a prescription, as you would need throughout the U.S.However, an appeals court ruled in January 2014 that a 2007 Ninth Circuit ruling remains binding in relation to the ongoing illegality, in federal legislative terms, of Californian cannabis dispensaries, reaffirming the impact of the federal Controlled Substances Act.The Federal Government will make Marijuana a Schedule Two drug on August 1, 2016, effectively legalizing weed throughout the US. You may be able to buy pot at Rite Aid in Santa Monica by the end of the year.As explained above, moving marijuana from Schedule One to Schedule Two, would have the effect of legalizing medicinal marijuana, throughout all 50 States, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories. This action may be taken by the DEA unilaterally--i.e., without specific Congressional authorization -- because Congress has previously granted the DEA rule-making authority over what drugs are on which schedules.The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is a United States federal law enforcement agency under the U.S. Department of Justice, tasked with combating drug smuggling and use within the United States. Not only is the DEA the lead agency for domestic enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act, sharing concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), it also has sole responsibility for coordinating and pursuing U.S. drug investigations abroad.Update: DEA Source Confirms Story, 7/04/2016. http://www.smobserved.com/story/2016/07/04/news/dea-source-confirms-that-schedule-ii-marijuana-is-in-the-works/1562.htmlYou might be interested in:"

This is certain.Read our great constitution.In it, it states:— That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. —We can overturn the status quo, and create a country that offers hope rather than hate.
https://www.snopes.com/joakim-noah-west-point/	Joakim Noah Gives U.S. Soldiers the Finger, Refuses to Eat With Them?	mixture	['joakim noah', ' military', ' new york knicks', ' west point']	https://archive.is/	https://archive.is/ZWPs1	2017/05/09	NY NBA Star Gives US Soldiers The FINGER, Refuses To Eat With Them While Training At Military Camp1.2KSharesxSponsored by RevcontentWhat kind of asshat does this? Joakim Noah was training at West Point and then refused to eat with the rest of the New York Knicks with the cadets because he’s anti-war. Really? That’s about as rude as it gets. Those cadets are not the ones instigating war and if war comes, they will willingly serve to protect our country. You know, the one that makes it possible for this moron to earn $72 million over the next four years. What a jerk.I’m really getting sick to death of all these athletes taking their supposed political stances against the heroes of our country. These teams could step in and put a stop to this. Noah had the full support of his coach when he pulled this stunt. All of them are going to wind up getting boycotted and it serves them right. Saying that he “absolutely” understood Noah’s point of view, Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek explained:“Jo’s done, in all his stuff that he does against gun violence and all that, he just didn’t feel comfortable, so that’s plenty fine with us.”Do tell. Well, then the Knicks shouldn’t mind if their fans and the rest of America take a hike and take their money with them.From the New York Daily News:Joakim Noah violated one of the basic rules of guest etiquette this week by boycotting a team dinner with West Point cadets that featured a speech from a retired Army Colonel.As we all know, it’s never polite to insult your host.Noah is anti-war, which is great. Most right minded adults oppose war and that would include the young men and women at the U.S. Military Academy. You can still be a conscientious objector while earning $72 million over the next four years and still spend quality time with the people who are dedicated to serving and protecting the country.This could not have gone over well at the NBA league office where almost one year ago to the day Adam Silver announced that Gen. Martin Dempsey, the recently retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was appointed as a special adviser to the NBA Commissioner.For the last several years, Knicks players — who hold their training camp at West Point — have traditionally dined with cadets, listening to speeches from military officers and signing autographs. If you are in someone’s house, you honor them. Someone might want to tell this Noah idiot that.It figures this guy is a big fan of Barack Obama. Why am I not surprised? Noah’s stance has not prevented him from spending time with President Obama. In 2011, during Obama’s re-election campaign, Noah even joined several of his fellow NBA players at a fundraiser for the incumbent president. So, he’s a Marxist as well as anti-war. He’s the whole liberal package.Noah also applauded his fellow athletes who “are taking a stand,” saying that “this country’s out of control” and “there are things that need to be fixed.” Here’s a thought… if he can’t honor those at West Point, he should take his sorry ass and leave. He won’t be missed and at least one thing will be ‘fixed’.Sponsored by RevcontentTrending Today

In The NetherlandsDEA / L. ROMANO / Contributor / Getty ImagesJanuary 15, 2018    viewsThe mainstream media in the Netherlands reported last week that ""Noah"" was the most popular baby name for boys in the small European nation.""Noah and Emma were the most popular children's names in the past year,"" reported Nos.nl. ""This is evident from the annual list of names of the Social Insurance Bank, which pays out the child benefit. Boys were named Noah 635 times, while 755 girls went through life as Emma since last year."" The year before, ""Daan"" and ""Anna"" were the most popular names, the site said.But a journalist at Powned.tv did a little research on the report and found something completely different. Checking for ""Mohammed"" — and all its alternative spellings — the writer found that 636 babies had been given that name last year.""Mohammed (221 times) and all possible conjugations like Mohamed (211 times), Muhammed (110 times), Mohammad (51 times), Muhammad (43 times), Mohamad (unknown), Muhamed (unknown), Muhammet (not known), Mouhamed (not known), Muhamad (not known), Mahamuud (not known),"" wrote the reporter.The 636 variants of the name put it one ahead of ""Noah."" That makes ""Mohammed"" and its alternate spellings the most popular name in the Netherlands for the second straight year. In 2016, ""724 boys received the name (or one of the conjugations) from their parents,"" the site reported.And then there was this:""By the way, how do you think about the statistics in Great Britain and Wales? The British claim that Oliver is the name given most to newborn boys . In reality, this is ... Right, Mohammed or one of his conjugations,"" the reporter wrote, citing this article .The UK’s national statistics office recently released the latest data on baby names in England and Wales. It says the following: “Oliver remains as the most popular first name given to baby boys in England and Wales in 2016.” But that’s not really true. In fact, the most common name by far is Muhammad.So apparently you can't trust the mainstream media in the Netherlands, either.By Amanda PrestigiacomoWhat's Your Reaction?This page is forcing your browser to use legacy mode, which is not compatible with Disqus.

You may opt out at anytime. You also agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .The state’s health education glossary  defines gender as “A social construct based on emotional, behavioral, and cultural characteristics attached to a person’s assigned biological sex.” Gender expression, meanwhile, is defined as “The way someone outwardly expresses their gender.”These definitions differ from the state’s definition of “biological sex”: “Based on chromosomes, hormones, and internal and external anatomy.”Nathan Olson, a communications manager for the statewide Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI), told The Daily Caller that the glossary “was developed to support classroom instruction.” The new standards were finalized in March but OSPI has yet to issue a press release  informing the public of the changes.As part of an aspect of sexual health titled “Healthy Relationships,” kindergarteners will learn to distinguish between “safe and unwanted touch.” They will also learn to “Recognize people have the right to refuse giving or receiving unwanted touch.” OSPI did not answer a question from TheDC about whether this lesson plan amounts to teaching consent to kindergarteners.By third grade, students will be expected to “Explain that gender roles can vary considerably” and “Understand [the] importance of treating others with respect regarding gender identity,” as part of the “Self-Identity” component of sexual health.Gender identity is defined by the state as “Someone’s inner sense of their gender.”“The standards don’t define ‘gender spectrum.’ But self-identity is a key component,” Olson said when TheDC asked whether learning that gender is a “spectrum” is considered part of learning about “gender identity.” Last month, Fox News’ Todd Starnes described a Virginia county’s lesson plans on gender spectrum as “the idea that there’s no such thing as 100 percent boys or 100 percent girls.”That lesson plan– which was met with outrage from parents –was designed for middle and high school students.By fourth grade, Washington students will learn to “Identify how friends and family can influence ideas regarding gender roles, identity, and expression” and define sexual orientation. The state defines “gender roles” as “Social expectations about how people should act, think, or feel based on their assigned biological sex.”In fifth grade, students will learn to “Describe how media, society, and culture can influence ideas regarding gender roles, identity, and expression.” Under the guidance of school employees, fifth graders will also “Identify trusted adults to ask questions about gender identity and sexual orientation.” It’s not clear if parents are automatically considered “trusted adults.”By the end of elementary school (typically around age 11 or 12), students will be expected to “Understand the range of gender roles, identity, and expression across cultures.”In seventh grade, students will learn to “Distinguish between biological sex, gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation.” By eighth grade, students will be expected to “Recognize external influences that shape attitudes about gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation.”This education continues through high school where students will “Evaluate how culture, media, society, and other people influence our perceptions of gender roles, sexuality, relationships, and sexual orientation.”OSPI denied that the state intends to force a set of beliefs upon its students.“Standards help students become familiar with concepts that education experts feel are essential for all students to know,” Olson said. “Standards are not used to impose belief systems.”In response to a question from TheDC about whether a student who rejects the idea that “gender identity” is distinct from “biological sex” could end up failing a course on account of their beliefs, Olson said: “That would be handled at the district/school level.”He later admitted that “we don’t exactly know what a school would do if a student failed to complete an assignment because he/she opposed the materials being taught.”Olson said that the decision to implement specific “learning outcomes” lies with individual districts. Districts can craft their own curriculums, he said, as long as they “align with state learning standards.”The full health and fitness standards can be read here .Follow Peter Hasson on Twitter @PeterJHasson

The bill would require the committee to report to the Legislature on its activities at the close of each legislative session. The bill would require the committee, by November 30, 2020, to develop a plan to implement the framework by January 1, 2024, and to identify and propose comprehensive tax reform solutions to increase revenue predictability and ensure sufficiency of revenues adequate to support the implementation of the framework, as specified.This bill would make the provisions relating to the committee inoperative on November 30, 2024, and would repeal them as of January 1, 2025.Digest KeyVote: MAJORITY   Appropriation: NO   Fiscal Committee: NO   Local Program: NO  Bill TextThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:SECTION 1. Chapter 12.88 (commencing with Section 18987.80) is added to Part 6 of Division 9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, to read:CHAPTER         12.88. Committee on Children and Youth18987.80. The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:(a) California has the sixth largest economy in the world and leads the country in innovation and diversity, and yet California’s children rank 47th in terms of their economic well-being.(b) Accessible child care, early learning, quality educational and job training opportunities, comprehensive health care, and well-supported families are necessary to ensure the productive potential of all Californians, yet there has been no comprehensive effort to ensure that California’s children and youth have access to those necessities and opportunities.(c) California’s tax structure         was designed during the Great Depression and is outdated, unfair, and unreliable, with newer economic sectors escaping tax obligations.(d) According to the Legislative Analyst’s Office, the total value of taxable sales has grown more slowly than the economy, necessitating higher sales tax rates to generate comparable revenue.(e) The increasing volatility of the state’s economy, and the stock market, has translated into greater unpredictability of state tax revenue, presenting challenges for budget forecasts.(f) According to the California State Library, the Legislature considered 4,600 tax proposals in the past two decades, the vast majority of which were directed at a single tax or group of taxpayers rather than to achieve comprehensive reform, demonstrating that fiscal necessity, rather than overarching policy         considerations, has prompted most recent major tax changes.(g) It is necessary to increase revenue predictability and to ensure sufficiency of revenues adequate to meet the needs of California’s children and youth.18987.81. (a) The Joint Legislative Committee on Children and Youth is hereby created.(b) The committee shall be composed of a total of 18 members, as follows:(1) Nine Members of the Senate, appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules.(2) Nine Members of the Assembly, appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly.(c) The committee and its members shall have and exercise all of the rights, duties, and powers conferred upon investigating committees and their members by the Joint Rules of the Senate and the Assembly as they are adopted and amended from time to         time.(d) The committee is authorized to act only until November 30, 2024, and on that date the committee’s existence shall terminate.18987.82. (a) The Senate Committee on Rules may make money available from the Senate Operating Fund, as it deems necessary, for the expenses of the committee and its members.

""You guys are misunderstanding again. Thats not how it is.""However, after speaking to her daughters teacher, she realized the statement was accurate.The teacher said she cant. She has to say yes. She has to accept and I said, \'Excuse me, Richard tells Fox 13.Richard took her concerns to the school principal.He basically just said theyve had this dance set up this way for a long time and theyve never had any concern before, she said of his response.Lane Findlay with the Weber School District confirms its a rule, but he said its meant to teach students how to be inclusive.Please be respectful, be polite,"" Findlay said. ""We want to promote kindness, and so we want you to say yes when someone asks you to dance.""I do see it from their perspective when it comes to that, but there are many other ways to teach children how to be accepting than with a social dance, Richard counters.Richard says forcing students not to say no teaches them the wrong lesson.Sends a bad message to girls that girls have to say \'yes\'; sends a bad message to boys that girls cant say \'no,\'"" Richard said.Prior to the dance, which is voluntary, students are told to fill out a card by selecting five people they want to dance with. The administration says if theres someone on the card you feel uncomfortable with, the student is encouraged to speak up.If there is an issue, if theres students that are uncomfortable or have a problem with another student, I mean: thats certainly something that can be addressed with that student and parents, Findlay said.However, Richard says rejection is part of life and at the end of the day, this policy is sending impressionable children the wrong message.Psychologically, my daughter keeps coming to me and saying I cant say \'no\' to a boy,"" she said. ""Thats the message kids are getting.""One of the concerns that Richard addressed with the principal at Kanesville Elementary is that parents werent aware of this policy. She recommended he send out a permission slip, detailing the instructions given to students, and he agreed. As of now, the rule remains in place.41.208160-112.062004'"
https://www.snopes.com/harriet-tubman-gun-republican/	Harriet Tubman: Gun-Toting Republican	false	['harriet tubman', ' history']	http://www.pbs.org/	http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p1535.html	2016/04/22	"Resource Bank ContentsHarriet Tubman is perhaps the most well-known of all the Underground Railroad's ""conductors."" During a ten-year span she made 19 trips into the South and escorted over 300 slaves to freedom. And, as she once proudly pointed out to Frederick Douglass, in all of her journeys she ""never lost a single passenger.""Tubman was born a slave in Maryland's Dorchester County around 1820. At age five or six, she began to work as a house servant. Seven years later she was sent to work in the fields. While she was still in her early teens, she suffered an injury that would follow her for the rest of her life. Always ready to stand up for someone else, Tubman blocked a doorway to protect another field hand from an angry overseer. The overseer picked up and threw a two-pound weight at the field hand. It fell short, striking Tubman on the head. She never fully recovered from the blow, which subjected her to spells in which she would fall into a deep sleep.Around 1844 she married a free black named John Tubman and took his last name. (She was born Araminta Ross; she later changed her first name to Harriet, after her mother.) In 1849, in fear that she, along with the other slaves on the plantation, was to be sold, Tubman resolved to run away. She set out one night on foot. With some assistance from a friendly white woman, Tubman was on her way. She followed the North Star by night, making her way to Pennsylvania and soon after to Philadelphia, where she found work and saved her money. The following year she returned to Maryland and escorted her sister and her sister's two children to freedom. She made the dangerous trip back to the South soon after to rescue her brother and two other men. On her third return, she went after her husband, only to find he had taken another wife. Undeterred, she found other slaves seeking freedom and escorted them to the North.Tubman returned to the South again and again. She devised clever techniques that helped make her ""forays"" successful, including using the master's horse and buggy for the first leg of the journey; leaving on a Saturday night, since runaway notices couldn't be placed in newspapers until Monday morning; turning about and heading south if she encountered possible slave hunters; and carrying a drug to use on a baby if its crying might put the fugitives in danger. Tubman even carried a gun which she used to threaten the fugitives if they became too tired or decided to turn back, telling them, ""You'll be free or die.""By 1856, Tubman's capture would have brought a $40,000 reward from the South. On one occasion, she overheard some men reading her wanted poster, which stated that she was illiterate. She promptly pulled out a book and feigned reading it. The ploy was enough to fool the men.Tubman had made the perilous trip to slave country 19 times by 1860, including one especially challenging journey in which she rescued her 70-year-old parents. Of the famed heroine, who became known as ""Moses,"" Frederick Douglass said, ""Excepting John Brown -- of sacred memory -- I know of no one who has willingly encountered more perils and hardships to serve our enslaved people than [Harriet Tubman].""And John Brown, who conferred with ""General Tubman"" about his plans to raid Harpers Ferry, once said that she was ""one of the bravest persons on this continent.""Becoming friends with the leading abolitionists of the day, Tubman took part in antislavery meetings. On the way to such a meeting in Boston in 1860, in an incident in Troy, New York, she helped a fugitive slave who had been captured.During the Civil War Harriet Tubman worked for the Union as a cook, a nurse, and even a spy. After the war she settled in Auburn, New York, where she would spend the rest of her long life. She died in 1913.Image Credit: Moorland-Spingarn Research Center"
https://www.snopes.com/the-amish-dont-get-autism/	The Amish Don’t Get Autism?	false	['amish', ' anti-vaccine', ' autism', ' vaccines']	http://blogs.plos.org/	http://blogs.plos.org/thepanicvirus/2011/06/28/anecdotal-amish-dont-vaccinate-claims-disproved-by-fact-based-study/	2016/10/28	Posted June 28, 2011 by Seth Mnookin in Autism , Public health , VaccinesThe various vaccine manufactroversies that have spread in the wake of the Andrew Wakefield’s bogus claims that the measles component of the MMR vaccine might be linked to autism are too numerous to unpack in one brief blog post. One of the most persistent has been the Amish fallacy: Most Amish don’t vaccinate; there’s almost no record of autism in Amish communities; ergo, vaccines cause autism. (This argument has also been used, time and time and time again, to illustrate the efficacy of a proposed vaccinated-versus-unvaccinated study.)Not surprisingly, no part of the Amish fallacy — which has been kicking around for over a decade and gained new prominence and attention with this, purely anecdotal 2005 dispatch * — is true. Over the years, Ken Reibel at Autism News Beat has documented the problems with the Amish report , although the myth still persists.Yesterday, Reuters Health reported on a recent study in Pediatrics titled “ Underimmunization in Ohio’s Amish: Parental Fears Are a Greater Obstacle Than Access to Care .” The study found that majority of Amish parents do, in fact, vaccinate their children…and among the minority that don’t, the most common reasons cited were the same anti-vaccine fueled fears that have infected people around the country.Unlike the theories propagated by anti-vaccine activists, this study was definitely not anecdotal: It was based on surveys sent to hundreds of families in Holmes County, which has a large number of Amish families. As Reuters reports, “Of 359 households that responded to the survey, 85 percent said that at  least some of their children had received at least one vaccine. Forty-nine families refused all vaccines for their children, mostly  because they worried the vaccines could cause harm and were not worth  the risk.”The study’s conclusions summarize the issue quite succinctly:The reasons that Amish parents resist  immunizations mirror reasons that non-Amish parents resist  immunizations. Even in America’s                         closed religious communities, the major barrier  to vaccination is concern over adverse effects of vaccinations. If 85%  of                         Amish parents surveyed accept some  immunizations, they are a dynamic group that may be influenced to accept  preventative care.                         Underimmunization in the Amish population must  be approached with emphasis on changing parental perceptions of vaccines  in                         addition to ensuring access to vaccines.It’ll be interesting to see how this plays out in the days to come…and what objections will be raised to invalidate this latest piece of evidence.* Correction: In the first iteration of this post, I attributed the Amish-don’t-vaccinate myth to the 2005 UPI dispatch linked to above; as was pointed out in the comments, it has been kicking around since at least 2000.Post navigation

https://www.snopes.com/photographs-show-dozens-dead-dogs-kuwait/	Bomb-Sniffing Dogs Killed in Kuwait?	mixture	['kuwait']	https://sofrep.com/	https://sofrep.com/57282/dead-working-dogs-piled-like-trash-contract-terminated-kuwait/	2017/08/22	By Desiree Huitt 06.23.2016 #Featured Email Share TweetThere are no happy stories of handlers being reunited with their working dogs in this article.Instead, there are only the deaths of at least 24 to 40 working dogs and the possibility of 90 additional dogs.  Eastern Securities or E Sec  was awarded a contract with Kuwait National Petroleum Company (KNPC) to provide explosive detection dogs for their oil rigs. When KNPC canceled the contract with Eastern Securities, they were left with 140+ dogs that no longer had a job and were costing them money to feed and house them. Instead of being responsible with the working dogs and finding them homes, Eastern Securities chose the most cost-effective way of dealing with the unemployed working dogs, euthanasia. It is unknown at this time exactly how the dogs were killed or even if the remaining 90 are still alive.Little to nothing can be done legally, the only thing that can come from this is a warning to companies that supply working dogs to security companies like Eastern Securities. Like many overseas security contractors, Eastern Securities purchased the trained dogs from a US company called  USK9 Unlimited, Inc .According to Mike Ritland, former Navy SEAL and owner of  Trikos International ,“The US is a major supplier of working dogs due to superior K9 training and quality of dogs found in the US. Once the dogs are sold, their fate is up to their new owners. That is why it is very important to check where and who the dogs will end up with. I have denied several dog requests from celebrities, security companies, and foreign governments in the past because I know that I cannot guarantee that the animals welfare and best interest are in mind.”In the featured image, you can see emaciated dogs. Mike Ritland, said,“It is not uncommon to have lean working dogs especially in a hot climate, but some of the dogs appear to be a little too lean. This does not happen overnight and could show further evidence of maltreatment and stressful living conditions.”USK9 Unlimited, Inc., released a statement on Facebook :“As President and CEO of USK9, due to many questions and statements regarding a Facebook post showing the massacre of dogs over in Kuwait, (a post shared on my personal Facebook page by a friend over in Kuwait), I felt obligated to post on behalf of USK9 in an effort to clear up any misunderstandings. Let me first state USK9 HAD NO PART OF SUCH AN INHUMANE ACT, if this alleged incident is in fact true, and has NOT done any business with nor been affiliated with this company “Eastern Security” for several years now.The original post shared on my timeline and some subsequent postings thereafter allege that someone intentionally killed multiple dogs and further blame “Eastern Security” (a security company operated in the country of Kuwait). According to these posts (and others) the alleged dog massacre occurred after “Eastern Security” allegedly loss a contract for security service in that country. Although I/we (USK9) have not made any such accusation(s), if these accusation(s) are proved to be true and accurate, USK9’s position shall be one of absolute condemnation of such a gross and vile act against defenseless animals. At USK9, we are true animal lovers and have always believed and treated each and every dog as “man’s best friend”. To see these type pictures simply makes all of us here sick to our stomachs.For the record, many years ago a successful and respected local business man (name withheld) here in Lafayette, La. reached out to USK9 with the prospect of he and his brother (“Bill Baisey residing in Kuwait”) starting a K9 security company to service the large refineries in Kuwait, using explosive detection dogs. Subsequently, USK9 entered into a contractual agreement with “Eastern Security” to sell trained explosive detector dogs and to help set up and train K9 teams for the “Kuwait Project”. In 2008, dogs were procured and trained by USK9 and sold to “Eastern Security”. Handlers employed by “Eastern Security” were sent here to Kaplan Louisiana (USK9) for certification for the “Project Kuwait”. The handlers for the “Kuwait Project” graduated in 2009. After a very long process, the Kuwait Project was completed and “Eastern Security” began operating as a stand-alone security company providing a K9 based security service to one or more oil refineries in Kuwait.USK9 ended up terminating the contract with “Eastern Security” shortly after it was up and running in Kuwait, due to what USK9 believed to be a breach of contract by “Eastern Security” on many issues to include but not limited to failing to make payments owed to USK9 for services rendered and other issues of conflict where one or more Kennel Master(s) and handler(s) that were employed by “Eastern Security”, began to raise questions about working hours, unfair wages, housing accommodations, delayed payroll issues etc.. USK9 was NOT aware of any abuse of animals during this time, otherwise would have reported such.USK9 has not had any dealings with or dog sales to “Eastern Security” in a few years now, ever since USK9 decided to terminate the contract and sever all ties with “Eastern Security”, which in light of this most recent alleged event, if true, will prove to have been a very wise decision. USK9 will monitor the developments of these allegations and will defend itself vigorously on anyone attempting to defame our impeccable reputation as a world leader in K9 training solutions.Respectfully,President/CEOUSK9 Unlimited, Inc.”SOFREP reached out to both Eastern Securities and USK9 Unlimited, Inc. but neither have responded yet. There has been a Facebook page created regarding this incident as the organizers of the page are trying to find vet care and homes for the 90 remaining dogs. Eastern Securities has not responded to their requests and inquiries of the remaining dogs as well.The Facebook page dedicated to helping the dogs also released a statement from a person who claimed to have worked for E Sec. In their statement they allege that not only does E Sec treat the dogs poorly but also might be involved in human trafficking:This is my story: I worked for this company for about 5 months in 2014 as an assistant program manager. Eastern Securities, a Kuwaiti contract company with an American owner, has killed the dogs left in their kennel upon losing the contract they had with the Kuwait National Petroleum Company. I can not get exact numbers, but the only witness that has exposed this says about 40 dogs. The owner of the company is Bill Baisey and his Program Manager is Tony Touchet . Both were aware of the murders of the dogs. The K9s were contract working dogs trained by a US company to do explosive detection at the oil drilling sites in Kuwait. The witness of this massacre is scared to come forward due to fear of being arrested in Kuwait. You see, in addition to killing these dogs, I believe Eastern Securities was also involved with human trafficking. I started to see the evidence of this when I worked there. In fact, Bill Baisey has been under investigation with his other company, Najlaa, and also with KBR for human trafficking charges. While I worked in Kuwait, many of the ES employees were not allowed to return to their home countries. Some had been away for many years. The company took their passports, held the sponsorships to their visas, and refused to let them go. If an employee went to the embassy, the company would lay a false charge or claim against them to get them arrested or “blacklisted”. Some handlers’ passports expired and they actually were thrown into a Kuwaiti jail for illegally being in the country when they finally got their passports back and tried to go home. While what happened to these dogs is sick and disgusting and inexcusable, what goes on in Kuwait regarding human trafficking is far worse. The public must understand that the employees who can testify for these dogs are all scared to death of their own fates at this moment. I started to pry into this issue while I was working there, but soon myself and the female office manager were being spied on. We were told that charges would be laid against us for bogus issues such as “having male visitors in our home” which is illegal and highly punishable for women in Kuwait. I left suddenly and quietly before I could be implicated or blacklisted or arrested. I stayed in touch with the handlers, and advised them as I could. Some have told me that a lawyer is working on this case for them. I am not sure what else can be done… As both Tony and Bill hold US passports, I would like to believe there is something the US government can do, but I am not sure what or who to contact. However, please believe… The story about the deaths of these CWD’s is true. This is the dirty, grungy side of animals for business. Even the “good” companies eventually have to sell their dogs to someone when their contracts are over, and then low-bidding companies like ES end up with the final say in their fate.Eastern Securities wants this issue to die, however, by sharing this article hopefully they will not win anymore contracts nor will companies be willing to sell them dogs.Image courtesy of Kuwait TimesIf you liked this article, tell someone about itAbout the AuthorDesiree Huitt Desiree Huitt is an Army Veteran serving 11 years as a Military Intelligence officer and prior to OCS as a combat medic.

https://www.snopes.com/the-coming-ice-age/	Did a 1977 ‘Time’ Story Offer Tips on ‘How to Survive the Coming Ice Age’?	false	['climate change', ' global cooling', ' time']	http://archive.is/	http://archive.is/ZK49j	2017/05/18	"Posted by Matt Dempsey Matt_Dempsey@epw.senate.govIn Case You Missed It... The Daily CallerSenators spar during hearing over alleged 1970s global cooling consensusBy Amanda CareyLink to Article Senate Environment and Public Works Committee members sparred Wednesday over whether there existed a consensus in the 1970s that the earth was cooling.During the hearing, Republican Sens. James Inhofe of Oklahoma and John Barrasso of Wyoming questioned the supposed need to enact policies to combat global warming by pointing to similar predictions in the 1970s of a global cooling phenomenon.The exchange started with Barrasso addressing the committee's witness, Environmental Protection Agency Director Lisa Jackson.""Forty years ago, the same scientists that are predicting the end of the world now from global warming were predicting the end of the world from global cooling,"" said Barrasso. ""So if we had committed the same amount of taxpayer resources and government manpower that the administration now wants us to commit to prevent global warming - if we'd done that prevent global cooling, we wouldn't be the most prosperous nation on earth.""He continued: ""The fact is that the same doomsday predictions we were getting 40 years is the exact same thing this agency and this administration today. Only now...the problem is man-made global warming.""Shortly thereafter, Democratic Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado responded to Barrasso by citing an article which he said proved the ""supposed global cooling consensus among scientists in the 1970s is a myth.""""Would you put that in the record then,"" committee chair Sen. Barbara Boxer of California eagerly interrupted.Still later, Inhofe got into the science debate by citing a 1971 study by Dr. John Holdren, who just so happens to be President Obama's advisor on science technology. In that study Holdren wrote, ""The effects of a new ice age on agriculture and the supportability of large human populations scarcely need elaboration here."" Holdren went on to write that the effects could ""generate a tidal wave of proportions unprecedented in recorded history.""A visibly satisfied Inhofe then turned to Boxer, and stated, ""So even the president's people are agreed with me, Madam Chairwoman!""###"

The lady pictured with her ""burnt"" ear in a bandage (Nora Kirkpatrick, an actress) was pictured using her phone next to the same ear. Her hair and clothes were totally unmarked.4.

She did it back in December, because she wanted to try it in a month where people “buy a lot of stuff”.Before becoming a sex-worker, she was an actress. But because she couldn’t find any good opportunity working as an actress, she decided to try this. But it went wrong.The woman got pregnant, and she wants to have the kid. But she doesn’t have enough money or resources to raise the chil, so she is filing for child support.“After all, this is HIS child. He has to take care of his child, even though he didn’t want to have it.”, the woman said to our reporter Gary Cockburn. She was very upset and angry, and refused to say anything else.On the other hand, the father of the child claims that “He didn’t know it was a real woman” and that he “avoids having sex with real women for this exact reason”.The case will be taken to court, as the man states that he is innocent and doesn’t want to have the child.“It was the most realistic sexual robot I had ever tried, until it wasn’t.”, said the man, disappointed.You can now write your own articles!

Upon conviction, the suspect is subject to up to 20 years in federal prison.The move passed the House with a historic unanimous vote of 435-0, skated through the Senate with another unprecedented vote of 100-0, and finally was signed into law in the very same day by President Trump.“At long last, we can all unite around our hatred for being forced to listen to sappy Christmas standards months before December 25,” a Congressional representative said. “While we may all disagree on just about every other social issue of our day, at least we can come together on this.”It’s great that our country can finally agree on something during these tumultuous times!SHARE

https://www.snopes.com/trump-sons-fundraiser/	Trump Sons Sell Access to Father for Hunting Trip Fundraiser	mixture	['donald trump', ' donald trump jr.', ' eric trump', ' hunting', ' opening day 45', ' trump sons']	https://exposingthebiggame.wordpress.com/	https://exposingthebiggame.wordpress.com/2016/12/18/hunt-with-the-trumps-for-1million/	2016/12/21	Donald Trump’s sons are looking to start the President-elect’s first full day in office with a bang. Following his inauguration, wealthy donors have the chance to go on a shooting excursion with Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump in a fundraiser, entitled ‘Opening Day’, honoring their father. For $1million, the top package offers a photo opportunity with President Trump for up to 16 people and a multi-day hunting or fishing trip with one or both of the Trump sons. Donald Trump Jr (left) and Eric Trump (right) are the stars of Opening Day, a fundraiser held in their father’s honor. Along with the event full of rich donors, Toby Keith, Alabama and other ‘surprise entertainers’ will be performing at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington DC onÂ Saturday, January 21. The attire for the fundraiser isÂ described as ‘camouflage and cufflinks… jeans, boots and hats are welcome’ and all proceeds will go to conservation charities. This isn’t the first time Donald Jr and Eric have shown their fondness for hunting, both domestically and internationally. In the past the two sons have come under fire for big-game hunting and posing with their kills, including Donald Jr smiling next a dead buffalo and in another holding up a tail of an elephant. Eric is pictured sitting on top of a water buffalo, with his hat hanging off its horn and three rifles propped up against the animal’s body. The two also have a photo that sparked outrage on social media where they proudly hold up a dead cheetah. In the past the two sons have come under fire for big-game hunting and posing with their kills. Trump turned to his children to boost support for his campaign and many political analysts think they aided to his win. Daughter Ivanka Trump played a large role in his campaign and was seen at her father’s side at conventions, rallies and debates. The 35-year-old is now the star of her own fundraiser, where a lucky bidder can have a 45 minute coffee break with the mother-of-three. The sit-down is estimated at $50,000 and once the bidder forks over the money to Eric Trump’s foundation and vetted by a background check, the two can chat about politics and life.

https://www.snopes.com/oklahoma-representative-god/	Did an Oklahoma State Representative Say Rape and Incest are the ‘Will of God’?	mtrue	['abortion', ' incest', ' oklahoma', ' rape']	http://www.patheos.com/	http://www.patheos.com/blogs/progressivesecularhumanist/2017/03/oklahoma-lawmaker-rape-incest-will-god/	2017/07/13	0 Comments{COUNT}Oklahoma State Rep. George Faught argues that rape and incest are the will of God while defending anti-abortion legislation.Tuesday the Oklahoma House approved House Bill 1549, also called the Prenatal Nondiscrimination act of 2017. The controversial legislation would prohibit abortion when the fetus is diagnosed with Down syndrome or any other birth defect.Discussing the legislation before Tuesday’s vote, Faught, the bill’s author, said when it comes to abortion, people are being allowed to play God.While discussing Faught’s legislation on the House floor Rep. Regina Goodwin asked :At what point did you decide that that’s within your ability to decide for all women in Oklahoma?Faught replied:One of the things that I campaigned on was to protect life, and I believe life begins at conception.At one point Rep. Cory Williams (D) asked Faught if rape is the “will of God.”Faught responded :Well, you know, if you read the Bible, there’s actually a couple circumstances where that happened. The Lord uses all circumstances. I mean, you can go down that path, but it’s a reality unfortunately.Williams followed up, asking if incest is the “will of God.”Faught said:Same answer. Doesn’t deal with this bill.Williams continued, asking why the bill does not include exceptions for rape and incest which are allowed in most anti-abortion legislation:You won’t make any exceptions for rape. You won’t make any exceptions for incest, and you are proffering divine intervention as a reason why you won’t do that.Williams Continued:I think it is very important (to know), do you believe rape and incest are actually the will of God?After a brief pause, Faught replied:You know it’s a great question to ask. And obviously if it happens in someone’s life, it may not be the best thing that ever happened, but — so you’re saying that God is not sovereign with every activity that happens in someone’s life and can’t use anything and everything in someone’s life and I disagree with that.Bottom line: For Rep. Faught, God is sovereign, and everything that happens is part of God’s plan – even rape and incest. Sounds like Faught’s God is a moral monster. Good thing God doesn’t exist, but it is terrifying that legislators like Faught are making laws based on their ridiculous and dangerous religious superstitions.(H/T Raw Story – Watch a video clip of the exchange between Faught and Williams below)Oklahoma State Rep.

She has allowed me to share her story. If you feel led, you can do the same<3""Hello, my name is Brianna, and this is my story.""Love is not the little things. It is not the phone calls, the dates, or even the memories. Love is knowing you would sacrifice things that you didn't even know you could sacrifice. Love is selfless.Have you ever felt your life shake ? Have you ever been hit with so much emotional turmoil to the point where everything around you becomes fuzzy and shaken? Your lungs feel tight and for a brief second you can't do anything. You are unable to move, unable to think, unable to even react. I have. I experienced something I never thought I would experience...all while nine months pregnant with my first child.Being pregnant is supposed to be one of the most amazing journeys you will ever embark on . You're creating a new life. You are experiencing unconditional love for someone you have not even met. Austin and I were so excited to meet our little boy. To bring him home. To be a family. I never imagined as I went to sleep that night, that my whole world would be shattered within hours. I still remember my mother in law waking me up that morning. ""Austin had an accident"" she said. All I knew was that my husband was in the hospital. The worst part? I didn't know why.After a two hour drive to the hospital, I learned that my husband, the father of my child, the person I am so deeply in love with, had had a brain hemorrhage. Why? The doctors concluded (after running his tox screen and ruling out drugs) that this horrible event was due to his recent excessive energy drink consumption (a habit he had built when he started working longer hours and commuting). Surgery was already in motion... and after an agonizing 5 hour wait, we got to see him. But while everyone was focused on the almost unrecognizable face hooked up to all sorts of machines and tubes, all I could see was his parents. I saw the light leave his mother's eyes as she saw her motionless son laying in that hospital bed. I saw his father break down crying as he held onto his wife. They didn't know if the life they created together would even wake up. Watching this family- my new family, who I have grown to love and be a part of, be so shattered and broken...that is the worst feeling I have ever felt.The next day was round two of brain surgery. Following this were strokes, seizures, swelling, and more things we weren't prepared for. There was a moment, sitting by his hospital bed, just praying he would be okay, that I knew I would never give up on him. No matter how messy our life would become. I was going to be by his side through all of it. After two weeks of living in a hospital, wondering if he would survive or be taken from us, we made our way back home. The time had come for me to deliver our baby.I'm not going to lie to anyone, it was so hard. I had planned on Austin being a part of this huge moment. Being by my side. Holding my hand. Being there to cut the cord. Being there to welcome our son into the world. It didn't feel right... But a beautiful miracle happened as I delivered our son. Austin woke up. I went about a week without seeing him. I thought about him every day. I cried as I looked at my child who looked just like his daddy. When the baby was only a week old, I left him with my in-laws. I knew I needed to see Austin. I needed to tell him that our baby was here. To tell him how much we needed him. Weeks went by. We chased him all over the state as more operations and procedures were ordered. I saw him every chance I got. At a little over 2 months old, our son finally met his dad. A day I wasn't sure I would ever see. That was the day that my heart gained some of its happiness back. Some time after that he could finally come home to me. Our life isn't normal. There are doctors visits and hospital trips- so many that I loose count. But we are here. Fighting. I wake up every day to take care of our beautiful little boy and my husband. I prepare the meals, do physical therapy, speech therapy, and occupational therapy. I help him with personal hygiene. I help him walk. I help him with every aspect of his life. And in between these tasks I take care of our very busy eight month old. It is hard, and I am tired, but we make the most of it. He isn't the same man I fell in love with, but I still fall further everyday, We are fighting to help him recover. To make his life better. One day we will get there. Until then, I will never give up on him. Because love is selfless, and I love him more than life itself.Photos courtesy of https://www.facebook.com/Endresphotography/"

It’s a shame that a state so well-known for social liberalism and true blue policy is also host to this kind of racism and hate.A convoy of douchebags traveling from Wrentham to Foxboro consisted of every piece of trash the area had to offer. The Massachusetts redneck is no different from anywhere else, with the exception that only a few are stupid enough to carry a confederate flag because of their “heritage.” Anticipating the ignorance that was about to happen, a recording session was planned and executed that can be used anytime you hear  Trump supporters say, “We’re not racists, we just aren’t politically correct.” Here’s what they mean by that:Subscribe to our Youtube Channel“Lynch all the f*cking n*ggers” is definitely NOT politically correct. It’s not correct in any way. None of what these imbeciles said is correct in any way.It would be nice to think that Trump supporters, once seeing and hearing how their comrades in idiocy truly behave, would have an epiphany of some sort and come to their senses. The problem is, they’re Trump supporters. They’re the ones driving those trucks.Featured image via screen captureRelated

They were shot either in head or heart in cold blood. Only very few incidents or events like this post were imitated in the movie Kingdom of Ants' though it doesn't reflect the true genocide at all. So, the incident in the post is not fake, illustrated or falsehood. The spirit is absolutely true. Every day thousand of fake, illustrated or false post are published and nobody cares at all. But here the fact is, the post has got more than 10,000 likes and share and a universal brotherhood has risen against the Israeli genocide. That's why some Israeli agents and brokers are scared of the post. They are afraid of this universal spirit and union against Israel. They are afraid that this post might create another impact like Tahrir Square or Arab revolution. That is why they are trying to divert the spirit by mentioning a movie reference.First they offered me handsome amount of money then they threatened me to remove the post. Every day I am being threatened in my cell phone, text message, mail inbox and Facebook inbox to remove the post. I will not remove it till my last breath.

While criminal investigations have increasingly included evidence from social media posts, live broadcasting a crime in progress is exceedingly rare  let alone an allegedly racially motivated attack.""I can\'t understand why anybody put anything on Facebook,"" Near North Area Commander Kevin Duffin said when asked about the video at an afternoon news conference at Chicago police headquarters.Chicago police speak to the news media about the attack of a man with special needs that was captured in a Facebook Live video and the resulting charges filed against four people suspected of the attack.

""Whether it\'s tensions between police and communities, (or) hate crimes of the despicable sort that has just now recently surfaced on Facebook.""Charged in the attack were Jordan Hill, 18, of Carpentersville; Tesfaye Cooper, 18, of Chicago; and sisters Brittany Covington, 18, and Tanishia Covington, 24, who lived in an apartment in the 3300 block of West Lexington Street where the assault allegedly took place.The four  who are all African-American  were each charged with aggravated kidnapping, hate crime, aggravated unlawful restraint and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, according to police. Hill also was charged with robbery, possession of a stolen motor vehicle and residential burglary, while both Covingtons were charged with residential burglary, police said.Police said all four have given statements admitting to their roles in the alleged attack. They\'re scheduled to appear for a bond hearing Friday at the Leighton Criminal Court Building.Late Thursday, David Boyd, who identified himself as the victim\'s brother-in-law, said in a brief statement to reporters that the family was grateful for ""all the prayers and efforts"" that led to his safe return.""He\'s doing well, as well as he could be at this time,"" Boyd said. He said ""everyone has seen the video"" but declined to comment on what he thought of it.""We appreciate all the support from everyone,"" Boyd said, adding they were focused on ""trying to stick together as a family.""Facebook Live video posted on Jan. 3, 2017, shows the verbal and physical attack of a mentally disabled man.

The victim appeared ""injured"" and ""confused"" and was wearing little clothing despite the freezing temperatures, police said.""I observed him wearing a tank top, inside-out, backwards, jean shorts and sandals on,"" Harrison District Officer Michael Donnelly said at the news conference. ""He was bloodied. He was battered. He was very discombobulated.""Police ran his name and discovered he\'d been reported missing Monday by his parents, who said he disappeared after they dropped him off at a McDonald\'s in suburban Streamwood to meet up with Hill on Saturday. Police said Hill knew the victim because they had attended the same school in Aurora.According to police, Hill had stolen a van in Streamwood before picking up the victim and passed it off as his own. He and the victim then drove to Chicago\'s West Side, visiting with friends for two days. The victim slept in the van before being brought to the Covington sisters\' apartment on West Lexington on Tuesday, police said.Hours into the visit, the victim and Hill got into a ""play fight"" that got out of hand, police said. The sisters got angry and tied the victim up, according to police.""That\'s when the attack begins,"" said Duffin, the police commander.The chilling Facebook video shows the victim crouched in a corner and mostly motionless with an expression of fear on his face. His mouth is taped shut and his hands and feet appear to be bound with orange electrical tape.Kim JanssenA depraved attack on a mentally disabled white teen broadcast live on Facebook allegedly by four black Chicago-area residents became a national rallying cry Thursday for conservative pundits who tried to pin the blame for the attack  without evidence  on the Black Lives Matter movement.

Shown... (Kim Janssen)The 28-minute video is recorded by and focuses mostly on the face of Brittany Covington, who smokes what appears to be a blunt  a cigar emptied and stuffed with marijuana  while narrating some of the action. Liquor bottles appear to be sitting on a windowsill of the sparsely decorated apartment, along with a crumpled bag of chips.As the group laughs and music plays in the background, Covington pans from her face to the victim and back. The two men can be seen cutting the victim\'s shirt with knives, then taking turns punching him and kicking his head. One of the men cuts the victim\'s hair and scalp with a knife, and the victim\'s head appears to be bleeding. Later, they pretend to tap ashes in the wound while Covington laughs.As the attack continues, someone off camera shouts ""F--- Donald Trump"" and ""F--- white people."" About 15 minutes into the video, one of the men says the victim ""represents Trump,"" and threatens to put him in the trunk of a car and ""put a brick on the gas.""A later clip shows the victim kneeling over a toilet while his assailants force his head into the water and order him to drink.At one point in the video, Covington can be heard telling the rest of the group that her little sister doesn\'t ""think it\'s funny."" She also expresses mock disappointment in the attention the live feed is getting on Facebook.""Y\'all ain\'t even commenting on my s---, man!"" she says into the camera.Duffin said police believe the victim was tied up for four or five hours. He said the attackers became distracted after a downstairs neighbor complained about the noise and threatened to call 911, prompting a confrontation.""They booted her door and they actually grabbed something on their way out,"" Duffin said.During their absence, the victim managed to leave the apartment and was later found wandering the street with Hill.CBS 2 Special Contributor Jay Levine interviews President Barack Obama at the White House.

About the same time, officers found signs of a struggle and property damage at the apartment on West Lexington that they linked to the attack, according to police.Streamwood police, meanwhile, said the victim\'s parents had reported getting text messages from someone claiming to be holding their son captive. As Streamwood officers investigated the texts, they discovered the Facebook video.Before the charges were announced Thursday, the video had became a national rallying cry for conservative pundits who tried to pin the blame for the attack on the Black Lives Matters movement. Debate also raged on social media and cable news stations about whether the police would consider the black-on-white assault a hate crime.""If this had been done to an African-American by four whites, every liberal in the country would be outraged, and there\'d be no question but that it\'s a hate crime,"" former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Thursday on Fox News.Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said there ""was never a question"" whether the case would be investigated as a hate crime, but police wanted to check all the facts before deciding anything based on emotion. He said the racial comments of the attackers and the disabilities of the victim both played a role in the decision.""Let me be very clear, the actions in that video are reprehensible,"" Johnson said. ""That, along with racism, have absolutely no place in the city of Chicago. Or anywhere else for that matter.""At a separate event Thursday, Mayor Rahm Emanuel called the acts on the video ""sickening,"" adding that anyone who views it is ""sickened by it.""John KassThere\'s a lot to unpack from Chicago\'s latest racial outrage, the Facebook Torture Case, and it\'s ugly, so let\'s get to it.

Four African-Americans were charged Thursday with hate crimes in the alleged kidnapping and torture of a bound, white and mentally disabled young man. Police... (John Kass)He declined further comment, citing the criminal charges, but also said ""there is more to our city than that.""Records show that the two sisters have previous arrests but only Tanishia Covington has been convicted, and of only one misdemeanor. She was arrested in the 1300 block of West Touhy Avenue on March 26 while riding in a car that had been reported stolen, records show. She pleaded guilty in April to misdemeanor criminal trespass to a vehicle and was sentenced to a year of court supervision.While the other charges filed against the four defendants Thursday have much more serious consequences  aggravated battery with a deadly weapon carries up to 15 years behind bars  it was the hate crime count that garnered the most attention.Illinois\' law, passed in 1991, states that a hate crime is committed if the offender launches an attack ""by reason of"" the person\'s race, religion, sexual orientation, nationality or physical or mental disability. A first-time offense is punishable by one to three years in prison, with probation also an option. Under the law, a judge can also consider the hate crime component after conviction on other counts to enhance whatever sentence is given.A spokeswoman for the Cook County state\'s attorney\'s office said Thursday the office did not have updated figures available for how many hate crime prosecutions it has brought in recent years. The office told the Tribune in 2014 that it had brought 44 cases in the previous three years.Most hate crime cases escape public notice, but several have made recent headlines. Last summer, a Cook County judge acquitted an Edgewater man of a hate crime and all other charges in an alleged attack on an elderly African-American judge outside the Daley Center. David Nicosia had been accused of spitting on and slapping the jurist and calling her ""Rosa Parks"" after becoming annoyed with her cigarette smoke.Police say an apartment on Chicago\'s West Side was the scene of a brutal attack captured on Facebook Live that led to hate crime charges being filed against four people.

The former freshmen, one of whom is the son of the Massachusetts Appeals Court\'s chief justice, had been charged with a felony hate crime.There have also been felony convictions. Norwood Park resident Tom Diamond was found guilty by a judge of a hate crime and sentenced to a year in prison for yelling racial slurs at an African-American woman walking by his porch in 2013. According to the woman\'s testimony, Diamond threatened to kill, rape and hang her from a tree if he saw her in his neighborhood again.In 2014, Terry Glover pleaded guilty to hate crime and aggravated battery charges after taking part in the beating of a lesbian couple walking home from a West Side liquor store, according to court records.Josh Kutnick, a longtime criminal-defense attorney who has represented several people charged in Cook County with hate crimes, said such cases are often difficult for prosecutors to prove.""It\'s hard to prove that something was done \'by reason of,\'"" Kutnick said.

https://www.snopes.com/woman-attacked-on-camera-for-wearing-a-trump-hat-in-hollywood/	Was a Woman Attacked on Camera for Wearing a ‘Make America Great Again’ Hat in Hollywood?	mixture	['alex jones', ' blaire white', ' hollywood', ' trump administration']	https://rationalwiki.org/	https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Blaire_White	2017/11/14	"“”I lost subscribers today for saying that children shouldn't be sterilized. Imagine that.—Blaire White, discussing trans children [6]White is a trans woman undergoing transition. As a result, her views on GSM issues often get extra respect despite being contradicted by science. Indeed, White routinely holds views contrary to those of scientific professionals on trans issues:Mental disorder: White asserts that ""transgenderism is a mental disorder,"" [7] which is false according to the American Psychological Association, [8] American Psychiatric Association, [9] and the World Health Organization. [10] [11] Indeed, in what was probably shocking news to exactly no trans person other than Blaire White, trans children were found to have normal rates of anxiety and depression when accepted by their families and communities. [12] [13]Transitioning: In the same video, she states her belief that transitioning is a ""faulty"" response to gender dysphoria and ""not for everyone"", and that there should be a ""cure for transgenderism"" , which is again denied by the American Psychological Association. [14]Gender binary: White firmly believes that there are only two genders [15] [16] and calls non-binary gender identities ""trans-retarded"". [17] This has no basis in any academic field of study, whether you want to look at biology , psychiatry, [note 1] or anthropology .There is no definition of gender under which it is true. It is first-grade bullshit that merely appeals to the worldview of right-wingers in the United States.Childhood transition: Ironically for someone who denounces ""transtrenders,"" a term that is usually a snarl word for people who reject transmedicalism , White believes that childhood transition is literally ""child abuse"". [18] Replace transgender with any other medical condition and the contradiction becomes obvious; this is, however, resolved when you view her not as making reasonable arguments but as pandering to a conservative audience that is looking for every pseudo-rational reason to justify their transphobia. Also, despite grabbing her a lot of attention the term ""child abuse"" for childhood transition is, again, rejected by the American Psychological Association, which extensively discusses trans youth, though it does conclude ""consensus does not exist regarding best practice with prepubertal children."" [8] In addition, trans YouTuber Zinnia Jones has two citation-heavy response blogs. [19] [20]Politics: White also believes that ""the left is fighting a fight transgender people don’t want"", [21] apparently unaware of modern polling. [note 2]Bigotry[ edit ]“”Respect is earned, and the transgender community does very little in the public eye that deserves respect. [22]White ""doesn't like the LGBT community"". [23] In her video series ""Triggering Trannies"" (later renamed to ""Upset Trans People"" [24] ) White freely admits that the LGBT community opposes her views, though she blows it off as ""just the SJW branch"". [25] [26] [27] Fittingly, White also holds numerous views that appear to be based not on reason but bigotry:White only supports straight trans women (i.e. those attracted exclusively to men). She believes that trans lesbians are really just straight men, taking the liberty to call one ""he"" and ""heterosexual."" Despite (at the time) being a non-op herself, Blaire criticizes said lesbian for still having a penis. [28]White thinks that trans women who don't pass shouldn't use the bathroom of their preferred gender. [29]White doesn't care much about preferred pronouns, referring to it as ""policing someone's behavior"" and ""being sensitive"". [30]White describes the label ""queer"" as ""brainwashing children"". [31]In short: White is against youth transition and simultaneously makes fun of people for not passing . She has also ""not bullied"" several specific leftist trans YouTubers:White dedicates five videos solely to attacking Riley Dennis , a trans female YouTuber. [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] She also misgenders Dennis, [28] [37] [38] [39] perhaps because she doesn't think Dennis is truly trans. [40] However, she has since apologized for said misgendering, when Riley Dennis revealed that she had been receiving hormones and laser hair removal, which is like apologizing to an Italian person for beating them up because you thought they were speaking Spanish. [41]White writes that ""I DONT WANT TO BE A BULLY but Milo Stewart is actually transitioning into a lawn gnome now, as I predicted. :X [image of Milo Stewart as lawn gnome]"" [42]Gender issues[ edit ]“”So now that we're all in agreement that feminism is indeed cancer, let's look at the ways feminism is like a virus.—Blaire White, prominent biologist [43]“”I can't explain why I don't need feminism, I'm too busy prospering without it. —Blaire White, professional tapeworm in the gut of feminism [44]White is an antifeminist . [45] [46] White frequently creates clickbait content of the ""REKT FEMINIST"" type. [32] [34] [35] [47] [48]White thinks rape culture doesn't exist. [49] Fittingly, she describes the feminist view of rape as follows: [50]Rape: Anything. No, seriously, like, they've butchered the definition so bad anything can be rape now.White denies the existence of the gender pay gap . [51] Her reasoning leaves a lot to be desired: [52]The wage gap is in great part due to women taking more time off than men.What will the Women's March do to help? They'll refuse to go to work. Amazing.White believes female privilege exists and is a strong argument for antifeminism. [45]In short: White is indistinguishable from your typical YouTube ""anti-SJW"" clickbait producer.Other stances[ edit ]“”I recently tried a tanning lotion out and I really regret it, it's not a good look. But on the bright side, I'm only a cornrowsaway from being able to demand reparations from you guys. [53]“”I tried on self tanner that I mistook for lotion in the store and my left hand has been African American for the past 4 days. [54]"
