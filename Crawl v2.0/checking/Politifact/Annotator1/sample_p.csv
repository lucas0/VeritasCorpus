http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/oct/17/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-says-connie-mack-missed-lot-votes-year/	"	In 2012, Connie Mack missed 178 votes, ""one of the worst voting records"" in Congress."	mostly true	['Candidate Biography', 'Debates', 'Voting Record']	http://www.politifact.com/	http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/jul/25/dave-weldon/weldon-connie-mack-missed-almost-half-votes/	2012/10/17	"""This year in Congress (Connie Mack IV) has missed almost half of his votes.""— Dave Weldon on Sunday, July 22nd, 2012 in a robocallDave Weldon says Connie Mack missed ""almost half"" of his votes in Congress this yearBy Amy Sherman on Wednesday, July 25th, 2012 at 10:33 a.m.U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV, R-Fort Myers, has been criticized for missing votes while campaigning for U.S. Senate.A Republican rival, former U.S. Rep. Dave Weldon of Indialantic near Melbourne, aired a robocall recently that picked up that story line:""How angry would you be if you hired someone to do a job and they only showed up half the time? You know -- they only cut half the grass, or they charged you for four hours when they really only worked two? Well, that’s what candidate Connie Mack has done. This year in Congress he has missed almost half of his votes, and now he not only wants to be paid for not showing up, he wants to be promoted into the U.S. Senate.""We wanted to check if that number was correct.GovTrack.us tracks missed votes for members of Congress using voting information from the official websites of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate. The page on Mack states that throughout his tenure, starting in January 2005 through July 23, 2012, Mack missed 362 of 6190 recorded or roll call votes, which is 6 percent. The median was 2.4 percent.We noticed that Mack’s percentage of missed votes started to spike in late 2011, when he missed 10.1 percent of votes. Mack announced he was running for Senate in late October 2011, with the goal of taking on Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson.Since the robocall said he missed almost half the votes ""this year,"" we will focus on Mack’s 2012 record. Below are his votes from Jan. 1 to July 23. Third quarter 2012 (starts July 1)4714228.6 percentWe shared our findings with Weldon and asked how he concluded that Mack missed ""almost half"" of his votes this year.""You know how these things are,"" Weldon said in an interview with PolitiFact. "" I didn’t actually get that. I relied on my staff to research that. It sounds like you did a better job than them.""Weldon said that the claim might have been based on previous attacks against Mack by George LeMieux, who dropped his Republican U.S. Senate bid in June.The robocall might not have factored in the second quarter and the portion of the third quarter, Weldon said.""It sounds like (Mack) is showing up more,"" Weldon said.Campaign spokesman J.B. Kump said that he didn’t put together the robocall, but it was intended to refer to the first quarter.""It was something that will probably be corrected in future robocalls if we use that script again,"" Kump said. ""We will try to be more accurate.""But Kump reiterated the general criticism of Mack saying he has missed too many votes -- in an email he told PolitiFact ""Any discussion of quarters, etc., is just quibbling.""Kump wouldn’t tell us exactly when or where the robocall aired -- the Tampa Bay Times posted it on its Buzz blog on July 22 and stated that voters heard it in Tampa Bay over the weekend.American Bridge 21st Century PAC , a Democratic group, said in July that Mack missed about 31 percent of votes based on the first half of 2012. (They arrived at a slightly different figure because they didn’t use the partial data available for the beginning of the third quarter.)Mack’s missed votes have made news for several months. The Tampa Bay Times reported in February that Mack missed a series of missed votes, including to repeal part of the health care law. POLITICO noted in April that Mack missed the high-profile vote on Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget plan.Mack’s responseMack’s campaign spokesman David James did not dispute our numbers.""Mack has a lifetime 95 percent voting attendance record affected by missing some votes to make sure Mitt Romney won the Florida presidential primary in January, something Connie's constituents felt very strongly about when it comes to invoking the change we need in Washington,"" James told PolitiFact.It’s not unusual for a congressman running for statewide office to miss a high number of votes. The Miami Herald reported in a 2000 story that Nelson missed many votes in 1990 while running for governor.Nelson has only missed one vote this year, according to GovTrack, but unlike Mack, he hasn’t faced feisty primary challengers, and the Senate takes fewer votes.Our rulingThe Weldon robocall said that Connie Mack ""missed almost half of his votes"" this year. Actually, Mack missed about 28.6 percent of votes this year, which is significantly less than the robocall claimed. The Weldon campaign conceded that they relied on out-of-date information for their attack.However, Mack has missed votes. He's missed more votes than the average member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and he's missed high-profile votes on health care and the budget.He hasn't missed ""almost half of his votes,"" though. So we rate this claim Mostly False. Advertisement"

ANNOUNCER: Starting right now on ABC THIS WEEK, Trump firestorm -- what he's saying now that has some Republicans demanding he drop out. Did he just go too far? Donald Trump is here live to respond. And terror in Tennessee -- the race this morning to find out more about the gunman and new details about his trip overseas and his troubled family life. Did authorities miss any warning signs? Plus, nuclear reaction -- Israel calls it a ""historic mistake."" John Kerry is here to defend the deal. From ABC News, THIS WEEK WITH GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS begins now. MARTHA RADDATZ, ABC HOST: Good morning. I'm Martha Raddatz. So many stories developing right as we come on the air. But we start off with Donald Trump's latest campaign firestorm shocking up the 2016 race. His new comments about Vietnam veteran John McCain's war record sparking a bipartisan backlash. Donald Trump will join us live momentarily. First, ABC's Cecilia Vega on the new uproar. CECILIA VEGA, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Donald Trump is at it again, unleashing his latest political firestorm on a new target -- this time, John McCain. DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He's not a war hero. VEGA: Trump in Iowa going directly after the Arizona senator and former Navy fighter pilot who spent five-and-a-half years as a POW during the Vietnam War. TRUMP: He is a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured, OK, I hate to tell you. VEGA: And the reaction from fellow Republicans, fast and fierce. Nearly every GOP challenger running for the White House firing back. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When it comes to attacking an American hero, I'm going to call it out. I denounce Donald Trump for that. GOV. RICK PERRY (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I was highly offended what Donald Trump said about John McCain and his years of sacrifice. VEGA: Democrats pouncing, too. HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: There's nothing funny about the hate he is spewing, the insults he's directed at a genuine war hero. VEGA: Senator McCain so far staying silent, but his daughter Meghan took to Twitter, saying she is ""horrified, designated. There are no words."" This is just the latest controversy for the brash billionaire. TRUMP: They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists and some, I assume, are good people. VEGA: McCain saying recently those fiery comments on Mexico fired up the crazies. That statement apparently igniting this now very public feud. But the controversies don't seem to be hurting ""the Donald."" The latest Fox News Poll showing Trump surging to the head of the pack and overnight Trump doubling down, saying once again that he will not apologize, writing, ""I am not a fan of John McCain because he has done so little for our veterans."" VEGA: And even the Republican National Committee lashed out at Trump, saying, quote, ""There is no place in our party or our country for comments that disparage those who have served honorably."" Some now predicting, Martha, this could be the beginning of the end for Trump's candidacy. RADDATZ: Thanks very much, Cecilia. And let’s get straight to Donald Trump who joins us right now on the phone for his first interview since those controversial comments. Thanks for joining us, Mr. Trump. DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Good morning. RADDATZ: Do you owe John McCain an apology? TRUMP: No, not at all. Actually, if you look at Sharyl Attkisson’s report last night, four times she said I said perfectly, I said whatever it was, and it was absolutely fine. And she thought the press was covering me very -- very, very unfairly. And she stated that strongly. And I respect her as a reporter. And somebody that a lot of other people respect. Also and very importantly I got a standing ovation, the biggest ovation they had all weekend, by far. When I left the room, it was a total standing ovation. It was wonderful to see. Nobody was insulted. What happened is, later on, the Republican candidates, some of whom are registering 1 percent and zero, and they’re very upset that I’m leading the polls by actually a nice margin, they’re extremely upset and they were extremely when the Nevada numbers just came out and they’re through the roof too. RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, I want to -- let’s go back to this issue of John McCain, and you’re talking about the Sharyl Attkisson piece. You said he’s a war hero because he was captured, I believe perhaps he’s a war hero. I want to read you a short bio of John McCain. He was shot down in 1967 on his 23rdd bombing mission over North Vietnam. He fractured both arms and a leg when he ejected and nearly drowned when he parachuted into a lake. He was pulled out by North Vietnamese, who crushed his shoulder with a rifle and bayoneted him. He was beaten, tortured, and interrogated. He spent five and a half years a POW. The North Vietnamese offered McCain early release for propaganda purposes. He refused until every man taken before him was released. He cannot raise his arms above his head to this day because of his wartime injuries. You do not think that is a war hero, captured or not? TRUMP: I didn't say anything differently. And if you read -- and if you watch and take a look at what you have, I said nothing differently. I'm very disappointed in John McCain because the vets are horribly treated in this country. I'm fight for the vets. I've done a lot for the vets. And the vets -- I've been going around to the campaign trail. They're treated like third-class citizens. He's done nothing to help the vets. And I will tell you, they are living in hell. RADDATZ: You -- let me tell you this, what the national commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, John Stroud (ph), said about your comments. ""For someone who never served a day in uniform to criticize the service and sacrifice of a combat-wounded veteran is despicable."" The founder and CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, Paul Reikopf (ph), ""an insult to everyone who has ever worn the uniform and to all Americans and an attack on one veteran's service is an attack on us all."" They apparently think you were criticizing Mr. McCain and saying he was not a war hero. TRUMP: Well, maybe they don't speak to the same vets that I speak to. But I go all over the country and I speak to vets all the time. And they're absolutely having miserable times. It takes them six, seven days just to get into waiting in a reception room, just trying to get in to see a doctor. They're treated horribly. TRUMP: -- and it's a scandal. RADDATZ: There is -- Mr. Trump, I have covered the veterans issues for many, many years. Indeed, there are big troubles in the Veterans Administration. TRUMP: -- the veterans except talk. And by the way, this all started, Martha, when we had thousands and thousands of people in Phoenix, Arizona, and John -- who, by the way, are devastated by illegal immigration, something I'm very proud to have brought to the forefront. We had thousands of people and he said they're all crazies. He called them crazies. And frankly, I think he owes them an apology. RADDATZ: Let me talk about your language about him being captured. You say you prefer those who aren't captured. What could John McCain have done not to be captured? TRUMP: Well, I do say this. People that fought hard and weren't captured and went through a lot, they get no credit. Nobody even talks about them. They're like forgotten. And I think that's a shame, if you want to know the truth. People that were not captured that went in and fought, nobody talks about them. Those are heroes also. RADDATZ: I think people do talk about those people as well. TRUMP: I don't think so. RADDATZ: -- what did you mean you -- what did you mean you prefer those who aren't captured? TRUMP: I want to give them credit because, frankly, they don't get the credit. John McCain gets credit. He was elected a senator, et cetera, et cetera, and we'll give him all the credit. And as in the report, it said, from Sharyl Attkisson, four times, I said he is a hero. But you know, people choose little selective like you try to do. People choose little selective pieces. If you read what I say or if you watch what I say, which is even better, you'll say that there was nothing wrong. But the people that weren't captured are also heroes, Martha. RADDATZ: I want to talk about you and your deferment. How many deferments did you actually get? And what were they for? I believe you had student deferments and then a medical deferment. TRUMP: I had student deferments, like many other people had, during the war or around the time of the war. I had a minor medical deferment for feet, for a bone spur of the foot, which was minor. I was then entered into the draft because if I would have gotten a different number, I could have been drafted. I was fortunate, in a sense, because I was not a believer in the Vietnam War. That was another war that was a disaster for this country. Lives and money and it’s disgraceful what happened with the Vietnam War. I was not a fan of the Vietnam War. But I was entered into the draft and I got a very, very high draft number. RADDATZ: That wasn’t until 1969. RADDATZ: The lottery wasn’t until 1969? TRUMP: That’s right. TRUMP: Excuse me. Excuse me. I was entered into the lottery, the draft lottery. If I would have gotten a low number, I would have been drafted. I would have proudly served. But I got a number, I think it was 356. That’s right at the very end. And they didn’t get -- I don’t believe -- past even 300, so I was -- I was not chosen because of the fact that I had a very high lottery number. RADDATZ: You -- there seems to be a pattern, Mr. Trump. When you’re criticized or attacked, you often respond with name-calling, using terms like “dummy”, “loser”, “total losers” on Twitter and elsewhere. You even demean some people’s physical appearance. Is that something you would continue doing if you were president? Isn’t that language beneath the office of the president? TRUMP: Oh, I don’t think -- look, when people attack me, I let them have it back. You say physical appearance. You know, it’s my hair but people are constantly attacking my hair. I don’t see you coming to my defense. I’m -- my hair is just fine, but I don’t see you coming to my defense. But if I say something about somebody else. Yesterday, I mentioned somebody was saying, McCain’s a smart man. I said, really? He graduated last in his class at Annapolis, OK. So people laughed when I said it, but a lot of people don’t know that. I’m very disappointed. I understand John McCain. I’ve backed John McCain; raised, I think, $1 million for John McCain when he let us down. He ran for president and lost to Obama, let us down. I wasn’t thrilled with that. But I will say what I want to say, and maybe that’s why I’m leading in the polls because people are tired of hearing politicians and pollsters telling the politicians exactly what to say. And, believe me, this whole thing was brought up by a lot of the people that are competing against me currently that aren’t even registering in the polls because people are tired of them. RADDATZ: Have you ever said anything you regret? TRUMP: Yes, I have, on many occasions. RADDATZ: Can you tell us a few of those? Not the birther issue. RADDATZ: Not the immigrant issue. TRUMP: No, I wouldn’t do that. I wouldn’t do that, Martha. I wouldn’t do that. It’s not the appropriate time. But certainly I have said things that I could’ve held back. But not that often, surprisingly not that often, but certainly there have been occasions. RADDATZ: So let me just get this clear. You are not apologizing. And you are certainly not pulling out of the race as some of your opponents have suggested. TRUMP: Of course they’d love to have me do that because I’m leading the pack. I’m certainly not pulling out; I’m leading and I’m leading in many states. North Carolina just came in; I’m way in the lead there. Nevada, as I said, just came in. I’m way in the lead there. And, interestingly, in Nevada, I lead in Hispanics by a tremendous -- the Hispanics, I’m way into the 30s with Hispanics. Which I said, if I get the nomination, if I run for president, I will win the Hispanic vote, because I’ll be able to take jobs back from China, jobs back from Japan and Mexico, and everybody else that’s ripping us off on trade. And everybody knows that. And I will win the Hispanic vote. RADDATZ: So you think this will actually help you? This is involving veterans and you heard what I said about those veterans groups. You still think this will help you in the polls? TRUMP: I believe that I will do far more for veterans than John McCain has done for many, many years, with all talk no action. He’s on television all the time, talking, talking. Nothing gets done. You look at what’s happening to our veterans -- they’re being decimated, OK. So I will do far more for veterans than anybody. I’ll be able to build them new hospitals, I’ll be able to build them care centers. I’ll be able to help the veterans. John McCain has failed. Because all you have to do is take a look -- what you report on all the time, take a look at the scandal at the Veterans’ Administration and the disastrous conditions under which our veterans have to live. And believe me, I built, with a small group, the Vietnam Memorial in downtown Manhattan. I know what it is to help people and I know what it is to help veterans. RADDATZ: Thank you very much for joining us, Mr. Trump. Now let's just in Democratic presidential contender, former senator, and Vietnam veteran Jim Webb. who, like John McCain, attended the U.S. Naval Academy. Senator Webb, what's your reaction? JIM WEBB (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, you know, I... RADDATZ: You don't know where to start. WEBB: That's a lot to react to in a quick minute or two. But first of all, I believe if Donald Trump had taken the opportunity to serve our country, could have volunteered like a lot of people did, he would have a different feeling about these kinds of things that he's saying in his vituperative personal attacks. It's one thing to talk about issues, but when you're talking about military service you're talking about duty and honor and dignity. And actually the comments that he made a few weeks ago about Mexican-Americans insulted a lot of our veterans. I have a couple of Mexican-American marine veterans who were in my unit in Vietnam who were really inflamed with these comments. One of them wrote a letter to Mr. Trump and said any time you want, come back and talk to us about military service. Oh, you didn't go. Now, I'd known John McCain for a very long time, a great respect for him. I don't agree with him. You don't have to agree with him to understand the daily courage that it takes, and took, when people are prisoners of war undergoing uncertainties of whether they are going to come home or not -- and as you mentioned so well, how badly injured he was... RADDATZ: Just quickly on that, you heard what Mr. Trump said. I said he was a war hero because he was captured. Was he backing off a little, or will that help at all, or just make it worse? WEBB: Well, what he said was -- there's no excuse for it. And, you know, he can talk about veterans issues. We all care about veterans issues. And as I said, this goes to all veterans when they hear those sorts of things, because you're talking about the dignity of service when you say things like that. And there's no way to take away the courage, the daily courage people like John McCain faced in those years of incarceration. RADDATZ: Thanks for joining us, Senator Webb. We'll have more with you later. Plus, the roundtable weighs in on Trump's future, but now that developing story out of Tennessee, new details on the suspect in that terror attack that left five service members dead. Investigators are working 24/7 to find out everything they can about Muhammad Abdulazeez. How did he plan his rampage? Who did he meat on his recent trip to Jordan? I recently reported from that country on the effort to contain the ISIS threat and talk to numerous young men who supported the jihadist group. Now, officials want to know if the Tennessee shooter had any links to ISIS. Here is senior justice correspondent Pierre Thomas. PIERRE THOMAS, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Right now the phones and computer of Muhammad Abdulazeez are at the FBI laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, an urgent effort underway to find clues to his motive. He was not under FBI investigation, not under surveillance, and the FBI wants to know how he was able to operate under the radar. They're looking at his travel, including the seven month trip to Jordan last year. Did he secretly go to other countries during that visit? And they want to find out if he was using online aliases to view violent propaganda or using encrypted communication to hide contacts with overseas radicals. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Law enforcement is asking is there we could have done? Is there more that we should have done? Were people aware that he was traveling to that region, were their signs that he was exhibiting in the community that were missed. THOMAS: The FBI is under tremendous pressure with terrorism investigations in all 50 states, involving hundreds of suspected radicals, many of them thought to be ISIS sympathizers. Just one week before the Chattanooga terror attack, the FBI director was sounding the alarm before congress. JAMES COMEY, DIRECTOR, FBI: I cannot see me stopping these indefinitely. THOMAS: And while we don't yet know if Abdulazeez has ties to ISIS, that’s the group that Comey fears is an eminent threat, specifically because of its unprecedented social media campaign targeting smartphones, computers and tablets. COMEY: It buzzes in their pocket. So there is a device, almost a devil on their shoulder all day long saying ""kill, kill, kill, kill."" THOMAS: A daily sophisticated multimedia campaign using all the advertising tricks. Primary ISIS focus: directives to kill U.S. military. And it's working. In recent months, at least a half dozen suspected ISIS sympathizers accused of plotting to kill U.S. soldiers here at home. In March, an Illinois national guardsman was accused of conspiring with his cousin to murder his fellow soldiers. In April, an Ohio man charged after he traveled to Syria and was allegedly directed by ISIS to kill military personnel, men like Abdulazeez in their 20s. Difference: Abdulazeez got through. For This Week, Pierre Thomas, ABC News, Washington. RADDATZ: And joining us now, Congressman Michael McCaul, chair of the homeland security committee who is calling the shooting an ISIS inspired attack. Chairman McCaul, can you tell us the latest that they've found out about Abdulazeez? REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL, (R) TEXAS: Well, the FBI is currently doing a forensics examination on his computer, his cell phone, his travels to Jordan, which is right across the border from Syria. So we have the threat of foreign fighters, but we also have the threat over the internet, which is a new sort of threat that's out there, a new generation of terrorists as you heard Director Comey talk about. These internet directives from a cyber command if you will out of Syria to activate people in the United States to attack. And what they are saying is attack military installations and attack police officers. And what we saw was one of the most deadliest attacks on American soil against our U.S. marines and an American sailor. And this is case that we're most worried about. We have followed quite a few cases. We have over 60 cases that we've rolled up ISIS followers over the last year. That's more than one per week. We have investigations into all 50 states. But what keeps us up at night are really the ones that we don't know about. And I'm afraid that this case falls into that category. RADDATZ: Well, to that point, you had a naturalized citizens, numerous trips to Jordan, which border Syria as you said, a father who is on the terrorist watch list at one time, reports of Abuse, online writing. Shouldn't alarm bells have sounded? MCCAUL: Well, 20/20 is hindsight. I commend the FBI and homeland for stopping so many terrorist plots in the United States. But we will be examining this case. I know the FBI is investigating again his travel. The father was on a watchlist, was under an investigation that was closed. We'll be looking at all those details. But you know this is, again, the new sort of threat that's out there over the internet that's very hard to stop. We have 200,000 ISIS tweets per day that hit the United States. And this is one of those threats that Director Comey talks about is getting so -- the chatter is so loud and the volume so high that it's a problem that's very hard to stop and disrupt in this country. It's something we've been warning about over the last year. And unfortunately we saw it take place in Chattanooga. And Martha, if it can happen in Chattanooga, it can happen anywhere, anytime, anyplace, and that's our biggest fear. RADDATZ: Mr. Chairman, you say 20/20 is hindsight -- or 20/20 hindsight -- but Tamerlan Tsarnaev had a background that should have raised alarms as well. And haven't we taken more measures since the Boston bombing to try to stop or track someone like this? MCCAUL: Of course. And I was one of the biggest critics of that -- the way that was handled, that particular case that we saw fall through the cracks. You know, this is one we'll be conducting oversight and examining what happened. But again, when we're stopping like we did the 4th of July plot that was imminent to blow up military at 4th of July parades, when we stopped at Garland, we stopped at -- we have again arrested -- there were 60 ISIS over the last year. Again, that's more than one per week. It's -- this is a very difficult counterterrorism challenge in the United States. And this is -- I met with the generals that conduct the war on terror. And you know what, I think we need to take the fight over there a little stronger. RADDATZ: -- I'm going to have to let you wrap up there, Chairman McCaul. Thank you very much for joining us. We'll be right back to look at these soft targets, like military recruiting centers, even cruise ships and shopping malls. Are we doing enough to protect them? RADDATZ (voice-over): Back in just a moment with a look at those soft targets. How can we protect them against attack? RADDATZ: A look at the growing memorial in Tennessee outside the recruiting center that was one of the sites of that horrific shooting rampage this week. This morning officials beefing up security at military locations nationwide. The strikes are a chilling remainder of just how many places are vulnerable to terror. Let's talk about that now with former FBI special agent Brad Garrett and retired general and former commander of U.S. Africa Command, Carter Ham. Carter Ham, you, of course, served in Iraq as well and you certainly looked at the issues of force protection there. But you have advised the Pentagon on how to protect our service members as part of your investigation into the Ft. Hood massacre. What do you think should happen now? GEN. CARTER HAM, FMR. CMDR., AFRICOM: I think the right thing to do now is to do a comprehensive approach. There are, as you mentioned, Martha, thousands of U.S. military facilities that are embedded in the fabric of our society around the country. And it's also noteworthy that, very sadly, the four Marines and the Navy petty officer who were killed were on a federal installation, not in the civilian sector. So how the shooter was able to gain access into that facility, I think, certainly merits further study. RADDATZ: And one of the suggestions -- and some people are doing it now for National Guard members -- is to arm them. I think people don't realize sometimes that on these bases people aren't really armed except for some security people. Do you think they should be armed? Do you think they should be armed, Brad? GARRETT: I think it's premature. It should be looked at. I know some state governors within their proper authority have directed that some of the National Guard members who are in facilities, recruiting facilities and the like, be armed. That's not the case for federal recruiting stations. And there are matters of law and history that have to get involved. But I think there are also other measures that can be taken, such as hardening the facilities, bulletproof glass in doors and the other. And I would also mention that the federal, state and local law enforcement relationship with these military entities is very, very sound. And if there is an indication of increased threat, they're very quick to make sure that these sites are aware of that threat. RADDATZ: And -- and Brad Garrett, they can harden those facilities. They can look at that closely. But it seems like almost everything else is a soft target. GARRETT: Basically the world, Martha, is a soft target, except for these little bitty pockets. You can't really take a recruiting center and target harden it, because you then take away what it's there for, which is for us to walk in and decide if we want to join the military. So a lot of this has -- we have to face the reality that some of us are just going to be vulnerable doing what we do day in and day out. Now, having said that... RADDATZ: And just quickly, because I asked you for -- do you think they should arm people at these recruiting stations? GARRETT: I think we should not get in a big hurry to do that. You're talking about arming folks that are being -- going to be walking around in the civilian population. I see big issues with that. RADDATZ: And -- and just very quickly, sum up what you think we can do, what we can do about soft targets. GARRETT: The only thing you can do, Martha, about soft targets, is improve your intelligence. In other words, the shooting that happened in Chattanooga, we didn't know about. Can that happen again? Of course it can. But this has really got to be driven by what do we know in advance, because we're not going to lock down every facility, every mall in the country. And I know we'll have both of you back to talk about this a lot in the future. Next, inside the historic Iran nuclear deal and the battle ahead on Capitol Hill. John Kerry and Israel's prime minister weighing in right here. Plus, that wild week on the 2016 campaign trail. It's not just about Donald Trump. RADDATZ: Part of the global reaction to the landmark nuclear deal with Iran, celebrations in Tehran earlier this week. I was there when the momentous deal was reached. We saw lots of joy and hope among the Iranian people, but there is also serious fear and concern here at home and around the world about that agreement. A top critic, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, joins us shortly. First, chief White House correspondent Jon Karl with America's lead negotiators, secretary of State John Kerry and Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz. JONATHAN KARL, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Could this be the beginning of a -- of a major change, though, in U.S.-Iran relations? I mean we've (INAUDIBLE)... JOHN KERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE: Well, there's no way to tell that. I mean it was not the purpose of the negotiations about a nuclear program. But we're prepared to test whether or not they're prepared to change their relationship in the region. And we certainly -- I think it would be diplomatic malpractice if we didn't keep our -- our doors open to possibilities. KARL: This deal is going before the U.N. Security Council on Monday. You've heard some harsh criticism about that from Congress. Bob Corker, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said this is an affront to the American people. Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the committee said this is presumptuous, to go to the U.N. before Congress. Why are you going to the U.N. before you're going to the U.S. Congress with this deal? KERRY: Well, we're not. What we did was negotiate with our P5-plus-1 partners, who are not subject to the Congress, that it cannot be implemented until after Congress has had a chance to vote. KARL: But the bottom line is the U.N. is going to vote on this before the Congress is going to vote on this. KERRY: Well, they have a right to do that, honestly. It's presumptuous of some people to suspect that France, Russia, China, Germany, Britain ought to do what the congress tells them to do. They have a right to have a vote. But we prevailed on them to delay the implementation of that vote out of respect for our congress so we wouldn't be jamming them. KARL: One of the most controversial provisions here is that in terms of these covert sites, Iran can delay for 24 days before inspectors get in there. You, Mr. Secretary, have said that there would be anywhere/anytime inspections. I mean, 24 days is not anywhere/anytime. MONIZ: It was anytime/anywhere in the sense of a well defined process that would have a well defined conclusion in time. Three weeks for a process of this type is reasonable. Most important, we are very confident in our ability to detect the vestiges of any nuclear work beyond 24 days. KARL: So, even though they have nearly a month, they can't clean up what they're doing and hide what they're doing? MONIZ: Yes, there had been various analogies to throwing things down toilets, et cetera. This is not so simple with nuclear materials. We have plenty of evidence of exquisite environmental sampling that will reveal the traces of nuclear work. KARL: And I want to ask you, the lifting of the arms embargo -- so you're going to unleash 100 billion dollars worth of Iranian assets, and then within five years, they're going to be able to go on the open market arms embargo lifted. This is the premier state sponsor of terrorism. KERRY: The United Nations resolution, which brought about the sanctions in the first place, said that if Iran will suspend its enrichment and come to negotiations, all the sanctions will be lifted. Now they've done more than just come to negotiations, they've actually negotiated a deal. And three of the seven nations thought they shouldn't, therefore, be held to any kind of restraint. We prevailed and insisted, no, they have to be. But we have ample other resolutions that allow us to hold them accountable for moving any weapons. President Obama is committed to doubling down on the enforcement of those measures. So I really think that a mountain is being made out of a mole hill here. RADDATZ: Now for the other side, let’s bring in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He’s called the deal “an historic mistake”. He joins us now from Israel. Prime Minister, we know you’re adamantly opposed to this deal. So, what do you do? Do you personally lobby Congress? BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTERADDATZ: Look, I think it’s very important for me as the prime minister of the one and only Jewish state to make our case against the deal that we believe endangers our security, our survival even, and the security of our -- of the Middle East and the world. I think that’s important. It’s a substantive disagreement. It should be examined on the substance. RADDATZ: I know you have concerns especially about the 24 days to allow inspectors on Iranian nuclear sites and military sites. And yet, the U.S. Secretary of Energy says the U.S. is very confident in its ability to detect nuclear work beyond 24 days. Is he wrong? NETANYAHU: Well, I think that -- I have respect for our intelligence services. They’re the best in the world -- Israel, the U.S. and the U.K. And yet, all three of us didn’t see for a long time the massive underground nuclear bunkers in Qom and in Natanz. We didn’t see the Syrian war kind of reactor, a nuclear reactor that was almost operational when we discovered. So, I have full respect for intelligence. But it’s very thin ice. You simply, you can’t have -- speak with confidence about knowing a covert path to the bomb uninspected sites because you simply don’t know. Intelligence and the best intelligence in the world, you still very thin ice. RADDATZ: What, to you, would have been an ideal agreement? NETANYAHU: Dismantle for dismantle. Dismantle Iran’s nuclear infrastructure for dismantling the sanctions. That was the original administration position and I think it was the right one. But, in fact, Iran actually gets both things. It gets to keep its nuclear infrastructure and it gets the full dismantling of sanctions in a very short time. So the hardliners in Iran are actually going to come out strong because they’re getting everything they want. They’re getting a pathway down the line, within a decade or so, to the capacity to be a threshold state with practically zero breakout time to many nuclear bombs, and billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars, which they’ll siphon off to their terror and war machine. RADDATZ: Ash Cater is coming tomorrow. Is there anything he can say, the secretary of defense, that will satisfy you? NETANYAHU: You know, everybody talks about compensating Israel. I guess the question you have to ask yourself is, if this deal is supposed to make Israel and our Arab neighbors safer, why should we be consecrated -- compensated with anything. And furthermore, you know, how can you compensate a country, my country, against a terrorist regime that is sworn to our destruction and is going to get a path to nuclear bombs and billions of dollars to boot for its terror activities against us, against you, against everyone else. I think the right thing to do is not to do this bad deal. RADDATZ: Let me ask you one final question. The military option. We know you’re not going to talk about specifics, but is there really any bomb, any military action that would delay Iran building a bomb for as long as this deal does? NETANYAHU: As far as the military option, I never talk about it. RADDATZ: Mr. Prime Minister, thank you. NETANYAHU: Thank you. RADDATZ: We’re right back with Senator Jim Webb and the roundtable breaks down the new Donald Trump firestorm. WEBB: I understand how our American military works. I understand foreign policy issues. And I would assure you, by the way, that if I were your president I would have never urged an invasion of Iraq. RADDATZ: Senator Jim Webb speaking in Iowa on Friday night. That event the first time all five Democratic candidates have appeared on stage together. And Senator Webb is back with us now. I want to go to the shooting in Chattanooga. You were a marine, you saw many men die. Do you agree that recruiters should have -- I think I know you do agree that recruiters should have guns. They should be allowed to carry... WEBB: Well, they should have the means to defend themselves. And this is dramatically changed since 9/11. And there's a basic logic here: if we don't know who these shooters are going to be, and we do know that one of their targets that they're focusing on are military people in uniform, then it's just logical that we should provide them a means to defend themselves if they become under any sort of attack like this. That doesn't mean you have to turn a recruiting office into a bunker, as -- that was being discussed before, but... RADDATZ: But these are in civilian areas. I think that's the difference there. You know, they're in strip malls. They're... WEBB: Well, you know, we don't take firearms away from police officers. There should be some means for these people to defend themselves. I had a long talk with the chief of staff for the army after the Ft. Hood incident, which also was on a military base. There was not one military person in that gathering that had a firearm. I grew up in the military. Firearms were normal in the situations when I was growing up. By the time they called the police to get in there to help them, they had 13 dead people. RADDATZ: How do you see that playing out? I know one of the things we talked about with the military is they're not police officers. The MPs are police officers. WEBB: Well, like I say, it's -- this -- I'm not talking about turning these different centers and bases into fire bases. But at the same time, they should have the ability to defend themselves in some way. And the -- try and think of it the other way around. RADDATZ: I'm going to leave that to you. I want to move to the Iran deal. You say you have a lot of concerns and we're going to read it. What concerns you most? And if you were still in the Senate, would you vote against it? WEBB: Well, first, I have been a proponent of these sorts of approaches toward rogue and rogue regimes. I worked with Vietnam in terms of normalizing relations there. I led the change in Burma in terms of opening up that regime. I just have very serious concerns here. Number one is even if all of these processes worked -- and I respect the people who put them together -- at the end of 10 years, what are we going to have? Have we now given our endorsement of the fact that Iran will eventually obtain nuclear weapons? And then secondly, the process beginning now, I think, is -- we've got to be very careful in terms of how it affects the strategic balance in the region in terms of signals that we send, not just in terms of who's got how many conventional weapons. RADDATZ: And I hate to say be quick on this because it's your entire campaign. But we'll let you go campaign. How do you think your prospects look for being president? And why do you want to be president? You stayed in the Senate on term. WEBB: Well, I've had four different periods of public service in my life. And I've been able to move out of public service for a while and look at things differently. So four year -- one term in the Senate is a term and a half of a presidency. Wasn’t a short period of time. RADDATZ: So why do you want to be president? WEBB: I'm very concerned about where we're going in this country. And I think we're going to see some dramatic changes in terms of how we approach our economic fairness issues and we really need a commander in chief who understands how to deal with these issues. RADDATZ: Thank you very much for joining us, Senator Webb. RADDATZ (voice-over): Ahead, will Donald Trump keep his lead in the polls after this latest firestorm? And Obama's big sell (ph), will Congress accept the Iran nuke deal? We're back after this from our ABC stations. TRUMP: I believe that I will do far more for veterans than John McCain has done for many, many years with all talk, no action. He's on television all the time, talking, talking; nothing gets done. You look at what's happening to our veterans. They're being decimated, OK? So I will do far more for veterans than anybody. John McCain has failed. RADDATZ (voice-over): Some of Donald Trump's comments causing that new uproar. Let's bring in the roundtable. ""Weekly Standard"" editor Bill Kristol, ESPN's LZ Granderson, former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm who's the co-chair of Super PAC Priorities USA and a Hillary Clinton supporter, and ABC's chief White House correspondent, Jon Karl. And a special welcome to LZ and Governor Granholm, here for the first time as ABC News contributors. We are happy to have had you before many, many times. I want to start with our Jon Karl, however. Is this different (ph)? Is this a turning point? JONATHAN KARL, ABC NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, this is what opened the floodgates of Republicans to finally come out and condemn Donald Trump. But look, he's content to lead in the polls with 15-17 percent and I'll tell you, Martha, there are two candidates that Trump unequivocally helps in this race, one now, the other in the future. The first is Jeb Bush because he becomes the vessel for all of the anti-Bush anger in the party and it's in somebody who is clearly unelectable, will not get the nomination. And the second is Hillary Clinton. You heard him again, yesterday, say that he will not rule out running as a third-party candidate if that happens, it guarantees Hillary Clinton victory. RADDATZ: And, Bill Kristol, I think it was just yesterday you did a brief interview with ABC News, calling him older, wiser, richer Donald Trump would be better than Hillary. BILL KRISTOL, ""THE WEEKLY STANDARD"": I think he's still older and richer than Hillary Clinton. KRISTOL: Though if she gives a few more speeches maybe she'll catch up. But, no, I don't think that anymore actually. I think it's one thing, he was a controversial character who said some useful things, I think, and brought some people into the Republican tent. But he jumped the shark (ph) yesterday. KRISTOL: -- yes, seriously, no. I mean, he insulted every veteran, every -- certainly every veteran who's a POW, which is -- with these insane statements about how it's your fault that you're captured or shot down. And with total lack of respect for not just John McCain -- that I think other people made this point, Jim Webb, made this point -- for other people's military service and sacrifice. So I'm finished with Donald Trump. And I don’t think it's going to -- he'll -- and I don't think -- I don't think he'll stay up in the polls, incidentally. Republican primary voters are pro-respect the military. And he showed disrespect for the military. RADDATZ: LZ, did his explanation do anything, change anything? LZ GRANDERSON, ESPN: Explanation? I thought it was just more of a -- just furthermore branding sort of promotion. I mean, we all know he's not actually trying to be President of the United States. He's just trying to stir the pot to keep his brand out there. And that's just what he's been doing. RADDATZ: But has he gone too far this time? GRANDERSON: Well, I'm amazed that we think this is the moment that he's gone too far. I mean, he -- on television and literally (INAUDIBLE) an entire race of people. Why wasn’t that the shark that got jumped? Why did it take the attack of John McCain to get people to get so upset that Republicans start tweeting and denouncing? When he went there and said, well, I like some of the Mexicans but the rest of them are a bunch of rapists and criminals? I mean, that, to me, was a shark jumping moment. RADDATZ: And Governor, the Democrats do what? Just sit back and let this play out? JENNIFER GRANHOLM (D), FORMER GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN: Well, I was going to say before yesterday, just put up your feet and break out the popcorn. But I do think that he really went too far. And I agree with LZ, that he had gone too far already and that this really, I think, is a signal of this sinister thread that runs through a lot of the far right and Tea Party, this feeling like those who are different are not one of us, that it's frightening for many in the sort of old, older white Americans who might be following him and who are angry, who may feel threatened by this -- by immigrants. I worry about that sinister thread. And I'll be interested to see whether, in fact, there is a -- you know, a diminution in his rankings. Because if it still stays high, then I think there's a lot more that the Republican Party has to figure out. RADDATZ: And let's look at those rankings first, Jon. We've got in the latest ABC News ""Washington Post"" poll, obviously, before these comments, Trump still had a 61 percent unfavorable rating, although his favorability has doubled since May, despite -- despite... KARL: -- your favorability is 33 percent and that is a doubling, by the way. RADDATZ: So -- so what happens going forward? In a week from now, if we took another poll, what do you think that would say? KARL: Well, I still think there is a portion of that electorate that is extremely angry. I don't doubt that it will go down a degree on this. But look what happened in the room when he made those comments. One thing he was right about in the interview he used it with him, is he did get a standing ovation. And he was enthusiastically applauded minutes after saying what he said about John McCain in that room. Now, by the way, the other thing he said is he was asked, can you tell us -- do you ever ask God for forgiveness. This was a -- this was a conservative religious right (INAUDIBLE)... RADDATZ: That was controversial. RADDATZ: In that room was... KARL: And he couldn't come up with a -- with -- well, I don't really know. I kind of leave God out of that. I think he kind of misunderstands Evangelicalism. RADDATZ: OK, Bill, we -- we also saw Scott Walker officially jump into the race this week. He's still doing well in the polls, both in Iowa and nationally. What's his vulnerability? KRISTOL: I don't -- I (INAUDIBLE)... RADDATZ: Maybe nothing? KRISTOL: Yes, I think he's a strong candidate, a Midwestern governor who governed successfully, won three times in four years in a -- in a state that President Obama carried twice in that same period. And I think that Trump will go away. I don't buy the argument that there is a huge number of un -- Jennifer wants to make it seem like this huge chunk of the Republican Party is... KRISTOL: -- vitriolic. GRANHOLM: I just think that there is... KRISTOL: It was the Democrats yesterday... GRANHOLM: -- there is a number... KRISTOL: -- who hooted at a huge left-wing convention, who hooted Bernie Sanders and O'Malley, Governor O'Malley, off the stage for not being left-wing enough. Governor O'Malley said black lives matter, white lives matter, all lives matter. Unacceptable in the Democratic Party. RADDATZ: I -- I want to move on to Iran since I just got back from Iran... RADDATZ: -- it's a particularly interesting to me. LZ, you Tweeted this week questioning Republicans like Senator Tom Cotton, who criticizing the deal. You said, ""All about 6's -- Senator Cotton, who has been in office for like six months, takes on the six nations that have been working on this Iran deal since 2006."" Is there like a 666 thing... GRANDERSON: It was (INAUDIBLE)... RADDATZ: -- going there? GRANDERSON: I just thought it was kind of curious that the number sixes kept appearing. And... GRANDERSON: And the way that the conversation continues to happen, especially domestically, I spent a couple of weeks in London. I was there for ESPN covering Wimbledon. And I can tell you that the conversation that's happening abroad in terms of this deal is totally different than the way that it's being promoted here or talked about here. Here, it's all through the lens of America. It's all through Congress, what Congress has to say. Abroad, it's about what's in it for Russia, what's in it for China, how does it impact the U.K.? It's a lot more about the breadth j the width of this deal and not just domestically. And I think that's important as we have this conversation here. This isn't about whether or not Obama negotiated a bad deal. This is about whether or not the six nations involved in the conversation found this deal to be advantageous versus the current status quo. That's the conversation we need to be having. KRISTOL: Do you think Congress doesn't have a right to say -- to weigh in? GRANDERSON: No, no, no. Part of the conversation is how Congress feels about it. But Congress isn't the leader of... KRISTOL: I'm sorry... GRANDERSON: -- the U.K., is not the leader of... KRISTOL: Well, that's right. GRANDERSON: It's not the (INAUDIBLE)... KRISTOL: So Congress should (INAUDIBLE)... GRANDERSON: -- of Russia. KRISTOL: -- on whether America... KRISTOL: -- goes along with this deal. GRANDERSON: -- for -- for America. GRANDERSON: But as Americans, we need to have a conversation about well, who else is impacted by this and what are their thoughts on this, as well, because that should influence us to have an intelligent conversation about it and not just one that's solely based upon us. RADDATZ: So let's quickly move to the Hill very quickly. Governor, do you think it -- what happens on the Hill? GRANHOLM: Well, I -- I do think that people should actually take a look at Hillary Clinton's statement on this, because this is not the end of the story. She says it's a beginning, it's a first step. There are a lot of other arrows in the diplomatic quiver to -- to constrain Iran's bad behavior in other areas. This is one thing. And the goal was to reduce Iran's ability to get the bomb and they've done that. KRISTOL: And give them $140... RADDATZ: And Jonathan Karl... KRISTOL: -- billion... RADDATZ: I've got -- I'm going to give you 10 seconds, because you know what that means. KARL: Well, I will tell you that I -- the White House thinks that they can keep this disapproval resolution from passing the Congress by getting at least 41 ""no"" votes in the Senate. That means they can hold most of the Democrats. I don't know if that's the case, but they have -- they're off to a good start. RADDATZ: And -- and what would this do to President Obama's foreign policy legacy? You've got 10 seconds. GRANHOLM: Yes. I think it is a tremendous legacy, because it shows that America can lead with allies in strategic coalitions. It doesn't have to be American unilateralism and cowboyism. RADDATZ: OK, thanks, all of you, very much. We'll keep an eye on it. We may not know the results of it for quite a long time. Finally this morning, the heroes killed in the Tennessee terror attack -- four Marines and one sailor. Some of these brave men survived wars overseas only to tragically fall here at home. We remember these remarkable Americans. RADDATZ: And please remember. That's all for us today. Thanks for sharing part of your Sunday with us. Check out ""World News Tonight."" And we'll see you back here next week."

Keith Ashdown, the spokesman and chief sloganeer for a watchdog group, had been stewing about how to describe Alaska's Gravina Island Bridge in a news release. He wanted a catchy phrase that expressed the huge cost and dubious need for the milelong span. Then, as he stood beneath a Miller Lite sign at a bar called the Hawk 'n' Dove, he had a brainstorm. ""Bridge to nowhere!"" Four years later, the phrase has done what few political slogans can do. It shaped public opinion, influenced an election and pressured Congress to change its rules. Mentioned hundreds of times in newspapers, on TV and at countless dinner tables, it became shorthand for political pork and a Congress that was out of touch. ""It was an extraordinarily powerful image,"" said Rep. Adam Putnam, R-Bartow. ""It became a metaphor for a Republican majority that had lost its way on fiscal responsibility."" Language columnist William Safire called it ""the phrase that launched a thousand editorials."" Columnist George Will wrote after the November election: ""Republicans now know where the bridge to nowhere leads: to the political wilderness."" This is the story of three words that changed American politics. 'Pillow-talk pork' Ashdown is an unlikely Washington power broker. He has never held elected office, he's not a lawyer and he rarely wears a tie. A stocky 34-year-old with a deep voice and a belly built by beer, he looks more linebacker than lobbyist. He works for Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington group that opposes corruption and government waste. He plays a unique role in the Washington power structure: part detective, part press agent. He gets tips about government shenanigans, verifies them, and then passes them to reporters with snappy quotes they can't resist. He described a project that helped a lawmaker's wife as ""pillow-talk pork"" and said Pentagon officials have ""spent money like Paris Hilton at a shoe sale."" Better than most in the nation's capital, Ashdown understands that the fewest words often say the most. That's why on that night at the bar in December 2002, he was determined to find just the right ones. The Golden Fleece He had learned of the Gravina Island Bridge a year earlier from an Alaskan environmentalist. He decided the $190-million bridge would be good for the Golden Fleece, a legendary award for dubious federal spending. The bridge would link the greater Ketchikan area, which has about 13,000 residents, with an island of 50 inhabitants that is home to the town's airport. It would replace a passenger ferry, but its main purpose was to encourage development on the island. ""It was really a bridge to the future of the community,"" said Blaine Ashcraft, executive director of the Greater Ketchikan Chamber of Commerce. Ashdown saw a boondoggle. His challenge was to make an obscure Alaskan bridge interesting, to find colorful words that would break through the din of messages competing for the public's attention. He was by no means the first to use the phrase ""bridge to nowhere."" It has been used for decades to describe unpopular bridges, including spans from Pittsburgh to Pensacola. On June 12, 2003, Ashdown issued a press release announcing the Golden Fleece award was going to Rep. Don Young, the Alaska Republican who sponsored the bridge. At first, it looked like the effort was off to a great start. Within hours, the Associated Press in Alaska published a story. But the phrase did not appear. Months went by. No one used the phrase. Ashdown was discouraged. All that work and all he had to show for it was one measly AP story. 'A little oinker' In the spring of 2004, Ashdown got a call from Timothy Egan of the New York Times, who was writing a story about the Gravina bridge and another one known as Knik Arm in Anchorage. During several interviews with Egan, Ashdown said ""bridge to nowhere"" at least 40 times. Egan's story, ""Built With Steel, Perhaps, but Greased With Pork,"" ran on the front page of the Times on Saturday, April 10, 2004. It marked the media debut of the phrase Ashdown, in Paragraph 16: ""It's a gold-plated bridge to nowhere ..."" and it portrayed the bridge as part of a money-grab by Alaska's congressional delegation. Egan quoted Young, who chaired the powerful transportation committee, boasting that he wanted to be ""a little oinker."" Once again, it looked like Ashdown's phrase was about to take off. The next day, on Meet the Press, when Sen. John McCain was asked about boosting military spending without increasing the deficit, he complained about ""bridges to nowhere in Alaska."" But again it fell flat. Despite Ashdown's salesmanship, the bridge to nowhere wasn't ready for prime time. The span was merely a proposal and had not been approved by Congress. The 2004 presidential campaign was dominating the news and voters weren't especially bothered about political pork. Smoking pot? In the summer of 2005, when Congress began considering a highway bill, there was an uptick of interest in the bridge. Journalists repeated the phrase in stories that skewered the pork-laden bill. At this point, Alaska leaders might have been able to quash the controversy if they had given a cogent defense of the bridge. The state had been blessed with two lawmakers who had the clout to get millions for the bridge - Young and Sen. Ted Stevens. But they also happened to be two of the most mercurial lawmakers in the U.S. Capitol. As criticism mounted, Young, who had boasted that he stuffed the bill ""like a turkey,"" told the Associated Press that, ""These people keep saying it's nowhere, they're just smoking pot."" The opposition was gaining ground, but not quickly enough. Congress passed Young's highway bill, with the bridge tucked inside. On Aug. 10, the president signed it into law. The tale of Ashdown's phrase might have ended here. But two stories gave it new life. Duke Cunningham, a California lawmaker under investigation, had drawn attention to congressional pork because he had earmarked money for a defense contractor in return for bribes. Then along came Hurricane Katrina. As cost estimates for the hurricane soared, lawmakers on Capitol Hill began looking for expensive federal projects that could be cut or delayed. The bridge to nowhere was the perfect target. 'Kiss my ear' Suddenly, Ashdown's phrase exploded in the media. In editorials, op-ed columns and TV news shows, the bridge was cited as a case study of federal priorities that were out of whack. As McCain said on CNN, ""Do the American people want their tax dollars to go to the victims of Hurricane Katrina - and now Rita - or do they want it to go to a bridge to nowhere?"" An editorial in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch groused about the highway bill ""larded with pork barrel public works projects like bridges to Nowhere, Alaska."" A letter to the editor of the Chattanooga Times Free Press declared that ""$200-million bridges to nowhere in Alaska and other outrageous pork projects have to be eliminated."" Young sneered at his critics' suggestion that he give back the money. ""They can kiss my ear,"" he said. In the Senate, Tom Coburn, R-Okla., proposed cutting federal money from the Gravina and Knik Arm bridges and directing much of it to repair a span in Louisiana damaged by the hurricane. Coburn said it was ""time for us to change our priorities."" Stevens, in an emotional, fist-pounding speech, said Coburn was attacking not the bridges, but Alaska itself. He thundered that it was wrong for a senator to steal another senator's pork. ""I will put the Senate on notice - and I don't kid people - if the Senate decides to discriminate against our state and take money only from our state, I will resign from this body."" Stevens defeated the amendment 82-15. But he hadn't stopped the growing furor around the nation. Pop status Three weeks later, Parade magazine, circulation 34-million, cemented the pop status for the bridge with a cover story titled, ""A Visit to The Bridge to Nowhere."" That marked a turning point when the phrase reached critical mass and began to have serious political consequences. Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., was so worried that he wrote to House Speaker Dennis Hastert warning that the phrase was damaging their party. ""Ask anyone what the 'bridges to nowhere' are and they will tell you they are a serious example of a Republican Congress bringing home some of the most expensive bacon in history on the taxpayers' dime,"" Flake wrote. Across the nation, in campaign events and town hall meetings, members of Congress heard a chorus of complaints about the bridge to nowhere. It seemed everyone knew about it. On the CBS-TV drama Threshold, one of the characters spoke derisively of the government paying for ""bridges to nowhere."" In the St. Petersburg Times, a letter to the editor used the phrase to lambast government funding for a bridge on the 15th hole at the Dunedin Country Club. Ashdown's phrase spawned imitators. There was the ""wall to nowhere"" (the border fence between the United States and Mexico), the ""runway to nowhere"" (at the St. Louis airport) and the ""railway to nowhere"" (a rail line in Mississippi). But Rep. Young, oblivious to the growing PR problem, scoffed at the criticism and disputed Flake's claim that the bridge was harming their party. ""He hasn't got any traction,"" Young told the Anchorage Daily News. ""He's a dog lying on ice right now: He's scratching a lot but he doesn't go anywhere."" In Ketchikan, community leaders were frustrated. In their view, the news media distorted the story, but they couldn't agree on how to respond and opted to say little. As a result, the national debate remained lopsided. The critics kept attacking, but Stevens, Young and the Ketchikan leaders failed to mount a forceful response. Collateral damage Congressional leaders had tried to quell the controversy by removing the earmarks for Gravina and Knik Arm from a spending bill, but they did not cut Alaska's transportation money by the same amount, so the state was still free to build the bridges with federal dollars. The phrase, fueled by the Parade cover story, a segment on ABC's 20/20 and countless mentions on talk radio, kept spreading. As the 2006 campaigns got underway, Flake's prediction was coming true: The bridge had become a serious political liability. Amazingly, a bridge to a tiny Alaska island was now an issue in House and Senate races in Rhode Island, Michigan, New York and Minnesota. It came up in debates and was a dependable attack line against Republican incumbents. Brian Riedl, an analyst with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the phrase was as evocative as the $400 hammer that symbolized Pentagon waste in the 1980s. In Rhode Island, Republican Sen. Lincoln Chafee was pummeled from the right and the left for voting with Stevens on the bridge. The conservative Club for Growth ran TV ads that blasted him for supporting ""that bridge to nowhere boondoggle up in Alaska."" Chafee ended up losing his seat. Analysts say the bridge was a factor.

Three words that changed U.S. How ""bridge to nowhere"" shaped an election, and the Congress. WASHINGTON - Like so many Washington tales, this one begins in a bar. Keith Ashdown, the spokesman and chief sloganeer for a watchdog group, had been stewing about how to describe Alaska's Gravina Island Bridge in a news release. He wanted a catchy phrase that expressed the huge cost and dubious need for the milelong span. Then, as he stood beneath a Miller Lite sign at a bar called the Hawk 'n' Dove, he had a brainstorm. Four years later, the phrase has done what few political slogans can do. It shaped public opinion, influenced an election and pressured Congress to change its rules. Mentioned hundreds of times in newspapers, on TV and at countless dinner tables, it became shorthand for political pork and a Congress that was out of touch. ""It was an extraordinarily powerful image,"" said Rep. Adam Putnam, R-Bartow. ""It became a metaphor for a Republican majority that had lost its way on fiscal responsibility."" Language columnist William Safire called it ""the phrase that launched a thousand editorials."" Columnist George Will wrote after the November election: ""Republicans now know where the bridge to nowhere leads: to the political wilderness."" This is the story of three words that changed American politics. Ashdown is an unlikely Washington power broker. He has never held elected office, he's not a lawyer and he rarely wears a tie. A stocky 34-year-old with a deep voice and a belly built by beer, he looks more linebacker than lobbyist. He works for Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington group that opposes corruption and government waste. He plays a unique role in the Washington power structure: part detective, part press agent. He gets tips about government shenanigans, verifies them, and then passes them to reporters with snappy quotes they can't resist. He described a project that helped a lawmaker's wife as ""pillow-talk pork"" and said Pentagon officials have ""spent money like Paris Hilton at a shoe sale."" Better than most in the nation's capital, Ashdown understands that the fewest words often say the most. That's why on that night at the bar in December 2002, he was determined to find just the right ones. He had learned of the Gravina Island Bridge a year earlier from an Alaskan environmentalist. He decided the $190-million bridge would be good for the Golden Fleece, a legendary award for dubious federal spending. The bridge would link the greater Ketchikan area, which has about 13,000 residents, with an island of 50 inhabitants that is home to the town's airport. It would replace a passenger ferry, but its main purpose was to encourage development on the island. ""It was really a bridge to the future of the community,"" said Blaine Ashcraft, executive director of the Greater Ketchikan Chamber of Commerce. Ashdown saw a boondoggle. His challenge was to make an obscure Alaskan bridge interesting, to find colorful words that would break through the din of messages competing for the public's attention. He was by no means the first to use the phrase ""bridge to nowhere."" It has been used for decades to describe unpopular bridges, including spans from Pittsburgh to Pensacola. On June 12, 2003, Ashdown issued a press release announcing the Golden Fleece award was going to Rep. Don Young, the Alaska Republican who sponsored the bridge. At first, it looked like the effort was off to a great start. Within hours, the Associated Press in Alaska published a story. But the phrase did not appear. Months went by. No one used the phrase. Ashdown was discouraged. All that work and all he had to show for it was one measly AP story. In the spring of 2004, Ashdown got a call from Timothy Egan of the New York Times, who was writing a story about the Gravina bridge and another one known as Knik Arm in Anchorage. During several interviews with Egan, Ashdown said ""bridge to nowhere"" at least 40 times. Egan's story, ""Built With Steel, Perhaps, but Greased With Pork,"" ran on the front page of the Times on Saturday, April 10, 2004. It marked the media debut of the phrase Ashdown, in Paragraph 16: ""It's a gold-plated bridge to nowhere ..."" and it portrayed the bridge as part of a money-grab by Alaska's congressional delegation. Egan quoted Young, who chaired the powerful transportation committee, boasting that he wanted to be ""a little oinker."" Once again, it looked like Ashdown's phrase was about to take off. The next day, on Meet the Press, when Sen. John McCain was asked about boosting military spending without increasing the deficit, he complained about ""bridges to nowhere in Alaska."" But again it fell flat. Despite Ashdown's salesmanship, the bridge to nowhere wasn't ready for prime time. The span was merely a proposal and had not been approved by Congress. The 2004 presidential campaign was dominating the news and voters weren't especially bothered about political pork. In the summer of 2005, when Congress began considering a highway bill, there was an uptick of interest in the bridge. Journalists repeated the phrase in stories that skewered the pork-laden bill. At this point, Alaska leaders might have been able to quash the controversy if they had given a cogent defense of the bridge. The state had been blessed with two lawmakers who had the clout to get millions for the bridge - Young and Sen. Ted Stevens. But they also happened to be two of the most mercurial lawmakers in the U.S. Capitol. As criticism mounted, Young, who had boasted that he stuffed the bill ""like a turkey,"" told the Associated Press that, ""These people keep saying it's nowhere, they're just smoking pot."" The opposition was gaining ground, but not quickly enough. Congress passed Young's highway bill, with the bridge tucked inside. On Aug. 10, the president signed it into law. The tale of Ashdown's phrase might have ended here. But two stories gave it new life. Duke Cunningham, a California lawmaker under investigation, had drawn attention to congressional pork because he had earmarked money for a defense contractor in return for bribes. Then along came Hurricane Katrina. As cost estimates for the hurricane soared, lawmakers on Capitol Hill began looking for expensive federal projects that could be cut or delayed. The bridge to nowhere was the perfect target. Suddenly, Ashdown's phrase exploded in the media. In editorials, op-ed columns and TV news shows, the bridge was cited as a case study of federal priorities that were out of whack. As McCain said on CNN, ""Do the American people want their tax dollars to go to the victims of Hurricane Katrina - and now Rita - or do they want it to go to a bridge to nowhere?"" An editorial in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch groused about the highway bill ""larded with pork barrel public works projects like bridges to Nowhere, Alaska."" A letter to the editor of the Chattanooga Times Free Press declared that ""$200-million bridges to nowhere in Alaska and other outrageous pork projects have to be eliminated."" Young sneered at his critics' suggestion that he give back the money. ""They can kiss my ear,"" he said. In the Senate, Tom Coburn, R-Okla., proposed cutting federal money from the Gravina and Knik Arm bridges and directing much of it to repair a span in Louisiana damaged by the hurricane.

http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2016/jul/08/brad-schimel/do-more-people-die-wisconsin-overdoses-car-crashes/	"""More people now die in Wisconsin from drug overdoses than car crashes."""	true	['Drugs']	http://host.madison.com/	http://host.madison.com/wsj/opinion/column/brad-schimel-lessons-from-prince-s-overdose-death/article_2c48d5d0-2a85-5d8d-afe5-a72a3e5ccce4.html	2016/07/08	SaveIn the weeks since the tragic passing of visionary musician Prince, many speculate his death may have been linked to drug abuse. We now know his death resulted from an overdose of the opiate medication Fentanyl.Prince’s hits were all over the radio when I was in my 20s and 30s. He was a truly gifted artist, and he will be missed by many fans. Out of his death, his fans and everyone noting his passing should take away two very important lessons.First, we as a society must work harder to reduce the stigma that surrounds substance addiction. As people speculated about the cause of Prince’s death, what judgments were they forming, perhaps even just subconsciously? Did they think he must be weak or of low moral character?Too often, society attaches labels such as those to people who are suffering from addiction. The truth is that addiction is a disease. We would not view people with leukemia or diabetes as deserving to suffer or die because they have the misfortune of being struck with a disease. What do we think, though, when we hear a news story about a person who died from a drug overdose?About 10 percent of Americans suffer from substance addiction. Addiction knows no socio-economic, gender, geographic or racial boundaries. For many people struggling with addiction and their families, it is kept secret because they fear the judgments they will face from others. As a result, they don’t seek help when they should.Prince seemed to have some quirks that go with being a celebrity, but I have never seen anything that suggests he was weak or a person of bad character. It is time to start looking at others who struggle with addiction compassionately and supportively. The odds are high that someone you care about suffers from this disease, and perhaps that person hasn’t sought help and is afraid of what you will think. It is time to change that.Second, I hope the passing of this music legend teaches us that no one is immune to the dangers that come with the abuse of prescription painkillers. They are highly addictive and can be deadly when abused. As a multi-millionaire, Prince had resources far beyond anything available to most of us. He could have afforded the best treatment available. Still, it took his life.This is probably not the first time opiates caused Prince serious health dangers. He had cancelled a concert due to a health concern prior to his fatal overdose. I don’t know whether that was opiate-related, but Fentanyl is an extraordinarily strong opiate. It is many times more powerful than heroin that can be purchased on the street.Data shows most people do not start off abusing the strongest painkiller. More likely, Prince progressed to abusing such a strong drug after his body built up a higher tolerance for less potent prescription medications. Here is a frightening fact: 80 percent of those who abuse heroin started by abusing prescription pain pills such as Oxycontin, Percoset or Vicodin. Once their tolerance builds, they seek ever higher doses or more powerful opiates. They become helplessly trapped.Opiates took Prince’s life despite his virtually unlimited resources and network of supporters. If it can happen to him, it can happen to any of us. Once addicted, the power of these drugs can be stronger than even the fear of death. And far too often, addiction comes quickly.As a society, we need to make treatment more readily available to those who are addicted. We absolutely need to lock up those who prey on our society by trafficking deadly drugs, especially to young people, but we will not incarcerate our way out of this public health crisis.Ultimately, our best chance to stem the nationwide opiate and heroin crisis is prevention.We must alter our view of opiates. More people now die in Wisconsin from drug overdoses than car crashes. Prescription opiates, not heroin, are the top killer in our state. In fact, more die from prescription painkillers than from heroin and cocaine combined.Opiates are appropriately prescribed in some circumstances, but they must only be used in exactly the way they are prescribed by a doctor.About 70 percent of the time, when a person begins abusing opiates, they do not get them from a doctor. They acquire them improperly from a family member or a friend. So we all have a role in solving this epidemic by securely storing painkillers in our homes and by properly disposing them.I was sad to learn about Prince’s death. I am even more saddened, though, about the 850 or so of my fellow citizens in our state who die from drug overdoses every year.Let’s not let any of them die in vain. Let’s do something to put an end to this tragic public health crisis. Please go to doseofrealitywi.gov to learn more about how we can make our state safer and healthier.

The standard political reply to that question might well have been, ""My patriotism speaks for itself."" But Obama didn't say that. nullPlaynullInstead the Illinois senator answered the question at length, explaining that he no longer wears such a pin, at least in part, because of the Iraq War. ""You know, the truth is that right after 9/11, I had a pin,"" Obama said. ""Shortly after 9/11, particularly because as we're talking about the Iraq War, that became a substitute for I think true patriotism, which is speaking out on issues that are of importance to our national security, I decided I won't wear that pin on my chest. ""Instead,"" he said, ""I'm going to try to tell the American people what I believe will make this country great, and hopefully that will be a testimony to my patriotism."" In Iowa, some Obama supporters applauded the candidate's fashion statement. Said Carrie Haurum of Waterloo: ""He doesn't need to wear that flag on his lapel. He wears it in his heart."" But talk radio and cable news quickly pounced on the issue. ""It just shows you he's not ready for the big time,"" conservative Laura Ingrams opined on Fox News. Said Sean Hannity: ""Why do we wear pins? Because our country is under attack!"" The Obama campaign declined to expand on the senator's statement. Spokesman Bill Burton said, ""His comments speak for themselves."" But, Obama responded to the mini controversy. ""I'm less concerned with what you're wearing on your lapel than what's in your heart,"" Obama said Thursday while campaigning in Independence, Iowa. ""You show your patriotism by how you treat your fellow Americans, especially those who serve. And you show your patriotism by being true to your values and ideals. And that's what we have to lead with, our values and ideals,"" Obama said. Of course, if he had said that in the first place, he might have avoided any controversy. Obama is not alone in not wearing the Stars and Stripes pin. Most of the candidates do not wear them. The one big exception: former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is rarely without one.

[applause] first of all, let me say that there's no silver bullet in actually trying to get women more economically empower asked8:12 pmhaving more entrepreneurship within women. and also there's no size fits all. it's not the same amount of policies you're actually going to have in the netherlands or in drc or in colombia or pakistan. at least in my travels, that's what i have experienced. financial inclusion one of the very big stumble blocks, i would say, but not the only one. financially inclusion is in combination with many other issues that need to be addressed so that really women can become economically empowered. and i would like to say that this is an issue that is universal. it's true, africa, latin america, asia, but also in my country, the netherlands. i mean, only one-third of all the interprize are actually -- enterprises are actually led by women, so we have work to do. also poverty in some households has the face of women, so we really need to do a lot of work, can and we are doing and we are advancing. but still a lot of work has to be done. what do i see as the challenges8:13 pmapart from financial inclusion? i have to say the improvement of business environment in general for both men and women is extremely important. because if it's easier to do business in a given country, it's going to be easier for a woman to do business in that country. so i think that, you know, general environment for doing business is extremely important. specifically to financial inclusion, i would say there are really laws and regulations that are impeding like sometimes they're unable to open an account, and that's certainly true for many countries. sometimes they are unable to hold property, inherit property. sometimes there are issues of customs, sometimes they cannot get out of the house alone so, therefore, they cannot just go and make a payment in a branch bank, etc. but there are also issues in terms of financial, that make the financial inclusion more difficult which are related to the caring of the family. they have to be -- they have less freedom of movement. they have to stay a lot more at home. they have to also issues in8:14 pmterms of how do they manage the cash. they have to make up for the necessities of a household in terms of health, nutrition, education, water, energy -- let's not forget that as well. so we need to factor these issues in, because those are very clear to the needs of the women. and we also have issues of literacy. literacy in general, but also digital literacy which is extremely important in the future. now, we all know that most of the credit that's been done is mostly -- [inaudible] lending. so if a woman doesn't have a land title, she will have no credit. if she doesn't have credit history, she will have no credit. so these issues need to be addressed. if a woman cannot travel easily, she will not be able to access markets. if she doesn't travel easily again, she cannot open an account or even build up a network, network of people that8:15 pmwill actually set up an enterprise with. and another very important issue that we've found in financial inclusion, entrepreneurship in women around the globe has been women do not have an id, an identification. it's very difficult for them to open an account. so i think it's extremely important to also address these issues. >> so we have a lot of, a lot of issues, but they are all related to financial inclusion, and that's the reason, as i understand you, why you focus so much on that. let's stick a little bit with this question, and i would like to turn to you, min structure freeland. minister freeland. about two months ago your prime minister, trudeau, and president trump launched a new initiative to challenge women business openers. but i have to ask in the year 2017, do we really need more councils, or do we need practical advice and progress? >> well, thank you for the question. and let me start by --8:16 pm[speaking french] [applause] >> i know there's no translation for french, but we're a bilingual country, and i do want to start by really thanking chancellor merkel for inviting us all here and for having the courage to put this issue so firmly on the g20 agenda. it's really important, and kudos. it's a great question, and you're right that a strong view that canada had and that i know ivanka really championed in the white house was that as part of the first meeting between prime minister i trudeau and president trump we wanted there to be an element of what we felt was a really shared agenda between the president and the prime minister which was championing women entrepreneurs. and i think it was one of the most successful elements of our summit, this meeting of the8:17 pmcanada/u.s. women's business council. look, i used to be a journalist. i'm familiar with the criticism of why do you need more councils, you need to have action. and i agree with that, of course, we need action. but you do need a group of actors in order to move forward. and i'm very proud of the group of canadian and u.s. businesswomen who came together. we're working very -- they are working very hard. the idea is that the initiative would strongly come from them with support from our government, and this is a group of very powerful, very dynamic, very creative women leaders. one of the issues that came up during that meeting was women's access to capital. and we've been talking about it very much in a developing world context, but one of the members of the council is a canadian woman entrepreneur, and she said, you know what? it's just harder for a woman out there. even in canada, we like to think8:18 pmof ourselves as an enlightened country. our prime minister is a feminist. he appointed a 50/50 gender-balanced cabinet. yea for justin trudeau. [applause] but, you know, as the queen said, we are very aware that, you know, we don't have a female leader. i accept that, chancellor. [laughter] [applause] touche. [laughter] so, you know, as queen maxima said, we are very aware in canada, i think in the united states too, that, of course, supporting women, women entrepreneur, girls' education, the developing world is a great development tool, but we also have a lot of work still to do at home. and i very much believe that this canada/u.s. women's business council is going to take a real leadership role on both fronts. >> what we are also partly missing you, your majesty8:19 pmalluded to that, referring to women not having ids, for example, and we're missing figures and facts, and i would like to ask you, madame lagarde, from a macroeconomic standpoint, do the numbers on an international scale tell a frustrating or a motivating story? >> both. [laughter] >> would you embellish on that a little bit, please? >> promise. [laughter] >> thank you. >> well, i want to say dank shein, mercy bow cue, thank you so much to the chancellor. because the first w-20 that took place was two years ago in turkey. to have it now in germany under your leadership at the highest level of the country and under joint initiatives, as i understand, to have it promoted as one of the key items of the g20 agenda is fantastic. so thank you very, very much. [applause]8:20 pmand in addition to money that is needed for any initiatives, and you've alluded to that, we also need not just actors, we need activists. because to come back to your question, it's a really disappointing situation that we're facing. and at the same time, it can be really ebb energizing and -- energizing and exciting because there's so much room for progress. you mentioned the 30% women entrepreneurs. well, in low income countries it's each lower than that. -- even lower than that. as soon as you move to the medium-sized enterprises, it goes down to 20%. and if you look at how much access they have to financing, bank account loans, it's about two-fifths of that 20% over 40 employees. so it's a really ridiculously small amount that can have access to financing. so that's thurm one. number two -- number one. number two, the point i would like to make in response to your8:21 pmquestion is that it's an economic no-brainer from a macro point of view because women's empowerment and participation in the economy are a triple bonus. bonus number one, they boost growth, and everybody around the world wants growth, wants jobs. if you were to close the gender gap in the united states, the economy is automatically bigger by 5%. you do the same thing in india, you're talking about 23%. if you do the same thing in japan, you're talking about 9%. so there is in all societies whether they are low incomes, emerging or advanced, there is a bonus to be had by having women join the economy. that's bonus number one -- >> [inaudible] be the brain in not taking advantage of the no-brainer? >> let me get to the other two. by the same token, you reduce inequality. you reduce the gender gap, you reduce inequality. it is demonstrated empirically8:22 pmnow by anybody, except a few e erratics -- [laughter] that if you reduce inequality, you have more growth. and it is more sustainable. so that's also critically important. third bonus, you have a more diversified economy that has more exports, more trade with each other, and it's really also a growth booster. so from those three points of view, it's critically important to bring women to the table. why don't they come? well, i think we have something to do about it. and that's the energizing part. i was, i will be activist for a we could if you'll allow me. -- second if you'll allow me. there are at the moment some big investors who are saying to the companies which they're invested, give us the numbers. tell us, what is the gender difference between salaries at the same level, and a lot of them are saying, oh, we're doing so much already, it's okay, you know? we are head anything the right direction. no -- heading in the right direction. no, give us the numbers and then8:23 pmwe can measure, and then we can move forward. [applause] >> maybe we stick with the numbers for a moment because there are studies, there is research that companies having women on boards and in executive management perform financially better than those who don't. >> true. and we're an example. we have 40% of our executive management team are women, 30% of the board are women, almost 30% are also people of color. and that makes a difference because the conversation is different. and to even go back to something christine just said, i do think this is an importance to councils coming together because it's difficult -- i'll speak from a financial institution. when you're trying to make traditions such as loans, as8:24 pmqueen maxima just raised, you need to think about how to derisk something. that means syndicating that loss, coming together with other financial institutions. the piece that ivanka trump and jim kim put out in the s.p. speaks to that creating a funding of sorts. but the financial institutions, i think, are more prepared than ever because we see the kind of growth, the kind of opportunity that ms. lagarde just spoke about. and, of course, success begets success. and just in the united states alone, we've seen enormous growth with women in small business. they are more reliable, they will put more money back into the community, and for those reasons alone, it's important. but without the council, without the discussion, without the discussion about the practical issues of derisking or syndicating both loss and profit, then it's very difficult8:25 pmto think that this is just going to take off. so although that can seem cumbersome, without it, it's not going to happen. >> mrs. trump, you're op-ed in the f.t. was just mentioned. i would like to take a minute to clarify something. you're the first daughter of the united states, and you're also an assistant to the u.s. president. as part of the audience, especially the german audience is not that familiar with the concept of a first daughter. i'd like to ask you -- [laughter] what is your role and whom are you representing, your father as the president of the united states, the american people or your business? >> well, certainly not the latter, and i amarather unfamiliar -- am rather unfamiliar with this role as well, as it is quite new to me. it has been a little under a hundred days, but it has just8:26 pmbeen a remarkable and incredible journey. so, you know, as an entrepreneur and as an individual prior to this in the private sector, i cared very much about empowering women in the workplace. and the opportunity to have an elevated platform, to be able to sit here on this stage -- and thank you, chancellor, for your very gracious invitation. i am humbled to be here with so many formidable leaders to engage in dialogue, to learn, to bring the advice, to bring the knowledge back to the united states, back to both my father and the president. and hopefully, that will bring about incremental, positive change, and that is my goal. so this is very early for me. i'm listening, i'm learning, i'm defining the ways in which i think that i'll be able to have impact. i'm seeking the counsel, to use your word, of informed and thoughtful women and men.8:27 pmand i'm really striving to think about how best to empower women in the economy both domestically and across the global because it's all interrelated. so it's been, it's been wonderful to date, and i have no doubt that coming out of this trip i'll be all the more informed. >> you wrote an op-ed in the financial times today, you wrote: we know what works, regarding women in business. and if we know what works, first question, why don't we do it? and the second question, are you sure that what works for you as a first daughter will also work for every other woman in the world? >> no. i think we represent 50% of the population, so there is no one size fits all when you think about women in the workplace or women as job creators. and then you have the cultural overlay which differs from country to country, from region to region, within countries. there are enormous problems. i feel fortunate in america that those problems are less than in other areas of the world when we8:28 pmthink about gender inequality, but we still have formidable problems in our own right. when you think about the fact that 30% of u.s. privately-owned businesses are women businesses, that leaves tremendous potential for growth and for engagement. of that 30%, only 16% of those businesses have employees beyond the owner. so when you think about the potential women have both to expand as entrepreneurs and to become more robust employers with our economy, it's incredibly exciting. there's a lot of wood to chop, and we're not right there. we're not there yet. and i think one of the interesting things is the problems are identifiable. we know what they look like, and they're the same across the globe, just with varying degrees of severity. the solutions and the tactical8:29 pmmeans to get to the right outcome will differ. and i think one of the great opportunities we have is as we travel and as we talk to knowledgeable and informed people is to find out what works in their countries and cultures. i know that chancellor merkel just this past march, you passed an equal pay legislation to promote transparency and to try to finally narrow that gender pay gap. and that's something we should all be looking at, to see the efficacy of that policy as it gets rolled out. so there's a robust, dynamic and ever-moving discussion. it's a political discussion, it's policy-oriented as we think about paid leave. sadly, the united states is one of the only countries in the world, the only developed country in the world that doesn't have a paid leave policy for the benefit of families. so that is something i'm very,8:30 pmvery proud of my father's advocacy. long before he came into the presidency, but during the campaign including in the primaries he's been a tremendous champion of supporting families and enabling them to thrive. in the new reality of -- >> you hear the reaction from the audience, so i need to address one more point. some attitudes towards women your father has publicly displayed in former times might leave one questioning whether he's such an empower for women. how do you relate to that or are things changing? what's your comment on that? >> i've certainly heard the criticism from the media, and that's been perpetuated. but i know from personal experience and i think the thousands of women who have worked with and for my father for decades when he was in the private sector are a testament to his belief and solid conviction in the potential of8:31 pmwomen and their ability to do the job as well as any man. so i think in my personal experience -- and you were asking me about my role as daughter and also adviser -- as a daughter, i can speak on a very personal level knowing that he encouraged me and enabled me to thrive. i grew up in a house where there was no barriers the what i could accomplish beyond my own perseverance and my own tenacity. and i don't take that lightly as a parent now myself. that's not an easy thing to do, and he did that, and he provided that for us. there was no difference from my and my brothers. and i think as a business leader you saw that, and as the president you will absolutely see that. >> we will be curious in watching. thank you. you are an example how a woman can run, successfully run a business. you inherited and took over a longstanding family-owned business. do you think you would have8:32 pmbecome an entrepreneur either way, regardless of your family history? >> i don't think so. i have to be honest. i'll switch into german now because chancellor merkel and i i agreed that we are on german grounds, and we are germans -- >> translator: we will speak german. before i got into management i work in the company and it made sense. cuesta women get specific8:33 pmattention at your company to be empowered, accelerated in whatever way? >> they say this is revolutionary in germany. every two years you can specify how much you want to work you can work remotely but we also offer the same things two men. i want to say clearly we only, we have a chance if we take the men along. so we have couples in our company. there are many who basically have shifts that they coordinate so that they will you work 60 to 80 percent for a few years and i think of the children or the animals or i take care of older people and then they change around and we do the same thing with companies.8:34 pmfor example we have an exchange of opinion would basically can have adjusted shifts. so have to work with the men, not against them. >> that is a good statement. we are an all-female panel. we are an exemption so something very interesting. but still it is about women and men to take the task together. and you were named social entrepreneur of the year in 2011 in africa by the world economic forum and were most recently among forbes 50 most greatest leaders. what is your motivation for becoming entrepreneur? >> thank you so much for the kind question. my motivation is solving problems. we have got lots of intractable problems around the world.8:35 pmwhen it comes to some of the problems we see around data collection. that the collaboration with my friends and colleagues at the time led to creating -- a crowdsourcing platform. also an organization that has since gone on to create more types of software and also to create other companies in kenya. the motivation is really solving problems. be at the information flow problem and then later, with handling problems around conductivity. where we have issues around electricity and reliability. that is truly, that is the basis of my motivation and i think just to go back to the question of problems. if we look at some of the emerging problems right now that are of a global nature, one of those is climate change.8:36 pmand that affects many people around the world and unfortunately, the people who bear the brunt of conflict of changes in weather patterns. be it farmers or people in the informal economy. that burden is carried by women. if we can just paint a picture if you see a visual of a woman carrying a child on their back. and having to flee from one area because of lack of resources. lack of access to water, education, so these are really big problems that not only require us to have global intervention but also to bring to bear the innovation that we are seeing actually in the developing countries. does a fantastic company called farm drive.8:37 pmwhich is supported by -- and others. and even companies like safari on that i'm looking at these problems. in figuring out how they are responding to his problems through business. the question for us today here is what are the concrete practical things we can do to shore up the international partitions that we need so when that woman is carrying that child and flee from a conflict, is there a support system where she is going to are there financial systems that she can tap into? identity systems that she can tap into? is she going into places where there is an ecosystem that can help them to succeed? because a lot of them also entrepreneurs. >> the living conditions you are eluding to our different in8:38 pmdifferent parts of the world. if we take a look at germany, one of the leading industries and economies in the world. madam chancellor, we did interview last year together. he told me the picture yourself managing a cafc or restaurant. which i found very inspiring and interesting. turned in preparation for this panel i asked myself is the first female chancellor of such an entrepreneurial spirit why the silicates that only one of the 10 starts in germany is founded by a woman? >> well, just like i was not able to do this until now with a start, many others will have the same experience because they are still many barriers. but first let me return the things that will express you. i want to thank the german8:39 pmwomen's council and all the female entrepreneurs who have arranged this event of civil society and arrange the panel so can take place in germany. i think it is very important. many parts of society, young people, women included but the fact that women represent more than 50 percent of our society and the fact that have a separate -- of course also in germany we can say that the female entrepreneurs are not represented as a majority. we want to encourage people as is the case in the developing countries, therefore it was a very interesting experience when i visited the american president donald trump and i observed how the canadian prime8:40 pmminister had taken place and i think it was a very interesting discussion with female entrepreneurs at that time. and it showed what progress could be made. i think that during my visit he did something similar. that we talked about skills and training of young people. how can our companies get better and this combination of skills and then also the courage to start a business is something that can add up. this must apply the same to developing countries as it does to our advanced countries. this is the new model and we have a role model as -- can speak from her own experience and can offer much that shows how family and work can be contactable so it is important. it is very important to me.8:41 pmone reason why ivanka trump is here is the idea which is also currently being discussed with how can we improve access to financial means? we want to improve that it is something that we want to have introduced to the political process and perhaps we can have an answer later on because i have an idea. that the process we had the idea of closing the gap between the genders with respect to work. we have about 50 percent of the women that work in 7476 percent of men, it has to be closed and as christine lagarde said we have to have the impact on growth. there we have the question of entrepreneurial ship. and we know from micro loans and nothing is as successful as credit to women.8:42 pmbecause they are much closer to the family life and their development actually impacts families much more.and so we had to consider how can we get from government support to teach from two actual loans and credit. this is an area where we have to make efforts both in our advanced countries and in our developing countries. if you look at the interest rates, and development banks it shows that rates are so high that no one can get loans. especially women. so the idea is to establish a special facility to provide access to women. especially in developing countries because credit worthiness has been proven by the microcredit was better for women, they were lower because women thought better about8:43 pmthat. could we say something about the special facility. the special facility should mean that we consider looking for countries among the nation's and i think germany must participate. we invited the country canada, united states, and some private sources with her they would contribute and that we would have that and the world bank and then have the possibility because of the loan capability to leverage it. for example 20 million becomes 200 or 200 and become 2 billion and then we can work with that and it can be made available to women in the developing countries. we are trying to discuss it with all of the other participants and if we have a good approach today than we have made major progress.8:44 pm[applause] >> when you like to comment on this? >> or think. i think it would be a really big first death and i think your point about microcredit is actually quite apropos i think. and really encouraging is that there are african women in kenya and other areas are creating companies. an example is paris. in kenya with her cofounder who created a company called farm drive. they do alternative scoring. by creating a profile of farmers and writing credit to those farmers. we are starting to see the creation of second generation and third generation enterprises on the basis of financial technology systems like the ones that the queen supported. the first sort of base platform on which some of these services are being created.8:45 pmit is very encouraging. and i hope some of that fun can also be provided for supporting innovation and technology. i think innovation and technology can help to accelerate the inclusion of women and making it not just transactional inclusion but also transformational. and helping to lift more people out of poverty by making them more wealthy. >> i think this is a very important point as we think towards not only the present but the future. and to look at the role of technology that it is playing in our lives. we cannot go online, we live online. and yet women, while this provides tremendous opportunity for the upside, there is also a challenge that exist today. -- we look across the globe in c1.7 billion women do not have8:46 pmaccess to a smart phone. and you see that as a deterrent for them fully participating in the economy of present as well as the economy of the future. plus you think about the role of skills-based education. and this is something that i was very excited to hear from chancellor merkel and her team of incredible entrepreneurs from germany that she went to the us in conjunction with some remarkable entrepreneurs are on to really discuss the growth of vocational education and skill based training. it really impacts this next generation of women and girls. it is critical to focus on that role of them and the fact that women's participation in stem fields, science technology engineering and math is moving in the wrong direction. despite the fact that we think about the future, so many of the highest paying most lucrative jobs are coming in8:47 pmthat arena. you see the divided a corporate level and leadership level. just in terms of the number of students graduating with those degrees.for women in the united states, in a field of computer science the numbers have gone from the low 30s to now the low 20s over the course of a little over a decade. so that is something that we really have to think about how to reverse their message in, education, engaging girls in stem fields much younger and integrating them into the curriculum in a modern and updated way. that inspires and engages them. that is something that has become a huge priority for the administration and it is something that we are very focused on. [applause] >> do you allow me to pay tribute to the chancellor first and if you want to transition to digital i would like to follow up with juliana rotich was saying. yes? thank you. i would like to bring policies8:48 pmmicro and macro together. on the policy front the announcement of the setting up of the women entrepreneurs fund is fantastic. i think it doesn't go without policies. and i am known in germany for complaining about the surplus of germany. okay. [laughter] i know that. [laughter] i really want to pay tribute to the chancellor for the spending. the public spending in childcare centers and the efforts that have been put into the budget for that. [applause] now you can include former and current female and family ministers. >> yes, of course. female ministers included of course.follow up on juliana rotich! i think it is a important move in the digitally want this to touch on. because the real study that she is explaining to us brings8:49 pmtogether the private sector that you just mentioned.but also the central bank. this is how the story goes. correct me if i get that wrong. the central bank realized suddenly that the number of microloans were massive between 3:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. in the morning. in other words, using the system which essentially mixing banking telecommunications together. i found out that there was massive microcredit taken out at the time of the day. why was that? because the women who were the street retailers were actually taking out microcredit at that point in time in order to pay the wholesaler. they were calling me little driver who would actually take the vegetable and fruit to the corner where they work. in the meantime they were looking after the family. sometimes fetching water, sometimes looking after the kids to make sure they went to school. so that exit same as everybody had been paid, the wholesaler,8:50 pmthe writer, they can go on the street corner, do their business and at the end of the day they would reimburse the microcredit that they had at that time of the day. now, where the micro and macro go together is that the central bank was able to identify those movements. identify the women who were doing the business and to build a credit history that that allowed them to access to much better financing. and that is a fantastic story of how digital connection can be leveraged to move financing for micro to something much bigger. it is a fantastic kenyan story. [applause] >> can you relate to that? >> definitely. and kenya we started rolling out -- and all of the regulatory challenges that they brought. we were really working with a lot of countries trying to change those rules and regulations to make digital mobile banking finance possible. and like you said, it is extremely important especially8:51 pmfor women with great potential. because women like you very well mentioned, they have other realities. sometimes you have to stay at home. they have much more need for privacy. for example, the much more prone to theft. they need to keep their money away from the husband and other family members so they can actually, you're laughing but they have to pay the school fees. they have to pay the next doctor's bills. and this is not money that should be spent on frugality's. and it is extremely important for women to keep, to have their own safe place to keep their money. and also to build credit history. when the mobile financial service that this woman actually pays and handles in your case, 10,000 shillings every day. 50,000 shillings every day. this woman can get a working loan of easy 50,000 shillings. which before was not possible. she can even start then building on and actually having insurance.8:52 pmbecause the issue is not so much getting people out of poverty but keeping them out of poverty. because one drought, one flood, that can happen in north and you and it is all back to zero. so it is extremely important today given the potential to really make it a reality for women. but she mentioned two things. one is connectivity. and ms. trump mentioned as well. not only do they have access to mobile phones, when they do, the phone is actually less marked phone and when they do they actually use it less. so we really need to. >> guest: the mobile network operators to see how we can actually give the for example, bundles with husband and wife and they both get the equal type of phone. and they all get the equal type of data. there is a great example of that in north iraq. then there's also the issue of last mile.there has to be --8:53 pmconnectivity for women is not an election and work it is a source of information. a way to make payments, a way to save, a way to get informed about vaccinations. it is extremely important. even cm projects are paying solar panels on a weekly basis. what they're saving on kerosene to actually through the mobile phone. and it has only been made possible through mobile phones. that is one issue, productivity. the second issue is most mobile network operators do not even know how many women they have as clients. they don't even know actually what, they do not even have women as a special segment. i think that we really need to be much more customer centric. because there are a lot of mobile bank accounts around in the world, the usage is a big issue. it has to do with digital literacy. the products and not really catered to women. so giving a special service from three to 5 o'clock in the8:54 pmmorning is extremely important. to thomas for example, not just a savings account that when they get harvest to really basically advertise. now you can say, you start planting again. so that you can have an increase in yield. it is extremely important. we have to study the needs, the underlying needs of women who really design the products so they can really make use of it and have a fantastic social impact. >> that is almost unbelievable that the telecommunication providers do not know about their female clients. i would like to take this to you -- is it true or does bank of america have a specific approach to serve female customers and even develop programs or entrepreneurial approaches? >> bank of america operates mostly developed countries and of course you have big databases and it is easy to evaluate of course we use that. but just to. >> guest: the idea of microcredit.8:55 pmthe challenge of microcredit is not only that they are very high rates too high and they are not sustainable. the only way to diminish that is to create scale. the only way to create scale is to have the data. so big financial institutions or ngos will come together to have enough data. just use the united states as an example. there are banks and there are also what we called michael and they come out with community development financial institutions. the way they work is the banks lend to the community development financial institutions. who in turn, lend to men and women. small businesses, their credit is not as good. there probably an earlier stage. so they would not be from a regulatory perspective, bank ready. and yet because we can land to the community development8:56 pmorganizations, vacant land to the individual. they can do it at much lower interest rates. and this is what we need to do on a global scale. that essentially is what i think we are talking about in terms of the world bank. to be able to aggregate enough banks, enough financial institutions will lend to community development groups and then lend at lower rates along with an education piece. >> so what we are coming at this in the digital economy, the two factors you're both talking about, like financial inclusion and availability on the women's side. an literacy or digital literacy on the other side. can come together. >> not only that, i think that if you give a credit also coaching, giving women access to markets is not just one you know silver bullet.you have to give the whole combination of issues. she has to have access to financial services.at the8:57 pmsame time she has had some kind of coaching. some kind of access to market. her whole family situation has to also be taking care of because she will chopper enterprise at the family is having a hard time.so we need to, it is not a one issue. it has to be a concerted effort of interventions. >> we talk a bit about the lack of access to credit and the lack of access to markets that are unique barriers for women that are disproportionately adversely affecting women and in the economy at and the global economy. but there is one thing here over and over again traveling around america and increasingly as a travel for the world. lack of mentors. i think mentor ship, it is an interesting challenge to solve because there is certainly is not one solution.8:58 pmbut women time and time again value the mentorship. and evaluate community and the advice and guidance. and when you talk to female entrepreneurs their networks are smaller than their male counterparts. they have less natural resources of flow and less people to help repel them through the system. i think this is something we have to be thinking about as well. created through mentorship opportunities for women to encourage women and also men to take it upon themselves to foster this next generation and to encourage their growth. and to mentor them through the process. >> one point of the joint council but also mentorship, role modeling is needed and provided. >> absolutely. and that is something that our councilmembers are very enthusiastic about. and they are enthusiastic also about as one of them put it, forcing our male colleagues to do the same thing. and that is really really important.8:59 pmi do want to say i was hoping to see this because mentors are important for all of us. and christine lagarde has been a mentor for me. it is really important for women to support other women. and i'm really grateful to all of the women who are here today.no you are all successful leaders otherwise you would not be here. and i know that you're going to go back home and support other women. and that is tremendously important. and as a volga said it is important that mentorship not being seen as something only women can do for the woman. we had a little bit of a discussion of father's and they used to say that behind every successful man was an even more successful woman. i have a view which is, backed up by sociological research that behind every successful woman is a very supportive father. there is a very supportive correlation between supportive9:00 pmfathers and female professional success. so we know something about the fathers of everyone sitting here. but i wanted to make one other point about this sort of virtuous circle that we've been talking about and supporting female entrepreneurship. women talking about this strong economic of getting women involved in the workforce and is the chancellor we just have more economic growth. it is absolutely true. get women involved in the workforce. have more money and they spend it on the kids and their families. there is a positive social cascading effect. but i am a politician so i want to bring in the politics. and i do think we have to remember as we are working on these programs, there is a reason women have been excluded. there are very deep political and social reasons. women have been cut out of positions of economic power. in efforts which i know we are all leading that are going to bring women into greater9:01 pmpositions of power and are going to be controversial. they're going to cause conflict in families and societies. and i think part of what we need to do is be very aware of that. and part of the effort also needs to be political. and it needs to be about saying you know what, it is good for the mother to have some control of the family budget. it is good for your daughter to be going to school and delay marriage and to go out there and get jobs. i think we have to be very upfront about that.and in any programs that we are building. frankly have to be upfront about the fact that their challenges and all of our own societies around female leadership and women being in charge of money. which is that key thing. >> i like to turn that over because you have been out smoking upon to regulation regarding topics that we were9:02 pmrelated to. like the german equal pay lapeer which you are not so in love with. let me put it like that. so what does it mean if we do not get things going by really setting the stage, even by political measures by regulation. that means you want things just to say how they are? >> well, i don't think i run the danger to act against women here. the question that you raised sits very well to what i want to say. i don't really want to spoil a good wood here. i would like to say that from my own experience, and i'm going to say something about the woman quota. i want to talk about my own company. it is very difficult to motivate women. we offer tremendous amounts, i mentioned already the working hours, the good working model, the flexibility. all of these topics of mentoring. all sorts of topics. we really are very supportive.9:03 pmnevertheless, we have to force many women basically have two force them to take executive positions and they have concerns. the woman in the southern german area, particularly conservative but we have to overcome. and the woman say we have children at home and the grades are going to go down and the boys never study. i have to be home etc. so it is not only depend on the circumstances but you really have to force the woman to accept certain management positions. and that had to be done. and i really don't like the regulatory action. i don't like it when the government gets involved in our business. and i had to say, introduce a secret porta in my company. because i demanded that when we9:04 pmare filling a management position that at least one female candidate has to be part of it. then things will change. but i'm talking specifically about regulatory and having little interference by government. because we can do it ourselves. >> the first of all let me say, i'm really impressed by how they have brought new atmosphere in the business because of the different perspective because she has her own family and for example not having the economics, business administration which shows a business is not so unusual that nobody studied something else could ever lead in management. they have to be a lawyer and economist, business administrator. otherwise you can't even get involved and that is true. you can study languages and still manage a business.9:05 pmthat is the first thing. the second, because he we already have basically where you can't even get into if you are not part of it. and that is a constant back and forth and your political discussion and different ideas about this. how much regulatory action you need and how much legislative action and how the can you do to volunteer activities or incentives. and i say after germany - became an active citizen in west germany. initially i was against having a quorum in my political party. but we found that ultimately had to have a woman in the final selection and then first he didn't have any and then for years -- you are in the management and we always ask, we would beg them. we were not able to get the9:06 pmcompany to have one third of their membership with women. they actually are responsible for having not lost past. i have the honor of being women's minister from 1990 to 1994. if you have women's minister that comes to me in the year 2013 and she says we sell less than 10 percent executives and i can't say we can wait for another 50 years. ultimately we found women who were willing to take the position and now we go on. there are additional controversial discussions. i think that even in the transparency of equal pay for equal work, we found nobody knew it. that was really interesting. there was really nobody knew it except for one person that we have a lot that provides that they have the right to9:07 pmfind out about pay if it is level from woman and men. representatives of the working counsel that amended it really mention it's a woman did not know about it. see have to go and break up those barriers and then the last point that i wanted to raise, there are many discussions that we have had also in the federal government. regarding the glass ceiling with women, what is the reason that women do not want to accept executive positions? i think two things are important for me. first, there are not that many role models. and so that is terribly important. if you show how it is that it becomes more normal. if a woman with two small children can show that the boys still study for school, but women are in the great stress,9:08 pmthe husband says well, you can go ahead but if things don't work out, he's not going to say i'm going to give them a management position. it is always the woman who then are responsible and therefore the fathers and the men. for example if the father say leave work for three months they find that taking care of a child can really be something that brings joy and they have a closer relationship to the children. and then the priorities get shifted and they say well, perhaps parents leave is not such a bad thing. and something changes in the entire balance of the family. and it is very important. >> a. [inaudible question] chancellor. your great intervention, do you consider yourself a feminist? [laughter] [applause]9:09 pm>> you can be honest. >> i am not one. well, the history of feminism is one where there is some commonalities and there are some areas where there are differences. and i would not want to assume a title that is not appropriate for me. for example if you look -- they have very hard struggles and now i'm going to sit down and say well, i'm a feminist now. isn't that great? so i am not afraid of it. if you think so, you can vote on it but i do not want to claim something that i am not entitled to. >> is anybody on this panel consider herself a feminist? [applause] >> hands up. who is considering themselves a feminist on this panel?9:10 pm>> what is in a name? i just want that all women have a freedom of a choice. they have opportunities that they can grab and they can pass opportunities and fill equal every floor and really be happy and proud of themselves. if that is feminist and i am a feminist. [applause] >> than i am 12. [applause] before everybody - >> did you also raise your hand? >> no, i did not want to out myself as a feminist. well the explanation by queen maxima is wonderful. i want to add a history. we are very conservative in fact to link it to what the9:11 pmchancellor said is when young men change the babies and all the things that are involved i can say we have a different experience than same experience that fathers have close contact with children but we also have experience that men come back and say .i'm so glad that really does months are over. i didn't know how much work it was. and now i can appreciate what the women do. and therefore parental leave is very important. but when we have the law where you forage? absolutely! and i had cases in the company that came to me and they said, my bosses who are men did not want to let me go and threatened that my career is ended. you'll have to imagine that and can you do something for me? and i said, stay away for six months.9:12 pm[applause] >> actually, i like it that this is heating up a bit. this was a very very interesting part of this panel. i was serious about it. and i didn't want to make jokes about it because i am a little bit wondering whether there is some sort of a new reluctance to use this word. and that is related with the fact that we are facing some parts of a backlash to liberal rights these days. and also towards women rights. and would you like to comment on this chrystia freeland? women's progress is not linear and we, and the need to fight more these days again? >> i think one of the lessons of the world today is the progress of liberal democracy and liberal democratic values in the world, it is not linear in general. right? there was a moment when9:13 pmchancellor merkel reference unification. i think it was a glorious moment when the wall came down, when the soviet union ended and some of us celebrated the end of history. and france's reticent famous book which i thought was very well-intentioned with the idea that the problem had been solved. and that the whole world understood that all humans really had so much in common. and we were all yearning towards liberal democratic values. in which i was very much including women's rights and feminism. and i'm happy to explicitly call myself a feminist. and i think what we have been learning over the past few years in a whole bunch of areas, very much including women's rights is that we can't take them for granted. and that is what i was related to a bit by talking about the political aspect of what we are discussing. there is a reason women haven't been in economically excluded in all societies. there is no society in the9:14 pmworld where women have fully equal rights. there is a reason for that. and i think a big part of our response needs to be very much about smart policies. and ivanka trump's point that we know what to do is make an excellent point.so much policy work has been done and if we just did all of the smart things that smart policy wants to agree on will make huge progress. but i don't think that we can neglect the political side of things. and neglect the fact that there are a lot of forces and a lot of societies including my own. it would feel more comfortable. you know with the woman staying at home. with the dead not having to take paternity leave and change those wretched diapers. so i, i think there is. >> is there a connection between the liberal free trade and all of those kinds of things and what we are talking about. one is progress. >> clearly empowerment. that is the juncture. but to follow up, one of the9:15 pmreasons women historically in many societies, not all put in many societies have been excluded is that feeling that a lot of men have more impositions in power and so forth feel threatened by women. and i think that was clearly demonstrated by this panel is that women are not a threat. there a positive contributor to the well-being of society. [applause] and they can be empowered. i just want to things. i have been leading an organization both in private and public sectors. and i have not yet met any woman who offered the space and comfort to her children looked after safely and given the training to actually exercise the leadership and competence. had to be for spears and they have been something wrong the translation of what you're9:16 pmsaying in german but frankly, if there is the space for the domestic activity on the one hand. and that relies on policies. and second, the training, encouragement. women take the challenge, they are brave, they are strong. if those conditions are set aside. other than that i would agree with you. final point, chrystia freeland i agree with you but i want to say to all of the women who either never had a father because he did not know him or lost their father, you can pick and choose a father. they exist around and they can be tremendous mentors.and i hope we can support that idea because nobody should feel left out in that game. and i know you feel strongly for that. [applause] >> mrs. ivanka trump we have talked about the current affairs and i would like to know regarding women in business, the successor women in business and the relationship to empowerment9:17 pmlike mrs. 7-eleven just appeared open societies and free trade. are you advising your father in this regard? also in international relationships that empower women in business as well? >> well it has been an ongoing discussion i had with my father most of my adult life. we are very aligned in many areas. that is why he is encouraged me to fully lean into this opportunity and come into the white house and be by his side as we think through these complex issues. even here today. we all acknowledge the problems and we have very different views on the right solution. whether a legislative layer or otherwise in terms of how to get to the desired end goal. so i think that in the areas where i'm fully aligned with my father which are many, which is around the empowerment of women in our economy and really unleashing them.9:18 pmand there are ways to do this more globally. just are all entrepreneurs and then there are specific tactics. that pertain and are most relevant for women in the workplace. that we had talked about the regulatory burden. there is an enormous regulatory burden that has been placed on american business owners. and that is slowly being lifted. there are definitely regulations that are good ones and there are ones that are stifling. and i think when the economy can flourish as a whole, that that benefits women. i think the policy component is very important. i think safe, affordable childcare is essential. and it is sadly something that is not available in most areas of the world including in the us. it has been a big party for me and the administration. because when you think of the wage gap, it is really exasperated by the, by a woman becoming a mother. so motherhood is an additional9:19 pmchallenge and it should not be. and while these are all family issues obviously, childcare is a family issue. and it has a millennial, be it on the other end of the spectrum, i consider i am really encouraged by what i see in my -- what i see in the next generation. where fathers are not only expected by their wives to be full participants in the household but they want to be. i think that is really important as we think about corporate cultures and so much of this innovation is happening at the private sector. we talked a lot about that today. -- the innovation of the private sector and doing what government can do which is amplified.i am encouraged when i see households and they see men being increasingly engaged in taking on these roles and really disrupting these ideas about gender bias9:20 pmanda woman's role. the rally in the us, the single largest cost and over half of americans households, the single largest expenses childcare.even exceeding the cost of housing. there isan enormous problem and when my father is committed to tackling. >> madame chancellor. >> i just wanted to raise one issue that christine lagarde had mentioned regarding the question whether women are willing to accept executive roles if you have arrangements with childcare? and i must say we have made tremendous progress in germany but especially when children start school and a younger brother knows when a child is three, they have three years and in elementary school and then i can go back to my career. i think we have a progress still to make.9:21 pmmake sure that we have childcare aftercare, after school. and women then are able to focus on their work fully so that we have proper arrangements. we have long discussions in germany. should we do that and also for younger children, younger than three years old that was very difficult but ultimately when you offer childcare than the acceptance is much greater. we have to say that because if women always have to prove that they need childcare then that is not the right approach. you have to make it available and then we don't have to princes, ask well do we need roads if you don't have roads? of course you can use them but -- >> we came from liberal values from free trade and policy environment in regulation and9:22 pmi've also talked about the micromanagement. let's put it like that. issue of childcare and regulation. i would like to get back to you, juliana rotich. what is your idea for taking up this whole debate from the perspective of the country you're coming from. is that what is needed there for our priorities is still very much diverse? >> i think just to add to some of the conversations about smart policies. how all these conversations do tieback to this question are smart policies around fundamentals. around education. healthcare. we have not talked much about healthcare. i think everyone is dancing around that. but maternity leave, reproductive rights. it was stated by the chair of the women 20 dialogues earlier that women's rights are human9:23 pmrights. that in these smart policies, we absolutely have to look at how those policies tie with women's rights and human rights and the rights of people of color. it is important to be as inclusive as possible. just to tie that back to not only the kenyan transformation and gender but also the african transformation and gender. there have been some progress around several key indicators around the number of, the percentage of women in cabinet positions for example. still have low percentages of women in senior positions in africa. but there is a report by mckenzie and another by african development bank. that indicates some of the smart policies. and they go back to the fundamentals. we can really harness and take into account how we safeguardquote9:24 pmcivil rights, women's rights and human rights and all of the policies, we can continue seeing the progress of scaling women entrepreneurship. and last but not least, the key idea of assessing as part of the afternoon conversations, is when we look at financial technology and the immense potential there is a transforming women's lives, i can't help but think that if we add the component of big data, analytics and social protection we can find ways to deal with the refugee crisis. we can deal with climate change, where we are dispersing certain amount of money to the most vulnerable.9:25 pmand last but not least, i hope my presence here and those who are watching online can debunk this idea that african women are not part of the solution. we are part of the creation of the solution. so include us as we think through the solution. not only from a technological perspective but also from a policy perspective. and continuing to advocate for women being at the table.at the highest able. [applause] >> that was a wonderful approach of taking wholesome picture and women's rights, human rights and we need to be very much inclusive in all different and actionable ways to really get going. thank you for making that very clear.9:26 pmas time is running out i would like to jump into a very quick last round with all of you. as we are a small but very powerful network of women here on this stage.i would like you to figure out for a moment, but was an idea or a statement or thought of one other panel on the stage you liked particularly and would like to follow up with? one idea, one statement, one thought from another panelist you really like and would like to follow up with. your majesty, master with you? >> partnerships and innovations. governments, private sectors and ngos really have to work together in partnership to really make this work. it is going to take change in regulation. it will take us from private sector to really look at women and desirable type of client but also potential that works for you potential supplier for your product.9:27 pmoften a fantastic role to play in actually taking that risk but may be private sector cannot take of given that knowledge that the government does not know. will help in convicting a data that was on the counter. an partnerships innovation taking technology into consideration will be key for the future. an integral really work for the country by country.>> juliana rotich, what is your idea? >> come back to me after. [laughter] >> mrs. anne finucane what is most important to you? >> something that struck me as all of you are speaking, in order for women to move forward, men cannot feel that they're having something taken away. we all want to step forward together. and that the world is a big place with a lot of opportunity. further with document gdp or dignity or respect.the idea9:28 pmthat it is going to take away for another group and move forward for all of us. >> thank you. >> mrs. nicola leibinger-kammuller. >> i'm very practical and i was very impressed when we discussed with the funds. and who would contribute to the women especially in africa would have micro credits available and you madam chancellor, say that you could conceive that private money could be collected and i know many people have a lot of money. and yes, i think especially women of course, they could be interested in it. i love to collect money for a period that is great! [applause] >> thank you! >> ms. chrystia freeland. >> i'm going to cheat as a day things really fast could obviously be funded and it is good to have private sector support is a chancellor said.9:29 pmcanada is very enthusiastic about this and i really want to also thank ivanka trump for how she had been driving this. second, we have been having two conversations per the problems of some of the people that juliana rotich is talking about. refugee women playing climate change of the child on her back, that is quite different from women in a wealthy western country worried about are they going to get into a middle management position or not. and i think it is important, it is important you talk about these things together but to recognize that they are different. so i second one is from juliana rotich. i love the story of form drives. and i love your deeper point. which is a conversation about development. it can be someone coming from outside and empowering women in developing countries. many developing countries are extremely smart, they know better than anybody else how to empower themselves.9:30 pmin terms of making unbiased pics and as we think about going forward. i think one of the key takeaways and there are so many first of all i'm grateful for the partnership, the women's9:31 pmempowerment funds that we are going to be launching and very very excited to work very hard with everyone here to ensure that it reaches its full potential. i really think this discussion of inclusion and how nuanced and complex this issue is it's very important. i was personally pretty struck by the discussion around the term feminism because they think as a society we are very prone to labels. and i do label myself a feminist and they i think of that in very broad terms. i think of that as believing in the social political and economic equality for all genders but i do think there is a feeling of exclusion for a lot of women. if they deviate in one small way in one small area and i think one of the things we have to do is we have to come together. we have to have discussions such as this one where we can9:32 pmrespectfully disagree with one another and we have to go out into the world, find people who disagree with us and try and understand their viewpoints and i think this discussion around feminism and whites become so loaded is that i think there is a negativity attached to labeling. it does feel exclusionary of others and so it's very interesting to hear the chancellor's perspective on that i do think there's an obligation upon us and upon all women to support and to hold each other up and to be inclusive. [applause] >> first of all i would like pick up the idea of queen maxima that we are all feminists on this topic. second, the proposal of women's9:33 pmissues elevated through the g20 not that w. 20 but the g20 level in some shape or form. [applause] and i love the idea of the fund that would be set up and leverage private funding but there is an initiative which you chancellor have launched which is compact with africa which could pilot that idea, that very principle that you identified in the opening. i think it's good having it as a pilot because you married the policies which are absolutely needed and the investment and the focus on the leverage of public balance sheets to bring more of private capital. think if we could experiment compact with africa with a special identification of women's issues in that project which you have championed in the g20 would be terrific read i'd like to coup -- compete with your idea that we need science9:34 pmand technology and the barrier to entry is reasonably low and should offer education that we put money into it should offer a way for a woman to actually be leaders and not be excluded as the digital revolution changes the way we work the way we relate to each other. thank you. >> the idea for the fund is extremely inspiring i think and with the input from this discussion that it would have a way that it would inclusive in terms of its thinking so it's eventual implementation includes an complements a lot of the work that has very been done by not only the central bank governors, some of the organizations that9:35 pmare part of the financial inclusion and others. i think that's truly the idea that i would like to take forward to help, help to broaden the input into the fund idea so that we have more people helping to think through actually how it will be implemented and bringing in some of the interest from others. thank you. [applause] >> madam chancellor. >> well in addition to being forced to think more intently as found in a very definition for it i would like to make sure that we can make clear the funds have great support.9:36 pmsecond i learned that we should take serious those that actually are involved in the partnership and we should include that so we should look at who we should talk to in order to refine these ideas because they are talking about selecting capital leveraging but also using it in such a way that meets the needs digital education and the digital technology is something we have to learn too. many things happen faster in africa then back at home. for example using a digital phone is a platform which is being used for everything which is the same thing for young people but not for the older generation so we want to take9:37 pmthat up in christine lagarde is correct basically on the one hand we have to have a compact with africa where some african companies are discussing concrete economic projects and use the funds here with some of these countries that are ahead already but would have to discuss this further. i think there is a lot of work to be done but i must say very frankly and it also applies to the entire scherpa staff we are very motivated now and starting to debate with other countries. in a week we will be in south africa and we have to discuss also with argentina and mexico because everything is decided in consensus but we have some that are basically supportive of this9:38 pmfun that i'm very happy that we have this discussion now. >> thank you very much. [applause] >> ladies and gentlemen i think this was a very productive and inspiring panel. thank you very much to all the panelists and newborn feminists like her chancellor who are still debating it. we will get back to that later. thanks to the audience for your kind attention and hopefully this will make a difference and an impact at g20 this year. thank you very much to everybody. [applause]9:39 pm>> ladies and gentlemen you can take a photo but please do not crowd the stage unless you have a special media passport to do so. of course remember that the german chancellor angela merkel will return tomorrow afternoon and i'm sure we can clarify the question about the feminist and many many other questions that have been posed to her. i would now like to ask you as a panel is about to leave the stage to stay clear of the aisle the photographers are still hungry for more pictures. that's give it to them. president trump will mark his first 100 days in office with a rally in harrisburg, pennsylvania.9:40 pm>> naming these buildings is the beginning of our journey together toward the healing from georgetown's legacy of slavery. >> we have moved the needle on this discussion. it used to be no way, no how on anything like the aca but now it's let's make it work. >> to the extent that it's possible scientific research should similarly be separated from government. then you would not fund climate9:41 pmscience in particular been a faction ridden orthodoxy enforcing you know political movement but rather the quest for knowledge. >> the object gives our simplified personal taxes, tax cuts to spur the economy and make our business taxes competitive. >> clearly we have got to work with the afghans to stabilize the situation against the taliban onslaught and move ahead with the political process that's going to have to include pakistan. >> attorney general jeff sessions on transnational crime organizations. >> if you are a gang member, we will find you. we will devastate your network. we will starve your revenue sources, deplete your ranks,9:42 pmseize your prophets. we will not concede a single lock or street corner to your vicious tactics. thanks c-span programs are available at c-span.org on our homepage and by searching the video library. c i'm going to go ahead and start in the witness will be out in just a moment to the foreign relations committee will come to order and thank you to all those for being here. today's hearing will examine the crisis in libya. like to thank your witnesses for again appearing before the committee on this important issue. unfortunately six years ago after"

Socialized medicine. Canada and Britain.They have been written on posters, yelled at town hall meetings, and repeated by politicians during TV talk shows. They've been tweeted on Twitter and pasted on Facebook. They are scary words. (Well, maybe not ""Canada,"" but in the context of ""The health reform plan will give us a system like Canada's,"" it's certainly meant to scare).Undeniably, these words have dominated much of the debate. But how much do they really have to do with what's actually being proposed in the health care bills in Congress? According to our research at PolitiFact, not a whole lot.Today, we published two items about rationing, a loaded term if ever there was one. We concluded that Republicans are wrong to suggest there's no rationing today but would be under Obama's plan, but also that Democrats are wrong the say there would be no rationing under his plan. Any plan that uses insurance companies with deductibles, caps and requirements for out-of-pocket expenses does, by its very nature, have rationing. Health care experts on both sides told us we've got rationing now and we'd have it under the Democratic plan.Warnings about ""death panels"" and euthanasia are the offspring of the rationing claims. We looked into the ""death panel"" claim, introduced by former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, and concluded she was wrong. We also debunked repeated claims that the plan includes euthanasia. The plan authorizes payments to doctors to give elderly and seriously ill patients end-of-life counseling, but that counseling is voluntary. And it's ridiculous to say it would lead to euthanasia.The other big phrase from opponents is ""socialized medicine,"" a headline-grabbing term meant to suggest that the government would take over health care, or that the plan being considered in Congress is a ""single-payer"" system. That's not what's being proposed. The plan is to have people with private insurance through their employer (and that accounts for most people) keep that coverage. For those who do not, the government would oversee a health care exchange, in which private companies would offer plans.Here's the most controversial part: The exchange would include a government-run health plan, which is often known as the public option. In other words, that government plan — which may or may not end up in the final bill — is a part of a part. And the government would subsidize those who cannot afford insurance. That's far short of a fully government-run plan.It's fair game to state an opinion that you think this is where the system is heading. It's reasonable, for example, to say ""I'm worried that a public option could lead to socialized medicine."" But it is not accurate to describe the Democrats' plan as socialized medicine.That's also true with the claims about alleged shortcomings in the public health systems in Canada and Britain. The underlying assumption is that that is what is being proposed here. It is not.Republican strategist Frank Lunz has advised GOP members to use the word ""rationing"" to build opposition to the Democratic plan.In a memo called ""The Language of Healthcare 2009: The 10 rules for stopping the 'Washington Takeover' of Healthcare,"" Luntz devotes a whole section to how the word can be used.""The word 'rationing' does induce the negative response you want, but what youreally want audiences to focus on is the 'consequences of rationing,''"" Lunz wrote.Luntz notes that ""'rationing' tests very well against the other healthcare buzzwords that frighten Americans."" Asked what two concepts or phrases would frighten them the most, ""healthcare rationing,"" ranked at the top of the list with 43 percent (well above other buzz phrases like ""socialized medicine"" at 26 percent and ""Hillary-Care"" at 10 percent).But it isn't enough to just say the word rationing, he wrote. It is much more effective to personalize the concept by saying, for example, ""the government will decide what treatment I can or can’t have.""The AARP has been inundated with calls from concerned seniors who have been misled by these buzzwords, said AARP spokesman Jim Dau.Debate is good, he said, but it's important that people's opinions be based on facts. And a lot of the scare words have no place in a reasonable debate about the critical health care reform issue, he said.""They are designed to play into the fears and suspicions of people,"" he said. ""And it's completely understandable that people would have fears and suspicions. But this is too important of a discussion to give way to willful distortions.""And make no mistake, he said, opponents of the plan have chosen these words to create a high impact.""A lot of time and effort and testing went into finding out what words will work to get the most response,"" Dau said. ""In politics, it's always easier to scare someone than it is to educate and engage them.""At PolitiFact, we don't want to hinder the robust debate on such an important policy issue, but we're in the fact-checking business and we felt it was important to highlight some of the more blatant distortions that have dominated much of the discussion and that distract from real issues in the health care debate.Related rulings:"

Frolicking with her boys at a playground in 1998, she wished some teenagers a happy Independence Day.She was met with blank stares. ""You know, the Fourth of July,"" she offered. Then they smiled and nodded, and she prodded a bit: ""Do you know who we got our independence from?"" One guessed France, another Mexico, and the last one said the Indians. ""They were not kidding,"" Ms. Stevens says.She enrolled her older son in first grade that year but wasn't happy with the emphasis on ""creative spelling"" and art projects. So she traveled to Massachusetts and visited public schools in Northampton, a town that boasts five colleges and universities within a short radius.RELATED: Back to school: How to measure a good teacher?""We knew Massachusetts was a fabulous state for public education,"" she says. And she and her husband, both graphic designers, figured they could work from about anywhere.The enthusiasm and skill of the second-grade teacher at the school in the Leeds neighborhood of Northampton ""blew me away,"" Stevens says. ""Meeting her sealed the deal that we would buy a house in that district.""They haven't been disappointed living in a state that by many measures sets the gold standard for public education in the United States.In national reading and math tests, the state's fourth- and eighth-graders have scored the best since 2005. Compared with the national average, greater shares of students here graduate from high school and score high on college-level Advanced Placement (AP) exams. The state even compares respectably with some of the top-performing countries.Education's roots run deep in Massachusetts – home of the first public school in America and some of the best universities in the world. Its success, education leaders say, results primarily from a two-decade commitment to set high standards; hold students, teachers, and schools accountable; and offer funding and other key supports to help them reach expectations.Other states have looked to the Bay State as a model in recent years as they've tweaked their own education strategies.Massachusetts is ""one of the major success stories in the country,"" says Gene Wilhoit, executive director of the Council of Chief State School Officers in Washington.But now Massachusetts, like 45 other states and the District of Columbia, is revising its curriculum as part of a collaboration called the Common Core State Standards – a new chapter in education reform premised on the idea that to compete globally, the benchmarks for reading and math in all states need to reflect a richer set of skills to equip students for 21st-century demands.Massachusetts could be a good test case for whether the Common Core approach lives up to that lofty rhetoric. President Obama has pushed for it through federal funding incentives, though critics say he has strong-armed states into de facto national standards, chipping away at state control.For some education observers, Massachusetts has broken the axiom ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it,"" and is in danger of watering down a key element of its success.Others say just the opposite – that the new common standards are at least as strong as Massachusetts' previous ones and could catapult more states to heights that the Bay State has already achieved.""One of the provisions ... was that no state would have to lower its standards in order to adopt the Common Core.... So the Massachusetts standards became a benchmark [in] developing the [new standards],"" says Mr. Wilhoit, whose organization is coordinating the Common Core initiative.Despite the state's attainments, there are always areas to improve, education leaders here say – particularly when it comes to achievement gaps for minority and low-income students""One of our greatest potential hurdles will be complacency,"" says Mitchell Chester, Massachusetts commissioner of elementary and secondary education. ""Once we are satisfied that we're doing it better than anyone else and that's good enough ... others will pass us by.""A key spark for education reform came in 1983 with ""A Nation at Risk,"" a report warning that student achievement wasn't keeping pace – at home or abroad.""In Massachusetts, people really took the report seriously,"" says David Driscoll, who became the state's deputy commissioner of education in 1993 and served as commissioner from 1999 to 2007.Leaders from state government, education, and business came together to form the Massachusetts Education Reform Act of 1993, creating high standards and curriculum frameworks in math, reading, social studies, and science, as well as related tests for fourth-, eighth-, and 10th-graders – the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS).To give those standards teeth, certain scores on 10th-grade tests became a requirement for high school graduation. Students scoring too low receive extra help and can retake the tests.The emphasis on high-stakes testing led some teachers and parents to protest, worried that it would nudge borderline students into dropping out – a debate that later resonated nationally because of the testing regimen established by the federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001.""There was tremendous pushback, bills filed every year to do away with it, but we stuck with it,"" Mr. Driscoll says.After the new system took hold, significant learning gains among Massachusetts students were reflected in both state and national tests.The MCAS ""made us feel as if Massachusetts had higher standards of learning than other states because that test is harder than other, average tests,"" Stevens says.One big reason people came to accept the reforms: The state boosted education funding by more than 10 percent for each of the first six years – targeting the money largely to schools and districts with the highest needs. To date, the 1993 law has channeled $34.5 billion in extra state funding to school districts.Strategies to boost achievement in Boston – the state's largest district – have included double blocks of time for reading and math instruction, as well as efforts ""to get the best teachers teaching the kids that needed the most support,"" says Thomas Payzant, Boston's superintendent from 1995 to 2006.In the 2010-11 school year, 97 percent of Massachusetts teachers were licensed specifically in the area they taught, and all teachers are required to earn a master's degree during their career, says Paul Toner, president of the Massachusetts Teachers Association.Moreover, a statewide testing system for teacher applicants has helped bring up the quality of education.Another factor: The state reform law set up a rigorous approval process for charter schools, many of which boast strong academic achievement.Many parents in the state have high education levels and good incomes, making it easier to support their children's education. In addition, Mr. Toner says, school districts are relatively small, allowing for teachers to know the community better; any student can enroll in an AP course; and all students are encouraged to take college-entrance exams such as the SAT.With high-stakes testing, some students do have to drill basic skills rather than enjoy a well-rounded curriculum as they approach 12th grade, Toner says, but ""you'd have to admit that by having a graduation requirement ... it got kids' and families' attention and you could see the proficiency numbers on the exams [going] up.""Stevens says she has seen over time how the MCAS pressures teachers and presents a rather rigid structure for some learners. But her sons received a well-rounded education, including early opportunities to play musical instruments, which weren't available in California at the time. Older brother Nicholas O'Connor is now studying engineering at Boston College, and Benjamin O'Connor is a high school junior hoping to study marine biology.""We understand the value of an education,"" Stevens says. ""It's the one thing you can give your child that will last their whole life.Because of Massachusetts' success story, education policies here are watched and sometimes ""emulated by other states,"" Wilhoit says.Texas, for example, adopted new math standards this year after a democratic process – starting with a draft based in part on standards from high-performing states, including Massachusetts, says Todd Webster, chief deputy commissioner of the Texas Education Agency. Texas is sticking with those standards rather than adopting the Common Core.But Massachusetts' future doesn't look as rosy to observers such as Jamie Gass, director of the Center for School Reform at the Pioneer Institute for Public Policy Research, a conservative-leaning group in Boston.""Massachusetts made historic gains ... but in the last four or five years, a lot of those policy gains have been rolled back,"" he says. ""There are other states that are nipping at our heels ... [and] Massachusetts has kind of plateaued.""Particularly problematic, he says, is the state's decision to jump on the Common Core bandwagon. Massachusetts' standards were a model, he says, and the Common Core standards are of lower quality. For instance, standards for English-language arts used to be based largely on classic literature and poetry, which have a rich vocabulary, but the Common Core emphasizes more informational text, Mr. Gass says. To him it's part of a ""trendy fad"" focusing on workforce-development goals and ""softer"" 21st-century skills.Commissioner Chester defends the state's decision to adopt the Common Core, saying it ""advanced what we already had on the table.""Collaboration is increasing among states as more leaders look at the bigger picture of the global economy, Chester says: ""When [there are] 50 different sets of standards [and testing] ... you're not necessarily giving children and parents honest and accurate information about how they measure up in a world where state boundaries are less and less relevant to your economic opportunities.""0 Shares"

DONNA EDWARDS, D-MD.: Thank you.REP. ALLEN WEST, R-FLA.: Good morning. Thanks for having us.WALLACE: Let's start with Medicare. And Paul Ryan's plan to turn it from a fee-for-service plan into a voucher system -- Congressman West, even though this wouldn't start until 2022, you've got some push-back at one of your town hall meetings recently. Let's watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PROTESTER: Hands off Medicare! Hands off Medicare!WEST: I will take my hands off Medicare, and when there is no Medicare, then I will come and see you, sir!(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Congressman West, as we saw in the special election up in New York state this week, where the Democrat beat the Republican and Medicare was a big issue, as we see in the national polls a lot of people, especially seniors, don't want to see Medicare changed this way.WEST: Well, I think when you look at Paul Ryan's plan, first of all, there is no change for anyone who is a senior 55 years and above. But as I sit here right now, I'm 50 years of age. And we already know that the board of trustee has said, you got 13 years and something very bad is going to happen with Medicare. So, what is going to be there for myself when I get 63 to 65?So, I think the thing that we see is at least there's a plan out there to try to have some type of reform.And there was a great article by Mr. Stanley Druckenmiller in The Wall Street Journal back in the 15th of May that talked about the fact that the financial markets, a lot of these, you know, bond markets are looking to see: are we going to have some type of long- term viable solution and plan as we go forward?WALLACE: But let me pick up on that, Congressman Edwards, because the knock against the Democrats is you don't have a plan, that congressional Democrats didn't pass a budget last year. Senate Democrats aren't offering a budget this year -- President Obama talks having an independent panel of medical experts who are going to find $20 billion of cuts somewhere. At least they've got a plan.EDWARDS: Well, I think it's not true that we don't have a plan. And, in fact, when we passed the Affordable Care Act last year, we put in some real markers for Medicare that in fact reduced Medicare costs. We invested in preventive care for seniors because we know that the real drivers of Medicare are these long-term costs for chronic care that happens at the -- you know, at the end of life.You know, Republicans are very interesting because in their budget what they would do is repeal preventive care. Prescription drug coverage -- we also closed the donut hole there, which is costing seniors a boatload of money and is not very efficient on the system.So, to say that Democrats don't have a plan I think is incorrect. I mean, in fact, the plan is to preserve and protect Medicare for future generations. And Republicans want to dismantle that.WEST: Yes, but I think as you sit here and look at the two of us, one of us has voted to cut Medicare. When you look at the fact you voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which had $500 million of cuts of Medicare. And we also have this independent payment advisory board, these 15 bureaucrats, that are supposed to control the cost of Medicare. I mean, that's something that really does scare seniors.What we are talking is something that does not affect any senior, anyone 55 years and above. We're talking about something that does put in some type of viable plan to sustain Medicare for the future, because as we know, it was put out three weeks ago, it won't be there.EDWARDS: Well, the congressman thinks the seniors are only interested in what's good for them. And what we know about seniors, whether they're in south Florida or in Maryland, is that they actually care about what happens with that next generation. They care about whether we're going to cover preventive care and prescription drug.WEST: But if you don't have a plan, there is nothing for the next generation.EDWARDS: And that they are -- and that they are not sent in the private market to negotiate with insurance companies. We know that that would be a failure. And that's exactly what the Republican plan calls for. I can't negotiate on --WALLACE: Let me move on to another thing, because the biggest difference, it seems to me, looking at your two positions on how to deal with the deficit is over taxes.Congresswoman Edwards, you have a big plan to increase revenues. And let's put it up on the screen. You would raise tax rates for the wealthy. You would raise the estate tax. You would tax capital gains and dividend as ordinary income and you would end tax subsidies for oil and gas companies.So, raise taxes in the middle of a weak recovery?EDWARDS: Well, let's be clear -- raise tax on the wealthiest 2 percent who have run away with the store for the last 10 years and haven't put money back into the economy. I mean, that's a fact, because if that trickle-down theory had worked, our economy would be in good shape right now.And so, we do -- I do subscribe to a plan that says, you know what? Middle income earners, you've already shared a fair burden of your taxes. But the wealthiest 2 percent have not.And there's no excuse whatsoever for continuing taxes for people who make over $500,000 a year.WALLACE: Congressman West, you got something there?WEST: Yes. I got a very interesting article which was written on the 26th of May by Steven Moore for The Wall Street Journal that talks about -- we are talking about a 62 percent top tax rate and the absolutely abysmal effects that it will have on this economy.And one of the great things he says here is, in the end, ""The Tax Foundation recently noted that in 2009, U.S. collected a higher share of income and payroll taxes, 45 percent, from the richest 10 percent of tax files than any other nation, including some such socialist welfare states.""So, I think that we are already getting a lot of the juice from those top brackets. But go back and look at history, Donna, when we looked at Coolidge and Harding. It took those marginal tax rates down to 29 percent. And the percentage of revenues for GDP grew. But after them came Hoover and Roosevelt who took it from 24 percent up to 83 percent, and the percentage of revenues decreased. Even John F. Kennedy, when he came in and saw a 91 percent marginal tax rate said that was too high. He took it down to 71 percent.EDWARDS: I'd like to just back to the Reagan tax rates. I mean, if we went back there, we would actually do a lot --(CROSSTALK)EDWARDS: We're talking about secure the system. And I think that what -- you know, what's happened here is we've got, you know, tax rates at the highest income levels where, you know -- whether it's George Soros or Bill Gates or whichever, you know, billionaire/millionaire doesn't pay the amount of taxes that the secretaries pay. I mean, I think the American public understands that this is not fair. And more --WALLACE: Wait, wait. I mean, that may be true in some exceptions. But the --EDWARDS: Well, Chris, more than that --WALLACE: Wait, wait. There are some statistics that show the vast majority, the people in the higher income brackets pay the vast majority of taxes.EDWARDS: Well, it needs to be proportion to their income. Income for lower income -- for middle income Americans have remained stagnant --(CROSSTALK)EDWARDS: Let me finish.WEST: How can you make it proportionate if they don't even pay, Donna?EDWARDS: And the fact is if we were to extend these tax rates for the wealthiest 2 percent over this next decade, it would cost the American public a fortune because in your budget, you don't even pay for them. They haven't been paid for the last decade. It's putting an unfair burden on the public.WEST: Who's producing jobs in the country?EDWARDS: Well, I would love it if the wealthy people holding on to the tax break put their money back to the economy. The fact is that they haven't.WEST: Because of the economic uncertainty we have --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: -- which brings me to the economy and the question of how you jump-start the economy.Congressman West, House Republicans offered a plan this week to do exactly that. To get the economy going, to boost jobs. Let's take a look at the plan. Cut the top tax rate even further for individuals and business, 25 percent; less regulation; more patent protection; and pass free trade deals with other countries.Whether that's good policy or not, the fact is we did see lower taxes, and less regulation under President George W. Bush. We ended up in a recession.WEST: Well, the important thing is this: with President George W. Bush, he grew government. And he increased the government spending.So, you cannot have a cut in taxes and also have a gross enlargement of government. That's one of the things that we don't want to see happen.I got to tell you, you know, here I have been here in Congress for about five months. And I have legislation that passed that will save the American taxpayers $80 million because I found three wasteful Department of Defense programs.And so, the thing is, while each and every one of us up here in our respective committees or whatever looking for those wasteful programs so we can cult those expenses.WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, what do you think of the GOP plan as I just outlined it?And I'd also like you to answer this -- and go ahead and talk directly to Congressman West, as you do. The Obama administration pumped $1 trillion in stimulus into the economy. The Federal Reserve has pumped trillions more. We've got 9 percent unemployment. We've got 1.8 percent GDP growth. It isn't working.EDWARDS: Well, I mean -- I don't know that I agree with that, because, you know, first of all -- let me finish here. I mean, first of all, the trillion dollars for stimulus package -- actually $786 billion -- was absolutely necessary to make sure that this economy didn't go into a freefall. We also know that we had to make sure that we began to stimulate the kind of growth that we need in this country to invest in the future.I -- you know what? I agree with the congressman here. I think there are actually some things that we could do both in terms of cutting back wasteful spending. But everything has to be the table, from the Defense Department, to every single department.WEST: And I said Defense Department.EDWARDS: But your party hasn't.WEST: Well, I am in the party. So, obviously.EDWARDS: And so -- your party hasn't. So I want to go back -- I want to make sure that we're really looking at the budget. But we also have to look at revenues. And that is a fact we have to look at revenues in this --WALLACE: Well, let me ask you about that, Congressman West. Wait, wait. The fact is if you're going to get a bipartisan compromise, you know there's going to have to be some, some revenue increase in addition to spending cuts.The Debt Commission, the Bowles-Simpson Commission came up with formula $3-to-$1, $3 in spending cuts for every $1 in revenue increase and maybe they didn't even talk about raising rates, they talk about doing away with tax breaks.Why isn't that acceptable?WEST: Well, Chris, I have to tell you. I've been wanting to say get rid of loopholes, get rid of subsidies. I talk about corporate business tax rate that comes down to 20 percent to 22 percent, and eliminate subsidies and loopholes. I talked about going through a tax flat which has just only one deduction pretty much for children.But I think the most important thing that we have to understand -- and I think Donna will agree with me -- until we show we're going to be fiscally responsible here, why should we continue to tax Americans? Why should we continue to take away their most precious resource if we're not going to do the right things up here?WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, answer the congressman.EDWARDS: You know, Allen, fiscal responsibility did happen when the last Democrat was in office before President Obama. And that was President Clinton.WEST: And he had a Republican Congress working with him.EDWARDS: He balanced the budget. We had surpluses.WEST: And he had a Republican Congress working with him.EDWARDS: And those were wiped away -- those were wiped away by two wars that were unpaid for by prescription drug plan that was unpaid for, by taxes.(CROSSTALK)WEST: And we have to fight. And we have to defend our country.EDWARDS: You know, I thank for your -- I thank you for your service. I mean, I grew up in the military, I feel very strongly about the military.But the fact is that you cannot have two wars that are on the books that are unpaid for, tax breaks that are unpaid for the wealthiest Americans. And at the same time say that we're going to balance our budget off the backs of the seniors.WALLACE: I got a couple of minutes left and I just want to get you both on one last subject which is the debt ceiling because we -- the clock is ticking. We're headed towards -- we now hear August 2nd as a date when we're going to run out of money and default on our debt.What do you do about it? Congresswoman? Well, go ahead.EDWARDS: Well, first of all, I think we have to pay our bills. And we can argue about how we got to those bills but the United States has an obligation both for ourselves and also for the rest of the world to make sure that we meet our obligations.We can have a conversation about what cuts need to be. But I think that the Republicans are being disingenuous when all you can do is talk about spending cuts, only a portion of the budget, and then not also talk about revenue increases.WALLACE: Congressman West?WEST: I give you two quotes from Mr. Druckenmiller and his Wall Street Journal piece. The grave danger he sees is politicians might give the government authority to borrow beyond the current limit of $14.3 trillion without any controls -- conditions to control spending. He's willing to accept temporary delay in the interest payment he's owed on U.S. treasury bonds if the result is a Washington deal to restrain run-away entitlement cost.EDWARDS: But you know what? If you get rid of --WEST: That was Soros funds manager.EDWARDS: On our debt, on our debt, if you get rid of the spending for two wars that have unpaid for and tax breaks for the wealthy Americans --WALLACE: You want us to pull -- that's a different issue. You want us to pull out of Iraq and Afghanistan?EDWARDS: I do, because you would then -- you would then draw our -- you would draw our responsibilities down --WALLACE: But that's not going to by August 2nd. Even president Obama is against that.EDWARDS: And so, I think the responsible thing is you that raise the debt limit and we work on the plan that gets us out of Iraq, out of Afghanistan.WALLACE: Well, I can see Congressman West shaking his head. He's going to say, no way. And you know, the Republican majority in your House has been saying that.(CROSSTALK)EDWARDS: Well, I don't know. You look at that vote the other day on our spending in Afghanistan. There are a lot of Republicans who don't agree with that.WEST: We have got to present spending control measures first. We have got to present spending control measures first. And let me tell you something that just happened, on my BlackBerry, I get 12 alerts this week of soldiers that lost their lives in Afghanistan. It's not over in Afghanistan.WALLACE: All right. We're going to have to leave it there. But to be continued.Congressman West, Congresswoman Edwards, thank you both so much for sharing part of your holiday weekend with us.WEST: Happy Memorial.EDWARDS: Thank you. Happy Memorial Day.WALLACE: Thank you.Up next, Senator John McCain on U.S. role in Libya and how to deal with a changing Middle east.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Joining us now to discuss the ongoing tension in the Middle East and to talk some 2012 politics is Senator John McCain.And, Senator, welcome back to ""Fox News Sunday.""MCCAIN: Thank you, Chris.WALLACE: Let's start with Libya. President Obama this week seemed to expand his definition of the NATO mission there. Let's take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Meeting the U.N. mandate of civilian protection cannot be accomplished when Qaddafi remains in Libya, directing his forces in acts of aggression against the Libyan people.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Between that statement and the stepped up airstrikes on Tripoli, are you now satisfied with the coalition effort to topple Qaddafi?MCCAIN: No, I'm not. But they obviously stepped it up. I'm sorry you didn't show one of the president's statement at the beginning how this is just a humanitarian effort, it's all going to be NATO. We're not going to have anything do with it. As you say, I'm glad to see him gradually changing.But the fact is as he is gradually changing, people are dying on the ground in Libya and they wouldn't have to if we were using all of U.S. airpower and the abilities and the unique capabilities that the United States military has. And, unfortunately, we are not. Although, we are gradually stepping it up and the attacks are stepping up. There was a raid on -- a daylight raid on Tripoli, which is unusual, here in the last 24 hours.So -- and, Qaddafi may crack. He may crack. But this could have been over a long time ago if we had brought the full weight of the American airpower to bear on him. And it's unfortunate.WALLACE: Now, another aspect that you call for is that you continue to say that the U.S. should recognize the rebels' national council as the legitimate government --MCCAIN: Yes.WALLACE: -- of Libya. And Defense Secretary Gates continues to say that there are some extremist elements among the opposition.MCCAIN: Well, I would say to Secretary Gates -- as you know, I have great admiration for Secretary Gates. But I say, Secretary, the best way to get extremist elements in the lead amongst the rebels there, the liberation forces, is a stalemate. That's the way extremists come into power. Look, these people are professor at the University of Washington, he's their finance minister. A guy with doctorate from the University of Pittsburgh.Are there people who are Muslim or -- you know, not exactly who we would like in this fight? Of course. But the reason why they're in the fight is because they hate Qaddafi who brutalized them and mistreated them. And, by the way, this recent reports of rapes in Misrata by Qaddafi forces should make us all angry.So, the reason to recognize the TNC, let's call it that, is because then you could free up the $33 billion assets that are frozen up of Qaddafi's and a lot more. It would legitimatize them as the voice of the Libyan people. Clearly, Qaddafi is not the voice. And I think it would have a significant impact on the morale of those brave fighters who are doing a pretty good job for a disorganized and untrained group.WALLACE: Let me turn to G-8 summit which this week pledged tens of millions of dollars to Egypt and Tunisia, to help with democratic reform and economic stability.Some of your Republican colleagues in Congress say at a time when this nation faces a dealt crisis, we can't be sending millions of dollars to the Middle East.MCCAIN: I think we can do things like debt relief, matching grant, stimulation, business and job opportunity. I understand that we have to be very careful because there is a strong anti-spending sentiment out there. But I think we also have to do a better job of convincing American people that a smooth transition to democracy in the region of the best guarantee of us not having to spend a lot of money in the future if the wrong people get in power.And, finally, could I just say that I think that jobs and investment, I'd love to see American business over there telling us we'll invest. If you give us a transparent, corruption-free government, one that is good for to us be in business in Egypt and Tunisia, then we'll invest. I think that could be one of greatest incentives rather than just throwing money at them.WALLACE: Now, the new authorities in Egypt this weekend have opened up a Gaza border crossing, which means that people are going to be able to go in and out of Gaza. Do you worry about the impact of that on Israeli security?MCCAIN: I worry. And I worry about some of the rhetoric we're already hearing from some of the politicians in Egypt who would like to gain support and votes. I worry about an alliance between Hamas and Fatah when, one, Hamas is still dedicated to the extinction of the state of Israel.WALLACE: But what impact do you think that opening this border crossing could have?MCCAIN: I don't think it will have a huge impact, because I think the Israelis can defend themselves. But I think the Palestinians recognize that if they commit serious aggression, that there will be a response from Israel.But it's time for all of them to sit down without preconditions, without saying that the '67 borders are the basis and certainly not putting Israel again on the defensive as the president has now twice. When the first time when he demanded a free zone settlement.WALLACE: Let's turn to another trouble spot. This week, the House of Representatives voted narrowly to defeat a measure, 204 votes for the measure, 215 against. So just barely was defeated. A measure that would require President Obama to step the withdrawal of U.S. military forces from Afghanistan, 26 Republicans voted for the measure, to speed up the withdrawals.With the takedown of Osama bin Laden are you worried that support for a U.S. role in Afghanistan is beginning to dry up?MCCAIN: Yes. I am worried. I'm greatly worried. And it isn't so much that bin Laden, taking him out, as it is that Americans are war-weary.Americans see all this money that we've spent. And they see the president of Afghanistan appearing ungrateful. They see the government of Pakistan, you know, in a very aggressive fashion in many ways toward us. There are continued relations with the Haqqani network and others.But we've also got to remember that it was Afghanistan where the 9/11 attacks began. If Taliban and then al-Qaeda take over in Afghanistan we could see a very, very serious threat to the United States national security. And remember, the Russians -- after the Russians left we got out completely. So, we shouldn't ignore the lessons of history.WALLACE: But how about the argument --MCCAIN: And, military, there is significant success on the ground. It's tough and it's hard, as General Petraeus predicted. But I've seen this movie before. It was in 2007 that the same movement to get out of Iraq and we managed to push that back and the surge succeeded.WALLACE: But how about the argument -- the president has already said he's going to begin drawing down U.S. troops in July. How about the argument when most of the people who would directly threaten us, for instance al Qaeda, but more of them are in Pakistan that they are in Afghanistan, what if we were to shrink the mission, from counterinsurgency to counterterrorism to focus on the ones who are a direct threat to the U.S. homeland?MCCAIN: I believe the only way you're able to arrive at the situation is when you get a stable situation and control of the country. That's why negotiations for the Taliban I think will be fruitless until the Taliban think they can't succeed. They are fighting ferociously because they're trying to take back the whole ground they have held for a long period of time.WALLACE: So, what would you say about the president in the July withdrawal?MCCAIN: I never thought that was a good idea. I always thought conditions on the ground should dictate withdrawals. But the president also emphasized 2014. I believe that by 2014, we will have succeeded in Afghanistan. As we have largely in Iraq, although we've got a problem with keeping some forces, I think, for a period of time to help the Iraqis complete the job.WALLACE: Finally, I mean, we only got a couple of minutes left. Let's do a lightning round on 2012 politics. You know something about presidential politics. Quick questions, quick answers.Sarah Palin announced that she is doing a bus tour starting today in Washington. It set off a media frenzy. Question -- can she win the Republican presidential nomination and can she beat Barack Obama?MCCAIN: Of course, she can. She can. Now, whether she will or not, whether she'll even run or not, I don't know.But you know, a lot of things happen in campaigns, Chris. You remember, I was written off a couple of times and were able to come back. So, there's going to be a roller coaster ride for all of them before we finally arrive at our nominee.But she certainly is a major factor. And I believe that she can be very competitive.WALLACE: And what her high negatives among -- especially among independents?MCCAIN: I think that the -- again, that's what campaigns are all about. I've never seen anyone as mercilessly and relentlessly attacked as I have seen Sarah Palin in the last couple of years. But she also inspires great passion, particularly among Republican faithful.WALLACE: OK. Lightning round rules. How big a problem is Romneycare for Mitt Romney?MCCAIN: I think I it's a problem. I think he realizes that. I think he's trying to address it. Whether he will successfully or not, I don't know. But he certainly has a good grassroots campaign in places like New Hampshire and others where he is really, you know -- having been around the block once is always a benefit for you the next time.WALLACE: Finally, after the bin Laden raid, you said enhanced interrogation did not contribute significantly to the successful take- down of bin Laden. Former Senator Rick Santorum said this.(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)FMR. SEN. RICK SANTORUM (R), PENNSYLVANIA: He doesn't understand how enhanced interrogation works. I mean, you break somebody, and after they're broken, they become cooperative.(END AUDIO CLIP)WALLACE: Question -- you have never responded to Santorum. What are your thoughts about what he said?MCCAIN: Well, I think he should look at the record including that of Director Leon Panetta, Dianne Feinstein, who both said that not only did we not get good information from the -- from KSM and others, but we got bad information. And the information that was primarily responsible for bringing bin Laden to justice had to do with standard methodology and intelligence gathering.And when you say that, by the way, it does a bit of the disservice to the thousands of people in our intelligence agency who labored night and day putting this puzzle altogether which we've become very aware of.WALLACE: You said, I remember, memorably in the 2008 campaign -- you were tied up during the 1968 Woodstock, things like that. What do you think of him saying you don't understand enhanced interrogation?MCCAIN: I think Rick realizes he made a mistake there. And so, it's just -- the major object here is that understand what torture does to the image of the United States in the world. But most importantly, it's about us.WALLACE: Senator McCain, we want to thank you as always for coming in. It's always a pleasure to talk to you, sir.MCCAIN: Thanks for having me on.WALLACE: Up next: as Sarah Palin's bus tour comes to Washington, we'll ask our Sunday group if she is about to steamroll the GOP president field.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SARAH PALIN, FMR. VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Freedom is a God-given right and it is worth fighting for. The Constitution provides the best roadmap for the more perfect union.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: That's a clip from Sarah Palin's video about her One Nation bus tour up the East Coast that starts today here in Washington.And it's time now for our Sunday group: Bill Kristol of The Weekly Standard; Nina Easton of Fortune magazine; Byron York from The Washington Examiner; and Fox News political analyst Juan Williams.Well, Bill, all Sarah Palin had to do was announce this bus tour a few days ago, and the political reporters and the chattering class went to DEFCON 1. As the man who helped spark the media's fascination with Sarah Palin three years ago, what do you think she's up to?BILL KRISTOL, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: I don't know, honestly. I don't think she's going to run. She's done nothing that would suggest to me that she's laying the groundwork for action running for the presidency, as opposed to trying to help shape the national debate and call attention to these wonderful memorials and monuments that she'll be visiting over the next week.(LAUGHTER)WALLACE: That's the best you got?KRISTOL: I'm leaving plenty of time for Nina here.WALLACE: Well, let me ask you, Nina, because Palin, even here, continues to have problems. She announced that she was going to participate in the Rolling Thunder veterans events here in Washington, never told organizers, who seemed somewhat miffed and said she will not be allowed to speak because they are very devoutly a nonpolitical organization.And take a look at these numbers from recent polls. In a Wall Street Journal poll last month, 25 percent -- this is all voters -- viewed Palin favorably, while 53 percent had an unfavorable opinion of her. That's a problem.NINA EASTON, FORTUNE MAGAZINE: I think the upside and downside of Sarah Palin and what people need to understand is that she carries her cards very close to her vest. I mean, she and her husband Todd call the shots. I mean, even close advisers don't always know what they're up to.That enables her to be super spontaneous, to do what she's doing this week, to which I think is really taking charge of her image again, jumping back in. It enables her to stir the sizzle, if you will. It enables her to shape the terms of the debate as she wants to take it.But I don't see any moves towards, you know, all that slog of a presidential campaign.She hasn't visited Iowa, South Carolina, New Hampshire. She's visiting New Hampshire this week. She's not reaching out to fundraisers and so on. Not that she won't have a big impact on the race.To me, the person to watch for in the next couple weeks is Michele Bachmann, who I do think will announce by June 15th, who is bringing advisers on board, and I do think will fill a lot of that space, the sort of Sarah Palin space.WALLACE: Byron, let's turn to the frontrunner in the race, Mitt Romney, who visited Iowa for the first time in seven months, which is kind of remarkable. But he wouldn't say whether or not he'll participate in the big straw poll there in August, which is a big deal in Iowa and to Iowa caucus-goers. He wouldn't say whether if he were president, he would sign the Paul Ryan Medicare plan into law. I know it sounds like an odd question, but Pawlenty had said he would sign it into law.How do you assess his chances?BYRON YORK, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Well, as far as strategy goes, if you talk to Romney advisers, they'll say, we're going to do it different this time, it didn't work the last time. So the question is, will he skip Iowa?He poured zillions of dollars into Iowa last time and did not -- well, it did not prevail. Mike Huckabee won. So they're going to do things differently this time. And he wouldn't commit to Ames, which could be viewed by people in Iowa as a sign that he's just not going to play hard there. Right now they're saying they'll play hard everywhere, but all the signs that they're going to do things differently, emphasize New Hampshire a lot more this time.WALLACE: And what's your sense, not just Iowa, but writ large about Romney's chances?JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think the fact that you see all these people trying to jump in the race right now after Mitch Daniels decided not to run, Chris, is evidence that people are just dissatisfied with the field. And I think the big divide here in terms of people like Sarah Palin, Michele Bachmann, is that people who are social conservatives feel they don't have a candidate.The reason Romney won't go to Iowa is that he feels he can't play ball with social conservatives. That's why I don't think he's going to do well in South Carolina. He might do somewhat well in New Hampshire, which he was -- you know, he was the governor of the neighboring state, Massachusetts, but he just doesn't have the sense of a passionate grassroots following that would elevate him in this contest right now. He's a very weak frontrunner, and I think that's why you see so many people jumping in.WALLACE: But one of the arguments is if the social conservatives -- you'd have Michele Bachmann, you'd have Herman Cain, you'd have Tim Pawlenty -- they split that vote -- he got, what, I think 25 percent of the vote in Iowa -- that he could win conceivably.WILLIAMS: He could, but what I'm saying is we're still at the point where the big money has not come behind any candidate to give them momentum. I think there's a thirst on the part of establishment Republicans at this point for someone even like Jeb Bush to jump in the race.WALLACE: All right. Let me turn, Bill, to two people whose names were prominently mentioned this week, that they might jump into the race. One is Governor Rick Perry of Texas. The other is Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City.What do you think, one, is the likelihood either will get in? And two, what kind of a factor do you think either of them will be?KRISTOL: I think it's unlikely Rudy Giuliani will get in. And if he does, I think it's unlikely he'll be the nominee. That's a reason he didn't win -- I mean, presumably, he would have been a stronger candidate in 2008, when the memory of his mayoralty was fresher than now.WALLACE: Then why is he up in New Hampshire?KRISTOL: Because all these guys look at the field and they think, really? I mean, I have as good a career as these other people who are running. Why don't I get a shot? And it is a wide open race.I think Governor Perry could well get in, and I have thought for months that if you came down from Mars and sort of looked at the possible Republican candidates, and you saw the governor of the second largest state in the nation with an extremely good record -- Texas has created jobs over the last 10 years while he's been governor, while the rest of the country has not -- over the last two years, I think Texas is the only state in the country perhaps that has net job creation I the private sector, and he's a Tea Party favorite.I mean, what do you need to be the Republican nominee? You need to have a proven record, I think, and you need to be accepted to and even exciting for Tea Party activist types.Perry checks both those boxes at once. I think Perry could be formidable if he got it.WALLACE: And how late could he get in and still be a player?KRISTOL: I think everyone's got until September. You know, I just came back from The Weekly Standard cruise, and you talk to Weekly Standard readers, Fox News viewers, conservative activists, Republican primary voters. They don't have the attitude like people here do that you've got to get in now, I want to know who's running. They have the attitude of, hey, we don't have to vote until February or March or April.Let's let people take their time. Let's see how the debate on the debt ceiling goes in Congress, and make up our minds about someone like Paul Ryan. Let's see what Perry decides. Let's see Allen West decides.WILLIAMS: But people don't understand, you've got to build an infrastructure to run. You have to have money to run.KRISTOL: I disagree. They understand more than insiders like you, Juan, about the new world. I'm serious about this.WILLIAMS: Well, OK.KRISTOL: I think their sense is in the new world of the Internet, immediate sort of news and the ability to raise money on the Internet, that you can go much later than you could in the old days.WALLACE: K. We have to take a break here.But when we come back, the debate over what to do about Medicare started out nasty and is getting worse.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE JOHN BOEHNER, R-OHIO: The only plan out there to preserve and protect Medicare for current and future retirees is the plan that we put forward.(END VIDEO CLIP)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SENATE MAJORITY LEADER HARRY REID, D-NEV.: The Republican plan to end Medicare is a nonstarter here in the Senate. I hope my Republican colleagues will stop pursuing this misguided plan and start working with Democrats on smart ways to reduce the deficit.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: That was House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid this week, just part of the growing political battle over what to do about and Medicare.And we're back now with the panel. Bill, the big development this week was the special election in Upstate New York in which Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, won in a district that has gone Republican for more than a half a century. Well, it wasn't the only factor. Paul Ryan's Medicare plan was a big issue there.How big a problem is it for Republicans?KRISTOL: It's a problem if they don't have anyone who can defend it well and defend it aggressively and say that the choice is not the status quo and Paul Ryan's reform. The choice is Paul Ryan's reform or Obamacare, or some other kinds of changes in Medicare because the status quo in unsustainable. We're going broke.Jane Corwin, in New York 26, was unable to make that case. It's pretty important that the Republican candidates next year and the Republican presidential candidate, I would add, be able to make that case.WALLACE: But Nina, both side in aftermath of the New York 26th race held their ground. Senate Republicans, except for four of them, all voted for the Ryan plan when it came up for kind of a shell vote in the Senate. And yet, House and Senate Democrats just intensified their attacks.So who's right?EASTON: Well, I think the Republicans ultimately are going to have the high ground on this. I mean, you look at -- the conventional wisdom now is hardening around this idea that this is going to be an albatross around the Republicans' necks. But if you listen to two little moments last week, one with Bill Clinton whispering to Paul Ryan backstage at a debt commission debate, I'm worried.I'm worried. I'm glad we won the special election, but I'm worried it's going to give us an excuse to do nothing. The other moment to me was House --WALLACE: But let me just say, he also said that the Ryan plan was wrong.EASTON: That's right, but he is worried that they're doing nothing.WALLACE: Right.EASTON: The same thing, House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer says, look, Medicare reform has to be on the table, he told a reporter this week. But we're not going to come out with specifics because its' dangerous, and look what happened to Paul Ryan.That says to me that they know they don't have the guts to pursue serious reform. And they know they have to. It is going bankrupt.I mean, if you don't have serious reform, you are signing the death papers for Medicare. And I think that's a very viable case to make.YORK: The Republicans aren't listening. You had the House and Senate together. There are 288 Republicans in Congress; 275 of them had voted for this. They own it.But there is this huge debate going on inside the Republican Caucus right now in how did we get here? They looked -- during the whole Obamacare debate, they looked at Democrats and said how could they be spending all of this time on national health care when the public cares most about jobs? And they ran and won in November on jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs. And now, five months later, they find themselves mired in this Medicare debate.And what you saw this week was they're trying to pivot jobs in the economy. There a horrible irony in that world, but they are trying to pivot to jobs in the economy. Eric Cantor came out with this new jobs creator plan. So they're going to try to emphasize what they seem to have forgotten for a while, which is that the public's number one concern remains jobs and the economy.WALLACE: But, Byron, I get a sense of what you're saying. You think that voting for the Paul Ryan plan and making it such a big deal, and now seeing it dominate the debate -- because, quite frankly, the Republican plan on the economy, which isn't all that new, kind of vanished without a trace this week.You think that was a mistake.YORK: Well, we don't a word called ""Mediscare"" for nothing. They knew this was going to happen, but I think they have been surprised at the degree to which it's completely taken over the debate. And the other pro-growth parts of the Ryan plan and their own growth policies have just fallen aside.WALLACE: Let's look at this from the Democrats' point of view, because their plan at this point seems to be exactly, you know, Mediscare. We're not going to offer anything. The Senate Democrats this decided this week they are not going to offer a budget, they don't have a plan to cut Medicare, and they're just simply going to say, look at what those guys are doing.Can they make that work all the way until 2012?WILLIAMS: Yes. Well, it's not that they are offering nothing. They have a plan.They have a health care plan, the Affordable Care Act, on the table. And when they put the plan up there, and they know it has some cuts in terms of things like Medicare Advantage in it, all Republicans did was use scare tactics and talk about death panels, and this is terrible, this is intrusive government.The fact is that now, with the Paul Ryan plan, the Republicans have put something on the that is extremely unpopular, as we just saw in the special election. And all this talk, including on this panel about, well, it's just a messaging problem? You know what? Jane Corwin, the Republican, she tried exactly the message of you guys and said, oh, well, you know, it's really about the deficit issue. Don't forget the deficit voters.You know what the voters said? This is a bad plan for seniors. It's going to drive up costs for us in terms of care at the end of our lives, and we don't want it. And we don't want it for our kids and grandfathering people who are over 55. Those people still said we don't want you to do it.EASTON: Even with the health care reform, the prediction is Medicare is going bankrupt. You can't get away from that. And it's important to note, the Ryan plan is not going to pass the Senate. It's a Democratic-controlled Senate. But there are other plans out there. There's --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Wait a minute. That was the plan that the House offered. That is -- I mean, Paul Ryan may be the face of the Republican Party more than anybody else on Capitol Hill.EASTON: But you don't see Senate Democrats rushing to embrace that or any other serious reforms as a negotiating point. You don't see that. What you see them, you see them hiding because they're afraid to stand up to activists who are -- who will call this -- that will say that this is cruel, or cuts --WILLIAMS: Let me just say you must have forgotten. Newt Gingrich, last -- I guess it was a few Sundays ago, said it was Republican radicalism and social engineering. Tim Pawlenty, you know, says that he likes it but he will introduce his own plan.I think what you see is a failure of the presidential candidates on the Republican side to support this. And I don't think you see a good job even being done by Republicans in the House and Senate in terms of making the case for it because everybody knows it's a loser.YORK: Republicans would say that Obamacare cut half a trillion dollars from Medicare to ensure previously uncovered people, whereas their plan cuts it to the extend the life of Medicare. That is a difference.KRISTOL: They also need to be more aggressive making the case that, ultimately, competition will improve Medicare. And I think that's something they've been too much in the mode of, oh, our cuts are going to be delayed. They need to really explain, which I believe to be true, incidentally, that these reforms would actually improve the quality of health care in the country.WILLIAMS: In other words, you trust the insurance industry.KRISTOL: But leaving aside these silly talking points --(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)KRISTOL: Fine. And look, in 2012, there's the man on the ballot called President Obama. He passed Obamacare. The choice will Obamacare versus the Republican vision for the future of health care, and the choice will be on the debt and deficit, which is an even bigger issue than Medicare in particular.Which party do you believe is serious about the fact that we are going broke? And if Republicans can't convince the country in 2012 that, A, we're going to broke, and, B, the Obama administration, the Democratic Party aren't serious about it, then the Republican Party deserves to lose, honestly. If they can't nominate a candidate who can make this case --WILLIAMS: I understand. OK. So the big difference between you and me is you trust the insurance companies, who have been absolutely abusive of people. And secondly, Republicans, for all this talk about oh, the deficit, the debt, we have to be serious, entitlement reform, refused to consider raising taxes.EASTON: Juan, serious Democrats in think thanks who actually want reform trust the private -- trust making it more of a private system than it is now. OK?WILLIAMS: Why would anybody trust the insurance companies? This is a puzzle to me.YORK: The problem for Republicans, this is a huge experiment. Even with the bad news we've had about Medicare, the problems are more than a decade away. It is a huge experiment to try to convince the voters that we have to do something really big, right now, for a problem that is still on horizon.WALLACE: Well, I'm glad we settled that.

It's only 24 notes. But it's so meaningful to that family.WALLACE (voice-over): Tom Day is talking about playing ""Taps"" at the funerals of military veterans. And he should know. He is the founder and president of an organization called Bugles Across America.(on camera): All told, how many funerals have you done since you started Bugles Across America""?DAY: Two hundred thousand.WALLACE: Really?DAY: In 10 years. Right.WALLACE (voice-over): It started back in 2000, when Congress gave every vet the right to a funeral with military honors, including two uniformed officers to present a flag and play ""Taps.""The problem was the military only had 500 buglers, so they sent someone to play a recorded ""Taps"" on a boom box or an electronic device inside a bugle.Tom Day, who played in the Marines in the '50s, didn't like it.DAY: I call it stolen dignity, that these veterans can't get live ""Taps"" when we are out there ready to perform live ""Taps.""WALLACE: So he started his organization, recruiting 400 horn players within a year.DAY: Now we have 6,270 horn players. And we're doing 2,200 funerals a month.WALLACE: It's become quite an operation that Day runs out of his basement near Chicago.Families can go on his Web site to ask for a bugler. A message is sent to every horn player within 100 miles of the funeral. Day gives away bugles and helps with uniforms.While they get support from foundations, he runs a deficit every year.WALLACE (on camera): How do you make up for shortfall?DAY: I kind of make it up myself.WALLACE: Fifteen thousand dollars, $20,000 a year?DAY: Probably $10,000.You finish the last of the 24 notes, you put the horn down, and the flag has been presented. Then the family comes over. The kisses, the handshakes from these families, there is nothing -- no amount of money could ever buy the feeling that I get from the family once I finish the 24 notes.WALLACE (voice-over): With soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, plus 1,800 veterans of World War II dying every day, there is a flood of military funerals. Day says he wants to keep going until he dies, then leave his organization in solid shape to carry on.DAY: I want every family to have live ""Taps"" at that going-away presentation of their veteran.

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/11/paul-ryan/ryan-obama-promised-unemployment-would-not-exceed-/	"	Says Obama promised unemployment would never go above 8 percent."	mostly false	['Jobs']	http://www.politifact.com/	http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/09/american-crossroads/ad-says-barack-obama-promised-jobless-rate-would-b/	2012/10/11	"""This is what President Obama said the jobless rate would be if we passed the stimulus: 5.6 percent.""— American Crossroads on Tuesday, October 2nd, 2012 in a TV adAd says Barack Obama promised the jobless rate would be 5.6% if Congress passed the stimulusBy Becky Bowers on Tuesday, October 9th, 2012 at 3:02 p.m.An ad by the Republican-aligned group American Crossroads attacks President Barack Obama's economic record.American Crossroads says Obama promised a jobless rate of 5.6 percent.Obama's economic team said its projections, such as this one of the jobless rate, were subject to uncertainty and ""significant margins of error.""A new ad claims President Barack Obama broke his promise about the impact of the economic stimulus plan.The ad uses a familiar Republican talking point, that Obama ""promised"" low unemployment if the stimulus was passed. We've checked many claims it would stay below 8 percent, but this ad says it would drop to 5.6 percent.It's a flashy ad from pro-Republican super PAC American Crossroads, using gleaming Minority Report-style graphics manipulated by a narrator in an empty warehouse. The version we've seen still running this week uses an outdated number, saying unemployment is ""actually"" 8.1 percent. The latest monthly report, which came out Friday, says it is now 7.8 percent.In this fact-check, we’re focusing on what Obama said the jobless rate would be if Congress passed a stimulus plan.Separately, we are checking the ad’s claim that ""Obama’s spending drove us $5 trillion deeper in debt.""Here’s the full narration:""This is what President Obama said the jobless rate would be if we passed the stimulus: 5.6 percent. But this is what the jobless rate actually is: 8.1 percent. The difference? About 3.7 million jobs. Obama’s spending drove us $5 trillion deeper in debt, and now we have fewer jobs than when he started. What Obama promised vs. what he delivered.""The screen displays the line, ""We can’t afford 4 more years.""What Obama saidWe asked American Crossroads for material to support the ad. Spokesman Jonathan Collegio referred us to a Jan. 9, 2009, report prepared before Obama took office, and a speech by the president-elect.The report, designed to help Obama argue for an aggressive response to the burgeoning jobs crisis, featured projections for the effect of a stimulus plan.Those estimates include a chart, "" Unemployment Rate With and Without Recovery Plan ,"" that displays a post-stimulus jobless rate around 5.6 percent in mid 2012, like the chart in the American Crossroads ad.But Christina Romer, chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser, also wrote that their estimates were ""subject to significant margins of error,"" and ""considerable uncertainty.""We’ve previously ruled that the report was not a promise, but a projection, noting its several caveats.How about the president-elect’s speech introducing the report?Here, too, we find it's a stretch to describe it as a promise. It doesn’t get into specific jobless rates, but does talk about projected job gains if a stimulus plan — which Congress had yet to write — were to pass.Collegio pointed out that Obama:• Said the report presented ""what this plan will mean,"" not ""roughly what this plan might mean.""• Said ""we’ll create jobs"" not ""could create jobs.""""Obama did promise it,"" Collegio said.But Obama’s speech first presents the report’s findings as ""projections,"" and later says that a stimulus plan would ""likely"" save or create 3 million to 4 million jobs. Only then does he simplify his language to say, ""we’ll create"" as he talks about a focus on jobs in energy, health care and infrastructure.Here’s how he sets it up:""I asked my nominee for Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Dr. Christina Romer, and the Vice President-Elect's Chief Economic Adviser, Dr. Jared Bernstein, to conduct a rigorous analysis of this plan and come up with projections of how many jobs it will create — and what kind of jobs they will be. Today, I am releasing a report of their findings so that the American people can see exactly what this plan will mean for their families, their communities, and our economy. The report confirms that our plan will likely save or create three to four million jobs.""And as we mentioned, the report carried Romer and Bernstein’s warnings about the uncertainty of their projections, including that ""the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity.""As we now know, as the pair prepared their estimates, the economy was already far worse than the best numbers at the time captured. The unemployment rate hit 8 percent even before Obama signed a stimulus package into law in February 2009.Our rulingAn ad from American Crossroads says, ""This is what President Obama said the jobless rate would be if we passed the stimulus: 5.6 percent.""But we find that's a stretch. In the evidence the group provided, Obama doesn’t mention that statistic. Rather, he introduced ""projections"" that included a chart showing the jobless rate falling to 5.6 percent under a recovery plan. The report highlighted the estimates’ ""significant margins of error"" and high uncertainty due to a recession that was ""unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity."" The economy was, in fact, much worse than economists knew. The chart is now infamous, but it was never pitched as a promise. We rate the statement Mostly False.Advertisement"

Xavier Becerra, Geno AuriemmaThis is a rush transcript from ""Fox News Sunday,"" May 11, 2014. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.CHRIS WALLACE, ANCHOR: I'm Chris Wallace.An international effort to bring hundreds of Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped by Islamic extremists.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: Protesters take to the streets. And the Internet to express outrage over the abduction. As the world rallies, what should the U.S. do? And what is Boko Haram?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's no question we're racing against the clock. They've been gone for a long time.WALLACE: We'll sit down with the former U.S. ambassador to Nigeria, John Campbell, and the co-founder of the Malala Fund, Shiza Shahid.Then, House Republicans name members of the select committee to investigate Benghazi. But will Democrats participate?REP. TREY GOWDY, R-S.C.: I want to talk to everyone who has firsthand knowledge of what happened that night. And I want access to every document.HOUSE MINORITY LEADER NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.: This is a stunt. This is a political stunt.WALLACE: We'll talk with the chair of the committee, Congressman Trey Gowdy, and the head of the House Democratic Caucus, Xavier Becerra. It's a ""Fox News Sunday"" exclusive.And with Republicans investigating Benghazi and citing IRS official Lois Lerner for contempt, Democrats dismiss it as conspiracy week. Our Sunday panel discusses which side has the better argument.Plus, our Power Player of the Week. Geno Auriemma has led UConn's women's basketball team to nine national championships. Now, he's talking to Pentagon officials about leadership.GENO AURIEMMA, UCONN COACH: We're doing the same thing they're doing, except the stakes for us are just winning and losing a game.All, right now, on ""Fox News Sunday.""(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: And hello again from Fox News in Washington.As we celebrate Mother's Day, it remains a time of heartbreak for hundreds of mothers in Nigeria, whose daughters have been kidnapped by Islamist militants. First lady Michelle Obama spoke out in this week's presidential address.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHELLE OBAMA, FIRST LADY: In these girls, about a rack and I see our own daughters. We see their hopes and their dreams. And we can only imagine the anguish their parents are feeling right now.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: More than 250 girls are still missing.Let's get the latest now from Fox News national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin -- Jennifer.JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Chris, six unarmed U.S. military personnel are now on the ground in Nigeria, part of a group of 16 U.S. personnel. They've been sent to try to pinpoint where the kidnapped schoolgirls are being held by the Islamic fighters known as Boko Haram. There are rising demands that the U.S. and others do more to help the mothers and families of these young girls.And now, the Pentagon is discussing the possibility of moving surveillance and reconnaissance assets towards Nigeria, possibly drones. A senior U.S. official tells me they are waiting for Nigeria to formally make the request. However, there is still no talk of sending armed U.S. troops to assist the search.Outrage ensued three weeks after the kidnapping when this video appeared this week from the leader of Boko Haram laughing as he boasted about converting the Christian girls in the group to Islam, threatening to sell the girls into slavery. The U.S. placed a $7 million bounty on him last year, and in November, designated Boko Haram a foreign terror organization after the State Department resisted request to do so for several years.The group's name means ""Western education is a sin."" The first lady tweeted this picture demanding the girls' return.The Nigerian president who did not speak publicly about the kidnapped girls or call for a security meeting to mount a search for more than two weeks finally spoke.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOODLUCK JONATHAN, NIGERIAN PRESIDENT: (INAUDIBLE)(END VIDEO CLIP)GRIFFIN: Perhaps the most explosive revelation since the kidnapping on April 15th is that the Nigerian military was warned four hours before it occurred and did not use its security forces to try to stop it -- Chris.WALLACE: Jennifer, thank you.For more, we're joined by the CEO and co-founder of a Malala Fund, Shiza Shahid, who's in New York. And here in studio, former U.S. ambassador to Nigeria, John Campbell.President Obama talked about the limits of what he can do to try to rescue these schoolgirls. Let's watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I have this remarkable title right now, president of the United States. And, yet, there are times in which I want to reach out and save those kids and -- having to think through what levers, what power do we have at any given moment.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Ambassador Campbell, realistically, what can the U.S. and also what can the government of Nigeria do to try to save those hundreds of schoolgirls?JOHN CAMPBELL, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO NIGERIA: The U.S. can provide technical assistance, particularly intelligence, intelligence sharing. It can also provide expertise in things like negotiation strategies if and when that becomes something which is feasible.However, for the U.S. to do anything requires the request and acquiescence of the Nigerian government. Nigeria is a sovereign country. And we can operate in Nigeria only at the behest of the government.WALLACE: And why -- because this came up in Jennifer's report, why has Nigeria been so reluctant to take action for itself and to ask for international help?CAMPBELL: Nigeria traditionally views itself as the giant of Africa as indeed it is in terms of population. It is a proud country that for a long time has played an extraordinarily positive role in conflict resolution in West Africa.In other words, the Nigerian -- Nigerians look to help, not be helped. So, this is a different set of circumstances for Nigeria.WALLACE: Let me bring up one more question. What does this terrorist group Boko Haram want? Is this all about a prisoner swap for some of their members who are in Nigerian jails or is this simply about terrorizing the Nigerian people and undercutting the central government?CAMPBELL: What Boko Haram's rhetoric says is it wants to destroy the Nigerian state. It wants to destroy the Nigerian state because the state is secular. It wants to destroy Western education because it sees Western education as promoting secularism and shaping the Nigerian state.WALLACE: Ms. Shahid, you run the Malala Fund named after your good friend Malala Yousufzai, who was subject to a terrible attack in Pakistan -- a schoolgirl who was speaking for girls' rights.Why are these terrorists -- these Islamist groups so frustrated, so threatened by the power of women?SHIZA SHAHID, CEO & CO-FOUNDER, MALALA FUND: Chris, it's unfortunately a tactic that we've seen deployed by extreme groups again and again as means of intimidation, of control, of terrorizing families, of terrorizing entire populations. And it really stems from the wider ideology of groups like Boko Haram and the Taliban which attacked Malala, of course. That is fear of progress, fear of liberal and progressive thinking, and fear of women in particular being empowered.In the Swat Valley, we saw this as a gradual progression where first children were asked to be segregated, then they demanded some changes in the curriculum and then moved towards actual destruction of schools. And in Nigeria, it's been an even swifter and more horrifying attack with the kidnapping of almost 300 schoolgirls.WALLACE: Let me ask you about the actions of the Malala Fund, because you're now donating all the money you (INAUDIBLE) to Nigerian women's groups and you are calling for urgent action to try to save these girls. Would you like to see President Obama and the U.S. use all military assets to launch a rescue mission?SHAHID: Well, I think it's promising that the Nigerian president has accepted the offers of support from the U.S. and from the United Kingdom and that these teams are now on the ground. It's unfortunate that it took three weeks for this cooperation to come about. And given that it is Mother's Day, we are hopeful that things will move quickly from here on.It's also been incredibly promising to see the power of social media in this case, almost 900,000 signatures on the petition Change.org calling for the release of these girls, and 2 million impressions on Twitter with the hashtag, #bringbackourgirls. It really compelled the Nigerian government and international community to move on this issue.We have to stay hopeful and, you know, the Malala Fund is pushing and a variety of groups are pushing to see these girls return safely and to see longer term investments in the security and education of Nigeria.WALLACE: Former Secretary of State Clinton spoke out this week about the kidnappings. Here she is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON: The government of Nigeria needs to get serious about protecting all of its citizens, girls and women, as well as boys and men, and ensuring that every child has the right and opportunity to go to school in security and safety.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: But, Ambassador Campbell, Secretary Clinton has come under fire this week because of the fact that back in 2011 she rejected calls by the FBI and intelligence community to designate Boko Haram as a foreign terrorist organization. As a Bush appointee to the ambassador, do you think that's fair the criticism of Secretary Clinton?CAMPBELL: No, I don't think it's fair. And along with good many other Nigerian experts at the time, we all opposed designation.We opposed designation because we don't think that the legislation actually fits the situation in Nigeria. The Boko Haram movement is highly diffuse. It's not a centralized organization. It has important grassroots, elements to it.The legislation has to do essentially with issues like getting visas to come to the U.S. or movement of money from the U.S. to Nigeria, neither of which is relevant. What the legislation also does, however, is it inhibits the possibility of future contact between either private citizens or public personalities with Boko Haram, and at some future points, that may reduce the options that we have in terms of negotiation.WALLACE: Ms. Shahid, you know, that's, of course the problem here. This is obviously a horrific event. How do you reconcile your call for justice and fighting and dealing with groups like Boko Haram or the Taliban in Pakistan with all of these complications and diplomatic considerations?SHAHID: Well, I think there's things that we know have to be done -- in particular, bolstering local organizations and civil society inside Nigeria. We've known for a long time that Nigeria's local education situation is appalling. One out of every six children are out of school and are inside Nigeria and the state of protection for girls and women remains incredibly shocking.So, whether we move on certain diplomatic fronts is important but in addition what is important is that all ordinary people or aid institutions invest in building Nigeria as a country, as an economy and in the next generation through schools and through education.WALLACE: Ambassador Campbell, we have a minute left. First of all, do you think the 200, 250 girls are all in one group? Do you think they've been split up? What are the realistic chance that's we'll ever be able to save them?CAMPBELL: We, of course, have no hard information on that. But I think it's highly likely that they have been split up. And given the fact that national borders in that part of Africa are essentially lines on a piece paper drown by the British and French, I think we have to anticipate that some are in Cameroon, some are in probably Niger, perhaps some as far as Chad, as well as some in Nigeria.WALLACE: Do you think we'll ever get them back?CAMPBELL: I think the question is how many do we get back? We're talking about a very large number of people. The Nigerian media reports that two of the girls already have been killed by snake bite.WALLACE: So, it's a bleak situation?CAMPBELL: It's a bleak situation.WALLACE: Ms. Shahid, Ambassador Campbell, we want to thank you both so much for coming in today. We will stay on top of this story.CAMPBELL: Thank you.SHAHID: Thank you.WALLACE: Do you think the U.S. should do more to try to rescue the Nigerian schoolgirls? Join the conversation on Facebook with other FNS viewers.Up next, House Republicans set up a select committee to investigate Benghazi. The Democrats are divided about whether to participate. We'll talk with the chair of the new panel as well as the head of the House Democratic Caucus.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: House Speaker John Boehner has named seven Republicans to a select committee to investigate the Benghazi terror attack. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi calls it a political stunt and is still considering whether her party will participate.The new chair of the select committee, congressman and former prosecutor, Trey Gowdy, joins us from South Carolina. And here in Washington, Congressman Xavier Becerra, head of the House Democratic Caucus.Congressman Gowdy, you have been talking this week about how you're going to run this committee, and one comment has raised some eyebrows. Here it is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOWDY: If the administration is slow-walking document production, I can't end the trial simply because the defense won't cooperate.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Congressman, do you see this investigation as a trial? And do you see the White House as the defense?GOWDY: No, sir, and I would hasten that -- first of all, happy Mother's Day you to and Mr. Becerra.I would also hasten to add that trials are both criminal and civil for 16 years I spoke in trial metaphors and perhaps I need to get out of that habit. What I simply meant is, when you ask me how long something's going to last, I need to know how cooperative the other side is going to be. So, to the extent that I said any indication to anyone that I view someone as the defense, what I meant by that is if you can tell me how cooperative the other side is going to be, I can give you a better idea of how long something's going to last.WALLACE: Congressman Becerra, you have been talking about the committee as a kangaroo court, your words. First of all, how do you know that before it even begins meeting? And do you really believe that all the questions about Benghazi have been answered?HOUSE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS CHAIRMAN XAVIER BECERRA, D-CALIF.: Well, what leads us to believe it could be a kangaroo court or a smokescreen from having to deal with the real issues Americans want to deal with like job creation and so forth, is that we've done these investigations some seven times, five of the investigations coming out of five of the House Republican committees.And so, we've done this over 18 months. We've spent millions of dollars. And we see what happens when you have a short trial.WALLACE: Let me ask you a question, do you believe that all the questions about the Benghazi have been answered?BECERRA: I have not heard any new questions raised that have not been answered.WALLACE: Let me ask you a question and maybe you can answer it for me. Where was the president? And what did he do the night of the attack?BECERRA: I believe the president was at the White House and he was in communication with some of the folks with his administration in and around time of the attacks.WALLACE: Do you -- do you know, Congressman Gowdy, where the president was and what he was doing during the seven hours of the attack?GOWDY: No, sir, I do not. Nor do I know what communication if any he had with Secretary of State Clinton, nor can I tell you why we were still in Benghazi despite the fact that there was an escalation in violence in the months leading up, nor do I know whether or not the president called any of our allies in the region and said, can you get any assets to Benghazi? We're under attack.I have more questions than answers despite the fact that committees of Congress have looked at this attack for 19 months now.WALLACE: Congressman Becerra, can you answer the specific questions that you just heard from Congressman Gowdy?BECERRA: Sure. And by the way, I also want to say happy Mother's Day to all the mothers out there. But, Trey, you served on one of the committees that did this investigation. You're a great prosecutor. You should have asked those questions or you could have asked those questions. I bet you did ask those questions.And so, the issue, Chris, is, are we going over and over and over? And now are we setting up a process that's not only going to be a fair, balanced or open approach to this, but also is appearing to be a smokescreen so they can raise campaign funds, because right now, we know the Republicans are raising campaign funds off of this Benghazi investigation that they're calling for. And so, it's very distressing --WALLACE: We're going to get to the campaign funds in a moment. But what about this argument, Congressman Gowdy, you had the opportunity to ask those questions before?GOWDY: Well, first of all, thank you, Mr. Becerra, for overstating my career as a prosecutor.Secondly, I don't have access to intel. I don't have access to sources and methods. I don't have access -- I have never interviewed Susan Rice about anything. I have never an opportunity to ask the secretary of state questions about the lead-up to Benghazi and why we were still there.One of the problems with the existing committee structure is they are stovepipe -- they are fragmented. We can't cross jurisdictional boundaries, which is why I asked for a select committee over a year ago, so that we can tear the barriers down and we can have access to all the information, and we're not stovepipe or fragmented according to which committee we're on.WALLACE: All right. I have another question and maybe the biggest question at this point is whether or not Democrats participate in this process?Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was making some demands this week. Let's put them up on the screen.Democrats must sign off on subpoenas. They must be allowed to participate and witness interviews and Republicans must not selectively release testimony.Congressman Becerra, I have a simple question, you are saying if you get satisfactory answers to those, that Democrats will participate? And if you don't, that you won't?BECERRA: We've participated in all the other seven investigations. If it's a fair, open and balanced process, absolutely. But we don't want to see reckless, irresponsible handling of an affair that took the lives of four brave Americans.WALLACE: So, I just want to -- you're saying that if you are satisfied with the ground rules, you're declaring that the Democrats will appoint members to this committee? BECERRA: I believe so. We've always said that we're ready to participate. We have an oversight responsibility in Congress. What we don't want to see is reckless and irresponsible use of Congress and taxpayer money to do these witch hunts.WALLACE: Congressman Gowdy, is it unreasonable for Democrats to demand some say in how the committee is run?GOWDY: No, sir. And if you talk to the ranking members of the two subcommittees that I have presided, Zoe Lofgren and Eleanor Holmes Norton, they will tell you I don't run my committees the way that Democrats are fearful of.I want a process, Chris, that at the end of it, you are welcomed to draw different conclusions from the facts. But I want everyone to say, it was fair. It was exhaustive and we know more than we did when it started.So, on two of those three points, I think reasonable minds can agree. On the first point though, Chris, imagine you and I starting an investigation and the first thing you ask for is the ability to deny or veto subpoenas going to witnesses. How can it be a pursuit of the truth?BECERRA: We've never asked for that, Trey. What we're simply saying is, make it a process where we can't be excluded from the interview of witnesses, where we can't be excluded when a decision is made to subpoena a witness. Make it so that we're all in the room when we're reviewing the documents that are supposed to be evidence.What we don't want to be is excluded. We don't want the American public to be shutout. Fair, balanced and open --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Go ahead, Congressman.GOWDY: How does it benefit me, Xavier, when I said from day one, I want this to transcend politics and I want it to inspire trust in you and our citizens? How does it benefit me to do any of the things you just listed? I haven't done it in the first three years that I'm in Congress.WALLACE: I'm going to declare a victory here and say that the Democrats are going to participate. This week --BECERRA: Based on a fair, balanced and open process.WALLACE: I love the fact that you're adopting the Fox News slogan.BECERRA: We call it the Fox standard, OK?WALLACE: The Fox standard? You could do worse.This week, Hillary Clinton said Benghazi has been thoroughly investigated, but then she added this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Some choose not to be satisfied and choose to continue to move forward. That's their choice. And I do not believe there is any reason for it to continue in this way but they get to call the shots in the Congress.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Congressman Gowdy, what specifically do you want to learn from Secretary Clinton and how do you answer charges that one of the major goals of this committee is to hurt Hillary Clinton's chances for 2016?GOWDY: Chris, I have no friends to reward and no foes to punish. We're going to go wherever the facts take us.Facts are neither Republican nor Democrat. They are facts. And if we overplay our hand or if we engage in a process that is not fair, according to the American people, we will be punished as we should be for that.(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: So tell me the single biggest question you want to ask Secretary Clinton?GOWDY: Why were we still in Benghazi? The British ambassador was almost assassinated. Our facility was attacked twice. There were multiple episodes of violence. We were the last flag flying in Benghazi and I would like to know why.WALLACE: The Pew Research Center did a poll recently, I want to put results up on the screen because when asked, what single thing they have the most negative view of in Hillary Clinton's career people said Benghazi, even more than the Monica Lewinsky scandal.Congressman Becerra, people still have a lot of questions about Hillary Clinton's role.BECERRA: Chris, so the year and a half that was spent by seven different committees didn't answer that? Of course it did.WALLACE: Wait. Wait. You keep pointing to that.We didn't find out -- and they have subpoenaed all the State Department documents -- excuse me, sir -- they had subpoenaed all the State Department documents, and it took until last week for the administration finally to release the Ben Rhodes e-mail in which two days before Susan Rice appeared on this show, he was suggesting that she'd say that it was because of the video, not because of a policy failure.BECERRA: You got juiced (ph). You know that that email shows nothing new. It simply -- WALLACE: I don't agree with that. I think it shows something dramatically new. It shows that despite what the White House -- it shows despite what the White House has been saying for the last year and a half, it shows that inside the White House, they were telling Susan Rice what to say.BECERRA: Chris, every time you get a witness or someone that comes to talk you to here, they're always going to try to prepare for that conversation with you.WALLACE: That's not what Jay Carney had said for 20 months.BECERRA: That e-mail had nothing that is inconsistent with what the CIA and our security personnel were telling us at the time. It's exactly the same.But if I can make one quick point -- I love what Trey just said. I hope Trey is going to stay true to what he just said. The rules, however, will determine if this is a fair process, not what Trey says. It's whether the rules or the conduct of the hearing will provide for a fair, open and balanced process.WALLACE: All right. You brought up an earlier point, I want to finish with that with Congressman Gowdy.You say this is not political, that this is just about fact- finding. But as Congressman Becerra brought up, just this week, the National Republican Congressional Committee, which is the committee that supports GOP House candidates sent thought fund-raiser. ""House Republicans will make sure that no one will get away from Gowdy and the select committee and then will you automatically add your name today to join us and become a Benghazi watchdog?""This is a fund-raiser coming out from the NRCC. Congressman Gowdy, isn't this exactly the problem, the danger, the risk that you overstep your bounds? The GOP, not you personally, you overreach and you make this political and as Congressman Becerra mentioned, you end up like going on a political hunt instead of dealing with issues that people deal with their daily lives like ObamaCare and jobs?GOWDY: Yes, which is exactly why I said I will never and have never sent out any fund-raising literature trying to raise money in the grief and tragedy of four dead Americans. I have asked my colleagues to follow suit.But my friends and colleague Tommy Cotton from Arkansas did a magnificent job on the House floor of pointing out the duplicity and hypocrisy of Democrats all of a sudden concluding that certain things are above politics. They raise money on Sandy Hook. They raise money on Katrina. They raise money on Iraq and Afghanistan.So, for me, I will not raise money on Benghazi just like I never raised money using crime victims when I was a prosecutor and I've asked my colleagues to follow suit. But it would be helpful, it would be helpful if our colleagues on other side of the aisle did not have selective amnesia when it comes to what's appropriate to raise money off of and what is not.WALLACE: All right. We're going to have to leave it there.Congressman Gowdy, Congressman Becerra, thank you both so much. Thanks for joining us today.BECERRA: Thank you.GOWDY: Thank you.WALLACE: From Benghazi to the IRS, Republicans are pursuing administration scandals. But democrats dismiss it as conspiracy week. Our Sunday group weighs in.Plus, what would you like to as the panel about accusations of politics on both sides of the Benghazi investigation? Just go to Facebook or Twitter @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER, R-OHIO: They've not told the truth about Benghazi. They've not told the truth about the IRS. They've not told the truth about ""Fast and Furious."" Now only one would have to guess if they're not willing to tell the American people the truth, it must not be very pretty.PELOSI: I think it's pretty clear, their focus on the Affordable Care Act has run its course. It's run its course. Now they have to find something else to talk about.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: House Speaker John Boehner and Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi debating this week whether alleged administration scandals are real or phony. And it's time now for our Sunday group. Brit Hume, Fox News senior political analyst, Julie Pace who covers the White House for the Associated Press, syndicated columnist George Will, author of the new book ""A Nice Little Place on the North Side"" about Wrigley Field at 100. And Fox News political analyst Juan Williams. Well, we asked you for questions for the panel. And we got two on Facebook that we want to put up. First of all, Tom Johnson asks, ""How can Republicans conduct these investigations so they are not written off as more Washington antics? And Donna Marie Sikes writes, ""I want to know what the Democrats are afraid of finding out."" Brit, they were writing about Benghazi. But how would you answer both of them when it comes to both Benghazi and also the pursuit of the IRS investigation?BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: I think that the answer to the first question is that it is a tall order to try to keep this inquiry from being written off as just political antics. Trey Gowdy displays the right spirit and the right attitude. He is articulate. I think he'll be a more effective chairman than those who have conducted these prior inquiries have been. But there is some things that he doesn't have that normally are present in these situations. There is no tail wind afforded by a red hot media climate on this issue. There has been a little bit more media -- mainstream media buy in on this story lately, but not very much. And that has always been present in the past and when these investigations have worked because it required the politicians in both parties to participate and not simply obstruct. My guess is that Democrats in this case will feel utterly free, as you can - and you could pick this up from Nancy Pelosi's comments, to kind of dismiss this and really not contribute. And that will add to the sense that this is a political circus. So, I think it's a tall order.WALLACE: Julie, you covered the White House. And I'm curious, how do top officials there regard what the Democrats are calling conspiracy week, the appointment of the select committee, the voting by the House of Lois Lerner, the IRS official in contempt. Do they see these as serious threats or do they think that Republicans have been distracted from better issues, more effective issues for them like ObamaCare?JULIE PACE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: Well, I don't think that they write them off completely, especially in the midterm election year. Any time you have something that in the atmosphere, that is not about jobs or any of the other issues that they want to be talking about, it's going to be a distraction for them. But they certainly think that Republicans have a lot of risk involved with focusing on both of these issues. You know, when you look at polling of the top issues that Americans are focused on in the midterm elections, neither the IRS or Benghazi tends to rate as a top issue. So, they think that Republicans have a risk of overreaching. But to get to one of the questions that was posed on Facebook about what are Democrats worried about coming out of this that is something that Democrats are talking about. If there is nothing to hide, maybe we should at least have a seat at the table in this Benghazi committee just to make sure that we're represented and to show that we feel like we have nothing to hide.WALLACE: George, is Nancy Pelosi right? Has ObamaCare run its course and Republicans are looking for something else to talk about?GEORGE WILL, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: No. ObamaCare has served its political function for Republicans, in mobilizing the base for what will be a mobilization election. Furthermore, late summer, probably, we'll begin to get the rate increases that will come from the various state insurance directors and it will have new lease on life. So, I don't think this has anything to do with that. This has to do with the fact that Republicans think something was terribly wrong at and around that compound that night. My hope is that they pull the focus back and ask what were we doing in Libya in the first place and what was in my judgment an unconstitutional, not to mention, illegal intervention, and furthermore, the American people could usefully be instructed as to whether or not General Lovell was right when he testified ...WALLACE: He's the deputy head of intelligence for AFRICOM, U.S. Forces in Africa.WILL: He strongly indicated that in his judgment more could have been done militarily while the attack was under way at the compound. Americans, perhaps, need to answer that and the military needs to weigh in on what it can do with its F-16s and the compound under attack in an urban neighborhood.WALLACE: Juan, Democrats say, and I want to -- this is a point that George was making, that this is just Republicans trying to gin up their face. But even if that is true in a midterm election, which is really about turnout, as many more - many fewer people vote if a midterm than in a presidential election, isn't that still an effective strategy?JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Yeah, I mean and it's an important strategy right now for Republicans. This week a lot of the Tea Party really was evidence in decline. Tom Tillis, one in the North Carolina, Republican primary, who was the non-Tea Party candidate, that's being reflected now across the country. I think you see the Tea Party in decline. There was a poll this week show Tea Party support nationally down, and principally down among Republicans. But the Tea Party is the energizing base of the Republican vote. And in order to get that vote, you have got to go to the talk show audiences. You have got to give them some red meat. And the red meat in this case is another -- this will be the 14th Benghazi investigation. Not to disagree with George about the importance of finding out why we were in Libya, what was going on at the compound that night, but none of that is the genesis of this probe. The genesis is, oh, there was an email we hadn't seen that said the White House -- one White House official wanted to project the videos more aggressively and Secretary Rice with talking points. That's all politics. Yeah, you want to make the president look good. And, yes, in fact, there were protests in Egypt, Tunisia and elsewhere caused by the video. So this has been -- it's a total farce this thing. It's a political farce. And intended to stir the Republican base and turnout for this election.WALLACE: All right. I know that there are several people on this panel are champing at the bit to get to follow that. But I want to turn back to the kidnapping, the terrible kidnapping of these Nigerian schoolgirls in the little bit of time we have left in this segment. Because this week Michelle Obama and Malala Yousafzai joined the Bring Back Our Girls movement. More than 2 million people have now tweeted the hash tag. And George, I'm just curious. Because I'm not saying I was that familiar with this phenomenon. It's even got a name, #activism. And I'm curious what you make of it. Do you think that this is significant and helpful? And can make progress? Or do you think it's really about helping the people who tweet the hash tag feel better about themselves?WILL: Exactly that. It's an exercise in self-esteem. I do not know how adults stand there facing a camera and say, bring back our girls. Are these barbarians in the wild of Nigeria are supposed to check their Twitter accounts and say, oh, Michelle Obama is very crossed with us, we better change our behavior.WALLACE: It's trending on Twitter.WILL: Power is the ability to achieve intended effects. And this is not intended to have any effect on the real world. It's a little bit like environmentalism has become. But the incandescent light bulb becomes the enemy. It has no effect whatever on the planet, but it makes people feel good about themselves.WALLACE: Julie?PACE: I do think that you have to take this for what it is. I don't think anyone is saying that by standing there and taking a picture of yourself holding a sign that you're going to get these girls back. But you have to remember, this is something that had really not been talked about, not even by the Nigerian government itself before this started to really take hold on social media. Now, what it has done is put more pressure on the Nigerian government to accept some international assistance and to raise questions about, you know, why they hadn't done that previously. So, standing there holding a sign does not bring the girls back but it could ratchet up the pressure that could lead to some more international assistance.WALLACE: All right. We have to take a break here, but when we come back, Pro-Russian separatists hold a referendum today on independence for eastern Ukraine. We'll have a live report and hear again from our panel.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Heading to the polls in eastern Ukraine as pro-Russian separatists hold a referendum on independence for the region. Let's get the latest now from Fox News senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot live in Donetsk. Greg?GREG PALKOT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Chris, our audience (ph) continue in this controversial referendum here in eastern Ukraine. Local officials tell us that the turnout is colossal. Kiev and the State Department is branding the vote illegal. Here's a little bit of what we saw.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PALKOT: The ballots for this referendum vote on self-rule in the region are marked in private over there and then brought over to these transparent ballot boxes where we can get an early unofficial exit poll. The ""Da""s or yes, have it.In fact, there are a lot of irregular aspects to this poll based on old electoral rolls, if you are not on the list, you can vote anyway. Besides, there are no international observers around. Plus, the wording on the ballot is vague - yes -- could mean anything from greater autonomy to breaking away from Kiev to joining up with Russia. Those not agreeing seem to be staying away. Those showing up were pretty vocal with us. All that's done, of course, in an atmosphere of violence, security at the poll stations was visible and it was pretty heavy handed nearby. Government buildings were occupied by those pro- Russian militants. Well, the day went mostly peacefully, there were clashes reported between Ukrainian military and rebels and there were some threats at polling stations. We should expect the first results from this vote later tonight and then we'll look for reaction, especially from Russia. Vladimir Putin has been keeping a pretty careful distance from this vote in the last couple of days. Chris?WALLACE: Greg Palkot reporting from eastern Ukraine. Greg, thanks for that. And we're back now with the panel. Well, I think it's fair to say that Russian President Putin has been playing a very complicated game this week. He said he wanted to delay today's vote, but the separatists went ahead with it. He said he was pulling Russian forces back from the border of Ukraine. But then there is no sign from NATO that he did. And what you're watching now is he made a surprise visit to Crimea to celebrate the annexation of that region of Ukraine by Russia. Brit, what is Putin's strategy in all of this?HUME: His strategy is to pull into Russia's orbit as much of Ukraine as he can and as much as he wants. And so far nothing that the United States and its allies have done seems to have deterred him even in the slightest bit. He's holding all the high cards at the moment. He can take his time. He can react to the outcome of this referendum however he pleases. He can be patient. He can pause. And then he can move. But I think the direction is clear and I don't think that the disagreements among allies about what to do about it are anything, but an advantage for him. And he's - the moment he's in the cat bird seat and it falls to President Obama to try to pull some kind of coalition together to put something together that would deter him. It hasn't happened yet.WALLACE: Well, President Obama is now threatening sanctions against the entire sectors of the Russian economy, not only if Russia invades, but also if they disrupt the May 25th - separate- May 25th elections for president in that country. Julie, at the White House, do they see Putin, you know, talking about pulling troops back, saying, let's put off today's vote? Do they see him blinking at all or do they think this was just a pretext? And is there any possibility that they'll impose sanctions before the 25th?PACE: The sector sanctions or on more individuals?WALLACE: You tell us.PACE: I think sector sanctions, you're very unlikely to see those before the May 25TH election. It's very possible that you could see more sanctions on individuals or companies if there were to be some other type of provocative action before the 25TH election. In terms of Putin's thinking, I think at the White House, they don't think that he necessarily has a firm strategy. That he is actually making decisions almost day to day, week to week as this unfolds. In Europe, you see some officials who actually feel relatively -- they are interested in what Putin said last week. They think that saying that he was pulling the troops back even though we have no evidence of that and saying that these referendum today should be delayed with positive sign, the White House doesn't necessarily view it as that. So there may be a further split between the U.S. and Europe, at least in terms of the signals they're getting from Putin. WALLACE: You know, you talk about the fact that there is maybe no strategy. But before Putin went to Crimea on Friday, there was a massive display. And take a look at this, of Russia's military might in Moscow's Red Square to celebrate the victory over Nazi Germany. It keeps getting bigger. That demonstration under Putin. George, is there a strategy here? And is it - that Putin wants to rebuild greater Russia?WILL: Sure, he has a strategy and he's adjusting his tactics as he goes along as you do in any other war. And this is a war. This week president of France and chancellor of Germany demanded that he pulled back the Russian troops. Putin amiably answered, oh, I've already done that. Now our intelligence indicates he's done no such thing. But that's an indication of the fact that he is gaining not just people and territory and trying to sow discord and chaos in a substantial portion of the Ukraine so that he can then say after two weeks from today the presidential election didn't count because there is so much disorder. But beyond that, he is learning information, what he's learning is that Europe remains a geographic expression, not a political expression. And that he really has nothing to fear from the European Union.WALLACE: So, Juan, what if anything can Putin - rather President Obama and the Europeans do and whatever they do, will it be enough to stop Putin or at least get him to change his behavior?WILLIAMS: Well, I think it comes down to a military scenario. And what we've seen in the months now that this thing has been playing out is that the needle has not moved with regard to the willingness of the Americans or the Europeans to become militarily involved in that situation. So what we're down to is sanctions. And, yes, I think you can anticipate, I think Angela Merkel of Germany, Hollande of France, (INAUDIBLE) in Germany, they said yes, they are willing now to go forward with more sanctions even if they cut into the European economy. I think that was good news. But the larger issue is about the military and about weaponry. Should the U.S., for example, according to senator McCain, Senator Graham be sending weapons in to help the Ukrainians? And the European response to that is we're trying to get weapons out of there and we don't want to get into a fight with the Russians where, you know, American or European weapons are going in. They cut off supplies and then that triggers a military confrontation. At the moment, we're really talking about if the Russians go beyond the Ukrainians and attack any of the NATO allies. That is a commitment that the Europeans and U.S. would have for military action.WALLACE: Brit, I want to talk about the sanctions issue. Because critics - and I think an increasing number of them are saying instead of using sanctions as punishment for actions that Putin already takes, should you get out ahead of them and use sanctions as a deterrent to try to stop him from taking action. We always say well, if you do this, we'll respond. How about the idea of going ahead and imposing sanctions to try to prevent him from ...HUME: The way we've been operating so far hasn't worked very well, has it? So once you accept that, then the question is well, how else to do it and the way to do it would be to do the sanctions as a deterrent. What I'm -- what I sense is that they just don't want to provoke the bear, the Russian bear and because the European dependence, economic dependence on its trade with Russia is such that the Europeans are really not willing and they couldn't sell it to their publics and all that. This is where somebody needs to step up and lead. And President Obama, I don't think has done that. But the way to go would be to -- I think Russia is responsive to sanctions.WALLACE: Julie, we've got - let me - we've got 30 seconds left. Any chance that the Obama administration may change and become more proactive?PACE: There certainly are some people in the White House who have some views on this that they think that we should do this ahead of time, punish Putin before he acts. So far the president has not taken that advice, though.WALLACE: And what do you think is the reason that he -- and what is the calculation?PACE: Well, again, he wants to move in coordination with the Europeans. So, he feels like if he moves on his own it doesn't have as much of an impact anyway.WALLACE: All right, thank you, panel. See you next week. Up next, our ""Power Player of the Week."" The Pentagon calls on a legendary college coach to talk teamwork.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: For 29 years, he's been the gold standard in women's college basketball. But the other day the coach of the University of Connecticut Huskies took his message to an unusual forum. Here is our Power Player of the Week.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)GENO AURIEMMA, UCONN WOMEN'S BASKETBALL HEAD COACH: We recruit our players out of high school. They're 18-year-olds. A lot of the young men and women who are in the military are of that age when they first start out.WALLACE: Geno Auriemma was at the Pentagon this week along with other college coaches for a strategy seminar, the idea to share techniques with military officers for how to assemble a winning team.AURIEMMA: General Dempsey loves to say that we never had a home game. And he's right. He said the military, the U.S. military's goal is to make sure we never play a home game.When I first started coaching, I thought that I could control all of the actions of all the players to get the desired result. And I realize now the only thing you can control is how well you train your players to handle that moment.One of the things I've seen recently, it was attributed to a Navy SEAL. And the comment was under pressure, you don't rise to the occasion. You sink to the level of your training.WALLACE: Auriemma says one key is instead of practicing set plays all the time, his team practices how to play.AURIEMMA: I'm going to give them just enough information and then say figure it out. Because once you learn to figure things out, then no matter what happens down the road, you'll figure it out.WALLACE (on camera): Obviously, there are differences as well as similarities, do you think these ideas can be helpful to the military?AURIEMMA: What they can learn from us is we're doing the same thing they're doing except the stakes for us is just winning and losing a game. We really appreciate that they're trying to do the same thing. But it's life and death on their end, not just winning a game.WALLACE (voice over): Auriemma is the most successful coach in the history of women's college basketball, which generates its own burdens.(on camera): Nine national titles, five perfect seasons. How do you create that kind of extraordinary winning culture?AURIEMMA: We tell kids, look, you go to another school. It's OK to lose. Here, if you go to Connecticut and you lose one game, right away there is this buzz.WALLACE: At UConn, it's almost you have to be perfect or you fail. How do you get them to deal with that kind of pressure? That's different than just being winning. That's being perfect.AURIEMMA: I came across a great quote recently and it said perfection is the enemy of reality. But along the way, hey, as long as, you know what I say, Chris? As long as they're keeping score, we may as well try to win, right?(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: UConn's men's basketball team also won the national championship this year. That's the second time the Huskies have held both titles at the same time. The only school ever to do so. And that's it for today. Have a great week. To all the moms out there, especially mine, happy Mother's Day. We'll see you next ""Fox News Sunday.""Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/09/matt-miller/analyst-says-netherlands-switzerland-achieve-unive/	"""Switzerland and the Netherlands . . .  cover all their citizens using private insurers, and they do so for much less cost."""	true	['Health Care']	http://www.washingtonpost.com/	http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/07/AR2009090702070.html?wprss=rss_opinions	2009/09/09	"By Matt MillerTuesday, September 8, 2009A dangerous sentiment on the left threatens to derail what could be the biggest progressive achievement in half a century. It's the view that any health-care reform that doesn't include a public option isn't ""real"" reform and thus isn't worth doing. This mantra has become an article of faith among many Democrats who haven't necessarily thought through the matter but who take their cues from leaders advancing this argument. Unless liberals rethink this premise, and fast, Democrats will squander their best chance in a generation to end the scandal of the uninsured, bring health security to every American family and begin the long-term process of getting national health costs under control.The first fallacy of the ""public option or nothing"" mantra is the notion that we'll never cover everyone without a Medicare-style program for Americans under 65. The experiences of Switzerland and the Netherlands prove that this isn't the case. Both have pioneered market-based universal health care. Both cover all their citizens using private insurers, and they do so for much less cost -- 10 percent of gross domestic product for the Dutch and 12 percent for Switzerland, compared with 17 percent in the United States, where nearly 50 million people are still uninsured.Those countries also boast better health outcomes than we do, even when compared to states with similar demographics, such as Connecticut and Massachusetts. Sick people in both countries are pursued as customers by private insurers (rather than shunned, as they are in the United States) because health plans are paid more for sick enrollees via a government-designed system of ""risk adjustment."" The Swiss and Dutch achievements are important because conservative critics often act as though fully socialized systems, such as those in Britain and Canada, are the inevitable result of any drive for universal coverage. In fact, as these two countries show, it is possible to cover everyone without a ""big government takeover.""A related fallacy is that the public option is the most important issue to debate. It's not. The central progressive breakthrough in any reform should be to make it possible for every American to access group health coverage outside the employment setting -- access that does not currently exist but which the proposed insurance exchanges would enable. What's critical, therefore, is the structure of these exchanges and the rules about who would be eligible to use them. Such questions have received disturbingly little attention but need to be front and center. For example, some legislation proposes barring people who enjoy employer-based coverage from seeking insurance from the new exchanges; this ban should be scrapped in favor of the proposal offered by Sen. Ron Wyden, under which employees could use the cash their companies spend on their benefits to buy coverage they prefer at the exchange.I respect those in my party who seek the single-payer system into which the public option might eventually evolve. But I don't agree that it's the best answer for the United States. Though single payer has merits, especially in administrative efficiency, it is also likely to freeze in place our fragmented, uncoordinated system of fee-for-service care. It would encourage providers to goose volume (to boost their incomes) rather than improve quality and would offer greater rewards for providers of acute care when we need a fresh focus on chronic disease management. Single payer also asks government to do things I don't think it is competent to do, such as setting prices across a large swath of the health sector in ways that seem certain to create damaging rigidities or resource misallocations (as happens in Medicare).Finally, if government is the sole payer, provider payments will become even more politicized than they are today. On the eve of beneficial innovations in drug therapies, devices and cost-effective ways to deliver better care, it is ill-advised to make the government's hand too rigid. Private health plans have many flaws, to be sure, but if sensibly regulated they're likely to respond more nimbly to disperse medical innovations.Liberals should make peace with the notion that a regulated market of competing private health plans can be the vehicle for getting everyone covered. Yes, it means that unlike some other advanced countries, we'll have billions of ""health"" dollars siphoned off by middlemen and marketers. But if liberals think of it as a jobs program, they'll learn to love it. If everyone's covered and insurer ""cherry-picking"" is dead, health insurance will come to look more like a regulated utility.Those on the left still seeking incentive should consider: In 2006, Sen. Ted Kennedy urged Massachusetts Democrats to support Mitt Romney's plan for universal coverage via a competing system of regulated private insurers, paired with an individual mandate and subsidies for low earners. Kennedy knew this would become a model for a bipartisan fix for the country. Now, a Kennedy-approved model is within reach. Liberals, far from resisting it as a setback, should celebrate it as a triumph.Matt Miller, a former Clinton White House aide, is a management consultant and the author of ""The Tyranny of Dead Ideas."" In recent years he has advised and given paid speeches to doctor groups, hospitals, pharmaceutical firms and insurance companies, as well as to low-income advocacy groups promoting universal coverage.© 2009 The Washington Post Company"

Specifically, these problems include long wait times and customers being turned away due to computer problems.The public hearing proved itself to be nothing more than naked political theater by the Democratic members of the committee and a brazen election year stunt. The problems with MVC service are almost entirely caused by an outdated computer system that is 30 years old. The technology was placed in service back when drivers licenses were little more than laminated pieces of paper, not the secure documents that we rely on today to prevent identity theft, crime and terrorism.Since the beginning of the Christie administration, the MVC has made great strides in serving its customers. It has placed a greater emphasis on moving critical technology projects forward to better position the commission for the future. We have finally restarted much-needed upgrades that were put on hold during the Codey and Corzine administrations.Year after year, during budget hearings, those of us who serve on the budget committees were told about major MVC technology investments, such as the Motor Vehicle Automated Transaction System (MATRX) and the Enhanced Digital Driver License (EDDL), which were planned to improve customer service and make the MVC computers more reliable. The proposed introduction of an extended six-year license, along with plans to implement online license renewals, were meant to be positive changes for New Jersey drivers. Those changes would make renewing easier and would reduce customer volume spikes and long lines at MVC offices. In reality, projections about the effects of a six-year license were off, implementation of the new digital driver license was greatly delayed and customer volume spikes and long lines exist to this day.Had the EDDL project moved forward within the planned time frame under previous administrations, a contract would have been awarded in August 2008. Under this timeline, online renewals would have been in place by late 2009, and the delays caused by the outdated, unreliable technology would not continue to occur.While previous governors never made improving customer service at the MVC a priority, the Christie administration has been proactive in addressing short-term MVC needs while it works to complete its long-term technological improvements. MVC office hours have been increased 20 percent to 54.5 hours per week more hours than ever before and include the restoration of service on Mondays. Additional staff is being added at high-volume MVC offices to speed up transactions, and additional cameras that are needed to issue drivers licenses are being installed, as well. And to ensure that customers are not left waiting in line exposed to the elements, MVC office space is being rearranged to shelter more customers comfortably indoors while they are waiting to be served.These changes will yield near immediate results in improving the customer experience at MVC offices and are the best short-term options available to remedy a bad situation left by previous governors and Motor Vehicle commissioners. But they are just that: short-term solutions. The key to modernizing the MVC and solving its problems in the long term lies in updated technology. Gov. Christie is fixing the problems left by other governors who failed to bring the MVCs computer technology up to modern standards. The dramatic change at the MVC is not just about this administrations push to introduce new technology, but also a number of other positive steps designed to better serve its customers. From instituting the greatest number of agency service hours in motor vehicle history and the opening of state-of-the-art facilities on state-owned land to installing more camera equipment and increasing staffing levels at our states busiest agencies, under Gov. Christies leadership, the MVC is doing whats necessary to fulfill the needs of New Jersey drivers.After all of the upgrades are completed and more services are online, the wait times at the MVC will drop significantly. In fact, most drivers will have to visit the MVC only once every eight years a welcome change from the current situation.I would have hoped that my colleagues in the Legislature who noted concerns about the MVC would have shown greater interest over the last several years when essential technology projects were languishing under previous administrations. Updating the technological capabilities of the MVC is of critical importance and should not be used for political gain. As we near the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, we should not forget that some of the hijackers used New Jersey drivers licenses to board those aircraft.Efforts like these to make the state drivers license more secure and the MVC more efficient will go a long way toward making drivers happier and New Jersey safer.Kevin OToole, a Republican, represents the 40th District in the New Jersey Senate, where he is a member of its budget and appropriations committee.Follow the Times of Trenton on Twitter.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.KIRAN CHETRY, CNN ANCHOR: Super Tuesday, more than 20 states, 40 contests. Candidates give their final pitches right here.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I am so committed on to making sure nobody goes without health care.MITT ROMNEY, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We want to make sure this party does not leave the house that Ronald Reagan built.(END VIDEO CLIP)CHETRY: The issues hit home, health care, the housing crisis. We're talking to voters in the north, south, east and in Super Tuesday's biggest prize, California, on this AMERICAN MORNING.And welcome. It's a special split edition of AMERICAN MORNING on this Super Tuesday. I'm Kiran Chetry. I'm here at one of the local schools up in Harlem, New York, where we've seen good amount of voters trickling in. Polls have been opened here for about two hours, John. And it looks like the action is heating up a little bit behind me as well, as people are coming in before they head to work to cast their votes today.JOHN ROBERTS, CNN ANCHOR: Good for them. I'm John Roberts. We're at the Atlanta diner here in Atlanta, Georgia. Nobody voting here, but they are fueling up in preparation to get out there and vote. It's as close as we'll come to a national primary. Well, at least this year. 24 states up for grabs today. 1,020 delegates up for grabs for the Republicans. 1,681 available for the Democrats. Most polls are open right now. We're going to be checking in with voters and our reporters across the country this morning. And we have got them from stem to stern here.Got our team on the issues talking to voters from coast to coast. Candy Crowley is live in Harlem this morning. Ed Lavandera in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Chris Lawrence in San Francisco and Mary Snow is in Charleston, West Virginia.No primary are caucus there in West Virginia, rather. A state Republican convention that gets under way in about an hour at 9:00 Eastern. 18 delegates at stake there today. And Mary joins us now live from Charleston.Mary, we were speaking with Mitt Romney this morning who flew overnight from California. There really seems to be a battle in the Republican Party on this Super Tuesday as to who is the real conservative.MARY SNOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that really is what it comes down to, John, for Mitt Romney. He has been hammering away at that theme -- that trying to portray himself as the real conservative. Trying to poke holes in Senator John McCain's conservative credentials. Mitt Romney will try to make that case here in West Virginia.As you mentioned, the convention getting under way just about an hour from now. This will likely be where we'll hear the first results across the country. Ron Paul is also going to be here. Mike Huckabee. Senator John McCain will not be here, but he will have a surrogate here for him. He is heading out to California before heading home to Arizona. Yesterday he concentrated on the northeast.One of his big themes has been national security. Also cutting government spending. But in terms of the Republican Party, he's trying to make the case, that he can be the uniter. Mitt Romney took his message to California trying to tout his conservative credentials.ROBERTS: Hey, we should point out, Mary, that we're looking at that polling place in Chappaqua right now. And there Hillary Clinton and her husband coming in to cast their votes. No question who she'll be voting for this morning. But let's go back to the Republican contest.Where do these candidates need to do well? Obviously, John McCain wants to win the whole thing and become the de facto nominee tonight. But where do the other candidates, Mitt Romney, Ron Paul and Mike Huckabee have to do well to stay in this race?SNOW: Well, you know, for Mitt Romney, one of the states where he really has to do well is Massachusetts. John McCain was campaigning there. Mitt Romney had been governor. He says he plans on winning there. But that would be a blow to him if he did not win in Massachusetts. And obviously, he's counting a lot in California.Mike Huckabee wants to gain support here in the south. He's been concentrating on that. And Ron Paul has been focusing on states like West Virginia, also Alaska. He's hoping to pick up delegates.ROBERTS: All right. Mary Snow for us this morning. Let's take it back to Kiran, who is there at Harlem.Kiran, you spoke with Senator Clinton a couple of hours ago. She's there casting her ballot in Chappaqua this morning. It took just a couple of seconds as well.CHETRY: Yes, that's right. She actually went on early, joining us in the 6:00 hour because it's the 7:00 hour here in New York. She wanted to be at the polling site. Senator Clinton casting her vote just a few minutes ago. And earlier on AMERICAN MORNING, she talked about issues like health care and the economy and a last-minute appeal to voters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: Really are not taking care of people. I want to put the American people first again. And you know, I think there is a lot of reason for people to worry that the president just doesn't pay attention. And I want them to know that I get it and I'll be there for them, if they are willing to go out and vote for me today. And I hope everybody watching will do that.(END VIDEO CLIP)CHETRY: Also a big question today, what do people in the south want in their president. Can Mike Huckabee win beyond Arkansas and can Barack Obama win beyond South Carolina? Tennessee, one of the states we're watching in the south. The polls just opened there moments ago.There are 52 Republican delegates at stake there. 68 for the Democrats and our Ed Lavandera is in Chattanooga. He's been talking with voters this morning. You know, you can't really lump everybody in the same group and say what are southerners thinking this morning. But what is the sense here getting from this that you talk to, Ed?ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, in speaking with several political analysts who look at these voters in the south, they really see, kind of a divide, between what they call the upper south and the lower south. So you have Arkansas and Tennessee perhaps going one way, maybe voting more alike and then, you have, Georgia and Alabama perhaps being a little bit more similar. But across the south, a big turnout is expected.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)LAVANDERA: Presidential candidates pour on the southern charm like thick gravy on biscuits.MIKE HUCKABEE, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's not often that a razorback comes to Tuscaloosa and has a good time.JOHN MCCAIN, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: One of my sons attended Vanderbilt University. And he married a beautiful, beautiful young lady from Cookeville. And I am so -- and I am so proud of that as well. So, as you can see, I'm puling out all the stops here everybody.LAVANDERA: But in the south, candidates know it takes a spiritual connection, too.BARACK OBAMA, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I know most folks were already in church today. So I don't want to give a whole another sermon. And I won't pass the collection plate.HILLARY CLINTON, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Every day, I strive to act on the lessons of my faith, to reach that higher place.LAVANDERA: Across the Super Tuesday southern states of Georgia, Tennessee, Arkansas and Alabama, both Obama and Clinton Democrats are embracing the most popular theme on the campaign trail.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I feel like there's a lot of change that needs to happen as, you know, for the whole country. Not just for the south.LAVANDERA: And some Republican leaning voters remain undecided.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: John McCain, I kind of leaning toward him in his military service and I like some of the policies that he's put forth. But Huckabee, right now, I'm leaning kind of heavy toward him.LAVANDERA: Emory University professor Merrill Black studies the mind-set of southern voters and on Super Tuesday, he sees division on the Democratic side.MERLE BLACK, EMORY UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR: I think we're going to see a split here. The Deep South is probably going to go for Obama. The Upper South will probably go for Hillary Clinton.LAVANDERA: And on the Republican side, he says McCain is in the driver's seat.BLACK: McCain probably will lead the field, but I think Huckabee could be competitive here. The big question mark is how well Mitt Romney would run in Georgia and Alabama and Tennessee.(END VIDEOTAPE)LAVANDERA: And Kiran, you know, there's one voter in all of the south that many people would like to know, how this particular person is voting, al least, on the Democratic side and that is Former Vice President Al Gore who is from Tennessee, of course.We reached out to his people yesterday and they said that -- we were told that he has already voted. He voted early. But we gave the old college try to find out who he voted for and we were told as a private citizen, he's not sharing that information.Kiran?CHETRY: I am sure that everybody can make a few guesses, but he's keeping mum. All right, Ed Lavandera for us in Chattanooga this morning. Thanks.ROBERTS: Coming up on eight minutes after the hour now. Will weather affect voter turnout on this Super Tuesday? Our Rob Marciano is checking it out for us this morning.Rob, anybody going to have a difficult time getting out to the polls today?(WEATHER REPORT)ROBERTS: We're at the beginning of CNN's nonstop Super Tuesday coverage. 40 hours, all day and all night. And join us for a special early edition of AMERICAN MORNING, 5:00 a.m. Eastern. And join CNN's Campbell Brown for her ""AMERICA VOTES SPECIAL"" talking to candidates and the issues. That's at noon Eastern on CNN and cnn.com.Kiran?CHETRY: Well, we've heard from three possible presidents this morning about the issues. What can they do for you? And we're breaking down, what they told us when it comes to key issues like health care and the economy.Also, Super Tuesday meets the mortgage meltdown. The states voting today where the housing crisis has hit hardest. And how the candidates are promising to fix it? We're going to compare some of their plans. That's coming up ahead on AMERICAN MORNING.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CHETRY: Welcome back. We've been hearing from the candidates this morning. Let's take a moment to go through what we heard. Senior political correspondent Candy Crowley joins me in Harlem this morning. Breaking down what Democrats talked about. One of the key issues, this morning that we heard from Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on health care. And let's just hear quickly what Barack Obama said just moments ago to John Roberts.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: What we do is set up a plan that allows anybody to get health care that is as good as health care to the members of Congress. We will subsidize it for those who can't afford it. People won't be able to be excluded from pre-existing conditions. So that, anybody who is self-employed, anybody who doesn't health insurance or is underinsured can join this plan. Now, we also work to lower costs for those who already have health insurance.(END VIDEO CLIP)CHETRY: It seems like, well, they are quite similar, Barack Obama is not going as far as saying that people would be mandated to get it if they can afford it. Hillary Clinton is, although, it's still unclear exactly how that would be enforced. But who is winning on this issue? And is this an issue that would sway voters?CANDY CROWLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, they think -- meaning in the camp Hillary, they believe this really is a winning issue. Because she goes out and says -- you know, this is a basic, fundamental Democratic issue. We've got to start with universal health care. He sort of pushes back, as you hear, and says -- listen, I have universal health care. That's where they are going.I think Democratic voters look at this and say, they are both headed in the same direction. While there are issues in this campaign that divide them, there are about 95 percent in agreement about these issues. And they are 100 percent in agreement as to the direction they want to go.So in the end, I think Democratic voters come to the polls and sort of say, you know, we have this one candidate who is campaigning on experience. We have another who promises to turn the page. Which direction do we want to go?CHETRY: You also -- when we were talking briefly before the break, said that, you know, for the Democrats, it's also the issue of who can win it for us this year. And how do the candidates prove that at this point?CROWLEY: Absolutely. I mean, it's all about electability at this point. And because in the end, what Democrats want is to win the oval office. So they are looking at who is the toughest and that's why you see Barack Obama now talking about John McCain, about electability. You hear him saying, you know, we don't want someone who is divisive, read that Hillary Clinton. She talks about how battle warned she is. How she knows who to go after these Republicans because they've come after her.So they're both, in their own way, saying I'm the more electable. And that in the end is really what Democratic voters want to know.CHETRY: She says, according to her, dug up all the dirt they could possibly dig up. So now they're going to go after the fresh meat.The other interesting element about this is just the way that the Democratic primary caucuses and primaries play out. It's a different situation in terms of gathering delegates. So what does that mean and who gets the advantage, if that's the case?CROWLEY: You know, first of all, it's so arcane. As you know, it's almost impossible to explain. But basically, what candidates can win a state and still lose the delegates because it's proportionately by district. So what we have to look at tonight is, first of all, who wins the states because in some ways, that's the headline.You know, in these 20-something states, so and so wins 11 or 12. But the bottom line is that they need 2,050 votes to win this nomination. So they are all counting delegates. And I have to tell you, they are counting delegates district by district. It's why you see Barack Obama in New York. Probably Hillary Clinton will win New York, but if he can sink off enough delegates, then -- you know, he's got something there. Same with Illinois. They, in fact, think that New York will cancel out Illinois. His obviously, his home state.CHETRY: It is interesting that all the four possible presidential hopefuls, all of them are Super Tuesday states. They are from Super Tuesday states.CROWLEY: Right. And so you start out thinking, OK, at least here I can do well.CHETRY: Right. There's a victory somewhere.CROWLEY: Exactly.CHETRY: Candy, great to see you as always. Thanks.John? ROBERTS: Coming up, Kiran, to 17 minutes after the hour. Of course, for the last three weeks, we've been crisscrossing the nation, stopping in at diners in small towns and big cities talking to undecided voters. We've got an undecided voter this morning at the Atlanta Diner.This is Trina Hackett. I was saying very famous name in New Zealand. They are the people who invented bungee jumping. And you are about to take a leap today. Cast your vote for -- I assume...TRINA HACKETT, UNDECIDED DEMOCRAT: Hillary.ROBERTS: Hillary and why is that? You were undecided just a little while ago. What made up your mind here?HACKETT: I was not truly made my mind. But it's like I'm saying -- more of saying she is very focused and very outstanding with everything that's going on. And more or less, she stands out more because of -- she looks out for the little people. You know -- and she's more focused on the little people. And, you know, and making sure that, you know, that -- life is going to be more easy for them.ROBERTS: So what's the number one issue for you in this one?HACKETT: The number one issue for me is, more or less, health care. You know, for everyone, that's not being able to afford and everything.ROBERTS: Have you really looked into the differences between the two plans? As we've been saying this morning, there's not that great of difference.HACKETT: There's not that great of difference but -- you know, we've seen who is going to stand out. You know, who is going to make it stick. You know, what I mean? Who is going to just really, really just make it known to bring to existence, other than talk about it, but make it realistic.ROBERTS: And do you think -- is that based on experience that she has?HACKETT: More to say, yes. Yes. I have seen she's more -- you know, sticking around the people to understand and get to know them more better. Stand beside them.ROBERTS: You know, when we were in California all the way across the country, last week, one of the big issues for people was electability. Who can actually win the White House? Who do you think has the edge on that front?HACKETT: I would say, Hillary. She's pretty much got it like, you know, hand packed because the more or less, I more saw her face more than I did Obama because -- I mean, I didn't know of him until he just came to run for president. You know, other than that, I was like, I didn't know him at all. ROBERTS: Obviously, she's been around for awhile. Interesting too, though, we should note that the latest polls have got Obama leading by a substantial margin here in Georgia. So if you want Hillary to win, I guess you better get out there and cast your vote.Trina Hackett, thanks very much for being with us. It's great to see you. Appreciate it. Get out there and vote today.HACKETT: Yes, sir.ROBERTS: So California, across the country again. The big prize in this Super Tuesday on the west coast. What are voters there thinking? We take a cross-country trip coming up to show you.And the mortgage crisis. We've heard some of the candidates talking about it. What are their plans to fix the situation?Gerri Willis will be here to tell us all about that, coming up on AMERICAN MORNING.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)ROBERTS: Many of the states voting today are states that had been hit hard in the foreclosure crisis. We have been looking at the candidates' plans to fix it. And CNN's Gerri Willis in a hard-hit neighborhood of Atlanta this morning.Gerri, what are you finding there?GERRI WILLIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, hey there, John. Yes, I'm in an Atlanta neighborhood where the foreclosures are highest. This zip code has the highest number of foreclosures in this city. Check out this house right behind me. It's bank-owned as you can see. Now, John, this is a largely working class community, if you can take a look at down the street here. Of the 85 homes on this street alone, some 24 are in foreclosure or have been in foreclosure.Now, the neighborhood leaders are trying to take back the community. They say much of the problem here has been the result of mortgage fraud. And John, as you've been saying all morning, of course, what's going on here is going on across the country in Super Tuesday states all over the country. No place has been hit harder than California where 1 in 52 homes is in foreclosure. Big number there. And they've lost as much as $61 billion in values in homes but also tax revenues. Lost tax revenues.As you know, the industry provides incredible tax revenues for local governments. Other states affected here as well. You can see Colorado. We've mentioned Georgia, Arizona and Illinois.John?ROBERTS: All right. So we know how the scope of the problem here, Gerri, because you've been doing some great reporting on it. But what are the candidates planning to try to do to fix it? WILLIS: Well, the person who's probably been most outspoken on the mortgage meltdown is probably Hillary Clinton. She came out with legislation last year to try to clean up the problem. She wanted the big bailout, actually, to solve the issue. Here's what she said recently about what should be done.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CLINTON: I want a moratorium on foreclosures for 90 days so we can try to work out keeping people in their homes instead of having them lose their homes. And I want to freeze interest rates for five years.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIS: Freeze interest rates so the people could actually work their way out of these adjustable rate mortgages which have been so difficult for folks.Also, Obama, has also been outspoken on this topic, also introduced legislation. He wants a $10 billion bailout for the issue and he also wants to make sure that people get mortgage tax credits whether they itemize or not.Now the Republicans have been very insistent on no government. They bailout of the folks in this crisis. They think private sector solutions are the best. One little bit difference there, one change, John McCain has opened the window to some possible Federal government involvement, if the issue isn't solved by the president's current plans that are working their way through communities all across the country.John?ROBERTS: All right, Gerri Willis for us this morning. Gerri, thanks very much. Now back to Harlem and here's Kiran.CHETRY: You know, there were nearly 16 million registered voters in California. What's most important to them as they choose a candidate this morning? We're on the road, taking a road trip to find out.Also, Kevin Everett, the Buffalo Bills player defied the odds in his recovery from what was describes as a catastrophic collision on the field. Dr. Sanjay Gupta is taking a closer look at the medical milestones that Kevin's made.Hey, Sanjay.DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning, Kiran. A spinal cord injury is what he had. A lot of people have heard of that. But why do some people get to walk away when so many others don't. I'll break it down for you and tell you what help Kevin. AMERICAN MORNING is coming right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROBERTS: We're back from the Atlanta Diner this morning in Atlanta, Georgia. A big Super Tuesday state. This is the big prize in the south. 87 Democratic delegates available. 72 on the Republican side. And people came in this morning for some eggs and grits and headed out to cast their vote. Welcome back to AMERICAN MORNING. February 5th, Super Tuesday. I'm John Roberts in Atlanta.Good morning, Kiran.CHETRY: Hey, good to see you, John. We're here at the Adam Clayton Powell School in Harlem, New York. Of course, New York another huge state on this Super Tuesday. Hundreds of delegates up for grabs, especially on the Democratic side. We've seen people trickling in and out of here 2 1/2 hours ago, is when the polls opened. It's going to be a busy day not only here but at polling sites across the nation because it is Super Tuesday.And it's as close as we'll come to a national primary. There are 24 states up for grabs today. 1,020 delegates for the Republicans and 1,681 delegates available for the Democrats. There's a look at the big picture map. People are already starting to line up across the northeast. Let's take a look at some of the places. How about West Hartford, Connecticut, Fort Lee, New Jersey, and also across the river from here in queens. We'll be checking back with voters as well as our reporters who have you covered from coast to coast this morning.Getting back to New Jersey now. Polls have been open there for about 2 1/2 hours as well. There are 52 delegates at stake for republicans in New Jersey. 127 for democrats and the race is special. Independent voters are allowed to cast ballots. For example, here in New York, they cannot. The closed primaries in New York state. The candidates are aiming for some of those independents. Jason Carroll is at a polling station in Ft. Lee, New Jersey, to break it down for us this morning. Hi, Jason.JASON CARROLL, CNN, CORRESPONDENT: And hello to you, Kiran. You know, if you are an independent and you show up here at a fire station like this, which is a polling place, that's why you hear the alarms going off. It is a working fire station, Kiran. But it is a polling place. But if you are an independent that shows up here, you have to declare either democrat or republican before you can cast your vote. The democratic race here much too close to call. Senator Barack Obama campaigned in east Rutherford yesterday where he was joined by Senator Edward Kennedy. It's the second major rally that he has attended in northern New Jersey within the past month.Senator Clinton supporters say that she has a slight lead here in the state. Even so, she dispatched Chelsea Clinton out to do some campaigning for her on the republican side. Senator John McCain has a double-digit lead over Romney in the state but McCain still stopping through Trenton yesterday to do some last-minute campaigning. Romney sending out his son to do campaigning in the state as well. As you know, Kiran, New Jersey actually moved its primary up so they could have more impact on the presidential nominee. We spoke to some voters this morning about how that's impacting them.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's kind of sad when years past when you feel like your vote doesn't count.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, it's a different year than usual. There are a lot of choices. And it seems that it would really make a difference.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's a lot of issues domestically we have to take care of. So with that, I think it makes it more important than ever.(END VIDEO CLIP)CARROLL: And Kiran, we took our own informal poll about the top issues facing some of the voters here in New Jersey. The top two issues they said - number one, the economy; number two, the need for change. Kiran.CHETRY: Jason Carroll in Ft. Lee, New Jersey, this morning. Thank you.Hillary Clinton, by the way, already cast her vote this morning. Hillary and Bill Clinton voted just minutes ago in Westchester county, the hometown of Chappaqua, about 30 miles north of us here in Harlem. Earlier on AMERICAN MORNING, I talked to her about some of the problems with the economy and asked what she would do to fix them.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHETRY: Another huge issue for people and that's the economy, recession. Some people argue we're already in one. Others say we need to pass some sort of stimulus plan and quickly to avoid one if that's the case. Right now, the House has a version. You're going to be heading back to Washington to vote on a Senate version. And meanwhile, there is talk that perhaps the longer this takes, the less effective it is. What would you do right now to try to stem the economic troubles we seem to be getting into?CLINTON: Well, I would have a very aggressive policy toward trying to stop home foreclosures. Again, I'm the only candidate left in this race on either side who has been talking about the mortgage crisis for nearly a year. We need to put a moratorium on foreclosures to help people stay in their homes and we need to freeze these interest rates that continue to escalate, driving more and more people into foreclosure. A lot of people were misled. They were the victim of predatory lending practices, and we need to stabilize the housing market.(END VIDEO CLIP)CHETRY: Senator Clinton also said she thinks the country is on the brink of a recession. And the Senate must get a stimulus plan through as a first step. John.ROBERTS: Coming up on 34 minutes after the hour, Kiran, Senator Barack Obama is heading back to his hometown of Chicago for a rally tonight. We had a chance to speak with him in the last hour of AMERICAN MORNING, talk about issues like Iraq and the difference between his health care plan and Senator Clinton's.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROBERTS: She suggests you are falling short here by mandating coverage for children but not mandating it for their parents. What do you say?SEN. BARACK OBAMA (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Let's break down what she really means by a mandate. What's meant by a mandate is that the government is forcing people to buy health insurance and so she's suggesting a parent is not going to buy health insurance for themselves if they can afford it. Now, my belief is that most parents will choose to get health care for themselves and we make it affordable.ROBERTS: In an Obama White House, what would that strategic relationship with Iraq look like?OBAMA: I think, first of all, it will not have us setting up permanent bases and a permanent occupation in Iraq for decades which is what George Bush's suggested but also John McCain. I think it is important for us to say to the Iraqis that we are willing to help them. We want to be partners with them, but we are not going to be there in perpetuity. And I have been very clear. I will end this war. We will get combat troops out. I hope to do it by the end of 2009.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROBERTS: Senator Obama also refused to say whether he'd join a combined ticket with Hillary Clinton. He said his focus now is winning the nomination and then trying to unite the country.Well, California is a big piece of the puzzle today. Polls opened at 7:00 Pacific, 10 a.m. Eastern and the republicans going after 170 delegates for the democrats' 370 are at stake. And there is no winner take all. Delegates will be awarded by congressional district making it a lot more -- making it more like a lot of mini elections instead of just one big one. So what issues are driving the voters? Our Chris Lawrence hit the road to find out. He is live for us this morning in San Francisco. Chris, good morning.CHRIS LAWRENCE, CNN, CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, John. You know, 1 out of every 8 Americans lives in California. That gives you an idea of the sheer size of this primary. And the voters here are making their decisions based on immigration, health care and most of all, the economy.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)LAWRENCE (voice-over): 80 miles east of L.A., Betty Larkins is packing up. After the bank foreclosed on her home.BETTY LARKINS: People are saying something about a recession might come. To me, we're in one.LAWRENCE: Betty beat cancer, but she's losing her home because she went broke paying hospital bills.LARKINS: See, I didn't even know what it cost for a mammogram until I didn't have insurance.LAWRENCE: Based on her health care plans, she's narrowed it down to Obama and Clinton.LARKINGS: But I have to pray about it a lot before I make my decision.LAWRENCE: Betty is just one member of the country's most diverse electorate. And California is super Tuesday's biggest prize. There are more people living in Los Angeles county than the entire state of Michigan. We wanted to hear from even more of California's nearly 16 million registered voters, and they are spread out all over the state.Driving hundreds of miles to the more agricultural area around Fresno, we found problems for one front-runner.JOE MENDOZA, UNDECIDED VOTER: McCain is wishy washy.LAWRENCE: Joe Mendoza hasn't decided which other republican he'll vote for.MENDOZA: Immigration is a big factor with me right now. To see what they are going to do. This country can't keep sending all our jobs off.LAWRENCE: The next day, we're back on the road to the Bay Area where all that Clinton-Obama advertising has some new company.For the first time, the GOP is awarding delegates to the winner in each congressional district. So republican candidates are campaigning in heavily democratic areas like San Francisco because even a small number there could deliver a win.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You feel like you are more part of the process.LAWRENCE: This registered republican is voting for Mitt Romney.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think Iraq is going to take care of itself with the surge. It's working. But I care about people who are going to actually create jobs. Keep taxes down so that companies can grow.(END VIDEOTAPE)LAWRENCE: Yes, one thing about California, a lot of the voters, in fact perhaps half of the voters will vote by absentee ballots. A lot of us who live here, our friends and our family, have already voted. With that in mind, two things to keep in mind today. Barack Obama's late surge and Mitt Romney's conservative challenge to John McCain. How much effect will they really have on the vote totals? John.ROBERTS: It's really becoming an incredibly tight race there. Chris Lawrence for us this morning in San Francisco. Chris, thanks. Kiran.CHETRY: A lot of people may still have, John, last-minute questions about the candidates. Not sure where to go to vote today or exactly who they're going to vote for. We have the most up-to-the- minute information for you. Super Tuesday information just ahead.And also, we see the amazing story of Kevin Everett of the Buffalo Bills. The progress he has made after a spinal cord injury that first was described as catastrophic. How did he and his doctors do it? We're paging our own Dr. Sanjay Gupta ahead on AMERICAN MORNING.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CHETRY: Oh, hey, we're back. We're back here at the Adam Clayton Powell Elementary, one of the voting sites here in New York today. There's a pretty healthy turnout so far. Polls open here about 6:00 Eastern time. It opened for a little more than 2 1/2 hours right now. Steady stream of people. We wanted to talk to some of the voters and see why they chose the way they did this morning. And joining us is Khalid Kamau. He recently transplanted from Atlanta. You said you were tired of living in a red state. You wanted to move to New York. You work for a non-profit organization right here in Harlem. Tell us a little bit about what went into picking a candidate today.KHALID KAMAU, DEMOCRATIC VOTER: Well, my roommates and I, we all watched all the debates. We're like tivoing and going back and forth. But just listening to the positions was really - I really felt I can say who I voted for - Hillary - I just felt on the issue that was most important to me, which was health care and several other issues. She really articulated a very detailed position. And, you know, I was really torn, especially after the whole like South Carolina debacle with like Barack and Bill, but --CHETRY: Did that turn you off a little what went on in South Carolina, the issues of race?KAMAU: Yes, it definitely did. I mean, just I think that everyone, you know, would love to see a president or an executive that looks like them. You know, in representative government that's true representation. But I really just felt that she just had a little bit better articulation of some of the issues that were really important, you know.CHETRY: When you talk about that, this is an issue that Barack Obama himself has talked about and said, I don't really want this to be an issue of race. I don't want people to vote for me just because I could be the first black president. Were those issues of race something that you -- that you took into consideration?KAMAU: Oh, yes, of course. You can't - I think as much as and you hear a lot of pundits, even reporters saying - you know, talk about how Barack transcends race. I just, we're not there as a country yet where we can just transcend. We can't vote for Barack and the past 400 years of history would like all be fixed. And it's the same thing with, I think, sexism and Hillary Clinton. So it really -- that's always just going to play a huge part.CHETRY: But for you, it came down to the individual person and what they were proposing to make your life better?KAMAU: It is really is. It really came down to health care. And I just think that we have to - I think Hillary is right when she says that we have to try to cover everyone. You know we have to at least start there.CHETRY: It's interesting because your mother actually voted for Barack Obama. So you guys had healthy debates over the dinner table?KAMAU: She did. We were actually a Hillary family. My mother and father. We were all very pro-Hillary. I think everything kind of turned in South Carolina. And I didn't know actually until this morning when I called her that she changed her vote. But I think that it's just - I don't know. It's just really a profound thing. I think a lot of people are even split with the delegates. I think that every year, every election cycle, it seems like they are finding out some new critical piece of this elaborate election mechanism.CHETRY: That's right. But every vote counts. And you certainly cast yours for Hillary. Khalid Kamau, thanks so much for joining us. And you know, it's very interesting, John, just how informed people are for this primary and for this upcoming general election. As you heard from Khalid, he watched every debate, tivoed it if he didn't see it. And that is what we're hearing from a lot of voters. They want, they're hungry for the type of information and they know that they're taking part in an historical decision. John.ROBERTS: Yes. All you have to do is look at the ratings for our debates to know that people have really been dialed in. We talked to so many people across the country and they are so excited on the republican side and the democratic side about participating in this election.We've been talking about the incredible recovery of Kevin Everett from the Buffalo Bills. Just five months after suffering a spinal cord injury during the Bills' home opener. Kevin Everett is walking again now. He told Kiran it's a recovery that no one would have predicted.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KEVIN EVERETT, BUFFALO BILLS: That's my collar.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROBERTS: Unfortunately, we had a little problem with that. But he said people didn't give him much of a chance to recover and he came back. How did Everett and his doctors do it? We're paging Dr. Sanjay Gupta for that. Sanjay joins us now. How did they do it?DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN, CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, it's not sure exactly what happened here. There's obviously a lot of people have spinal cord injuries who never recover the way he did. But I tell you, he's a pretty happy guy there. Dominik Hickson, by the way, who tackled him is very happy guy as well because Kevin is walking. We know several things about his recovery. One is that he got a very early surgery. His operation was quickly. That's important. He also got this therapy, known as hypothermic therapy, actually cooling his spinal cord, cooling his body. Although it's unclear exactly when that was instituted. But take a look at the timeline here. Now, the operation and the injury at the end of September. He had the operation within ten days, he was in a rehabilitation facility. Within week two, he was able to take some steps with a walker. Within week three, standing on his own. By October 30th, he was getting out of bed and eventually on November 18th, he was discharged. So pretty speedy recovery, John. But again, out of which of those things actually made the difference? It's really unclear.ROBERTS: Why did he recover when so many others don't?GUPTA: Well, you know, you talk about this hypothermic therapy, which is essentially cooling the spinal cord. A lot of people say that's just anecdotal. There's no sort of scientific evidence that works. In his case in particular, what we know is that he got the hypothermic therapy started after the surgery, according to the neurosurgeon who took care of him. So, it's hard to say if that made a difference. He also had a central cord injury, John. It's a type of spinal cord injury from which a lot of people do recover. In fact, in his age group, over 90% of people do recover to some extent.ROBERTS: How has that different from the debilitating type of injury like Christopher Reeve's?GUPTA: Right, you're talking about complete spinal cord injury where the entire spinal cord is crushed to some extent. In Kevin Everett's case, according to his rehab doctors, he suffered more of a central spinal cord injury where it's more of a bruising. Think of it as a bruising to the spinal cord where the central most fibers of the spinal cord are the most damaged. The crucial thing there is, John, if you follow those patients over time, a lot of them do recover as long as they have the surgery and the time.ROBERTS: And you should know all about this, Mr. Neurosurgeon.GUPTA: Obviously, happy for him. He'll walk again. Hard to say if he'll play football again but he's going to walk again.ROBERTS: He said he's going to get into some businesses and see how it goes after that. Sanjay, thanks very much.GUPTA: Thanks.ROBERTS: CNN NEWSROOM just minutes away now. Heidi Collins down the street at the CNN Center with a look at what's ahead.

John.ROBERTS: So will weather affect voter turnout on this super Tuesday? There's some bad weather moving into parts of the country. Our Rob Marciano checking it out for us this morning from the CNN weather center just down the street. Good morning, Rob.ROB MARCIANO, CNN, METEOROLOGIST: Good morning, John. Yes, we got a big storm that's running across the country. It's going to bring the gamut as far as weather is concerned through a number of states holding their primaries and caucuses. Kansas, Oklahoma, you'll be under the gun for snow. And after some morning rain and thunderstorms and severe thunderstorms expected across Arkansas and through the mid-Mississippi River Valley, western parts of Tennessee, we could very well see damaging winds and violent tornadoes, especially in Arkansas. Where the storm's prediction center has just upgraded their outlook for today to a high-risk area. That is very rare for this time of year, especially this far north.The main reason, among other things. We got strong winds at the midlevels. We got a lot of heat, 67 Little Rock. 69 degrees in Dallas. And a lot of cold behind that. 32 degrees in Amarillo and 17 degrees right now in Denver, Colorado. So cold mixing with the warm and you got the fireworks, that's for sure.We have severe thunderstorm watch out for north Texas. Likely a tornado watch issued in about an hour for Arkansas and behind the system we have snow. Eastern Colorado through Kansas back through Illinois. Winter storm warnings are posted for several inches of snow possible and then storms extend towards the east coast. Looks like it will be wet for much of New York state. A lot of action. A lot of bad weather to folks heading to the polls. Don't let it discourage you. It will be gorgeous here in parts of the southeast. But if you have some weather to deal with, tell the folks to get out there and get it done.ROBERTS: Boy, bundle up in Colorado today.

That's why Blue America started a new Wisconsin Recall page and it's why we've invited state Senator Chris Larson and state Senate candidate Sandy Pasch here for a Blue America live chat today (2pm, CT, noon, PT).As you no doubt recall, earlier this year the newly elected extreme Republican governor of the state, Scott Walker, pushed through a radical attack on basic labor rights. His plan to strip workers of the right to bargain collectively for protections against unfair treatment and unsafe worker conditions was one of the greatest assaults on working families in the last half century. And now he's pushing a radical, destructive agenda that guts priorities like education, health care and help for seniors while giving hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to huge corporations. He couldn't have done it with an equally extremist state legislature, which has rubber stamped every single point on his destructive agenda.The recall elections next month matter far beyond the borders of Wisconsin. The Walker agenda is being duplicated in state after state by the extreme Republicans who swept into power in last November’s elections. This fight for rights and the basic values we all hold dear will reverberate across the nation, impacting elections in every region of the country. With the help of Blue America's most trusted friend in Wisconsin , Sen. Chris Larson, we looked at all progressives running to replace the six Walkerites and we invited Assemblywoman Sandy Pasch to talk with us today about the elections. She and Chris are both open to answering questions about the campaign and about Wisconsin politics.Sandy's running in the 8th Senate district. Over the course of a few months, more than 30,000 residents signed petitions to recall Walker-ally and friend of special interest, State Senator Alberta Darling. Darling is a 19- year Republican incumbent who has embraced the extreme conservative agenda. From slashing money for women’s health care, to raising taxes on seniors and the working poor while giving tax breaks to big corporations, to gutting money for Wisconsin schools, to making it easier to carry a concealed gun into days cares, malls and bars, Darling is a prime symbol of why we need to win these recall elections. Formerly a kind of mainstream conservative she's devolved into a career politician who puts the extreme, divisive agenda of the party bosses and special interests ahead of her constituents.Remember, Democrats need just three net victories to take control of the state Senate and create a firewall against the reckless Walker agenda. Winning Darling’s seat will be a critical part of that equation. She's vulnerable. Polling shows she can be beaten, and even her Republican allies in the Senate have said to the press she is in trouble.Sandy's a dedicated progressive and has over 30 years of experience as a clinical nurse and educator. She is committed to stopping Walker’s assault on Wisconsin’s working families. Darling won her last election by only 1,007 votes and next month Sandy is the right candidate to fix that mistake.Winning these recalls will not just help protect Wisconsin-- it will send a signal to the entire country that we will stand up to extreme, divisive agendas that hurt our values and threaten the priorities we know are so important. Help her campaign now , and this summer Wisconsin will be the first step in our national efforts to stand for the ideals under threat by the most extreme right wing special interests facing our country since the 1940's. Please don't forget to make your way over to the live forum in the comments section below and meet Chris and Sandy.Tags: Blue America '12 , Chris Larson , Sandy Pasch , Wisconsin State SenateShare This PostWe welcome relevant, respectful comments.

(AP Photo/Nati Harnik)At the first Democratic debate of the 2016 presidential race, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticized opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for supporting a 2005 law that shields the gun industry from certain lawsuits.Clinton voted against this law when she was a senator, and she has lambasted it several times on the campaign trail this month.""Probably one of the most egregious, wrong, pieces of legislation that ever passed the Congress when it comes to this issue is to protect gun sellers and gun makers from liability,"" she said in Iowa Oct. 7. ""They are the only business in America that is wholly protected from any kind of liability. They can sell a gun to someone they know they shouldn't, and they won't be sued. There will be no consequences.""Is Clinton right? Are gun makers and dealers ""wholly protected"" against any kind of lawsuit, and do no other industries have similar immunities? Short answer: No. The gun industry is susceptible to some lawsuits, and there are federal laws restricting liability for a number of other types of businesses.As support, Clinton’s staff sent us a public health journal article that argues the gun industry’s ""broad immunity"" against litigation inhibits safe manufacturing and distribution of firearms, though it does not directly address her claim.ExceptionsThe law at issue is the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act , which was signed into law by President George W. Bush and seen as a victory for gun rights advocates . The purpose of the law is to protect gun dealers and manufacturers from lawsuits when their products are misused. For example, if a person buys a gun legally and then uses the gun to intentionally kill someone, the gun dealer and manufacturer cannot be held liable for the crime under the law.While opponents argue that the law stops some victims from having their day in court, supporters say the law protects gun dealers and manufacturers from frivolous and expensive legal proceedings. In any case, Clinton goes too far in saying the gun industry is ""wholly protected from any kind of liability.""The law lists several situations that are not protected from liability. It does not protect gun dealers who transfer a gun knowing it would be used for criminal purposes, nor those who knowingly break state or federal law if the violation results in harm. Gun manufacturers can also be sued if the gun, when used properly, causes injury because the product is defective.""The statement is incorrect insofar as it suggests that gun makers are totally free from liability,"" said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles who specializes in gun law.Some opponents of the law argue that the liability protection is so broad and ambiguous, and the exceptions so narrow, that some legitimate lawsuits won’t have a chance to appear in court. But this is different from saying the gun industry is wholly immune to all lawsuits.Clinton also said the gun industry is the ""only"" business in America with this total liability protection. We know that it doesn’t have total protection, but do other sectors have something similar?Not the only oneThe act ""is not the first federal law to grant a particular industry immunity from tort liability,"" said Timothy Lytton, a law professor at Georgia State University, who edited a book on gun industry litigation.Possibly the most analogous rule -- in that it protects a specific group of potential defendants from a specific liability theory -- is one that offers some immunity to online service providers, said John Goldberg, a law professor at Harvard University and an expert in tort law, in an email to PolitiFact. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act blocks victims of online defamation from suing service providers (like Comcast) and content providers (like YouTube) for failing to monitor or remove defamatory posts uploaded by customers.In a prior interview with NPR , Goldberg called the gun industry law particularly ""aggressive"" in terms of the liability protections granted.Most of the experts we surveyed also mentioned a vaccine manufacturer liability law passed in the 1980s. Under the law, victims of injuries that they say were caused by defective vaccines are not allowed to sue vaccine manufacturers. This differs from the gun legislation, however, because it established the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program , through which alleged victims can make a claim and receive compensation.""By contrast, (the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act) simply prohibits certain kinds of tort claims against the gun industry without providing plaintiffs any alternative means of pursuing their claims,"" Lytton said.There’s also some liability protection in the medical devices and airline industries, noted Walter Olson, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute and expert in tort law. For example,the 1994 General Aviation Revitalization Act said small aircraft manufacturers cannot be sued for accidents involving aircraft more than 18 years old.""It’s not at all unique to the gun industry. It’s a version (of liability law) Congress developed for an industry that was under very heavy attack,"" Olson said, referring to the slew of litigation against gun sellers and makers that prompted Congress to pass the law.Our rulingClinton said the gun industry is ""the only business in America that is wholly protected from any kind of liability.""Clinton is talking about a law that says the gun industry is protected from liability in certain instances, but the law also specifies several situations in which the gun industry is susceptible to lawsuits.Further, Congress has passed a number of laws that protect a variety of business sectors from lawsuits in certain situations, so the situation is not unique to the gun industry.We rate Clinton’s claim False.Advertisement"

Not in my district. Not in California. Not anywhere. But over the past five years my constituents have struggled to survive without life-giving water in the face of a catastrophic drought.“This past winter, heavy rains and snowfall have brought much needed relief. In fact, there was so much water this past winter, we ran out of room to store it.“But we cannot always expect a year to bring monsoon-level rains and record snow. What happens if next year’s rain and snowfall is average? Or below average? Or we have another drought? The federal and state regulations that keep us from pumping and storing water will come back to haunt us.“The water bill passed by this body and signed into law last year was a down payment on California’s future. Today’s legislation is another major investment in our state’s future.“So, let’s look at pumping. There is no reason—absolutely no reason –we should prioritize potential benefits to fish over real benefits to families. This legislation increases Delta pumping and will bring immediate relief two-thirds of California south of the Delta.“But a long-term solution demands more than pumping. While California’s population has doubled since the 1970s, we haven’t completed a single major storage project in that time. Now that’s worth restating. With California’s population having doubled since the 1970s we have not completed a single major storage project in that time. How can California grow and thrive in the future if we depend on inadequate infrastructure from nearly 50 years go?“Currently, five reservoir projects have been stalled in regulatory and red tape for decades. If these reservoirs alone are built, we could store between one to 1.5 million acre-feet of additional water in our state. So we need to build more storage as soon as possible. Last year’s water bill jumpstarted the process for building new reservoirs in California and the West. It was a bipartisan bill with hundreds of votes out of the House, more than 70 in the Senate.“Today’s legislation builds on that by requiring the federal government to finally finish the feasibility studies for the five storage projects in California. Then we reform the permitting process so other projects aren’t held up for years trying to get approval from a dozen different agencies.“So I want to thank Congressman David Valadao (CA-21) for his hard work, his persistence on this issue. Ultimately, American citizens haven’t gotten the water they need because their government was failing them. Last year’s bill was a start to change all that. So today, we take another major step forward to bring our communities the water they contract and pay for.“Now Mr. Speaker, you’re going to hear a lot of people on this side of the aisle talk about the need in California. Unfortunately, on the other side of the aisle it looks like you’ll just hear from one. That should show you the need and desire of why this bill is so important.”

Chris Christie, shown in his Trenton office Thursday, has been pressuring the Legislature to advance the Urban Hope Act during its lame duck session, which ends next week. TRENTON An Assembly committee unanimously endorsed legislation yesterday that would allow private companies to build and manage up to a dozen public schools in three of the states neediest cities, where school construction has otherwise ground to a halt in recent years.Known as the Urban Hope Act, the bill is one of four Gov. Chris Christie has been pressuring the Legislature to advance during its lame duck session, which ends next week. The measure could give businesses unprecedented control over public education in Newark, Camden and Jersey City, the three districts where companies could soon build and own schools.The Schools Development Authority is responsible for construction in these and other low-income districts, but dozens of projects have been stalled since Christie took office and no schools have been built to replace those that are crumbling or overcrowded.Amid the bills supporters is a former opponent and frequent Christie target the New Jersey Education Association. The states largest teachers union had called the legislation a veiled effort to ""funnel tax dollars"" to the private sector. But yesterday, union president Barbara Keshishian released a statement endorsing the act.""NJEA supports this legislation because it allows for innovation while providing meaningful public accountability,"" Keshishian said. ""It is a creative expansion of public school choice that uses public funds to support public education.""One of the bills sponsors, state Sen. Donald Norcross (D-Gloucester), said he expects the full Senate and Assembly to pass the measure Monday, the last day of the current legislative session.""We have spent enough money and endured enough failure, especially in our urban districts,"" Norcross said. ""Its time to do things differently in a limited, focused way.""Nonprofit operators interested in starting up to four new schools, called ""renaissance school projects,"" must apply to the state Department of Education and demonstrate experience working in a ""high-risk, low-income urban district,"" according to the bill. Those nonprofit groups are free, however, to contract with businesses to purchase land, construct facilities or manage the schools. They are not required to follow public bidding laws to select contractors.The governor unveiled the Urban Hope Act in June at Camdens Lanning Square Elementary, a school slated for reconstruction by the school development agency. After Augusts earthquake, city officials condemned the dilapidated building as unsafe for students. Assembly Budget Committee Chairman Lou Greenwald (D-Camden) said the SDAs inaction has been a ""major stimulus"" of the legislation. ""Not one school has been built under the Christie administration over the past three years,"" Greenwald said. ""For students in Camden where the walls are falling down and students in Phillipsburg who take class in trailers, its a tragedy to deprive those children of better facilities.""Others said inaction by the SDA is no reason to sign a law authorizing private companies to do its work. Nearly a year ago, Christie said the agency would begin work on 10 school-construction projects, but it did not have the money to take on any more. Lanning Square did not make the cut.""Lanning Square was promised to us 10 years ago,"" said R. Mangaliso Davis, a Camden resident who testified before the Assembly Budget Committee yesterday. ""If the SDA had done its job, we would have many more schools than we have now.""If approved Monday, the proposal would be a major win for Christie, whose other education reforms have stalled.That win could lead to court action, however. David Sciarra, executive director of the Newark-based Education Law Center, took issue with the legislations allowing land currently owned by the state and slated for school construction to be transferred to private companies at little or no cost.""Such transfers of these taxpayer-funded assets could very well run afoul of state and federal law,"" Sciarra said.

Howmuch has he changed the country? How much has the office changed him? We have the ""Roundtable"" standing by to debate those questions and allof the week's politics, including Harry Reid's role in the publicoption, and the GOP civil war that has forced their nominee out ofTuesday's congressional race in Upstate New York. But first, let's check in with one of the president's closestfriends and advisers, White House counselor Valerie Jarrett. Welcome to the THIS WEEK. VALERIE JARRETT, ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT FOR INTERGOVERNMENTALRELATIONS & PUBLIC LIAISON: Thank you, George. It's a pleasure to behere. STEPHANOPOULOS: Let me bring you back to one of -- probably one ofthe best moments of your life, one year ago this week, when PresidentObama accepted the verdict of the country's voters. Here is what hesaid that night. BARACK OBAMA, THEN-PRESIDENT-ELECT: Let's resist the temptation tofall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that haspoisoned our politics for so long. And while the Democratic Party haswon a great victory tonight, we do so with a measure of humility anddetermination to heal the divide that have held back our progress. STEPHANOPOULOS: One year later, the president's economic plan haspassed, but with no Republican votes in the House, only three in theSenate. It sure looks like right now no Republican support, the healthcare bills, as they are going forward in the Congress. And our polling shows that this partisan divide persists on issueafter issue after issue. Why has that core promise of the president'scampaign, healing the divide, gone unfulfilled? JARRETT: Well, you should ask that question to the RepublicanParty. I mean, frankly, just listening to the president's words again,it brought back terrific memories, and I think his message was aprofound one. And he has stayed true to that message. He has reachedout. He has listened. He has reached across the aisle. Just recently meeting with both the Democrats -- the Republicans andthe Democrats in both the House and in the Senate. His effort has beensustained throughout the year. And the fact... STEPHANOPOULOS: So the president bears no responsibility for thefailure to get Republican votes? JARRETT: Well, I think -- I think what we look to the president todo is to lead by example. He has reached out. He has listened. He hasincluded very helpful advice from the Republicans when it has beenforthcoming. But the fact... STEPHANOPOULOS: But not their ideas in the legislation.. JARRETT: Well, actually, that's not true. There have been examplesof where he has included their ideas. And ultimately whether they votefor a piece of legislation or not, doesn't mean that it hasn't been anopen and fruitful process. STEPHANOPOULOS: So the president doesn't feel he needs to changethe way he does business at all, to reach out more to Republicans, toget more Republicans buy-in? JARRETT: Oh, George, listen. He is constantly reaching out toRepublicans. Both he and his team. And he will continue to do that. But ultimately it's up to the Republicans to decide if they want to be aconstructive force and come to the table and work with us in a positive way. We want to hear good ideas. The president is known for listeningmost closely to those with whom he disagrees. So the door is always open. STEPHANOPOULOS: Does that mean, for example, that Speaker Pelosishould give the Republicans a vote on an alternative in health care? JARRETT: I'm not going to in any way comment on what the speakershould do. She is an extraordinary leader and she is going to continueto do that. And she is going to reach out in a way that she deemsappropriate. But your question is what is the president's leadership about it,and hearkening back to the message from last year, and I think he hasbeen consistent not just here, domestically, but also around the worldin the way he has reached out. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, to follow through, shouldn't he ask thespeaker then to give Republicans a vote? JARRETT: To give them a vote and give them a voice. It gives theman opportunity to contribute constructively. That doesn't mean that youactually have to change what you think is in the best interests of theAmerican people simply to get a Republican vote. What you do is you reach out, you listen, you collaborate, butultimately, the president is accountable to the Republican people -- tothe American people, sorry. STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's talk about this election coming up Tuesday inUpstate New York. The president created a vacancy by making John McHugh-- Congressman John McHugh, the secretary of the army. And now thereappears to be a bit of a Republican civil war going on there. TheRepublican nominee, Dede Scozzafava, was forced out of the race by aconservative challenger. And I know that the president's political team is hoping to convinceher to throw her support to the Democrat, Bill Owens. Any luck on that? JARRETT: Well, we'll see. We would love to have -- of course, haveher support. And it's rather telling when the Republican Party forcesout a moderate Republican and it says I think a great deal about wherethe Republican Party leadership is right now. So of course we would love to have her support, and those are thepeople who are going to vote for her. STEPHANOPOULOS: What does it say about where the Republican Partyleadership is? JARRETT: Well, I think it's becoming more and more extreme and moreand more marginalized. Look at the number of people who actually saythat they are registered, consider themselves a Republican. And ifthat's the direction they want to go find, what we're going to do iswhat we've always done, and that is, we're going reach out, we're goingto try to include as many people to be a part of our governing process,being open, being transparent, and we're going to let the Americanpeople decide. And right now what you see is a great deal of momentum movingforward, for example, on health care. The American people want change. They don't want the same old health care system that is not affordable,that doesn't offer coverage to everybody, that keeps escalating in costs. And what we've seen from the Republicans is really a desire to havethe status quote. And, George, that's not acceptable anymore. STEPHANOPOULOS: Our latest polling shows that there is not majoritysupport for the president's health care plans. JARRETT: Well, we actually think that there is. And I suppose itdepends upon what poll you're looking at. But as more and more word hasgotten out about what health care reform is all about, whether it's ourdesire to make it affordable, whether it's to cover all people, whetherit's to make sure that people who have pre-existing conditions don'tlose their coverage, whether if somebody changes a job, they don't losetheir coverage, if somebody is unemployed they don't lose their coverage. All of these are extraordinarily important to the American people. This has been an unusual process. It has been open, it has beentransparent. Oftentimes the sausage-making in Washington is a littlebit off-putting. But look how far we've come. George, five different committees haveapproved health care. It's now being debated. And all of those fivecommittees have -- the content of those bills is consistent with whatthe president put forward. STEPHANOPOULOS: You know, you say that all five bills areconsistent with what the president has put forward, but the bill comingout of the Senate Finance Committee includes a tax on these high-pricedinsurance plans. Senator Charles Grassley, the Republican ranking member of thatcommittee has looked at Joint Tax Committee figures, and according tothose figures, it shows that 46 million families making less than$200,000 will eventually see their taxes go up under this plan. Thatwould break the president's promise not to raise any taxes on peopleearning under $250,000 a year. So how can you say that's consistent with his plan? JARRETT: Yes, well, first of all, there are lots of differentanalyses of the plans, and until we have a final bill, let's hold offprejudging what it's going to do. But the president has been clear, hedoes not want to impose a tax on the middle class. That's whyimmediately upon taking office, when the Recovery Act was passed, itprovided a tax relief to the middle class, something -- a very big pointhe made in the course of the campaign. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, then let me press this point, because it'snot just Republicans who say this. You've got union leaders like GerryMcEntee and several others have said this is also a tax increase on themiddle class. You've got 180 House Democrats who are saying the samething, saying that that's why they're opposed to it. So are you saying that the president will not sign this proposal ifit does indeed raise taxes on the middle class? JARRETT: What I'm saying to you, George, is, let's let the processgo forward. Let's not pre-judge to the end. There have been so manyconstructive conversations going on as recently as Friday with thevarious leadership in both the House and the Senate. And I think what the president has said is, look, we do not want tohave any additional tax burden on the middle class. We want to haveaffordable health care. We want to make sure that people who have nothad insurance before have it. We need to bring down the costs, becausethat's going to help our federal deficit... STEPHANOPOULOS: So if... JARRETT: All of those parameters -- and no, what I'm saying is thatI'm not going to leap forward to the end. What we're going to do... STEPHANOPOULOS: But don't you have to set the bottom line for the... JARRETT: No, no. What you do and what he has done, and what hasbrought us to the point where we are right now where we have five billsfor the first time in history, after decades of effort, what he is doingis working. And what he is doing is talking constructively. His team is up on the Hill every single day, meeting with theleadership, meeting with all of the different members. And we're goingto see where we go. And he has made it clear, as I said from theoutset, what his parameters are. And he's constantly... STEPHANOPOULOS: So he will not -- bottom line, he will not violatethat commitment, is what you're saying? JARRETT: What I'm saying is that he is confident that a bill that'sgoing to be passed is going to be consistent with his parameters, yes. STEPHANOPOULOS: OK. Let's talk about Afghanistan for a second. Wesee today the opposition candidate to President Karzai, AbdullahAbdullah, has said he's not going to run in the run-off. Is this awelcome development or is the White House worried the questions aboutthis election will cast a cloud over President Karzai and make it moredifficult for the president to implement his strategy? JARRETT: We don't think that it's going to add a complication tothe strategy. It's up to the Afghan people and their authorities todecide how to proceed going forward. We watched the election verycarefully. And we're going to work with the leader of the Afghangovernment and hopefully that's going to improve the state of conditionsfor the people in Afghanistan, and also help us as we try to bring thiswar to a close. STEPHANOPOULOS: So this is not a complication as far as you see it? JARRETT: No. We don't see it as a complication. STEPHANOPOULOS: And we also -- we're getting some word followingthe president's meeting with the joint chiefs on Friday that the targetdate for announcing this decision may be slipping a bit. The presidentwants some more information from the Joint Chiefs. Is it now possible that it's going to come after the presidentreturns from Asia, more like the end of November than the middle? JARRETT: What the president has said consistently is he is goingthrough a very rigorous process. George, before he puts our men andwomen in harm's way, he wants to make absolutely sure that he has astrategy. This isn't just a matter of how many troops are sent over. Although that is a very important component. We have to look at what's going on on the ground. We have to lookat what our allies are doing. We have to look at the state of thegovernment in Afghanistan. And he's looking for a strategy that leadsto keeping our nation safe. And so the timing for that is completely upto the president, who makes the decision when he is confident that hehas all of the facts that he needs to make the right decision for ourcountry. STEPHANOPOULOS: So it could be later in the month. Let me just -- also this week the president went to Dover. And wewant to show our audience some of the pictures from that. The presidentseemed -- did seem quite moved, almost stricken at times during thatvisit. It had quite an impact on the president, didn't it? JARRETT: How could it not? I mean, my goodness, to meet thefamilies of people who have given their lives, the maximum sacrifice toour country? Of course he was deeply moved by the experience. Anyonewho was there would have to be. STEPHANOPOULOS: Did you have a chance to talk to him about it andhow do you think it will affect his decision-making? JARRETT: I think that he is going to make the decision that he --that he thinks is right for the American people. It certainly is areminder of what is at stake. And you talk about 40,000 troops, behindevery troop is a family. And it's a huge sacrifice that we're askingour men and women to make. And I think going to Dover and showing respect on behalf of ourcountry for that sacrifice was something that was very important to thepresident. But ultimately he is going to make the decision that hethinks is going to keep our country safe. STEPHANOPOULOS: One final question, the president received bothpraise and criticism for doing that visit with television camerasthere. Why was it important for the president to do that somewhat inpublic? JARRETT: Well, he wouldn't have done it in public if the familieshad objected. So the first and foremost thing is what is important tothe families. And I think that it's important for us all to recognizewhat is at stake. And so when you talk about numbers, like 40,000troops, as I said a minute ago, I think it's a reminder about how deepthe sacrifice is. And it's something that's open and transparent, and it was a way forhim as the president to convey to those families on behalf of theAmerican people how much we appreciate that enormous sacrifice they'vemade. STEPHANOPOULOS: Valerie Jarrett, thanks very much. JARRETT: You're welcome. Good to see you. STEPHANOPOULOS: We're going to go straight to the roundtable, so asour panelists take their seats, we have a little bookend to thatelection night excerpt we showed from President Obama. Gracious wordsfrom Senator McCain. SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R-AZ), THEN-REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:Senator Obama and I have and argued our differences, and he hasprevailed. No doubt many of those differences remain. These aredifficult times for our country. And I pledge to him tonight to do allin my power to help and lead us through the many challenges we face. STEPHANOPOULOS: We're going to go straight to the roundtable, soas our panelists take their seats, we have a little bookend to thatelection night excerpt we showed from President Obama. Gracious wordsfrom Senator McCain. MCCAIN: Senator Obama and I have and argued our differences, andhe has prevailed. No doubt many of those differences remain. Theseare difficult times for our country. And I pledge to him tonight todo all in my power to help and lead us through the many challenges weface. STEPHANOPOULOS: One year ago this week. With that, let me bringin our roundtable. I am joined as always by George Will; EdGillespie, counselor to President George W. Bush; Ron Brownstein ofthe National Journal; Dee Dee Myers, press secretary to Bill Clinton;and the Reverend Al Sharpton. Welcome to all of you. And let me just begin with the threshold question. We're about ayear out from the election. Has the president delivered on thatpromise of change? WILL: I think domestically and in foreign policy, he has. Hisone great achievement is to enhance the status of the United States. Now, that happens to have zero cash value, it turns out. TheIranians, the North Koreans, the Afghan government, China and Indiaregarding carbon limitations -- he's made no progress on any of thesefronts, but people like us better. So I suppose that's anachievement. SHARPTON: I think he absolutely has changed -- I agree withGeorge. He's changed the perception of America. I think that he'salso changed some things here, the economy. When you look at the GDP,up 3.5. When you look at 30-year mortgages at a lower rate than it'sever been... STEPHANOPOULOS: Be careful there. Unemployment almost 10percent. SHARPTON: Unemployment -- again, the hardest thing once youbring an economy back, is the jobs. I think he has to finish thetask. Let's remember, George, he's only been there 10 months aspresident. In nine months, he's helped restore America's image, he'shelped to stop the hemorrhaging of jobs, and bring the economy back. So in nine months, what it usually takes to make a baby, he's startingthe rebirth of America. STEPHANOPOULOS: And Ed Gillespie, I was thinking of you asValerie Jarrett was here talking. Basically, her answer on why thispartisan divide hasn't healed at all is it was the Republicans' fault. GILLESPIE: Right. Well, it's always the Republicans' fault ifyou listen to this White House, and I think that's one of thedisappointments, I think, frankly, for a lot of us Republicans,independents, is that this has not been a post-partisan presidency, aswe were led to believe. In fact, it's been a very partisan WhiteHouse, very political in its nature. And just, for example, I've heard Valerie Jarrett say, well, interms of health care reform, you know, no Republican support. Well,look at what's happened in that debate. The things that got OlympiaSnowe's vote in the United States Senate, they dropped and so yet theycontend they're looking for Republican support. They eliminated theone Republican they had a shot of getting so far. The president inhis Joint Session speech talked about medical liability reform. ThePelosi bill punishes states that put a limit on attorney's fees or puta cap on damages. So when you look at their actions relative to therhetoric, I think that accounts for the bipartisanship. STEPHANOPOULOS: I want to get more to health care later. Butfirst, Dee Dee, on this broader question, the president obviously camein with more popular support than Bill Clinton had in 1993 but similarnumbers in both the House and the Senate. And they did seem to makethe choice, not unlike the choice in 1993/'94 to secure the Democraticbase first on their big pieces of legislation. MYERS: Well, I think after some consultation in the early weeksand months, they ran up against the reality. It's true the presidenthas in some ways changed the tone, but he's also in these nine shortmonths, 10 short months shown the limitations of bipartisanship. Youcan talk a good game, you can go meet with people and you realizethey're just not going to be for you and so that leaves you noalternative than to secure your base. You have to get the votes outof your base. And if you can pick off one or two people in the middlelike Olympia Snowe, moderate Republican, to call the bill bipartisan,great. But if not, then you have to be able to pass legislation withDemocrats. BROWNSTEIN: These are much more structural problems than reallydealing with one president in their control. We are moving muchcloser to something like a parliamentary system in this country whereeach party is now much more the base, the coalition is much moreideologically homogeneous than it was a generation ago and that exertstremendous and typical pressure for legislators on one side to standwith their side against the other on almost every major issue. I think Obama wants to bring in Republicans but he wants to do soby addition. He's willing to add Republican ideas, I think, to hispackage. Republicans need -- really need subtraction. I mean that even if, for example, you have medical malpracticereform in the health care bill, there are very few Republicans todaywho could vote for an individual mandate, which is the cornerstone ofthe bill, even though that was the Republican alternative to HillaryClinton's plan in 1993. I think the parties are structurally moving apart, and it is verydifficult for either side to win substantial support on theirlegislative priorities from the other. That is just a reality of ourpolitics today. MYERS: But it's worth noting that twice as many people, Americanpeople, think Obama and the Democrats have tried harder to reachacross the aisle than Republicans. WILL: But the reality is the Democrats have a very clear agenda,unified theory of this administration and it is equality, understoodas equality of outcome. And, therefore, every proposal the presidenthas from dealing with General Motors to the United Autoworkers tohealth care is to increase the number of Americans equally dependenton the federal government for more and more things. And I don't thinkthe American people at the end of the day want that. SHARPTON: Well, I think that you cannot get by Dee Dee's point. I think that the American people have said very, very clearly thatthey think that this administration and the Democrats have been theones to reach out. We're waiting to see the Republican that emergesthat reaches back. Even on education reform, the president has NewtGingrich and I touring together. I mean, you can't reach out morethan to try to get Newt Gingrich and I to go on tour together. I think that he has reached out. I think at some point, therewill be a tremendous backlash on the Republicans when they don't reachback. And I think that that is the problem that they're having in alot of these pollings that we're seeing. BROWNSTEIN: I was going to say, look, the president has had somesuccess and broadening his coalition outside of Congress. He has hadmore success than Clinton did at bringing in business interests onreally all of the major initiatives whether it's on cap and trade withsome of the major utilities... STEPHANOPOULOS: Or health care policy. BROWNSTEIN: But the underlying fact I think is George is correctwhether you characterize it the way he did or not, what Obama and theDemocrats want to do and what the Republicans fundamentally want to doat this point, the gulf is so large, it is very difficult to see themcoming together in meaningful numbers. And if you say what Obama has done in nine months, he really haschanged the frame of debate. The stimulus plan included more net newpublic investment and the things that Democrats prize, like education,alternative energy than Clinton was able to achieve in his eightyears. And let's not forget that he is within sight now of a health carebill that has defeated every president who has tried it since FranklinRoosevelt. So he is changing the terms of the debate. There arepolitical costs, we'll talk about those later, but he is shifting whatwe're discussing and what the solutions we're discussing are. STEPHANOPOULOS: One area where we've seen less change thanactually I would have expected is on the issue of race relations inthe United States. Remarkable poll from the Gallup organization thisweek. They asked, ""Do you think that relations between blacks andwhites will always be a problem for the United States, or that asolution will eventually be worked out?"" You go back to December1963, 42 percent thought it would be a problem, 55 percent thought itwould eventually be worked out. By November 2008, the number thoughta year ago on Election Day, it would be a problem, had gone down quitea bit. STEPHANOPOULOS: And the number who thought it would be workedout had gone up. But look at October 2009, right back to where we were, basically,in November 1963, despite all the changes we've had in those times,Reverend Sharpton. SHARPTON: Because I think the structural inequality is stillthere. The reality is that you still see the race gap in education,in employment, in health care. And I think the reality has sobered alot of people up. I think what the president has done is tried to reach out andbring people together, and I think everyone appreciates that. But Ithink people are looking at the reality. So a year after his election, with all the hope of Americanscoming together and the great symbolism of having an African-Americanpresident, I don't think we've lost that; I think we just sobered upto the reality. We've learned that he can't walk on water, but he'sstill the best swimmer in national politics. STEPHANOPOULOS: Best swimmer, George? WILL: When a poll shows something that is so obviouslypreposterous, they ought to go back and look at the poll. The VotingRights Act, public accommodations act, enormous changes in educationin the United States, access to college -- we've made enormousstrides. And for them to say essentially nothing has changed is justnonsense. Watch the election in Atlanta this week. WILL: ... mayor. A black city may be about to elect, for thefirst time in, what, two generations, a white mayor. Now, thatindicates a, kind of, coming of the real color-blind nature of ourpolitics. MYERS: The same thing may (ph) happen in Atlanta. GILLESPIE: No, I think -- the (inaudible), George, is that it's-- we're moving the goal posts in a good way. You know, we've alwaysgot to do better, but the fact is, I can tell you, my children havegrown up in a more color-blind society than I grew up in, and I grewup in a more color-blind society than my parents grew up in. And wehave made great progress. The election of President Obama was a proud moment for the UnitedStates of America in that regard. But, that said, I think what you see is an American public thatsays, you know what, we've got to keep striving. And I think that's apositive thing. BROWNSTEIN: Each cohort -- each younger cohort in American lifeis more diverse than the one older. We are becoming inexorably a morediverse society. This was the first election in American history morethan a quarter of the voters were nonwhite. That number isn't goingdown. It's only going up. Now, having said that, there is a red flag out there that goesback to what George was saying before, I think. There are very --there are divergent views between white and nonwhite America over therole of government, and that is widening at a really -- almost at anominous rate. I mean, white America is moving, I think, by and large, in avery, kind of, Perot-esque direction. There is, kind of, a backlashagainst some of the ambition of what Obama is pursuing and theDemocrats pursuing across the board, whereas there is much moretolerance in nonwhite America for a larger, more expansive federalrole. And that skepticism about institutions that you see in big chunksof the white electorate, contrasted with the support in the nonwhiteelectorate, is, kind of, an unstable phenomenon. STEPHANOPOULOS: It's going to reach such tension next year, asthe president goes forward. We're going to take a break in just aminute. Before we do, there's a new book out by President Obama'scampaign manager, David Bluff -- Plouffe -- called ""The Audacity toWin."" And, Reverend Sharpton, there's a fascinating little excerptabout you in the book. He describes a moment on Christmas Eve 2007,very close race in Iowa, where President -- then Senator Obama callsPlouffe as Plouffe is in church, because he's worried -- he's gottenword that you might be coming to Iowa, and that is not entirely goodnews for him. On the one hand, if you're coming to endorse Hillary Clinton,they're fine with that, but they felt that, if you were coming toendorse him, it might create problems for Obama that they didn't want. The way it ends us, you don't come. They say you played aconstructive role the rest of the campaign. What happened? SHARPTON: There was a group that tried to get me to come in, andI think they were -- this was at the time when they were trying toreally go for these race politics and miscast... STEPHANOPOULOS: Coming for Obama. SHARPTON: No, they wanted me to come in, period, on a raceissue, which, really, you'd have to be hard-pressed to really dealwith that in Iowa. But we determined it was a distraction (inaudible). And I pickedup the phone and called then-Senator Obama and said, I'm not going tobe used like that. And I've worked, as they said, constructivelythroughout the rest of the campaign. Because, even though he and I may not agree on every strategy, Ithink that, once you decide you want to work with someone, you do whatis best, whether you're out front or behind the scenes. STEPHANOPOULOS: OK, we're going to take a quick break. We'll beback with more roundtable in just a minute, and later, the Sundayfunnies. DAVID LETTERMAN, HOST, ""THE LATE SHOW"": Because of the weatherand due to the low ceiling -- listen to this -- earlier this afternoona Northwest Airline airplane, passenger plane, accidentally landed atthe correct airport. STEPHEN COLBERT, DAILY SHOW: Staunch conservative George Willhas for the last two Sundays on ABC's THIS WEEK wore a long tie. Clearly his bow ties were the only thing tethering George Will toreality. WILL: Marijuana is getting much better. COLBERT: Then he tried to eat George Stephanopoulos because hethought he was a teddy graham. WILL: We legalized prostitution, as anyone who opens a telephonebook and looks under escort can tell you. COLBERT: I don't now which is more disturbing, that George Willgoes to prostitutes or that he still uses the phone book. STEPHANOPOULOS: George Will's star turn on ""Comedy Central,"" youand Steve Colbert. I want to bring you back in here along with Ed Gillespie, RonBrownstein, Dee Dee Myers and the Reverend Al Sharpton. I could askyou to respond but we can go straight to the politics of the week. First time I've ever seen George Will blush. STEPHANOPOULOS: A lot of elections coming up this week. Let'sshow the latest polling in these gubernatorial races and importantcongressional race. No. 1, down in Virginia, Creigh Deeds, theDemocrat, about 10 points behind in the latest ""Washington Post"" pollto Bob McDonnell, the Republican. Up in New Jersey, Jon Corzine, the incumbent, 43 percent, ChrisChristie, Republican, 38 percent and Independent Chris Daggett has 13percent. That race really too close to call according to most of thepolling right now. And then this congressional district up in upstate New York, NewYork 23. John McHugh left to become secretary of the army. It was adead heat according to the poll that came out from the Siena ResearchInstitute yesterday between the Democrat Bill Owens, the conservativecandidate, Doug Hoffman, the Republican Dede Scozzafava was far behindat 20 percent. And yesterday, George Will, she dropped out of the race. A lotof big Republican power brokers had come in on either side of thisrace. Sarah Palin came in for the conservative candidate. So did TimPawlenty. Newt Gingrich, the former speaker came in on behalf ofScozzafava and he said something interesting in ""The New York Times""this morning. And he said, he warned about an impending civil war inthe Republican Party. He said ""If we get into a cycle where everytime one side loses they run a third-party candidate, we'll makePelosi speaker for life and guarantee Obama's re-election."" WILL: If they had done what Newt Gingrich urged them to do inthat district, the district probably would have gone to a Democrat andwould have lost a seat. Newt was just tone deaf as were the peoplewho picked this woman. Who is a candidate of among other things theworking families party which is a wholly owned subsidiary of thePublic Employees Union. She's for tax increases, same-sex marriage. She's for abolishing the right of secret ballot in union elections. There's already a party for people who think like that. It's calledthe Democratic Party. MYERS: It was interesting that she was chosen by the countyparty chairs, 11 people got in a back room and chose her for somereasons that may have to do with state party politics and not to dowith winning. But there's no question -- it will be very interestingto see what lessons both Democrats and particularly Republicans takefrom this. Is this going to be a carte blanche for conservatives totake on more moderate incumbents in primaries? GILLESPIE: Well, look, Dee Dee's point is a very important one. This nominee, Scozzafava was chosen by 11 people behind closed doors. STEPHANOPOULOS: It was a caucus process, wasn't it? GILLESPIE: It's a process but it doesn't make it a good one. The fact is that a lot of Republicans said, wait a second, she wasn'ta moderate Republican as George pointed out. She is a liberalRepublican. Daily Kos, the left wing Web site endorsed her over theDemocrat. The fact is I think Republicans, many of whom support herbecause she was the Republican Party nominee, and there is anobligation that have you in the party to support the nominee arerelieved today at the opportunity to pick up this seat now. And I think that if you look at the 20 percent that Scozzafavawas getting in that poll, I suspect that breaks about 3-1 to Hoffmanat the end of the day. STEPHANOPOULOS: And Ron, the Republicans almost certainly willnow win. BROWNSTEIN: It seems the momentum is there. It sends a mixedmessage for Republicans out of this. On the one hand, I think it'sgoing to be another indication, I think we'll see others on Tuesday,that there is energy in the small government, anti-spending argumentat this point. On the other hand, the fall of the Dede as I think she's knownnow, I think is a sign that the leash that the base is holding on theparty is tightening and that the Palins, the talk radio, the RushLimbaughs, the FOX, the definition of what is acceptable as aRepublican I think is narrowing. I mean this does come after Arlen Specter essentially was forcedto leave the party after voting for the stimulus, after Chuck Grassleyfaced threats, open threats of a primary challenge if he compromisedwith Max Baucus. In the long run -- in the short run, there's clear energy here inthe small government, anti-government argument. But in the long run,I do wonder about whether Republicans are going to have the freedom ofmaneuver they'll need to recover in some of those blue states wherethey've significantly eroded. GILLESPIE: I think they will. Let's understand something. Thisis a conservative district. This is a district where a conservative-- this is not some swing district where having a moderate Republican,not a liberal Republican, but a moderate Republican who may vary withthe party on some things has a better change of winning here. GILLESPIE: ... conservative Republican. GILLESPIE: I agree, but I just -- I don't think it's right toread too much into New York 23, in terms of this civil war that I'mreading about... SHARPTON: Newt Gingrich was the one that said it. And I thinkwe should read all we could. I encourage civil war all over the Republican Party. And I'm very encouraged, on a Sunday morning, to hear you, Ed,admit that the Republicans' candidates are chosen by these 11 guys atthe top. GILLESPIE: Not always. SHARPTON: And I hope the masses of the Republicans rebel anddivide all over the country. GILLESPIE: My point, Reverend, is that was the exception. That's one of the things -- you know, usually, our nominees comethrough a primary process where the voters have a chance to expressthemselves. MYERS: Really important point, which is the Democratic Part wasable to take back the House in 2006 with a big-tent strategy, byopening the party to people who didn't agree on every ideological --you know, the Heath Shulers of the world. Will the Republicans be able to do that, if they want to win backthe House in 2010? GILLESPIE: One of the points I make, Dee Dee, all the time, is,look, if you look at what the Democrats did, they were very smartabout it. They did get districts, one, carried by people in Oklahoma,Texas, other places, predominantly Catholic areas, where they mightnot agree on abortion as the party platform. But in doing so, in winning the majority in the House, they didnot -- their party did not move to the right. The Democratic Party,if anything, moved to the left in that process. So I think there's alesson we've learned there. STEPHANOPOULOS: You're now going to see this play out in otherraces. We've Marco Rubio challenging Governor Crist for the Senate. STEPHANOPOULOS: He will win? WILL: Absolutely. Absolutely, he'll win. STEPHANOPOULOS: Against the popular governor of Florida, thestate of Florida? WILL: Look -- look what the local caucuses are saying in theirstraw polls. Look at who votes in an off-year, closed primary. Itwill be the ideologically intense, and Rubio will get them. BROWNSTEIN: You know, the problem with the civil war metaphor isit implies two equal armies contesting on the battlefield. There isnot a civil war in the Republican Party. You have a dominant conservative wing that is a larger share ofthe Republican coalition, by far, than the liberals are, by the way,of the Democratic coalition. And then you have, kind of, a moderateto liberal -- not even liberal -- remnant that is declining ininfluence. And the -- and the ability of the moderate side of the party, Ithink, to, kind of, shape the definition or the image of the party isvery limited. And I think what you saw -- I agree with you; New York 23 is aconservative place. You can't read too much into it. But I think itis part of an overall continuum in which, after Bush, after McCain,the conservative part of the party is saying, look, we lost notbecause we were too moderate but because we were -- not because wewere too conservative; because we were too moderate. And I think they will -- I think there is going to be a tightleash on Republican leaders in terms of how far they can deviate froma small government message in the next couple years. WILL: Independents -- independents are moving to the right indroves. Gallup says the number of Americans who identify themselvesas liberal is down 20. Those identifying as conservative, Reverend,are up to 40. That's two times 20. SHARPTON: Well, I'm a conservative. I want to conserve voterrights. I want to conserve women's rights. WILL: You don't want to conserve voting rights for unionmembers. SHARPTON: I think you've got to redefine what conservatives are,now. I think that a lot of what people who used to call themselvesconservatives, they're the extremists. They want to change America asit has become. I think we are now the conservatives. We're trying toconserve the America of the last 40 years that is making the progressyou talked about. STEPHANOPOULOS: One feeling I think a lot of those conservativeshave -- I mean, and you see this across the polling -- independentsare going up in every poll. But these are, as Ron suggests, is Perot-like independents, really, really angry, right now. And that couldcost Jon Corzine from your neighboring state, New Jersey, his race,even though he's ahead right now. SHARPTON: I think unfairly so. But I think you're right. Ithink that Corzine was impacted in his tenure as governor by whathappened in terms of the national economy and things that were beyondhis control. I have been in New Jersey. And I've been on the ground there,and I think that the problem there is trying to get that messagethrough and to really raise a lot of the things concretely that he diddo in the state. And I think that is going to be a close election. And I thinkhe'll win. STEPHANOPOULOS: But in that state, you've also, though, got moreof a moderate Republican challenging the Republican nominee, and he'scosting Chris Christie, the Republican, how many votes, as well. GILLESPIE: For right now... STEPHANOPOULOS: Third party. GILLESPIE: Yes, a third-party candidate. But, look,independents -- New Jersey's the first state in the union with aplurality of registered independent voters. They tend to be -- havebeen leaning Democrat for years, but they are fed up with thespending. They are fed up with the taxes. They're tired of seeingbusinesses run out of the state and they're tired of seeing one-partyrule in Trenton. And what we're seeing now is a reaction to that. And we've gotwind at our back for Chris Christie. I think Daggett's numbers willcome down between now and Tuesday, and they will accrue to -- theywill go to Christie. BROWNSTEIN: You know, you -- I think you are going to see somewarning signs for Democrats out of this election. I mean, you canmake too much of these -- these off-year elections, but in 2006 and2008 Democrats won independents substantially, both in the state racesand at the presidential level. In the last polls these week, in all three, Virginia, New Jersey,and New York 23, independents are moving toward the Republicans,largely, I think, around a size-of-government, scale-of-government,cost-of-agenda argument. I think you're going to see more pressurefrom Democratic centrists next year as the result for some kind ofdeficit reduction. STEPHANOPOULOS: I want to get into that, because... BROWNSTEIN: Can I just -- one quick point, having said that,President Obama's approval rating has stabilized over 50 percent withunemployment at 9.8 percent. When unemployment hit 9.8 percent underRonald Reagan in July '82, he was at 41 percent approval. There isstill a substantial base that supports Obama that puts him in adifferent position than Clinton was in, both legislatively andpolitically heading into that first midterm. STEPHANOPOULOS: Right now I think that's exactly right. I thinkthe other thing you're going to hear from Democrats, Dee Dee, if,indeed, Republicans win in both New Jersey and Virginia, is that inthese off-year elections, those states always go to the out-party. But if both states, both Virginia and New Jersey, go to theRepublicans, that could have an impact on this health care debate. MYERS: It could. You know, it could make a lot of Democrats --or moderate Democrats in both the House and Senate very nervous. Imean, there is backlash against -- this can't be completely attributedto a bad economy and to an unpopular incumbent in New Jersey. There is something afoot in the land that people areuncomfortable about, and one of the issues is spending. And that'sprobably the biggest issue. WILL: Well, that's right. I mean they've seen, A, on Friday, wehad the biggest contraction of the stock market in six months. Thejobs numbers come out, and they say, well, the GDP is growing. Peoplesay, well, so what, where are the jobs? We've had ""Cash forClunkers,"" which was a government-engineered automotive bubble thatpromptly collapsed. Our next stroke of genius in managing the economy from Washingtonwill probably be to extend the $8,000 tax credit for first-time ormultiple-time home-buyers, which is to say a government subsidy to getpeople into houses they cannot afford to be in. GILLESPIE: And by the way, the ""Cash for Clunkers,"" you know,which was a vaunted success supposedly, it turns out each of thesecars, apparently, $24,000 per car is the estimated cost of these. Thejobs that they attribute to stimulus, $71,500 per job. We're lookingat now having $540,000 per household in debt imposed by thisadministration. That is jarring to people, and the jobs aren't there. The fact is, is that we saw Jared Bernstein, a White Houseeconomic adviser, on TV last week say that they expect job creation tobegin the second half of next year, eight months from now. STEPHANOPOULOS: Of course, what the White House says and theireconomic advisers say is that without these programs that we wouldhave had 2 or 3 percent less... SHARPTON: And no one is more concerned about the 9.8unemployment rate than I am. But at the same time, you have to stopthe job loss. I live in New York. People forget that when we saw theWall Street companies go down, the financial services jobs thatordinary people lost on the ground, we had to stop the hemorrhaging. And I think that a lot of Americans which is why President Obama'spoll numbers are staying as high as they are, understand that heinherited a bad hand. He got the key to the bank with no money in the vault and thepeople that took the money are asking him, why aren't we makingwithdrawals? I think he has got to deal with what he was handed, andI think that that it is not just blaming the Republicans, it'sreality. He was handed a bad hand. BROWNSTEIN: You know, there's a short term and a long term arcto be looking at here. I think that in the near term you do havemovement among independents toward a -- especially white independents,toward a more skeptical Perot-esque view of government, and you add tothat the fact that the electorate in 2010 is going to be older andwhiter than the electorate in 2008, and younger and non-white votersare the core of the Democratic Party. That kind of adds up to whatcould be a difficult election in 2010. But if you look over the longer arc toward 2012, I do have towonder if Republicans are drawing the right lessons here, because insome ways they are responding to Obama's effort to expand governmentby becoming more aggressive in their proposals to retrench (ph)government. You had four-fifths of House Republicans vote this spring toconvert Medicare into a voucher for everybody under 55. And you'vehad three-quarters of House and Senate Republicans vote this year tolower the top marginal tax rate for the wealthiest to 25 percent, thelowest level since 1931. Now that's not going to be part of the debate in 2010. It'sgoing to be a referendum on Democrats. But when you get to 2012, ifthat is the trajectory of the party, I think Obama has an excellentchance of recapturing some of those independents who are skeptical. STEPHANOPOULOS: A lot will depend on whether health care passes,and what kind of impact it has had on people by 2012, as well. Andthis week we did see some major movement. You saw the House ofRepresentatives announce their bill, also Senator Harry Reid on thiswhole issue of the public option, choosing to side with his Democraticbase rather than Olympia Snowe, who the president had decided to gowith on the public option. Yet what he couldn't say at the end of that press conference wasthat he had the votes to get this to the floor and pass it. SEN. HARRY REID (D-NV), MAJORITY LEADER: We have 60 people inthe caucus, it's -- the comfort level is kind of -- we all hugtogether and see where we come out. STEPHANOPOULOS: A gamble forced by necessity, right, George? WILL: Yes. Now the president has now declared swine flu anemergency because the government hasn't done very well in coping withan epidemic we saw coming. Now at this very moment we're saying whatwe ought to do is expand radically the role of government in handlinghealth care. At the last count I heard, this 15,000 -- 1,500-page bill has theword ""shall"" in it. ""You shall do this."" ""Government shall do this."" ""States shall do."" That's the polite way of saying, ""must,"" 3,425times. WILL: And they say this is not government takeover of the healthcare system? It's preposterous. SHARPTON: It is government protection of citizens, 50 millionpeople uninsured, with all of the... WILL: Fifty? The president says 30. SHARPTON: ... 47, if you want to be exact. I don't have theexact numbers of how many times ""shall"" is in the bill, so let me beexact with... ... 47 million people uninsured who have not been protected andwho, I might add, in the Reagan years, Bush senior and Bush junioryears, it just sat there. I think the fact that this president has been able to move a -- adialogue forward and different manifestations of a health care packageto where it has passed five committees and we're on our way to somekind of movement, here, is nothing short of amazing. And I think that he ought to be saluted for that. The Americanpeople should be protected by the government. STEPHANOPOULOS: Democrats are convinced that failure here is notan option and that victory will put to rest a lot of the anxiety thatpeople have right now. Yet, at the same time, you're likely to see,if this bill does go through, at least over the next year or so,premiums continue to go up. Yet voters will also, for the first time,say they can't be denied health insurance if they're sick. So how does that trade-off work? GILLESPIE: I think -- George, I am stunned by this, I have tosay. I always thought, and I've said, you know, before, here, that Ithought that they would get to a bill that they could pass that hadbipartisan support, that was scaled back, that didn't have the publicoption. They have gone whole hog. This bill is a monstrosity. And froma Republican perspective, if you look at the mandates in it, the taxesin it, the cutting of Medicare for seniors, the federal funding ofabortion, it is -- I feel like one of those old game shows, where youtake the shopping cart down the aisle and try and scoop it all in, interms of trying to pick out, where do you hone in on this... STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes it is rolling toward passage. MYERS: It is rolling toward passage. And I think, you know,Senator -- what are Senator Reid's motives in approaching the publicoption this way? Well, part of it is back-home politics. He's in a very tough re-election. His state supports the public option, so he's taken a moreaggressive position. I don't think anybody believes there's enough votes in the Senateto pass this. So what's the fall-back plan? An opt-in, which bringsback Olympia Snowe. I think it's entirely possible that they passthis. GILLESPIE: But if they vote in the House on this bill, let metell you, it would be like the BTU of '93. And I've got to say... MYERS: They're a little smarter about that now. GILLESPIE: I've never felt this -- this is the first time I'vethought of this, but I've got to tell you something. I know that theywere willing to sacrifice 20 conservative Democrats, or moderateDemocrats, to get this done. I think they risk losing the House ifthey try to pass this bill and they jam it through the way it'swritten. MYERS: That's not going to pass the Senate, so we know that'snot going to... GILLESPIE: But it's going to pass the House, and those Housemembers are going to have voted for all these things. MYERS: It will depend on what gets worked out in the Senatebefore they go to vote in the House. BROWNSTEIN: Can I just make two quick points? I mean, your point about, sort of, the throwing everything in theshopping car -- the core of this bill, an individual mandate, amandate on individuals to buy insurance in return for fundamentalinsurance reform, paid for by slowing the growth of Medicare spendingis the John Chafee/Bob Dole alternative to Hillary Clinton in 1993. And it says something about the evolution of the party that,regardless of what else was in there, the individual mandate by itselfwould be a bridge too far for almost... STEPHANOPOULOS: Just stop there one second. Because I want --that's -- you're right. On the other hand, now let's go hardballpolitics. When this is in an election context next year, what youhave for the House members to (inaudible) they're going to be saddledwith $400 billion in Medicare cuts, and if this tax on high-pricedinsurance plans passes, something that a lot of their own supporterswill call a middle-class tax increase. How do you fight that? BROWNSTEIN: Yes. The heart -- the heart of the choice is goingto be whether George or Al are right -- Reverend Sharpton -- is rightabout what Americans want from government. Because what you are saying is that there's a fundamentallyReaganite moment, here, in which people are saying, look, governmentis just doing too much and we want it rolled back. What you're saying is that people are angry that government seemsto be protecting the rich and not doing anything for me. And to theextent that Obama and the Democrats can portray health care assomething that's not for Wall Street but helping to provide securityfor middle-class Americans, they have a better chance of selling itthan it might now appear. WILL: Here is why we have two parties. The Reverend Sharptonsay the American people need protected by government. Some of usthink we need protected from government. BROWNSTEIN: And that's the core of the argument. SHARPTON: But you guys lost the election a year ago, so I thinkthe American people have spoken on that... WILL: The Constitution is very picky about this. We keep havingelections. SHARPTON: Every four years. We have three left. WILL: Two years -- every two years. STEPHANOPOULOS: So are you worried about this wave, if EdGillespie -- is Ed Gillespie right, if this passes, that Democratscould lose the House? SHARPTON: I think that I'm concerned how it comes out. I thinkDee Dee is right. I don't think that it will out in the hard linesthat it is outlined. I'm sure that he will portray it that way. I think that it will not be that way, and I think that, at theend of the day, it will come down to what George Will just said. Americans will say, does government -- is the government's role toprotect us or to protect us against government? And I think moreAmericans have seen those that have had this rhetoric of protect usagainst government hasn't worked. STEPHANOPOULOS: That will have to be the last word. You guyshave a lot more to say. Say it in the green room."

It’s all so clear now,” he added.After the video started to go viral in ISIS cave networks and strongholds, thousands of terrorists began pouring out into the streets of Mayadin, giving one another spontaneous group hugs, destroying their weapons, and planting trees and flowers in an attempt to begin rebuilding the Middle East into a utopian wonderland.According to reports, al-Baghdadi further confirmed that a recent advertisement in which Kendall Jenner offered a group of riot police a Pepsi was also influential in his decision to immediately cease their murderous reign of terror and lead ISIS down a path of peace.TAGS

Gardner Selby on Wednesday, January 16th, 2013 at 3:06 p.m.Asked about restoring public education aid, Gov. Rick Perry suggested that’s the wrong question.According to a Jan. 9, 2013, Texas Tribune news story , Perry replied at a press conference earlier that day: ""We’ve had public education funding growing at three times the public education enrollment. So you’ve had a 70 percent increase of funding from 2002 to 2012. You've had a 23 percent increase in enrollment... I think under any scenario over the last decade, the funding that we have seen in the state of Texas for public education has been pretty phenomenal.""Those contrasting figures seemed surprising given that the revenue-strapped 2011 Legislature modified school finance formulas--sending schools $4 billion less than if the formulas had stayed the same--and also made other school funding cuts. We were mindful, too, of other flawed education spending claims. Of note, Republican lawmakers have said Texas did not cut such spending ( Pants on Fire ), that they raised education spending ( Pants on Fire ) and also that they raised education’s share of the budget ( Mostly True ).Enrollment increased about 20 percent from 2001-02 to 2011-12, from more than 4.1 million to nearly 5 million students, according to a December 2012 report by the Texas Education Agency. By email, agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe told us 2012-13 enrollment is expected to exceed 5 million, but the total has not been settled.And how much did spending increase or decrease during the period?To find out, we measured spending on public schools in two ways: how much spending from all sources--state, local and federal--changed and how much the state itself spent.Overall expendituresOverall school expenditures, counting state, local and federal sources, totaled $27.9 billion in 2002 and $44.2 billion in 2012, according to a chart from the Legislative Budget Board, which tracks fiscal issues for lawmakers.That makes for a difference of 58 percent, though that’s also before adjusting for inflation, which the board’s staff did by converting figures to 2004 dollars using an inflation adjuster devised by the federal government, the Implicit Price Deflator for State and Local Government.In 2004 dollars, Texas public school spending in 2002 totaled $30.1 billion. In 2012, the total was $33.3 billion--11 percent greater than in 2002.By this measure, then, it looks like school enrollment went up faster than spending.Then again, we learned, these figures were not behind Perry’s statement.State spending alonePerry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told us by email that Perry was referring to the difference in state education spending alone ""as those are the funds the state has control over.""The budget board’s chart shows $10.9 billion in state spending on the schools in 2002 and $18.9 billion in 2012, for a 73 percent difference, or a little more than Perry’s declared 70 percent.Adjusting for inflation, though, reduces the increase to 20 percent. In 2004 dollars, such spending was $14.2 billion in 2012, compared to $11.8 billion in 2002.Analyst Eva DeLuna Castro of the liberal Center for Public Policy Priorities and school lobbyist Lynn Moak, a former Texas Education Agency official, each pointed out another wrinkle, suggesting that any consideration of state education spending should take into account changes in law approved in 2006 resulting in the state picking up about $7 billion more in annual costs in return for school districts cutting local maintenance & operation property tax rates.Castro said by email: ""The property tax cut was $14.2 billion a biennium, or $7.1 billion every year. That means the state had to put in that amount of money a year to offset local property taxes falling by the same amount.""The shift in funding sources did not, in itself, step up aid received by the schools, Castro said.Moak said by phone: ""This was simply a source-of-funds transfer.""To adjust for the annual cost shift, we subtracted $7.1 billion from the state spending in 2012, suggesting a $0.9 billion difference from the 2002 spending. However, adjusting for inflation makes the 2012 state spending equal $8.2 billion in 2002 dollars--25 percent less than the $10.9 billion spent in 2002.We asked Frazier about taking inflation and the tax-swap law into consideration. She replied by email: ""The governor has laid out the accurate facts.""Our rulingPerry said education spending escalated more than three times as fast as enrollment from 2002 to 2012.We accept that he was talking about state education aid, which outpaced the 20 percent growth in enrollment by about the cited margin.But that’s without considering inflation and the impact of the annual tax swap set in motion by lawmakers and Perry, which drove up state spending without in itself delivering more school aid. Make those adjustments and it looks like Texas schools in 2012 fielded 25 percent less in state aid than what they fielded in 2002.We rate this claim as False.Advertisement"

Clinton attended a fundraising dinner on Saturday evening at the Studio City home of Clooney and his wife Amal, with Ellen DeGeneres, Jane Fonda, Anna Wintour and Jim Parsons among the attendees. The event was widely publicized, as the campaign held a contest to win tickets to the fete. At the event, Clinton floated between two head tables, one hosted by the Clooneys and another hosted by Katzenberg and his wife Marilyn. Others at the event included Jim Gianopulos, Tom Rothman and Bryan Lourd. In the afternoon, Clinton attended a smaller gathering at the Katzenbergs’ Beverly Hills home, where she was joined by Casey Wasserman, Haim Saban, the Clooneys, and Steven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw. All were cohosts. Also present: James Cameron, and George Lucas and his wife Mellody Hobson, according to source briefed on the event. It was largely kept under wraps until late Saturday afternoon. As supporters of Bernie Sanders staged a protest down the street, backers of Clinton emphasized that the bulk of the money raised would be going to the national and state Democratic party and benefit candidates across the country. About 150 people attended the events, with tickets priced at $33,400 per person. Co-hosts contributed $50,000, and event co-chairs contributed $353,000. Money went to the Hillary Victory Fund, a joint committee for the Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee and state party committees. The money is split between the entities — donors are limited to a maximum of $2,700 per person to the Clinton campaign and $33,400 per person to the DNC. Other funds went to state parties. According to a Clinton aide, she talked about “building on the progress we made under President Obama. An attendee at the Clooney event described Clinton as “completely enthusiastic,” as she talked about the Supreme Court, marriage equality, income inequality and mass incarceration. The Clooneys and Katzenberg each gave remarks before she spoke. “She spent more time talking about the dangers of Trump than beating up on Bernie,” an attendee said. Clinton also attended a $2,700-per-person event earlier in the day at the LINE Hotel in Koreatown, and a free campaign rally in the morning at Los Angeles Southwest College. This weekend, campaign of her rival for the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders, bought time to run an ad spot, called “$27,” on Los Angeles stations to contrast the average contribution to Sanders’ campaign to that of some of the high-dollar events that Clinton has held. Clooney himself agreed with Sanders’ criticism of the high dollar amounts being raised. “They’re absolutely right,” he told Chuck Todd. “It is an obscene amount of money. The Sanders campaign when they talk about it is absolutely right. It’s ridiculous that we should have this kind of money in politics. A group of Sanders supporters held their own fundraising event at a home just down the street from the Clooneys. Dubbed the “99% Party,” it was being held at the residence of Howard Gold — of the family that founded the 99 Cents store chain. Radio host Cary Harrison, actor Andrew Keegan and director Matthew Cooke were among the co-hosts, and contributions were $27 per person. About 110 Sanders supporters gathered in front of Gold’s home and lined both sides of huge street. As Clinton’s motorcade went by, they threw $1,000 in real dollar bills at the vehicles. After it passed, they danced in the street to “Dancing in the Streets” as Secret Service agents and LAPD officers looked on. Among those present was actress Frances Fisher, a longtime Sanders supporter who held a “Feel the Bern” sign. The view of many other Hollywood Democrats, however, is that as much as they decry money in politics, they are also pragmatic, and do not want to cede the money race to Republicans. Clinton has called for overturning Citizens United, the landmark 2010 Supreme Court decision that removed restrictions on unlimited outside spending in presidential contests. “The best way to get money out of politics is to elect Hillary Clinton,” said Andy Spahn, an organizer of the event whose consultancy firm represents some of the evening’s co-hosts, including Katzenberg and Spielberg. Jon Vein, the CEO of Marketshare who hosted Clinton at his home in February, noted that she was spending time raising for national and state parties, which will benefit candidates down ballot in November. That would benefit Sanders, too, if he were to be the nominee, he said. “Everybody there — if they could get money out of politics, they would,” he said.

Mark Kelly, Cardinal Donald WuerlThe following is a rush transcript of the March 31, 2013, edition of ""Fox News Sunday With Chris Wallace."" This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.CHRIS WALLACE, HOST: I'm Chris Wallace. The debate over gun control heats up.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: One hundred days after Newtown, Congress gets ready to vote on new measures to prevent mass shootings. But is the call to action starting to fade? We'll ask a leading voice in the debate, former astronaut Mark Kelly, husband of Gabrielle Giffords. It's a ""Fox News Sunday"" exclusive.Then, how will the new pope change the Catholic Church?

We'll ask our Sunday panel, have the fiery threats reached the danger point?And our Power Player of the Week -- the untold story of how a doctor saved the life of Ronald Reagan.All, right now, on ""Fox News Sunday.""(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: Hello, again, and happy Easter from Fox News in Washington.Well, after months of debate, the Senate is finally ready to vote on new gun control legislation. One of the people at the center of the issue is Mark Kelly, retired astronaut and Navy captain, and the husband of former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot two years ago.Captain Kelly joins us from Tucson, Arizona.Captain, after Newtown, there was national outrage over these acts of mass violence, but that has begun to change. CBS has a new poll, just after the massacre, 57 percent supported stricter gun controls. Now, that's down to 47 percent.And, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says the bill he'll introduce the week after next won't include a ban on assault weapons and won't include a limit on high capacity magazines.Question -- should President Obama have moved faster to bring it to a vote before the call for action began to fade?CAPTAIN MARK KELLY, (RET.) U.S. NAVY: Well, I think, after something like, you know, 20 first graders being murdered in their classrooms, you know, it is important to take action. And the American people are demanding action now. You know, the timeline of that, you know, sometimes, especially with a polarized Congress, these things can take a long time.But, it's clear -- and you say that, you know, there is less support and I want to address that for a second. When you use words like gun control, you know, gun control doesn't poll very well, but we do know that over 90 percent of Americans support a universal background check. And, there is incredible momentum in Congress and around the nation to get this done.WALLACE: Well, you say incredible momentum. Five Republican senators say that they are going to filibuster any additional gun restrictions. We have them up on the screen.What do you say, for instance, to Marco Rubio and Rand Paul?KELLY: Well, first, I would say to Marco Rubio that 94 percent of his constituents support a universal background check.For Senator Rand Paul, it's about 83 percent, in Kentucky. So, they should listen to their constituents and, certainly, shouldn't be getting in the way of the process, which is to debate the bill and to vote on the bill. I mean, that doesn't make any sense.And, I imagine that at some point, if they actually do this, that their constituents will hold them accountable for those actions.WALLACE: Why do you think there is, in polls -- I mean, there are a couple of things going on here. One, we see in the polls, diminishing support. Two, we see Harry Reid, who is, you know, the Senate majority leader, and he's not even going to include the high capacity magazines or the assault weapons ban in the bill. They'll be a vote of amendments, but they're not part of the bill. He says in the assault weapons ban, it wouldn't get 40 votes, let alone 60.What's going on?KELLY: Well, certainly, you know, in this country we have a very powerful gun lobby and the leadership of the NRA has done a very good job over many, many years of controlling the debate on this issue. But, one thing that is different now, is the fact that we had 20 first graders murdered in a classroom, along with six educators. I mean, that's unacceptable.And the American people, you know, want something done on this. You know, 92 percent of Americans support a universal background check. It's 74 percent of NRA members.I would hope at some point that the leadership of the NRA would just listen to their membership on this issue.WALLACE: We're going to get to the background check in a second. One last question about the Senate, because Republicans say they are going to offer an alternative bill that would crack down on gun trafficking and would beef up school safety. It would not include the background check or an assault weapons ban.What do you think of what's called the ""Grassley alternative""?KELLY: Well, you know, I think it is a mistake. Any bill that does not include a universal background check is a mistake. It's the most common-sense thing that we can do to prevent criminals and the mentally ill from having access to weapons.I mean, the system we have right now, we have 40 percent of all Americans who buy a gun, buy it without a background check and that's probably where most of the criminals and the mentally ill are going. I mean, we know from a poll that has been done with criminals in prison, that over 80 percent of them get them through that loophole.So, it would be a mistake not to address the thing that 92 percent of American households support and 74 percent of NRA members support, which is the universal background check.WALLACE: All right. Well, let's pick up on that, because the main feature of what is going to be in the Senate bill and what you are pushing and pushing today is the universal background check. This week, you went -- or rather, recently, a few weeks ago, you went to a gun store in the Arizona area, and bought a .45 caliber hand gun and afterwards discussed the background check you had to go through with your wife, Gabby.Let's take a look.KELLY: It was very easy to do. It took just like five minutes.FORMER REP. GABBY GIFFORDS, D-ARIZ.: Yes. Five minutes.KELLY: You know, that's all we have to do to make sure everybody has to get a background check before buying a gun, to make sure that criminals and the mentally ill can't get one.GIFFORDS: Universal background check.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Captain Kelly, what do you think that showed?KELLY: Well, you know, we went in there, my executive director (inaudible), the executive of our organization, and in five minutes and 36 seconds is the time it took to fill out one piece of paper. You only have to fill out one side for it to be submitted to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and get an answer. Five minutes and 36 seconds.So, what it shows you is that it is not the burden that the NRA leadership says, what a background check is. I mean, it's s a simple, common sense thing we can do to make sure criminals and the mentally ill can't have access to firearms.WALLACE: Well, let's talk about that, because, in Gabby's tragic case, the shooter, Jared Loughner, had been suspended from college, because he was deemed to be a threat to himself and to others. He went to a gun store, he got a gun, passed a background check. And, yet was able to go out and shoot Gabby and 18 other people.And, the NRA says the problem with the background check is that -- the kind of mental health information, for instance in Loughner's case, doesn't get passed on. So, it doesn't get to be part of the background check.KELLY: Well, it doesn't get passed on in a lot of cases. You know, you know, 19 states have included less than 100 records on mental illness into the NICS, into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. In the case of the shooter in Tucson, the information on his mental illness, that caused him to get expelled from community college, that should have been in the system. His admitted drug use to the U.S. Army, who rejected him, that should have been in the system.So he should have -- if we had, you know, a system -- if we improved the system, he would have been rejected from buying the gun in the gun store. Now, the other problem is, there's the other loophole, right? There's the records loophole, but there is the loophole that would allow him to go to a gun show, or on the Internet to buy a gun.And we need to prevent criminals and the mentally ill from doing that. It's crazy that we have a system -- you know, we have a system that responsible gun owners get a background check, and the option to avoid one is available for anybody who doesn't want to do it. I mean, it's a -- it's a crazy system.WALLACE: But doesn't the NRA have a point: if you're going to expand the background check and cover more people, don't you have to make sure the mental health information gets into the system, because otherwise it's kind of a waste of time?KELLY: They absolutely have a point. I mean, they are -- they are right on that issue.I mean, we need to encourage states to include the mental health records. After Virginia Tech, for instance, Virginia was one of the worst states on this. And after what happened in Virginia Tech, they're actually really, really good about getting those records to the federal government.So I'm encouraging -- I mean, I would love to be able to work with the leadership of the NRA and work with the United States Senate and the House to make sure we get those records in the system and then close the gun show and private seller loophole, like 92 percent of Americans want, like 74 percent of NRA members want.WALLACE: The big hold-up in the Senate now over the background check is that if you do expand it to include gun shows and private sales, do the people who sell the guns in those cases have to keep private records? Keep records of those sales? And as you well know, the NRA says the danger is that if they have to do what licensed dealers have to do and keep those records, that could be used to form a national registry and somewhere down the line, that could be used to confiscate people's guns.How do you respond to that?KELLY: Well, I just don't think it's logical. I mean, right now, when you buy a gun in a gun store like I did, you know, there is a record that remains with the gun store. It's not a record with the federal government. It is not a record that is going to one day lead to a national registry, or gun confiscation.So the system currently works with the federally licensed firearms dealers. There is no reason that same system cannot work with the gun show, and the private seller. But, of course, this is an issue for many, you know, some Republican senators. And it's certainly something that could be worked on. I mean, we've got a lot of smart members in the Senate and I think they can figure out a compromise on this issue.WALLACE: Finally, Arizona officials this week released a lot of records about the shooter, Jared Loughner, the man who shot Gabby and 18 others. His parents, it turns out, knew he was deeply disturbed. They tested him for drugs, but they did not send him to get help.What do you have to say after learning all of this to Jared Loughner's parents?KELLY: Well, certainly as a parent, myself, I understand. I mean, it is a tragic thing they went through as well. It would have been an entirely different situation, however, if he would have gotten some mental health -- you know, gotten an evaluation. And when he -- you know, certainly in his case, when he's taking medication, he's not as psychotic as without the medication.So, this would have clearly been -- would not have happened if he would have had proper mental health treatment, you know? But you can't -- you know, you can't go back in time. I mean, there's -- you know, the only thing we can do is move forward and try to make sure that the dangerously mentally ill are not only getting treatment for their mental illness, but let's make sure they don't have access to guns. Let's make sure criminals don't have access to guns.I mean, our organization, Americans for Responsible Solutions -- I mean, we are really focused on this, every, single day. To make sure we fix this problem, and we address gun violence in this country.WALLACE: I just want to pick up on that last point, because after Newtown, there was a lot of talk about making it easier for authorities, a school or a family to commit a Jared Loughner, an Adam Lanza, the Newtown shooter before they got access to guns and acted out in this horrible way. But, that seems to have been forgotten in all of the debate about gun control.KELLY: Well, I don't know if it has been forgotten. I mean, certainly, you know, the debate in the Senate is going to -- going to include some aspect of help for the mentally ill. Now, what that is, you know, I'm not -- you know, I don't know what those details -- how that's going to turn out but that is certainly an important component of this. I mean, to address mental illness in this country, to get those records of mental illness into the system and then to make sure that there isn't a loophole where the clearly dangerously and mentally ill and criminals can get access to a gun.WALLACE: Captain Kelly, we want to thank you. Thank you for joining us. And we want to wish you and your wife, Gabby, the very best, sir.KELLY: Thank you, and, happy Easter, Chris.WALLACE: Happy Easter to you.Up next on this Easter Sunday, we'll discuss the new pope and the challenges he faces as we talk with one of the men who elected him, Washington's cardinal, Donald Wuerl.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Today at the Vatican, Pope Francis celebrated his first Easter mass as leader of the world's 1 billion Catholics. In the traditional Easter message, the pope called for a political solution to the civil war in Syria, as well as peace on the Korean peninsula.As his papacy begins, Francis has set a humble tone in contrast to the corruption and scandal in some parts of the church. But, how much does the new pope intend to shake things up?Earlier, I asked the archbishop of Washington, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, what he thinks Pope Francis will do.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: Your Eminence, happy Easter and welcome back to ""Fox News Sunday.""CARDINAL DONALD WUERL, ARCHBISHOP OF WASHINGTON: Thank you. It's great to be back.WALLACE: From the moment he took the world stage, Pope Francis talked about serving the poorest, the weakest, the least important. On Holy Thursday, he followed the tradition of washing the feet of 12 people. But instead of 12 priests as other popes have done, he washed and kissed the feet of a dozen young inmates, including women and Muslims.Question -- what message is the pope sending about what he is going to do?WUERL: I think his message is a very clear one, that you bear witness with words, but you also bear witness with actions. And I think what he is trying to say to all of us is, if we really are trying to introduce people to the gospel, if we are really trying to tell believers how important the gospel is, can't you do that as well, maybe even better, with actions as well as words. I think that's what he's trying to do.WALLACE: There is a widespread sense that the church has problems, governance problems. That there is corruption inside the church, that there are turf wars. One of the first things the pope has to deal with is that secret investigative report about the Vatican leaks.Why did the cardinals believe that Pope Francis was the right man to clean things up?WUERL: I think there are probably a couple of ideas that were going around as we were talking about who might be the next pope, who would be the best person to choose. One, when we talk about the church, we also want to make sure that we distinguish it from just the operation of the Vatican. I think we were concerned about who will keep the momentum of the new evangelization going and who will keep this energy the church is seeing among many of our young people around the world. Who will keep that going?At the same time, somebody has to address the administration of the Holy See. Somebody has to take a look at what is working and what isn't working. I can't tell you what that means, because we didn't have the report. But the very fact that we recognize there needs to be some change, that was a part of the thinking.Can you -- can you envision someone better than Pope Francis? The credibility he brings to whatever he decides, in the Vatican, is going to be enormous. But, in the meantime, he is keeping the focus on the rest of the church, where there is an awful lot of good going on.WALLACE: But on the inside game, how aggressive a reformer, how revolutionary, if you will, do you expect Pope Francis to be -- not on doctrine -- but on changing the way the church does business?WUERL: Well, perhaps we're seeing signs of it in the fact that he hasn't moved in to the papal residence, that he's chosen to stay in the residence where we all were for the conclave. Maybe he's simply saying, there are going to be a lot of changes, we're going to get back to something that will be a little more direct, and maybe contact with the pope will be a little easier.And that was one of the things that we cardinals talked about -- the need to find ways in which there is a lot more communication between the rest of the church and the pope.WALLACE: All right. You were there. We saw all of the pictures. Take us inside. This is your first conclave. Take us inside the Sistine Chapel. They closed the doors, the 115 cardinal electors are all there and you are choosing the head of church, for 1.2 billion, 1.3 billion Catholics.What is that moment like?WUERL: There is a solemnness that I really wasn't prepared to experience as fully. When you hear that door closing, you hear it, and the -- that bolt is locked, then you realize, this is really a liturgy. We're all -- we're all wearing what we would wear if we were presiding at a mass, somewhere. Not as the celebrant but simply as a cardinal.This absolute silence -- and the one thing you are supposed to be doing is listening with your heart. Before I went in, I talked to one of the older cardinals, he's 90 years old. He came to one of those general meetings, just so we could chat. I have known him for 40 years.And I said to him, ""Cardinal, I am feeling a little bit overwhelmed by all of this."" He said, ""When you get into the Sistine Chapel and they close that door, just listen with your heart. And you'll hear.""And it turned out to be true. There is a solemn oath you take, and, then, Chris, when the moment comes to write a name on the ballot. There is nobody there but you and, I like to think, the Holy Spirit, guiding that pen.WALLACE: I'm fascinated. There were five ballots. Obviously, the fifth ballot you chose the pope. After a ballot, and they tell you, so-and-so, Bergoglio, Pope Francis has so many votes. Do you mill about and talk and --WUERL: No. This is the interesting thing. They count the ballots and that in itself is rather solemn. Three people look at each ballot, and go through the whole thing, so -- once it's clear no one was elected, nothing is said.There is this moment, quiet, and then, you just write another name on the next ballot. It is as if the Holy Spirit is saying, look, now you know the direction, OK. You're going to have to -- you're going to have to whittle this down.This is the power of the part, though, Chris, you have your ballot in your hand and you have to stand there in front of that fresco of the last judgment, and say, ""I call on Christ the Lord, who will come to judge me that this ballot is for the person I believe should serve and lead the church."" And it's really powerful.But, there is no milling about. There is no discussion. There -- it's altogether different than anything that you and I have experienced in our life here, politically. There are no nominations, no candidates. It's all open to the action of the spirit.WALLACE: Not exactly like pulling the lever on election day.The big story in Washington, this week, as you well know has been the Supreme Court's consideration of the issue of same sex marriage. If the court finds that there is a constitutional right, what will you say to gays, who are good Catholics, attend church every week, who say, who believe that God made them that way, and who want to commit to a partner?WUERL: We are always welcoming of everyone. The Catholic Church welcomes everyone.But, the Catholic Church also reminds all of us, there is a moral law. There are commandments of God, and we have to do our best to live by them. We announce that from the pulpit and, we try to meet people where they are and walk with them in life's journey.The church is probably, with 20 centuries of experience, probably the most understanding of the human condition of any institution. But, at the same time it does remind, not only gay people, but heterosexual people, straight people, you're not supposed to be following a moral law apart from what Christ has said to us.We do that all the time --WALLACE: So, specifically, what do you say, what would you say to the good, gay Catholic?WUERL: I think we try to work with them, whatever situation they find themselves in. The goal is to hold them as close to the church and to Christ and the sacraments as possible. A lot depends on how well we're able to communicate, how well we're able in a pastoral situation to look at each person's life and see where we are.WALLACE: So, you would allow him to continue in the church but you would not recognize his marriage?WUERL: We do that with people who are married, divorced and remarried. We say you are still part of the family, but we can't recognize that second marriage. We do that, we've done that -- and it has never been a great problem.It's painful for all of us to have to realize that making our way through life is difficult and, that we can't always be as perfect as away would like to be. I look to the church to say to me, look, walk as close to Christ as you can. That's why we are here. Come to mass. Participate in the life of the church.WALLACE: I want to ask you about the legal situation. Canada legalized same sex marriage in 2005 and there have been legal problems. There was a case of a Knights of Columbus hall that had agreed to hold a reception for a married couple, until they found out that it was a same sex couple and they had to pay a fine.And there are questions, about a Catholic university that has housing for married couples, what are they going to do if it's a same sex couple. How is the church and the -- writ large, not just the church but the whole religious institution, how is it going to deal with that and doesn't it get a little bit to the issue you have with the administration, about the mandate of insurance policies, including birth control?WUERL: Shouldn't there be enough space in a society as pluralistic and free as America is to be able to work all of these things out in a way that everybody can be who they are, and carry on their activities?I'm thinking for example when we talk about changing the definition of marriage. There is going to have to be a lot of adjusting, because the whole world has always understood marriage is the word you use to describe when a man and a woman commit to each other for the rest of their lives, and generate and educate children. Once you change that arbitrarily, there is going to be downstream from that, all kinds of questions. We're going to have to deal with them one by one as we come to them and that's why the church keeps saying, make room for everyone's faith.The only thing I worry about is someone saying to see, you, because you believe that sex is intended for marriage, and because you believe that marriage is undissolvable and because you believe that marriage is between a man and a woman, that somehow you don't belong here, that somehow this is -- this is bigotry or this is hate speech. That's what I worry about.There has to be room enough in the society as large, as free and as pluralistic as America, to make space for all of us.WALLACE: Finally, for all of the controversies, this is Easter which has a very joyous meaning. What is your message, your Easter message, for our viewers.WUERL: The Easter message for every Christian is Christ is risen and that's we say, hallelujah, come to mass. But for the rest of the world, Easter is also a reminder of hope. There is always hope, individually, collectively, societally, we should never give up hope that we can make things better. That's the story of Easter.For the believer, it's hallelujah. For everyone else, it should be -- there is hope, there is a possibility to make it a better world.WALLACE: And it's a beautiful spring and flowers are blooming, and all is right with the world.Cardinal, Thank you so much.WUERL: You are very welcome. Thank you, Chris.(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE: The archbishop of Washington, Cardinal Donald Wuerl.Up next, a threat to peace in the Pacific. We'll ask our Sunday group how serious is North Korea's drumbeat of war?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHUCK HAGEL, DEFENSE SECRETARY: ... their very provocative actions. And belligerent tone. It has ratcheted up the danger.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel responding to North Korea's threat of war against the U.S. and South Korea. And, it is time now for our Sunday group. Bill Kristol of ""The Weekly Standard."" Mara Liasson of National Public Radio. Republican strategist Ed Gillespie and Charles Lane of ""The Washington Post."" Well, Kim Jong- un, the young leader of North Korea, was quoted Friday as ordering his missile units to be ready to strike the U.S. and South Korea, and this photo was released. Kim meeting with top North Korean generals with a chart showing the trajectory of their missiles, hitting major American cities. Bill, what is Kim's game?BILL KRISTOL, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Who knows, but it's not good. I mean, they've murdered, starved millions of their own people, that regime, and now -- and they proliferated nuclear weapons. And don't forget, the Israeli strike on the Syrian nuclear weapons plant in 2007, that was given to them by North Korea. So, even if you discount North Korea, oh, they are containable, they are not going to destroy their regime by attacking us, they can proliferate weapons of mass destruction, they can proliferate nuclear weapons and missiles and guess what? Iran and North Korea have this dark relationship and North Korea is short of cash, it could sell these weapons to terrorist groups. So, the threat of North Korea is very real.WALLACE: And why do you think they are ratcheting up - he is ratcheting up the tension?KRISTOL: Well, the normal explanation is that it helps stabilize and, you know, helps secure his situation at home -- maybe that is true. But the degree to which, you know, they've created -- he might think he's being playing two games, like his father and his grandfather did, I guess, and, you know, they can pull back at the key moment. But, you know, South Korea and Japan are sitting there, nervous -- he killed South Koreans just about two years ago, three years ago, they killed, what, 45 South Korean sailors, attacked their ship. I mean, Japan, they lobbed a missile over Japan. It's dangerous.WALLACE: Yeah, let me pick up on that, Mara. Because the North Koreans traditionally, as Bill points out like to bluster and saber- rattle, but even by their standards, this is pretty extreme what is going on now, and that is the concern, that somehow particularly with South Korean, if you've ever been in Seoul, I mean it is an hour's drive from the DMZ. I mean they would be right on the front line. The danger is it gets out of hand.MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: The danger is it gets out of hand. And that crazy map behind Kim Jong-un, which showed the lines of the missiles hitting the mainland of the United States and exposing their, quote, battle plans, that might be a fantasy, but they can do tremendous damage to South Korea, and he's announced also that the armistice doesn't hold anymore. They are back in a state of war. Nobody knows exactly what he wants to do. I don't even know if he knows what he wants to do, but yes, it is a really dangerous situation, and I don't think the United States has a clear idea of what to do to stop him.WALLACE: Well, let's talk, Ed, about the U.S. response. Because first, Chuck Hagel, the defense secretary announced that we are beefing up our missile defense along the border with Alaska and then this week -- in Alaska, again, along the border with Russia, and, then, this week we sent, as you can see there -- a pair of B-2 stealth bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons, all the way from Missouri to military exercises over South Korea. Ed, sensible reaction by the Pentagon or over-reaction?ED GILLESPIE, FMR. ROMNEY CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER: No, I think it's a sensible reaction. And I think in addition to that, it would be good for the administration to not only bolster our own missile defense, but to support Japan and South Korea with missile defense. I think, to Bill's point, they are nervous, understandably, and I think doing anything -- everything we can to reassure them would be helpful, and, obviously, you know, trying to get China to engage in their own region in a way that would be helpful, I think, with Kim Jong-un would be important, too.WALLACE: I'm going to pick up on China in a second. Your thoughts, though, Chuck about the U.S. response. What we have done so far, what more we can do?CHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST: Well, I think President Obama's approach to North Korea throughout his presidency has been, essentially, not to rise to the bait, and I think that has been a good approach so far. I think sending the B-2s sent a strong signal.I think what we are dealing with here is sort of the third generation of a family business over there in North Korea, and the business is building up this whole military structure, building up as Bill suggests, the capability to proliferate. Conducting terrorist activities. People forget that years ago they blew up a whole group of South Korean diplomats in Burma of all places. And the purpose of the family business is through the constant threat, constant belligerence, constant menace, to extract money, concessions, and everything else you can get by blackmailing the other side. Whether the endgame of the family business is to actually go to war in South Korea, I doubt, because I think people are -- need to remember, North Korea would not win that war. At the very least would come out of it very badly damaged. So, I think what we are seeing here is a generation of war hysteria to help control themselves inside and the generation of threats, especially towards this new, more conservative, less concession-minded government in South Korea to see what they can extract. As they have now for 20 years since this nuclear issue began.WALLACE: You know, one of the concerns here, and that does seem to be different, Bill, is that North Korea seems to be ignoring the warnings from its main, far and away biggest sponsor, China, which had warned the regime and Kim Jong-un not to make these threats against the United States, not to make these threats against South Korea, and yet it proceeded with them. Why would Kim risk alienating the country that literally, you know -- talk about biting the hand that feeds you, that literally feeds its people?KRISTOL: Well, China never seemed to really have been willing to pull the trigger and stop feeding his people or stop providing other kinds of aid to North Korea, so they've gotten away with this in the past, and the Chinese have been unwilling to risk undermining -- allowing the North Korean regime to be undermined and to fall with the unified Korea. And I think that's dangerous to them. I don't know why, Korea isn't going to invade China, but nonetheless, they want to preserve -- they don't want the East European model of communist regimes falling on their border.The U.S., what can we do? We can get serious about missile defense. We spend about 1.5 percent of our defense budget on missile defense. The Obama administration having canceled the ground base interceptors, then restored them just, what, a couple of weeks ago, and said we're going ahead on it. But basically, under both parties, really, but especially under the Democrats, there's been a sort of very haphazard (inaudible) through to President Reagan's announcement 30 years ago. The (inaudible) made a decision, really, and maybe we should try to defend ourselves from nuclear weapons and not just accept them as inevitable. And I think in a post-Cold War world, we don't know, the North Korean regime could be ten or 20 years from now, and they could have many more missiles and many more nuclear weapons and they could be proliferating them. I'm not sure we'll find them or the Israelis will know whether they have proliferated. Don't we want to get serious and spend some real money and really invest in serious missile defense for ourselves and our neighbors?(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Ed, the president has kind of flipped on missile defense.GILLESPIE: Yeah.WALLACE: Because when he first came in, he pulled back on some of the deployment of anti-missile interceptors. Now, one of his first steps, he and Chuck Hagel at the Pentagon, was to beef up our interceptors system up along the Alaska coast.GILLESPIE: Yeah, and like I said, they should be commended for that. I'll take one exception, Bill, I'm not -- I think President Bush did make a priority of missile defense, and one of the first things that the Obama administration did was to reverse that, and now they've reversed themselves again, understanding that there was a reason for it, an important strategic reason for it, and I'm glad they reversed themselves. I wish they hadn't reversed themselves in the first place or reverse the policy in the first place, but we have -- this is an example of why we need missile defense, and we need for our friends to have it as well.WALLACE: All right. We have to take a break here, but when we come back, after this week's historic Supreme Court hearings on same sex marriage, where does the issue stand now?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SUPREME COURT JUSTICE SAMUEL ALITO: You want us to step in and render a decision based on an assessment of the effects of this institution, which is newer than cell phones or the Internet? I mean we -- we are not -- we do not have the ability to see the future.SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ELENA KAGAN: Supposed the states said, because we think that the focus of marriage really should be on procreation we are not going to give marriage licenses anymore to any couple where both people are over the age of 55. Would that be constitutional?(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Supreme Court Justices Samuel Alito and Elena Kagan differing on whether the court should intervene in the issue of same sex marriage. We're back now with the panel. So, at the end of a rare two days of arguments, Bill, where do you think the court is on the constitutional question of same sex marriage, and also, on the Defense of Marriage Act, which denies federal benefits to same sex couples, who have been legally married in their states?KRISTOL: I mean, it looks as if the court will strike down part of the Defense of Marriage Act, on sort of federalism grounds, and ...WALLACE: But it's a state issue, not a federal issue.KRISTOL: Right, and the federal government in a way is putting a thumb on the scale by preferring traditional marriage to states that -- by preferring states that have chosen traditional marriage over states that have chosen same sex marriage, and it looks as if the court is not going to impose a universal constitutional right to same sex marriage on the nation. And I hope they don't, and I -- I think they won't.WALLACE: Do you think that they will leave Prop 8 alone and, just, let's say, deny it on procedural grounds, the plaintiff didn't have standing or do you think that they might decide, yes, Prop 8 either stands or falls in California, but that doesn't impact other states.KRISTOL: Yeah, I can't - I can't tell it, it is hard to read. And maybe others know better than I do what the court is going to do.WALLACE: All right, we'll go down the list. Down the row here and see. But, one of the points, Mara, that several justices made, is that public opinion is changing so quickly on this issue, both in the polls and, four states in 2012 legalized same sex marriage, that perhaps the court should stay out of it, and leave it to the political process in the states. In that sense, could the supporters of same sex marriage be victims of their own success?LIASSON: Yes. I think they could and I actually think the best outcome for Democrats and even proponents of same sex marriage is if Prop 8 is upheld in California, but there is no sweeping constitutional finding that same sex marriage is legal all over the country, because ...WALLACE: Well, if Prop 8 is upheld, that means that same sex marriage is banned.LIASSON: No, I'm sorry, Prop 8 is -- the lower court ruling is upheld, which means Prop 8 is overturned.WALLACE: OK.LIASSON: I'm sorry about that. But if they want to in California, right now they could back and put up Prop 8.2, legalizing same sex marriage and it would probably pass, it is a lot more meaningful and profound to kind of adjudicate divisive social issues by voters and legislators, not unelected justices, and I think that it's going to be more lasting political change if you do it at the ballot box. It also means you're not going to have this huge backlash and I agree with Bill, I don't think the court is going in the direction of legalizing same sex marriage on the national constitutional basis.WALLACE: Ed, let's talk about the politics of this. You, of course, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, isn't this a problem for the GOP? As we say, public opinion is moving in the direction of support for same sex marriage, especially among young people, 70, 80 percent of all people of all persuasions, under the age of 35, 40, support same sex marriage as a legal right. But the polls show that Republicans still overwhelmingly oppose it, only 27 percent in one poll, I saw, support same sex marriage. So, where does the Republican Party go? You have an awful lot of your base still very much opposes this. But you can see the pendulum swinging for the country.GILLESPIE: Chris, I don't see the Republican Party or most Republicans, obviously, changing in terms of believing that marriage is between one man and one woman. I do think that in the context of this debate, as in so many other debates, Republicans have been cast in the negative, you know - in the negative to say we are opposing something as opposed to talking about what most Republicans are for. Most Republicans are also for the benefits of marriage in the legal system, that are afforded, the protections like, for example, visitation - hospital visitation rights or survivorship benefits and I think you will hear more Republicans making that point, that we can do those things without having the government sanction same sex marriage.WALLACE: But looking at the polls, and, particularly, looking at where younger people are going, would you have any problems in 2016, with a Republican Party platform saying that marriage is between a man and a woman?GILLESPIE: I wouldn't have any problem with that. I think one of the questions is, I believe the platform right now calls for a federal constitutional amendment to ban it. You know, there may be a debate about that.WALLACE: (inaudible) ban same sex marriage.GILLESPIE: Yeah, to ban it. I don't think you would ever see the Republican Party platform saying we are in favor of same sex marriage, but there may be a question, because I think to Mara's point, the federalism aspect of this Supreme Court debate has been interesting, and because a lot of conservatives have felt for a long time that Roe was wrongfully decided and imposed ...WALLACE: Roe v. Wade.GILLESPIE: Roe v. Wade.WALLACE: 1973.GILLESPIE: And that the issue of abortion should have been left to the states, for people to hash out in a more civil manner.A lot of conservatives found themselves arguing in this instance that the court shouldn't impose a federal mandate that it is legal. So there has been a little bit of a shift I think in terms of Republicans saying we should allow this to be worked out in the states not imposed by courts and not imposed federally. And, it will be interesting to see how that shakes up, because the platform as it is today says a federal constitutional amendment to ban it.WALLACE: We should point out it isn't just conservatives who feel that Roe was wrong in this particular issue, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a justice of the Supreme Court appointed by Democrats, liberal, very much an abortion rights supporter, says she thinks it was a mistake, because she thought it moved the court too quickly in this direction in a judicial fiat instead of leaving it to the states to work out something that they were working out. Chuck, when you listened to what you three learned colleagues, your fellow justices here on the court, say, your thoughts about the debate this week, where it leaves the issue and the political implications.LANE: Well, as to the debate, not to sounds Pollyanish, but I thought it was actually refreshing and useful for the whole country to listen to two days of discussion among nine very intelligent people of various views who are not running for office, you know? And who aren't obsessed with the short-term political consequences of these things themselves, but are really sort of wrestling with it in a very serious way, and in that regard I think it was a very, very helpful occasion in the whole debate. Because they've had the sort of guts to go through a whole lot of difficult questions, you know, about, is this really just like interracial marriage? What are the social science consequences and so forth.But I think what is crystallizing as a result of this is a distinction is developing between the substance of whether this is a good idea or not, and the process of how we as a country are going to decide. And, in that respect, I do think there is a -- a kind of a tentative consensus on the court that the procedural - the optimum way to handle it is to let the states decide, to give more time to the democratic process to work this thing out as opposed to having the judicial branch sort of slice through the Gordian knot --WALLACE: But what about the argument? For the sake of argument, what about the argument, look, we don't decide constitutional rights ...LANE: Right.WALLACE: ... that way. We don't decide whether schools can be segregated that way. We don't decide interracial marriage that way.LANE: I think the answer, I've heard from the court was, we're not ready to say this is a constitutional right. That there isn't enough support in the text of the document or in the precedence of this court to say that without same sex marriage every state in the union is violating the Constitution.WALLACE: Thank you, panel. See you next week and don't forget to check out panel-plus. Where our group picks right up with the discussion on our Web site, FoxNewsSunday.com, we'll post the video before noon eastern time, and make sure to follow us on Twitter @FoxnewsSunday.Up next, our Power Player of the Week.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Of course, this is Easter Sunday. But, it was also 32 years ago, this weekend, a gunman tried to kill Ronald Reagan. Today, a story you have never heard before. About how a doctor saved the president's life with what he believes was some divine help. Here's our Power Player of the Week.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. SAM SPAGNOLO, GWU & VA MEDICAL CENTER: And they said we need you to come over to the hospital right away.WALLACE: That was how Dr. Sam Spagnolo learned 32 years ago he was about to take on the case of his life. He was the head of the lung department at George Washington University Hospital. And Ronald Reagan, who had sustained a gunshot to the lung, was in the operating room. SPAGNOLO: The bullet went through here and lodged over here on the inner surface of the lung, so another inch or two and it would have been into the heart.WALLACE: Spagnolo first saw the president when he was wheeled into the recovery room.SPAGNOLO: And we put him on the ventilator right away and he was getting some sedation and I stayed there until we finally got him off the ventilator, about 3 o'clock in the morning.WALLACE: The doctor says Reagan did well in the first couple of days, his condition serious, but not critical, then things changed. Spagnolo kept a diary he's making public for the first time.SPAGNOLO: Day five, April 3rd, 1981. I was called at home and requested a return to the hospital. I arrived at the presidential suite and asked the nurse in charge what was going on. She told me the president's temperature was almost 104 degrees and he was not looking well. That made all of us a little nervous about which way this was going to go.WALLACE (on camera): When you said which way this was going to go, was his life is danger?SPAGNOLO: At that point I thought his life was in danger.WALLACE: That's got to take your breath away.SPAGNOLO: It did.WALLACE (voice over): Spagnolo ordered a battery of tests, to check for infection. But the president's medical team resisted.SPAGNOLO: Things were going a little slower than I'd hoped.WALLACE (on camera): So, what did you say?SPAGNOLO: If we don't get movement, I'm not - I'm going to walk off this case.WALLACE (voice over): The other doctors agreed to the tests, but they found no sign of infection. Still, Spagnolo was convinced that was the problem. And put Reagan on antibiotics. Within 24 hours, his temperature went down.WALLACE (on camera): Honestly, 30 years later, what do you think would have happened if you had not intervened and given him this broad dose of antibiotics.SPAGNOLO: He might not have gotten better.WALLACE (voice over): Spagnolo sat by the president's bedside in the morning for the next two weeks, watching TV and listening to his stories. There was no mention of politics.SPAGNOLO: Day nine, Tuesday, April 7th -- I went to the president's room and spoke with him for 10 to 15 minutes. He looked better and his spirits were good.

Gardner Selby on Thursday, May 9th, 2013 at 6:38 p.m.Gov. Rick Perry ran this advertisement in the Austin American-Statesman on May 9, 2013, to welcome President Barack Obama to town.In a May 9, 2013, advertisement, Gov. Rick Perry offered President Barack Obama a ""handy checklist"" about job creation to take back to Washington, D.C.The ad, which Perry’s campaign placed in the Austin American-Statesman the day Obama came to Austin to stress economic issues, said the checklist includes low taxes, lawsuit abuse reform, predictable and effective regulations, balanced budgets and accountable schools and a competitive workforce.And an indicator that the ""Texas model"" works, the ad said, is that while the U.S. lost 2.5 million net new jobs over the past five years, Texas created 530,000 net new jobs. Also, the ad said: ""Over the last 10 years, Texas created 33 percent of the net new jobs nationwide.""Texas has had a healthy economy compared with most other states. Still, we were curious if one in three of the nation’s net new jobs over the past 10 years was gained in Texas.By email, Perry spokesman Josh Havens referred to information attributed to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicating that Texas reaped more than 1.75 million net new jobs from March 2003 to March 2013, a period in which the United States as a whole accounted for 5.3 million net new jobs, Havens said.To our inquiry, a regional economist for the bureau, Cheryl Abbot, confirmed the net job gain figures provided by Havens. According to a spreadsheet she emailed our way, Texas topped 42 states with net job gains in the period, considerably outdistancing the No. 2 jobs-gainer, New York, which had a net gain of 458,000 jobs. States with net losses were Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio and Rhode Island.Among the states, Texas had the third-greatest percentage gain in jobs over the decade, 19 percent, trailing North Dakota (33 percent increase) and Utah (21 percent), the spreadsheet indicates.By email and in a telephone interview, though, Abbot said the bureau steers clear of using its employment estimates to declare how much of any national job gains are attributable to net job gains in individual states. That judgment has to do with technical difficulties comparing the results of surveys undertaken state by state to research intended to have national sweep, she said.Regardless, she said, ""Texas has been a very powerful job creator; during the period, the state created 1.75 million net jobs – and that was equal to one-third of the net jobs created nationwide,"" which is slightly different from saying the state accounted for 33 percent of national net jobs gained.We sent Perry’s office the bureau’s standing cautionary note about using its figures to reach conclusions about how much each state contributes to national job gains. Havens replied: ""The bottom line is, this is the most accurate way available to compare any single state’s job growth to the nation as a whole.""We also tried a different way of gauging the degree that Texas job gains fit the national picture by adding up each state’s net job gains as estimated by the bureau. This delivered a slightly higher total for national jobs gained, 5.5 million. Dividing the 1.75 million net jobs gained in Texas into the higher total leaves Texas accounting for 32 percent of the nation’s net jobs gained.We also asked Jason Abrevaya, who chairs the University of Texas Department of Economics, to review the bureau figures. He said by email that they seem to hold up. If Texas had been performing at the average nationwide from 2003 to 2013, he added, one ""would expect the state to account for roughly 8 percent,"" rather than 33 percent, of the net job changes, since Texas accounts for about 8 percent of the nation’s jobs.Our rulingPerry said: ""Over the last 10 years, Texas created 33 percent of the net new jobs nationwide."" That conclusion is supported by comparing state-by-state job gain estimates and a separate calculation of net job gains nationally, both by the federal government. This might be an imperfect way to explore this facet, but there also don't appear to be better approaches.We rate the claim as True.Advertisement"

Their cartoonish ad shows a smiling headshot of Frankel and makes a series of claims about her tenure as mayor. Here is part of the script:""Frankel took a 40 percent pay raise with our money. We lost jobs,"" says the narrator while the text on the screen states ""West Palm Beach lost jobs."" The ad then continues: ""Frankel flew from a posh country club to a party across town in a police helicopter. You sat in traffic. Frankel went on a spending spree resulting in a budget deficit. You? Higher taxes to pay for it. $13,000 in taxpayer money for a designer marble bathroom in Frankel's office.""You can read here about a TV station pulling the ad over a dispute about the word ""deficit."" (A spokesman for the PAC told us that a new version omits the word ""deficit"" and that some other stations didn’t object to the original version.)For this fact-check, we will examine whether Frankel took a 40 percent pay raise while West Palm Beach lost jobs.2004 pay raiseThe ad doesn’t explain when Frankel -- who served as mayor from 2003 to 2011 -- took that 40 percent pay raise. A spokesman for the PAC said the pay raise referred to 2004 and sent us quotes from Palm Beach Post articles that year.We will pull information from those articles:In January 2004, Frankel formed a committee to explore whether she and commissioners should get a pay raise. She said she was forming the committee because the city code required an annual review of all employee salaries. At the time, the city foresaw a budget shortfall of $110,000 -- the prior year it had a $2 million shortfall.The committee recommended increasing the mayor’s salary and the city commission obliged. (We were unable to quickly obtain the committee’s report or commission meeting minutes ourselves from a city spokesman so we relied on the Post’s articles about it.)On July 6, 2004, the city commission unanimously voted to raise Frankel’s salary from $89,250 to $125,000 effective Oct. 1. That’s an increase of about $35,750 or 40 percent. The last time the mayor received a raise was 1998, the Post wrote.Frankel didn’t vote on the pay raise, her campaign said. The city has a strong mayor form of government in which the mayor votes to break a tie, which wasn’t necessary in this case.The Post wrote that Frankel’s new salary would place her in the middle range compared with other strong mayors. (Strong mayors tend to earn higher salaries than other mayors because strong mayors are the chief executive.) The city commissioners received a smaller pay boost.(PolitiFact Florida contacted a couple other large cities with strong mayors and found these annual salaries in 2004: Tampa, $135,000; St. Petersburg $110,334.)An analyst in the city’s human resources department told us that Frankel’s annual salary remained at $125,000 from 2004 through 2011.Frankel’s response about the pay raiseFrankel doesn’t dispute that she got that pay raise.""The city commission voted unanimously to adopt the recommendations of a blue-ribbon committee that called for raising the salaries of West Palm Beach's elected officials to be more competitive,"" wrote Frankel spokesman Joshua Karp. He cited this sentence from a Palm Beach Post article: The blue-ribbon committee ""said the mayor’s pay hadn’t kept pace with the demands of the job in a fast-growing city.""But as for the second half of the claim -- while West Palm Beach ""lost jobs"" -- Frankel points to some different statistics about employment than those sent to us by the PAC.Were taxpayers losing their own jobs while paying Frankel a higher paycheck?The ad says that West Palm Beach lost jobs as Frankel’s own taxpayer-funded paycheck soared.A spokesman for the PAC sent us data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics about the unemployment rate starting in March 2003 when Frankel took office and through her tenure in March 2011 and beyond. But that data was for the entire metropolitan area, which extends beyond the city boundaries.We looked at Local Area Unemployment Statistics data for just the city of West Palm Beach. That showed the unemployment rate rose from 5.8 percent in March 2003 to 10.2 percent in March 2011. Frankel’s tenure overlapped with the national recession -- the rise in unemployment wasn’t unique to her city.But during her tenure, the number of employed workers also rose -- from 42,876 to 44,848. (Her campaign cited some regional figures showing growth in the number of employed people.)So while it’s true that unemployment rose, the number of employed workers also rose.We interviewed Sean Snaith, an economist at the University of Central Florida about the unemployment statistic emphasized by one side and the employment figures emphasized by the other. Both are important to get a picture of the labor market, he said.""You can't cherry-pick your favorite statistic and point to that and have it as definitive evidence,"" he said. ""Neither is superior.""The unemployment rate relates to the number of unemployed people relative to the labor force. That means if some unemployed people give up looking for work, the employment rate can improve even though in reality the situation hasn’t improved.Generally speaking, city mayors can’t take much of the blame or credit for unemployment or employment.""There is only so much (mayors) can do when financial markets are in disarray, and the housing market has imploded,"" Snaith said. ""I don’t care how adept you are at sweet-talking businesses.""If we thought that Frankel should take the blame for the unemployment spike during part of her tenure then we’d also have to give her credit for the drop in annual unemployment to below 4 percent between 2005 and 2007.Our rulingThe YG Action PAC said that ""Frankel took a 40 percent pay raise as mayor."" Frankel did form a committee to explore whether she should get a pay raise and that resulted in a 40 percent boost -- an extra $35,750 -- in 2004. However the ad omits the context for that raise -- the mayor’s salary hadn’t had an increase since 1998 and after she got the raise in 2004, her salary then remained set at $125,000 a year until she left office in 2011.The ad also stated that while Frankel got a hefty pay hike, the city ""lost jobs."" The unemployment rate rose from about 5.8 percent to 10.2 percent during her tenure. But the number of employed actually increased slightly and Frankel can’t be blamed for a national recession.If we look at the big swing that occurred in the economy, ""no mayor in the world would be able to counterbalance the forces that were in play,"" Snaith said.For those omissions about context, we rate this claim Half True.Advertisement"
http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2016/apr/22/unbreakable-kimmy-schmidt/dolphins-rapists-unbreakable-kimmy-schmidt/	"""Dolphins are rapists. Look it up."""	false	['Animals', 'Science']	http://justingregg.com/	http://justingregg.com/the-dolphin-rape-myth/	2016/04/22	by justingregg • June 11, 2013 • Dolphin News , Dolphin Science , Personal Musings • Comments Off • 723780Google the term “dolphin rape” and you’ll find countless references to male dolphins raping female dolphins , males raping other males , gang rape , and even dolphins raping humans . You might even find this hoax webpage claiming that dolphins regularly kidnap swimmers and take them to a “rape cave.” Head over to Google Scholar, however, and you will find exactly zero references to “dolphin rape” in the scientific peer-reviewed literature.The reason for this discrepancy is quite simple: the term rape cannot be used to describe the kinds of behavior scientists have observed in dolphins. The central problem is that the legal definitions of rape include a lack of consent on the part of the victim, and we simply cannot know the extent to which dolphins or other animals are able to give consent. A non-consensual act like rape has “moral and legal implications” that are only relevant in the human world, which is why animal scientists (pretty much) stopped using the term altogether in the early 1980s. The correct scientific term to describe when a male aggressively restrains a female in order to mate is forced copulation. Forced copulation has been observed in ducks , lizards , monkeys , fruit flies , crickets , orangutans , chimpanzees , and countless other species .But not dolphins.Despite the media frenzy around the idea of dolphin rape, it’s primates, birds and insects that are the forced copulation aficionados, not dolphins. What follows is a brief rundown of all of the aggressive sexual behaviors that scientists have observed in dolphins that often find their way into popular reports discussing dolphin rape:Sexual Coercion: Sexual Coercion is a term describing a suite of behaviors observed most frequently in the bottlenose dolphins of Shark Bay Australia and Sarasota Bay Florida. Individuals or groups of males use a variety of coercive tactics to increase their chances of mating with females. In Shark Bay, groups of male dolphins are often seen in the company of an individual female for extended periods of time (referred to as a consortship). Sometimes these males begin the consortship by herding (i.e., chasing and corralling) the female, although other times the female appears to enter the consortship willingly. These males sometimes use aggressive behavior to keep the female close to them and to fend off rival males, and it’s during these consortships that mating takes place.In Sarasota, males also follow females around when it’s time to mate (a form of mate guarding), but rarely engage in aggressive behavior directed at the female like in Shark Bay. Dolphins might use other tactics to persuade a female to mate with them, including committing infanticide (i.e., killing calves) so that the females will come into estrus and be more receptive.But here’s the thing: even in the clearly aggressive coercion scenarios witnessed in Shark Bay, researchers have never witnessed forced copulation. The kind of coercion being described here is indirect in that these tactics ultimately result in males persuading females to mate with them, but not directly forcing themselves on the females. The scientific experts studying the Shark Bay dolphins had this to say about forced copulation in a recent book :We have no evidence of direct sexual coercion in dolphins, including forced copulation or other behaviors directly associated with male attempts to mate.In other words, if forced copulation should be considered the non-human animal equivalent to rape insofar as it appears (to the human observer) as if the female has not given consent, then this still has never been observed in dolphins. This fact alone is a strong argument against the use of the word rape to describe any dolphin mating strategies.Socio-Sexual behavior:The below video has been mislabeled as “Dolphins Mating,” and purportedly shows two males and one female dolphin. In fact, there are three male dolphins in this video. This group of young males is engaging in what scientists call socio-sexual behavior. This is a blanket term that describes any social behavior involving penises that does not involve a male trying to impregnate a female. Sometimes the dolphins simply rub all over each other while brandishing erections, and sometimes they actually insert their penises in each other’s anuses or genital slits. Unlike true mating, which usually take the form of the male swimming belly-to-belly underneath a female , socio-sexual behavior often involves the male approaching the other dolphin (male or female) from behind or the side. Sometimes it looks rather brutal and aggressive, and sometimes, like in the below video, the animals seem pretty chill. There are a variety of reasons dolphins engage in these behaviors, ranging from establishing or maintaining social bonds and friendships, to blowing off steam, punishing rivals, or simply having a grand old time. It’s difficult to know exactly what is going through the dolphins’ minds when watching socio-sexual behavior unfold, and whether or not any of the observed penile penetration is consensual. Regardless, it does not resemble forced copulation.Mounting: You can easily find examples online of dolphins with erections and thrusting behavior directed at human swimmers (like here , and here ). It’s impossible to know if penetration is their intention (i.e., some form of penetration being another criterion in the definition of human rape ), or if it’s the dolphin equivalent of a dog humping your leg . Mounting behavior (which does not always involve penetration, especially since females sometime do the mounting) has been studied in a number of animal species, and the list of proposed functions for this behavior is diverse: play behavior, solidifying maternal bonds, dominance, aggression, establishment and maintenance of social bonds, conflict resolution, and of course sexual gratification. Mounting behavior in dolphins is widespread and is a form of socio-sexual behavior. It involves dolphins of all ages and both sexes. Juveniles and calves will sometimes mount their mothers (and vice versa) and females will mount males. Despite documented mounting attempts involving dolphins and humans, I have found no verified accounts of a male dolphin having ever penetrated a human orifice with his penis (against their will or otherwise).So here’s the bottom line: calling any of this behavior rape trivializes the word rape. It either downplays the horrific human behavior of rape by jokingly misapplying it to quirky animal behavior, or unnecessarily vilifies what is, for dolphins, a diverse catalog of behaviors that might not cause the dolphins involved very much stress, and might even be consensual 100% of the time. In most cases involving male dolphins using aggressive strategies to mate with females, the correct term is sexual coercion, which is NOT synonymous with rape. Unlike rape, sexual coercion might involve consent on the part of the female, and involves many indirect coercive behaviors (e.g., herding, infanticide), and not just forced copulation. In any event, forced copulation as a sexual coercion technique has never been observed in dolphins. In cases where males are directing their penises at the bodies and orifices of other dolphins where reproduction is not the goal, or engage in mounting behavior, the correct term is probably socio-sexual behavior . Again, socio-sexual behavior might involve consent, and does not always involve penetration or forced copulation.The dolphins are rapists meme easily lends itself to being a trendy t-shirt , or link-bait headline , but rape is undoubtedly the wrong term to apply to dolphin behavior. It is a loaded term that really should be used solely to describe the fundamentally horrific, and uniquely human crime of rape as defined by the law. There is no dolphin equivalent.***************Further reading on sexual coercion and socio-sexual behavior in dolphins:Connor R.C., Vollmer N. 2009.

The probing questions came from two skeptical neurologists during ABC News' special on health care reform, ""Questions for the President: Prescription for America,"" anchored from the White House by Diane Sawyer and Charles Gibson. PlaynullDr. Orrin Devinsky, a neurologist and researcher at the New York University Langone Medical Center, said that elites often propose health care solutions that limit options for the general public, secure in the knowledge that if they or their loves ones get sick, they will be able to afford the best care available, even if it's not provided by insurance. Devinsky asked the president pointedly if he would be willing to promise that he wouldn't seek such extraordinary help for his wife or daughters if they became sick and the public plan he's proposingPlaynull limited the tests or treatment they can get. The president refused to make such a pledge, though he allowed that if ""it's my family member, if it's my wife, if it's my children, if it's my grandmother, I always want them to get the very best care. ""There's a whole bunch of care that's being provided that every study, that every bit of evidence that we have indicates may not be making us healthier,"" he said. Gibson interjected that often patients don't know what will work until they get every test they can. ""Oftentimes we know what makes sense and what doesn't,"" the president responded, making a push for evidence-based medicine. PlaynullGibson asked the president if it doesn't make sense to decide what the limitations will be on options in any health care reform proposal before voting on it. ""That's what people are afraid of,"" Gibson said. The president said he understood the American people ""know they're living with the devil, but the devil they know instead of the devil they don't."" Obama: GOP Senators Are Wrong on Public OptionPlaynullOn the ""Nightline"" edition of the health care forum, Gibson read the president a letter from Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee expressing concern about the creation of a government-run health care plan. ""At a time when major government programs like Medicare and Medicaid are already on a path to fiscal insolvency, creating a brand new government program will not only worsen our long-term financial outlook but also negatively impact American families who enjoy the private coverage of their choice,"" the senators wrote. ""The end result would be a federal government takeover of our health care system, taking decisions out of the hands of doctors and patients and placing them in the hands of a Washington bureaucracy."" Playnull""They're wrong,"" the president said, arguing that in a Health Insurance Exchange, the public plan would be ""one option among multiple options."" The concern, Gibson articulated, is that such a plan wouldn't be offered on a level playing field. The president rebuffed that, arguing that ""we can set up a public option where they're collecting premiums just like any private insurer and doctors can collect rates,"" but because the public plan will have lower administrative costs ""we can keep them [private insurance companies] honest."" Obama said he didn't understand those advocates of the free market who constantly say the private sector can do things better and are yet worried about this plan. ""If that's the case, no one will choose the public option,"" the president said. He also suggested, however, that the private sector might not necessarily be better, point out that users of Medicare and Veterans Administration hospitals constantly rate ""pretty high satisfaction."" Views on Government-Funded Health InsuranceAccording to the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, 62 percent of Americans support creating a government-funded entity to offer health insurance to those who don't get it elsewhere. But if that caused many private insurers to go out of business because they couldn't compete, support plummets to 37 percent. The White House has shown some flexibility about a government-run plan. In a meeting with a bipartisan group of governors today, the possibility was raised of states offering public plans of their own instead of just one federally administered plan, according to a source with knowledge of the meeting. And White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel told Democratic senators Tuesday night that the president was open to ""alternatives"" to the public plan. Sawyer asked Ron Williams, the CEO of Aetna Insurance, ""Is the president right that you need to be kept honest?"" Williams said he disagreed with the notion of a public plan. ""It's difficult to compete against a player who's also the person refereeing the game,"" Williams said. He proposed working to ""solve the problem as opposed to introduce a new competitor who has rule-making ability."" Gibson pointed out that the president constantly makes the argument that if you like your insurance you won't have to change it. And yet from the audience, John Sheils, senior vice president of The Lewin Group, a health care policy research and management consulting firm, estimated that up to 70 percent of those with private insurance would end up on the public plan. ""There are a whole series of ways that we could design this,"" the president said, arguing that employers would be given a ""disincentive"" to shift their employees to the public plan. Another neurologist, Dr. John Corboy of the University of Colorado Health Science Center, asked the president, ""What can you do to convince the American public that there actually are limits to what we can pay for with our American health care system and if there are going to be limits, who's going to design the system and who's going to enforce the rules for a system like that?"" Obama, however, didn't directly answer the question. ""If we are smart, we should be able to design a system in which people still have choices of doctors and choices of plans that make sure that necessary treatment is provided but we don't have a huge amount of waste in the system,"" he said. He said he had ""great confidence"" that physicians ""are going to always want to do right thing"" if they have the right information and a payment structure that focuses on evidence and results and not tests and referrals. ""We should change those incentive structures,"" the president said. ""Our job this summer and this fall,"" he said, is to ""identify the best ways to achieve the best possible care."" The president cited the Mayo Clinic as an example of a medical center where experts had figured out the most effective treatments and eliminated waste and unnecessary procedures. Sawyer said that e-mails ABC News had received argued that ""the Mayo Clinic is exactly the point,"" indicating that private companies are solving this problem, and raising the question as to why the government needs to get involved. ""And, unfortunately, government, whether you like it or not, is going to already be involved,"" Obama said, citing Medicare and Medicaid. One questioner -- Marisa Milton, vice president of health care policy for the HR Policy Association, a public policy advocate for human resource executives -- said that ""other industrialized nations provide coverage for all their residents"" with ""high quality care"" without spending more money. ""A lot of those countries employ a different system than we do,"" the president said. ""Almost all of them have what would be considered a single-payer system in which the government operates what is essentially a Medicare for all."" The president said he didn't think it wise to attempt to ""completely change our system root and branch"" since health care is one-sixth of the U.S. economy. It ""would be hugely disruptive,"" he said, arguing that citizens would be forced to change their doctors and insurance plans ""in a way I'm not prepared to go."" End-of-life issues were raised as well; right now it is estimated that nearly 30 percent of Medicare's annual $327 billion budget is spent on patients in their final year of life. Jane Sturm told the story of her nearly 100-year-old mother, who was originally denied a pacemaker because of her age. She eventually got one, but only after seeking out another doctor. ""Outside the medical criteria,"" Sturm asked, ""is there a consideration that can be given for a certain spirit ... and quality of life?"" ""I don't think that we can make judgments based on peoples' spirit,"" Obama said. ""That would be a pretty subjective decision to be making. I think we have to have rules that say that we are going to provide good, quality care for all people. ""We're not going to solve every single one of these very difficult decisions at end of life,"" he said. ""Ultimately that's going to be between physicians and patients."" Who Will Pay for All of This? ""How and who will pay for national health care system,"" asked Christopher Bean, who said he has good insurance with his job at Allint Tech Systems and worries about government interference. ""We will have some up-front costs,"" the president acknowledged. ""And the estimates ... have been anywhere from a trillion to $2 trillion. But what I have said is whatever it is we do, we pay for."" The president criticized the Congressional Budget Office, which recently analyzed the cost of two Democratic Senate draft bills as costing between $1 and $1.6 trillion. The president said the CBO ""doesn't count all of the savings that may come from prevention, may come from eliminating all of the paperwork and bureaucracy because we have put forward health IT. It doesn't come from the evidence-based care and changes in reimbursement ... they're not willing to credit us with those savings. They say, 'That may be nice, that may save a lot of money, but we can't be certain.' ""We spend $177 billion over 10 years in providing subsidies for insurers,"" the president said as an example of the latter. About a third of the costs will come from new revenue,"" the president said, pushing his proposal to raise taxes on those making more than $200,000 a year through a change in the itemized deduction in the tax code. Gail Wilensky, a senior fellow at Project HOPE who ran Medicare during the administration of President George H.W. Bush, pushed the president for more specifics on how he expects to pay for the plan. ""This is not an easy problem,"" the president acknowledged. ""And it's especially not an easy problem when the economy is going through a difficult phase."" But the president suggested the stars were aligning for reform, citing efforts being made such as the pharmaceutical industry's recent pledge to help defray the costs of prescription drugs for seniors, and argued that now was the time for reform. ""We have to have the courage and the willingness to cooperate and compromise in order to make this happen,"" the president said. ""And if we do, it's not going to be a completely smooth ride, there's going to be times over the next several months where we think health care is dead, it's not going to happen but if we keep our eye on the prize ... then I'm absolutely convinced that we can get it done this time."" Earlier in the day at the White House, Obama told a bipartisan group of governors he wants them to be kept in the loop as health care reform legislation develops on Capitol Hill. ""We're committed to working with them in the weeks and months to come to make sure that when we get health reform done it is in partnership with the states, where the rubber so often hits the road,"" the president told reporters. But Obama acknowledged the thorny issues they're all facing -- including whether there should be a government-run public plan, who will pay for it, and how to achieve universal coverage. ""There's no perfect unanimity across the table in terms of every single aspect of reform,"" the president said. The biggest bone of contention may be how to pay for reform. ""Anything that we do on health care we have to have a long-term plan to pay the bills,"" said South Dakota Gov. Mike Rounds, a Republican, who attended the meeting. In an exclusive interview with ABC News' Diane Sawyer that aired today on ""Good Morning America,"" Obama indicated that there was a breaking point in the balance sheets where he would say that the cost of reforming the system is too great for the federal government to handle, but he did not put a price tag on it. ""I think that if any reform that we get is not driving down costs in a serious way ... if people say, 'We're just going to add more people onto a hugely inefficient system,' then I will say no. Because -- we can't afford it,"" he said. Taxing Health Care Benefits? One option being considered on Capitol Hill is taxing health care benefits, which are currently tax exempt. Today, a key Democratic senator indicated that may be inevitable. ""It is hard for me to see how you have a package that is paid for that doesn't include reducing the tax subsidy for health care,"" said Sen. Kent Conrad of North Dakota, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, who is regarded among Democrats as something of a deficit hawk. Conrad sees the potential for a significant source of revenue. ""Tax subsidies for health care. They're huge. Hundreds of billions of dollars a year,"" he said. Obama said he opposes that approach, instead wanting to pay for the bill partly by reducing the tax deductions wealthier people can take when donating to charity. ""We would raise enough money to actually make sure this thing is paid for,"" Obama said in the ABC interview. ""Now members of Congress may have other ideas about how best to do this. I'm happy to listen to them."" Conrad said that limiting deductions is ""still on the table"" in the committee's discussions. While the details are hammered out on Capitol Hill, there is a legislative push and pull and shifting positions at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. As a candidate, then-Sen. Obama bashed his rival for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton, for proposing that Americans be mandated to have health insurance. ""She'd have the government force you to buy health insurance,"" he said Feb. 23, 2008. ""I disagree with that approach. I believe that the reason Americans don't have health care isn't because no one's forced them to buy it, it's because no one's made it affordable."" But now the president is acknowledging that his thinking on the issue has ""evolved"" and he could support a law mandating that individuals purchase health care coverage, with fines for those who do not. Obama stressed that there must be some kind of waiver for those who are simply unable to afford it. ""People have made some pretty compelling arguments to me that if we want to have a system that drives down costs for everybody, then we've got to have healthier people not opt out of the system,"" the president told ABC News. Earlier this month in a letter to congressional leaders working on the reform legislation, Obama said he would consider supporting such a measure, if it has room for exemptions for small businesses and individuals who cannot afford the premiums. Obama's Approval Ratings on Health Care SlipWith the health care debate ramping up, with Republicans assailing Democrats for the high price tag and a public option plan, Obama's ratings on the subject slipped slightly in the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll. Only 53 percent of Americans approve of Obama's handling of health care while 39 percent disapprove of it, up from 29 percent who disapproved in April, according to the poll. Concluding the health care forum, Obama expressed optimism that reform is possible. ""If the American people get behind this, this is going to happen,"" the president said. ABC News' Z. Byron Wolf contributed to this report. President Obama struggled to explain today whether his health care reform proposals would force normal Americans to make sacrifices that wealthier, more powerful people -- like the president himself -- wouldn't face. The probing questions came from two skeptical neurologists during ABC News' special on health care reform, ""Questions for the President: Prescription for America,"" anchored from the White House by Diane Sawyer and Charles Gibson. Dr. Orrin Devinsky, a neurologist and researcher at the New York University Langone Medical Center, said that elites often propose health care solutions that limit options for the general public, secure in the knowledge that if they or their loves ones get sick, they will be able to afford the best care available, even if it's not provided by insurance. The president refused to make such a pledge, though he allowed that if ""it's my family member, if it's my wife, if it's my children, if it's my grandmother, I always want them to get the very best care. ""There's a whole bunch of care that's being provided that every study, that every bit of evidence that we have indicates may not be making us healthier,"" he said. Gibson interjected that often patients don't know what will work until they get every test they can. ""Oftentimes we know what makes sense and what doesn't,"" the president responded, making a push for evidence-based medicine. Gibson asked the president if it doesn't make sense to decide what the limitations will be on options in any health care reform proposal before voting on it. ""That's what people are afraid of,"" Gibson said. The president said he understood the American people ""know they're living with the devil, but the devil they know instead of the devil they don't."" On the ""Nightline"" edition of the health care forum, Gibson read the president a letter from Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee expressing concern about the creation of a government-run health care plan. ""At a time when major government programs like Medicare and Medicaid are already on a path to fiscal insolvency, creating a brand new government program will not only worsen our long-term financial outlook but also negatively impact American families who enjoy the private coverage of their choice,"" the senators wrote. ""The end result would be a federal government takeover of our health care system, taking decisions out of the hands of doctors and patients and placing them in the hands of a Washington bureaucracy."" ""They're wrong,"" the president said, arguing that in a Health Insurance Exchange, the public plan would be ""one option among multiple options."" The concern, Gibson articulated, is that such a plan wouldn't be offered on a level playing field. The president rebuffed that, arguing that ""we can set up a public option where they're collecting premiums just like any private insurer and doctors can collect rates,"" but because the public plan will have lower administrative costs ""we can keep them [private insurance companies] honest."" Obama said he didn't understand those advocates of the free market who constantly say the private sector can do things better and are yet worried about this plan. ""If that's the case, no one will choose the public option,"" the president said. He also suggested, however, that the private sector might not necessarily be better, point out that users of Medicare and Veterans Administration hospitals constantly rate ""pretty high satisfaction."" The White House has shown some flexibility about a government-run plan. In a meeting with a bipartisan group of governors today, the possibility was raised of states offering public plans of their own instead of just one federally administered plan, according to a source with knowledge of the meeting. And White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel told Democratic senators Tuesday night that the president was open to ""alternatives"" to the public plan. Sawyer asked Ron Williams, the CEO of Aetna Insurance, ""Is the president right that you need to be kept honest?"" Williams said he disagreed with the notion of a public plan. ""It's difficult to compete against a player who's also the person refereeing the game,"" Williams said. He proposed working to ""solve the problem as opposed to introduce a new competitor who has rule-making ability."" Gibson pointed out that the president constantly makes the argument that if you like your insurance you won't have to change it. And yet from the audience, John Sheils, senior vice president of The Lewin Group, a health care policy research and management consulting firm, estimated that up to 70 percent of those with private insurance would end up on the public plan. ""There are a whole series of ways that we could design this,"" the president said, arguing that employers would be given a ""disincentive"" to shift their employees to the public plan. Another neurologist, Dr. John Corboy of the University of Colorado Health Science Center, asked the president, ""What can you do to convince the American public that there actually are limits to what we can pay for with our American health care system and if there are going to be limits, who's going to design the system and who's going to enforce the rules for a system like that?"" Obama, however, didn't directly answer the question. ""If we are smart, we should be able to design a system in which people still have choices of doctors and choices of plans that make sure that necessary treatment is provided but we don't have a huge amount of waste in the system,"" he said. He said he had ""great confidence"" that physicians ""are going to always want to do right thing"" if they have the right information and a payment structure that focuses on evidence and results and not tests and referrals. ""We should change those incentive structures,"" the president said. ""Our job this summer and this fall,"" he said, is to ""identify the best ways to achieve the best possible care."" The president cited the Mayo Clinic as an example of a medical center where experts had figured out the most effective treatments and eliminated waste and unnecessary procedures. Sawyer said that e-mails ABC News had received argued that ""the Mayo Clinic is exactly the point,"" indicating that private companies are solving this problem, and raising the question as to why the government needs to get involved. ""And, unfortunately, government, whether you like it or not, is going to already be involved,"" Obama said, citing Medicare and Medicaid. One questioner -- Marisa Milton, vice president of health care policy for the HR Policy Association, a public policy advocate for human resource executives -- said that ""other industrialized nations provide coverage for all their residents"" with ""high quality care"" without spending more money. ""A lot of those countries employ a different system than we do,"" the president said. ""Almost all of them have what would be considered a single-payer system in which the government operates what is essentially a Medicare for all."" The president said he didn't think it wise to attempt to ""completely change our system root and branch"" since health care is one-sixth of the U.S. economy. It ""would be hugely disruptive,"" he said, arguing that citizens would be forced to change their doctors and insurance plans ""in a way I'm not prepared to go."" End-of-life issues were raised as well; right now it is estimated that nearly 30 percent of Medicare's annual $327 billion budget is spent on patients in their final year of life. Jane Sturm told the story of her nearly 100-year-old mother, who was originally denied a pacemaker because of her age. She eventually got one, but only after seeking out another doctor. ""Outside the medical criteria,"" Sturm asked, ""is there a consideration that can be given for a certain spirit ... and quality of life?"" ""I don't think that we can make judgments based on peoples' spirit,"" Obama said. ""That would be a pretty subjective decision to be making. I think we have to have rules that say that we are going to provide good, quality care for all people. ""We're not going to solve every single one of these very difficult decisions at end of life,"" he said. ""Ultimately that's going to be between physicians and patients."" Who Will Pay for All of This? ""How and who will pay for national health care system,"" asked Christopher Bean, who said he has good insurance with his job at Allint Tech Systems and worries about government interference. ""We will have some up-front costs,"" the president acknowledged. ""And the estimates ... have been anywhere from a trillion to $2 trillion.

Gardner Selby on Sunday, March 1st, 2015 at 6:00 a.m.By not teaming with legislators, Rick Perry left many Texans without reasonable health care, a Democratic group says.The Texas Democratic Party popped this claim a day after the former governor and 2016 Republican presidential prospect told New Hampshire residents: ""People criticize us for having a large number of uninsured. That’s what Texans decided they wanted. They did not want government forcing everyone to buy insurance.""According to a Dallas Morning News blog post datelined Bedford, N.H., Perry was referring to Texas’ refusal, under his leadership, to create an insurance marketplace--leaving it to the federal government to do so--or to expand Medicaid as permitted under the federal Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.Javier Gamboa, the Democratic Party’s spokesman, reacted in a Feb. 12, 2015, press release: ""Perry should be ashamed of himself for saying that the people of Texas did not want increased coverage and expanded access to healthcare. More than one million hardworking Texans are living without affordable care because of his failure to partner with the Legislature to find a Texas solution to closing the coverage gap.""Is all of this so?Perry and legislatorsPerry won his last term as governor in 2010, the year the then-Democratic-controlled Congress and President Barack Obama agreed to mandate health coverage for most Americans. The law also permitted states to widen access to Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance, with Uncle Sam covering related costs for three years. But Perry was adamant about Texas not expanding; in July 2012, he rejected the deal, calling the offer a brazen intrusion into state sovereignty.And in 2013, the Republican-led Legislature, in accord with Perry, ""shot down federal efforts to cover uninsured, low-income Texans by expanding access to Medicaid,"" according to a May 2013 Austin American-Statesman news story .Texans in the 'coverage gap'So what is this ""coverage gap"" and how many Texans fall into it?In 2014, uninsured Texans earning 100 to 400 percent of the federal poverty level began to be offered subsidies to help buy insurance on an online healthcare exchange or marketplace. However, as the Statesman story said, Texas adults living below the poverty line—then $11,170 for an individual, $19,090 for a family of three—won no change in access. Some 947,000 uninsured Texas adults were living below the poverty line at the time, the story said.Varied estimatesMindful that figure is years old, we hunted fresh data.Replying to our requests for elaboration, the Democratic spokesman, Gamboa, pointed out news stories, including a January 2015 Associated Press news story stating: ""Texas leads the nation in uninsured, with nearly a quarter of the state’s population—6.4 million people—lacking health insurance."" That story said the Obamacare law ""mandates expanding Medicaid to residents with incomes less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level, but a Supreme Court ruling left expansion up to each state and Texas said no. ""That created a ‘coverage gap’ of more than 1 million Texans who aren’t poor enough to qualify for Medicaid,"" the story said, ""but don’t earn enough to receive the law’s new subsidized health insurance.""But there also are other estimates.In particular, Anne Dunkelberg of the Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for low-income residents, initially nudged by email that according to the center’s interactive Health & Wealth County Checkup website, nearly 1.2 million to nearly 1.3 million Texans fit the coverage gap. Drawing on an October 2013 report from the Kaiser Family Foundation, itself rooted in Census Bureau surveys asking whether respondents had health insurance, the center reached a rough estimate of 1,151,410 to 1,208,090 Texans in the coverage gap. The foundation is a nonpartisan health policy research group,Also, the center notes, a February 2014 report by the Urban Institute, limited to estimates for major urban counties, supports the estimate of 1,293,100 Texans in the coverage gap.A November 2014 analysisMost recently, a November 2014 Kaiser report said that in states that do not expand Medicaid, many adults fall into a ‘coverage gap’ of having incomes above Medicaid eligibility limits but below the lower limit for Marketplace premium tax credits,"" meaning the Obamacare subsidies.The report, starting from the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey results for 2014, offered this illustration of its estimated nearly 4 million citizens in the gap--one quarter of them, or 948,000, living in Texas--who would have been newly eligible for Medicaid if their state had expanded coverage:Source: Report, ""The Coverage Gap: Uninsured Poor Adults in States that Do Not Expand Medicaid – An Update,"" Kaiser Family Foundation, Nov. 12, 2014 (accessed Feb. 24, 2105)By email, Kaiser spokesman Chris Lee told us the 948,000 figure was the organization’s latest estimate of Texans lacking insurance who would be eligible for Medicaid if Texas agreed to expand access.Experts told us there is one other way to use Census Bureau surveys to estimate Texans in the coverage gap. By email, a bureau demographer, Carla Medalia, guided us to results from the 2013 American Community Survey indicating that nearly 1.4 million Texans aged 18 through 64 were uninsured and living below the poverty level--meaning they weren’t eligible either for Medicaid in Texas or for Obamacare subsidies; they’re potential gappers. Dunkelberg cautioned, though, that the bureau figures don’t filter out residents living in the country without legal authorization or legal immigrants here less than five years; members of both subgroups would be ineligible for Medicaid.On balance of late, Dunkelberg said, she’s been saying around 1 million Texans fall into the gap.Affordable care?Next, we wondered if individuals in the gap live without affordable care, as the Democrats said.Nationally, the Kaiser report offered its read of what kinds of Americans fit the coverage gap.""While nearly half of people in the coverage gap report that their health is excellent or very good, nearly a fifth (18%) report that they are in fair or poor health,"" the report said. ""These individuals have known health problems that likely require medical attention.""The report also recapped whether individuals in the gap otherwise reported having access to coverage, perhaps through a family member’s job. ""The work status of people in the coverage gap indicates that there are limited coverage options available for people in this situation,"" the report said. ""Two-thirds (66%) of people in the coverage gap are in a family with a worker, and 54% are working themselves,"" the report said. ""While workers could potentially have an offer of coverage through their employer, the majority of workers in the coverage gap (51%) work for small firms (<50 employees) that will not be subject to ACA penalties for not offering coverage. Further, many firms do not offer coverage to part-time workers. A majority of workers in the coverage gap also work in industries with historically low insurance rates, such as the agriculture and service industries. More than a third (34%) of adults in the coverage gap are in a family with no workers.""Our rulingThe Democratic Party said more than 1 million Texans live without affordable health care because Perry failed to ""partner with the Legislature to find a Texas solution to closing the coverage gap.""Per the latest estimates, it’s safe to say around a million Texas adults fall into the coverage gap for making too little money to qualify for insurance subsidies and also remaining ineligible for Medicaid unless Texas expands access as encouraged by the Obamacare law and rejected by Perry and the state’s ruling Republicans. Less certain is what kind of care is available to those people in the gap and how affordable it might be for them.We rate this statement, which lacked clarification, Mostly True.MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.UPDATE, 5:45 p.m., March 1, 2015: Today after this fact check posted, we made various changes to our original version to eliminate typos, improve the writing and clarify our ruling, which did not change.Advertisement"

O'Scanlon speaks during a meeting of the Assembly Budget Committee at the Statehouse Annex in Trenton in June of 2008.By Declan O’ScanlonIt’s a simple question loaded with political appeal: “With so many people hurting and income disparities rising, shouldn’t we ask New Jersey’s millionaires to pay a ‘fair share’ in taxes?”Okay, what’s a “fair” share? If the current share of state income tax paid by the top 1 percent of New Jersey’s taxpayers — about 37 percent — isn’t high enough, what is? Would 80 percent be fair? Or 90 percent? Taxpayers earning $1 million pay an effective tax rate that is about four times what taxpayers earning $100,000 pay. When and how will we know when we’ve achieved “fairness”?Unfortunately, intense partisanship — feeding on visceral emotions — has made it virtually impossible to have a rational conversation about taxes in America. As a senior member of the state Assembly’s Budget Committee, I think those of us in positions of leadership have a responsibility to do more than stoke emotions, and instead, adopt tax policies that generate the revenue needed to support budget priorities on a fair and sustainable basis.Piling taxes on the rich may be great politics, but it’s lousy public policy. New Jersey already has a progressive income tax system, which, thanks to high-income households receiving a greater proportion of their income from investments and capital gains, has made our revenue base highly volatile. Increasing our relative reliance on high-income taxpayers will increase volatility, making it more difficult to engage in prudent, long-term financial planning.Most experts believe increased volatility is a problem because fiscal stability is a condition precedent to sound policymaking. Wild fluctuations in revenues fuel an inefficient boom-and-bust approach to budget-making that mismanages expectations. The impact of emergent budget cuts on New Jersey residents is regressive — those at middle and lower income levels experience the pain of budget cuts disproportionately, since they more often benefit from state programs.Some editorialists have suggested Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s recent decision to embrace higher rates for high-income New Yorkers should serve as an example for New Jersey. New York’s current high rate is 8.97 percent, the same as New Jersey’s. Instead of letting the rate go down to 6.85 percent, as scheduled, Cuomo is saying he’ll let the rate fall to 8.82 percent for taxpayers at $2 million or more, but let the rate fall to 6.85 percent for taxpayers between $300,000 and $2 million. Everyone in New York will get a tax cut, but folks above $2 million will get less of a tax cut than they had expected. If that’s the standard of “fairness,” maybe the editorialists are right and we should follow New York’s example.Here’s the critical point: The top marginal rate in New York will soon fall below the top rate in New Jersey; that’s not good news for our competitive position.A review of national IRS data by Charles Steindel, the state Treasury’s chief economist, confirmed a statistical connection between tax increases enacted under former Gov. James E. McGreevey and an increase of affluent taxpayers who moved out of, or never moved into, New Jersey. Steindel also conducted a survey confirming a significant proportion of tax advisers had discussed the idea of moving out of New Jersey with their relatively affluent clients. The study and survey were modest in scope and merely confirmed what we already know: Yes, Virginia, taxes matter.Are they the only competitive consideration? Absolutely not. Infrastructure, regulations, climate, educational levels and other factors play a major role.Instead of asking “What’s fair?” we should be asking “What’s in our long-term self-interest?” I suggest it’s in New Jersey’s interest to pursue policies that support sustainable and growing revenue collections over time. Although New Jersey cannot expect to compete globally on the basis of low taxes alone, we should avoid negative “outlier” status and, with it, the kind of reputation that once prevented the Garden State from getting into the starting blocks when companies make site selections.Assemblyman Declan O’Scanlon (R-Monmouth) is the ranking Republican on the state’s Assembly Budget Committee.Most Read

The protest will challenge an Internal Revenue Code restriction that limits the political activities of charitable organizations – including churches and other religious groups – that are exempt from taxation. According to the Internal Revenue Code, religious groups may lose their tax-exempt status if they officially endorse a political candidate. The ADF says that if its protest leads the Internal Revenue Service to penalize houses of worship for their pastors’ political advocacy, ADF will bring a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of these penalties.To discuss the ADF protest and IRS restrictions on the political activities of religious organizations, the Pew Forum turns to church-state scholar Robert W. Tuttle.Featuring:Robert W. Tuttle , David R. and Sherry Kirschner Berz Research Professor of Law and Religion, The George Washington University Law SchoolInterviewer:Jesse Merriam , Research Associate, Pew Forum on Religion & Public LifeQuestion & AnswerBefore 1954, section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code permitted nonprofit organizations to endorse political candidates while remaining exempt from federal income tax. But in 1954, the U.S. Congress amended this part of the code to say that a charitable organization loses its tax-exempt status if it intervenes in a political campaign. Why did Congress add this restriction?Many members of Congress, including Lyndon B. Johnson, a senator at the time, voted for the amendment because they were concerned about nonprofit organizations funding their opponents’ political campaigns. But because there was little debate over the amendment or how it would influence churches, we don’t know precisely why Congress enacted the amendment.Notably, the 1954 amendment is often misunderstood as limiting political advocacy, but the rule’s actual purpose has to do with political contributions. Under the Internal Revenue Code, there are many different kinds of tax-exempt organizations. For example, section 527 of the code exempts all sorts of political organizations from federal income tax. But organizations that qualify as charitable groups under section 501(c)(3) are special because donors to these organizations may deduct their contributions from their own federal income taxes. So a primary purpose of the 1954 amendment was to prevent donors from deducting political contributions from their taxes.Why is the Alliance Defense Fund so interested in eliminating this restriction?The ADF opposes the restriction because the rule requires churches to choose between actively participating in political campaigns, on the one hand, and accepting tax-deductible donations, on the other hand. As a result, if a church wanted to promote or oppose a particular political candidate, the church would be required to create a separate organization to do so. Although this separate organization would be exempt from taxes, contributors could not take a tax deduction for their donations to this organization.The ADF believes that this restriction takes political activity out of the heart of a congregation’s life. For example, a congregation that wanted to retain its tax exemption under section 501(c)(3) could not include political activity in its worship service unless the worship service was financed by a separate organization. Moreover, ADF believes that because IRS officials must examine the content of sermons or other religious messages to determine whether a church has improperly engaged in political advocacy, IRS enforcement of the rule entangles the government in the operation of religious organizations.If ADF’s protest leads to a constitutional challenge in court, what arguments might ADF make?The ADF would almost certainly argue that the 1954 amendment violates the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause, which prohibits the government from regulating religious organizations more strictly than their secular counterparts. Similarly, ADF will likely argue that the amendment violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a 1993 federal statute that prohibits the federal government from imposing a “substantial burden” on a religious organization unless the government demonstrates that it must impose that burden to achieve a “compelling government interest.” The ADF will also likely argue that the restriction violates the First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause, which prohibits the government from regulating speech on the basis of its content. Finally, ADF might also claim that IRS enforcement of the 1954 amendment violates the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause by requiring the IRS to scrutinize sermons or other religious messages, thus excessively entangling government and religion.How might the government defend the 1954 amendment?The government will likely defend the 1954 amendment by arguing that the rule does not violate congregations’ rights under the Free Exercise Clause or RFRA because the restriction treats religious organizations just like other charitable and educational organizations. Moreover, the government would say, the restriction does not bar congregations from participating in campaigns; it only prohibits donors from making tax-deductible political contributions. Likewise, the government will likely argue, the restriction does not violate the Free Speech Clause because the restriction does not prohibit the congregations from making political statements; it only bars them from using tax-deductible donations to do so. Finally, in response to ADF’s Establishment Clause argument, the government will likely argue that there is no excessive entanglement of government and religion because the IRS does not need to evaluate a sermon’s theological merit to determine whether the sermon promotes a politician.How do you think a court might evaluate these arguments?It’s always difficult to predict how a court might decide a hypothetical case because a court’s decision often turns on a case’s particular facts. But past decisions give us a pretty good basis for guessing that a court would uphold the constitutionality of the 1954 amendment’s application to religious organizations.The most relevant case on this issue is Branch Ministries v. Rossotti (2000), a case in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the 1954 amendment’s constitutionality. That case arose after a congregation advocated for a presidential candidate, prompting the IRS to revoke the congregation’s 501(c)(3) status. The congregation claimed that this revocation violated the Free Exercise and Free Speech clauses. But the D.C. Circuit Court rejected both of these arguments on the ground that the congregation was still free to engage in political speech and activities.The D.C. Circuit Court’s reasoning in this case relied heavily on two U.S. Supreme Court decisions, Regan v. Taxation with Representation (1983) and Jimmy Swaggart Ministries v. Board of Equalization (1990). In Regan, the high court held that 501(c)(3) status provides a monetary benefit to certain tax-exempt organizations because it allows their donors to take a tax deduction for contributions. Therefore, the court concluded, the 1954 amendment does not violate the Free Speech Clause because the amendment merely withholds a speech subsidy rather than restricts speech.Similarly, in the Jimmy Swaggart Ministries case, the Supreme Court held that a tax imposed equally on all organizations does not violate the Free Exercise Clause. The court held that although the tax may increase the cost of religious activity, the tax does not impose a “substantial burden” on religious exercise because it does not prevent religious organizations from engaging in religious activity.If ADF challenged the 1954 amendment’s application to religious organizations, I think it is very likely that a court would agree with the Branch Ministries decision and reject the challenge. In the years since the Regan and Jimmy Swaggart Ministries cases, there have been a number of important changes in free exercise and free speech law, but those changes have only reinforced these decisions.If the 1954 amendment was lifted for religious organizations but not for other charitable organizations, would that raise a problem under the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause, which generally prohibits the government from favoring religion over nonreligion?This is an even more difficult and complicated question than the previous one, and I could see a court going either way. On the one hand, courts usually uphold legislative efforts to relieve burdens on religious activity, even if those burdens are not so “substantial” as to require an exemption under RFRA. So if Congress lifted the 1954 amendment, courts might be inclined to defer to the legislative judgment that the amendment should not apply to religious organizations.On the other hand, courts might be more skeptical of such a religion-specific exemption from the 1954 amendment because this exemption would potentially provide religious organizations with a very significant benefit not extended to other charitable organizations. Indeed, if the 1954 amendment applied to all 501(c)(3) organizations except religious ones, those who contribute to congregations engaged in political activity would be allowed to take an income tax deduction for their contributions – thus offsetting some of the actual cost of the donation – while contributors to other political organizations would not be allowed to deduct their contributions. In other words, the government would effectively subsidize the political activities of congregations.Such a subsidy raises serious questions under the Establishment Clause. In Texas Monthly v. Bullock (1989), the Supreme Court held that a Texas law that exempted religious publications but not other publications from sales taxes violated the Establishment Clause because the exemption effectively subsidized religious publications. The court explained that although the government may alleviate special burdens on religious activity, the sales tax did not present such a special burden because it applied equally to both religious and nonreligious publications.So the Texas Monthly decision strongly suggests that lifting the 1954 amendment only for religious organizations would violate the Establishment Clause. But that doesn’t mean that the present Supreme Court would definitely find a constitutional violation if Congress lifted the restriction only for religious organizations. Indeed, because the present court has a much narrower view of the Establishment Clause than the court that decided Texas Monthly, the present court might be willing to overrule the Texas Monthly decision. The ADF is no doubt hoping that this will be the case. As I said, it’s very difficult to guess how a court would decide this issue.Report Materials

Lower-paying jobs and rapid population growth are the big reasons, the authors say. Per capita personal income in Oregon totaled $36,125 last year, 9 percent lower than the national mark of $39,626, according to a report from the Oregon Employment Department. That placed Oregon 32nd among states, its lowest ranking since the government began tracking the measure in 1929. Per capita personal income essentially is the amount of money earned per person, regardless of whether they work or not. It includes not only work earnings, but income from interest, dividends, rent and government payments such as Social Security. In the last decade, Oregon's per capita income has grown 7 percent, adjusted for inflation, while the nation's grew 12 percent, the report says. Key reasons for the expanding gap: slower earnings growth for Oregon workers and relatively rapid population growth. ""When the state's population is growing faster than the rest of the nation, we have to have more income growth to keep up,"" says report co-author Nick Beleiciks, an employment economist. ""That hasn't been happening."" Wyoming, by contrast, has seen a jump in higher paying oil and natural-gas industry jobs and has had little population growth, Beleiciks says. The District of Columbia posted the nation's highest per capita income in 2009, at $68,000, according to the study, while Mississippi had the lowest, at $30,400. Wyoming had the largest per capita income growth -- 66 percent -- between 1996 and 2009, while Michigan's 8.5 percent was the lowest. The 59,000 commuters living in Clark County but working in Oregon also pulled down Oregon's income figure. That's because the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis measures income based on place of residence. Economists call this phenomenon a ""net outflow of commuter wages."" Oregon has the nation's sixth highest net outflow, and it accounts for 17 percent of the state's income gap relative to the rest of the nation. Oregon also suffers from a higher unemployment rate, a higher rate of part-time jobs and a shorter average workweek, the report found. And Oregon business owners also earn less than counterparts elsewhere. The findings underscore Oregon's shift from a resource-based economy -- where low-skilled workers could get higher paying jobs cutting timber, fishing or working in woolen mills -- to more of a service-based economy with lower paying jobs, one expert says. ""In the old days those jobs had to be in Oregon because this is where the trees were, this is where the fish were,"" says Bill Conerly, an economics consultant in Lake Oswego. ""In the 21st century, the jobs can be anywhere, not just in Oregon. And you can't treat businesses as if they're captives."" Closing the gap won't be easy, if policymakers and economic development officials choose that as a goal, the authors warned. Even if Oregon lured 10 new employers with 1,000 jobs paying $100,000 a year, its per capita income would still be 8 percent lower than the nation's average, the report found. But there's a silver lining. The cost of living in Oregon is lower than in states with higher incomes, though not low enough to close the gap. ""People are willing to take a lower income to live in Oregon,"" Beleiciks says. Other findings: Oregon's low-wage jobs -- retail and food-service positions, for instance -- pay better than the national average. But higher earning jobs in law, management, computers and finance don't pay as well as elsewhere. The state's urban areas generate $4 out of every $5 earned. Yet the income disparity is actually worse in the state's cities. While incomes are higher in those metro centers, they consistently lag other metro areas. Only in the past decade, with the decline of the timber industry, have incomes in Oregon's rural counties fallen below the national average for rural areas. Oregon had the third-highest number of part-time workers. It also ranked in the top 10 for the number of involuntary part-time workers.

Bernie Sanders responds here live.From ABC News, a special Super Tuesday addition of This Week. Here now, chief anchor George Stephanopoulos.(END VIDEO CLIP)GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC HOST: As we come on the air this week, it's getting harder and harder to find words to describe a presidential race that's sounding more and more like a grade school playground.Just two days from Super Tuesday, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are dominating this race. Clinton trounced Bernie Sanders in South Carolina Saturday by nearly 50 points, cruising into Super Tuesday's southern states on the strength of overwhelming support from African-American voters.And with Donald Trump ahead right now in nearly all the Super Tuesday states, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz have unleashed a barrage of new attacks, trying to slow the Trump steamroller.ABC's Jon Karl is here to start us off. Good morning, Jon.JON KARL, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDETN: Good morning, George.As he appears on the verge of winning it all, Donald Trump is facing his biggest test yet, a sustained assault of personal insults, substantive attacks and mockery that looks like it could have been designed by Trump himself.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)KARL: On the campaign trail Saturday, Donald Trump predicted a Super Tuesday rout.TRUMP: Hopefully we're going to win Tennessee, we're going to win everything. I think we're even -- I think we're even really have a great chance to win Texas.KARL: And after his double digit wins in South Carolina and Nevada, some establishment Republicans finally agree he could actually win this thing.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump, he's got the momentum. I think there's more than a 50 percent chance he's the nominee.KARL: Nowhere was that hammered home more than with Friday's shocking endorsement.CHRISTIE: We need a first class president, and we're going to have it in Donald Trump.KARL: New Jersey's tough guy governor, Chris Christie, who once mocked Trump as the entertainer in chief is now in his corner.But with Trump on the verge of an insurmountable lead, Marco Rubio has decided desperate times call for desperate measures.RUBIO: Well, I don't know anything about bankrupting four times. You bankrupted four companies. I don't know anything about starting a university that was a fake university.KARL: Around the campaign, Rubio has insisted he wouldn't go after his fellow Republicans.RUBIO: And I know that there's this craving in the media for people to attack each other, but I've never been a campaign that attacks people.KARL: Now he's using Trump's playbook, mocking the frontrunner with personal insults.RUBIO: How can a person with the worst spray tan in America attack me on Twitter for wearing makeup.He said he wanted to sue me. He's going to sue me. He should sue whoever did that to his face.KARL: Besides the insult assault, Rubio has a new label for the billionaire businessman.RUBIO: He is a con artist.Con artist.I will never stop until we keep a con man from taking over the party of Reagan.KARL: Trump and his new wingman were happy to return fire.TRUMP: This lightweight Rubio, total lightweight. And little mouth on him -- bing, bing, bing. Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.CHRISTIE: When the heat was on Senator Rubio in those debates, you saw what happened. He melted. He melted.KARL: As the campaign turns into a food fight, the question is Rubio's aggressive strategy too little, too late?With so much at stake, Senator Lindsey Graham had a colorful diagnosis for the state of the Republican Party .SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: My party has gone bat (EXPLETIVE DELETED) crazy.(END VIDEOTAPE)STEPHANOPOULOS: And Jon Karl joins us now along with the rest of the roundtable.I want to start with Hugh Hewitt, Salem Radio Networks.You were in the middle of that debate on Thursday night as well. And we just heard Lindsey Graham, the Republican Party bat bleep crazy?HUGH HEWITT, CONSERVATIVE RADIO SHOW HOST: Yes, it was an interesting red wedding debate.I can't complain about the ferocity or the velocity, as Hyman Roth said in Godfather II, this is the business we have chosen. So I like covering things like that.But we are on the verge of a tipping point in the Republican Party where it could actually split for the first time. I've got a note this morning from Meg Whitman who is the finance co-chair for Chris Christie denouncing Chris Christie for political opportunism. And that's kind of a shattering thing when your finance co-chair takes a roundhouse at you.So, we are at the verge of a real meltdown in the Republican Party. It might happen Tuesday.STEPHANOPOULOS: Split in the Republican Party, Greta?GRETA VAN SUSTERN, FOX NEWS: I don't know about that.Look, you know the problem with this is it's entertaining, but it's not particularly inspirational by any of these candidates at this point.I mean we all probably shouldn't laugh and do laugh at the things that are said. You heard the audience laugh.But the Republican Party has got to come to terms with the fact that they're not inspiring, they're entertaining.STEPHANOPOULOS: And Jon Karl, trying to come to terms with Donald Trump, the real possibility he's the nominee.KARL: Absolutely. But I am told that there are at least two dozen House Republicans that have told their colleagues that they will not support Donald Trump as their nominee. So if he goes, if he solidifies this on Super Tuesday and goes on the win this nomination, he will be the leader of a very divided Republican Party, some who simply will not support him.VAN SUSTEREN: But the voters are supporting him. That's the -- you know, like all the candidates can say, or all the politicians can say we won't support him, but at least so far the voters have.STEPHANOPOULOS: Meantime on the Democratic side, Donna Brazile, that win for Hillary Clinton yesterday in South Carolina got a higher percentage of the African-American vote. Now there were three candidates eight years ago, but higher percentage than Barack Obama.DONNA BRAZILE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Everyone was surprised last night, not just by the margin, but the depth and the real excitement she had in South Carolina.Her southern firewall is intact. But as you well know, this is a race about delegates, not just winning states. And so the real question is, will she be able to replicate that in other southern states like Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi?STEPHANOPOULOS: And Katrina Vanden Heuvel, you are the editor and publisher of The Nation. You endorsed Bernie Sanders. Does he have a viable path going forward?KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL, THE NATION: Yes. I would say not so fast. Don't write Bernie Sanders's political obituary after South Carolina. There is a path ahead. 17 states vote in the next two weeks. Whatever happens, he has -- and I think he has a path -- he has injected new ideas into this campaign. He has transformed the Democratic Party. He has opened space for more progressive movements.But as Donna knows, it's way too early after South Carolina. I think he goes to the convention. This goes through May. He will have pledged delegates. And he will fight to shape the platform.STEPHANOPOULOS: And we will talk to him ahead. I want you all to stand by right now.But right now, we are going to turn to Senator Ted Cruz. He's in Arkansas this morning.Good morning, Senator.SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Good morning, George.CRUZ: Good to be with you.STEPHANOPOULOS: Thank you, Senator.Thanks for joining us this morning.New polls out this morning show you're looking pretty good in Texas, but Donald Trump is strong in so many other Super Tuesday states.If he wins everywhere else, how can you prevent him from getting the the nomination?CRUZ: Well, I think Super Tuesday is going to be the most important day of this entire primary. And -- and it is, right now we're in -- we're in a strong position in Texas and we're running neck and neck with Donald in states throughout Super Tuesday.And I think it really depends on turnout. If conservatives come out and vote on Super Tuesday, we're going to have a strong day.I also depends, George, you know, 65 percent of Republicans believe that -- that Donald Trump is not the best candidate to go head-to-head with Hillary Clinton, that Donald Trump loses to Hillary Clinton.And -- and the only candidate that has beaten Donald Trump, the only candidate that can beat Donald Trump is me. And so I think more and more Republicans who are recognizing Donald Trump is not the right person for us to nominate. If we come together and stand united on Super Tuesday, we're going to have a good election night.STEPHANOPOULOS: But, you know, you talk about that support from conservatives, but the fact is that in most of those states, Donald Trump is winning among conservatives, winning among your strong base of Evangelical Christians.CRUZ: Well, you know, I think the debate last week really started to show some significant differences. And -- and in particular, the difference you saw is -- is you saw Washington deal makers -- listen, it's Washington deal makers that have gotten us in this mess.And Donald promises yet more deals with Democrats. Remember, Donald is someone who has contributed financially to Jimmy Carter, to John Kerry, to Hillary Clinton, to Chuck Schumer.He is someone who had funded open border Democrats for 40 years and -- and, indeed, one of the striking things, you know, Donald talks a lot about immigration, but in the 2013 battle over amnesty, when I was leading the fight against the Rubio-Schumer Gang of Eight amnesty bill and we defeated it in Congress, Donald Trump was funding the Gang of Eight. Five of the eight members of the Gang of Eight received, collectively, over $50,000 from Donald Trump.And you can't be funding open border Democrats, like Donald Trump did, and, at the same time be claiming that you're actually going to secure the border and stop illegal immigration.STEPHANOPOULOS: You've been making that point about Donald Trump supporting Democrats for -- for several weeks right now. It doesn't seem to be sticking.Why not?CRUZ: Well, listen, I know we're seeing real movement in the polls. We won in Iowa and -- and I think on Super Tuesday, we're going to have a good night. You know, I've got to say, George, it was striking at the debate this week when Donald Trump disagreed with me. He disagreed with me, number one, on Israel. He said that America should be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians. I strongly disagree with him on that.If I am president, America will stand unapologetically with Israel.But he also disagreed with me on the Supreme Court and religious liberty. He said, Ted, you've got to be willing to cut deals, you've got to be willing to compromise.I'll tell you right now and I'll tell the people at home, I am not going to compromise on ""The Bill of Rights."" I'm not going to bargain away your religious liberty. I'm not going to bargain away your Second Amendment rights and sit down with Harry Reid or Chuck Schumer and agree on Supreme Court nominees. we need a president who will invest the political capital to defend your -- your constitutional liberties. And Donald Trump told us at the debate he doesn't intend to do that. There's a reason Harry Reid, when asked about the Republican field, said the Republican he likes the best is Donald Trump, and he said, because I can work with him. He'll cut deals.We've had too many deals in Washington. It's way we're bankrupting our kids and grandkids.STEPHANOPOULOS: You've made a big issue of Donald Trump's taxes, now released summaries of your own returns.If he releases those some kind of summaries, will that be enough?And -- and what do you think of his -- his statement that he believes he might be targeted by the IRS because he's a Christian.CRUZ: Well, I -- I think his statement, nobody who heard it had any reaction other than laughter. Listen, I've released now nine years of taxes. Donald Trump has not released any of his tax information. He needs to release his tax information.And -- and the fact that he's refusing to do so really suggests, as Mitt Romney pointed out, that there may be a bombshell in there, that there's something he's hiding.Now -- now, it could be an awful lot of media...STEPHANOPOULOS: What do you think it is?CRUZ: -- outlets have reported -- well, a lot of media outlets have reported that he doesn't make nearly as much money as he says he does.You know, who knows, maybe -- maybe the -- the fact is that Mitt Romney is richer than Donald Trump. We don't know. But -- but he's clearly hiding something.On the other hand, it could be donations to liberal groups like Planned Parenthood. At every debate, it seems, he praises Planned Parenthood. Maybe he's written them a bunch of checks. Or -- or, you know, maybe there are other issues. You know -- you know, for example, there have been multiple media reports about Donald's business dealings with the mob, with the Mafia. Now maybe his tax returns show that those business dealings are a lot more extensive than has been reported...STEPHANOPOULOS: Business dealings with the Mafia?CRUZ: We don't know -- indeed. ABC has reported that. You guys have reported that he's -- he's done deals with S&A Concrete, which was owned by two of the big crime families in New York, and that he's had involvement in Atlantic City. Maybe that's what his tax returns show.We don't know, but the important point is, George, in the general election, Hillary Clinton is going to shine a light on all of this. And Republican primary voters deserve to know. And the media is going to amplify the Democrats' attacks a thousand fold.The Republican primary voters deserve to know if there's a scandal, if there is, at Mitt Romney put it, a bombshell in Donald Trump's taxes, we deserve to know, the voters deserve to know and to vet the candidates.STEPHANOPOULOS: You know, elected officials are in -- Republicans are getting increasingly nervous and -- and some are even calling on you -- Representative Franks from Arkansas, from -- from Arizona, excuse me -- to join forces with Senator Rubio in a joint ticket.Here's what he had to say, ""Senator Rubio and Senator criticize can unite and win together or remain apart and each fail separately. For the sake of our country, the conservative cause and future generations, I adjure both Senator Clinton and Senator Rubio to unite.CRUZ: Well, listen, I agree with the sentiment that -- that to beat Donald Trump, we've got to come together. What Donald wants is -- is all of us who are -- who are convinced Donald is not the right nominee to be divided, to be splintered. And -- and looking at this race, only one candidate has beaten Donald Trump. Historically, in modern times, nobody has ever won the nomination who hasn't won one of the first three states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina.Only two of us have done that, me and Donald.And if you look at Super Tuesday, we're the only campaign in a position to beat Donald on Super Tuesday.So if you're at home and -- and you don't think Donald is the right candidate, you think nominating Donald will end up electing Hillary Clinton, then even if, perhaps, you -- you look another candidate -- listen, there are a lot of good people in this race who I like and respect, but I would encourage you to stand with us, because the only way to beat Donald is for us to stand together on Super Tuesday.STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Cruz, it sounds like you're not ready to unite with Marco Rubio now, but thank you for joining us this morning.And we're live next with Chris Christie in a THIS WEEK exclusive.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), NEW JERSEY: I am proud to be here to endorse Donald Trump for President of the United States. He'll provide strong, unequivocal leadership. He will do what needs to be done to protect the American people first and foremost, both in the homeland and in creating jobs for this country. And he will make sure that people around the world know that America keeps its word again. Donald Trump is someone who, when he makes a promise, he keeps it.(END VIDEO CLIP)STEPHANOPOULOS: And Chris Christie is here this morning with us here on THIS WEEK.Thank you for joining us, Governor. And let's begin.You heard Hugh Hewitt at the top of the program read from that Meg Whitman statement. Your national finance co-chair says that your endorsement of Donald Trump, an astonishing display of political opportunism.She goes on to say Donald Trump is unfit to be president. He's a dishonest demagogue who plays to our worst fears. I call on Christie donors and supporters to reject the governor and Donald Trump outright. I believe they will. For some of us, principle and country still matter.CHRISTIE: Well, listen, I love Meg Whitman. She's a great friend to me and to Mary Pat, always has been. We obviously, from that statement, have a difference of political opinion. And that's OK. That's what makes this country great is that people can have differences of political opinion.And so Meg has always been free to express her views and I honor her. And we absolutely adore our relationship with her and I'm sure it'll continue.STEPHANOPOULOS: Some of your supporters say you promised them you would not endorse Donald Trump. Joe McQuaid (ph), the publisher of the ""New Hampshire Union Leader"" says you promised him on a phone call you wouldn’t endorse Donald Trump.CHRISTIE: Not, it's just not true. He called me two days after the primary and said, I was just hold that you're about to endorse Donald Trump. And I said to him, that's absolutely untrue. I'm not about to endorse anybody.But that's all the conversation --STEPHANOPOULOS: You didn't say you would never endorse him?CHRISTIE: No.STEPHANOPOULOS: OK, let's --(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: -- wasn't going to endorse him then; that's what he -- you know, New Hampshire person on the ground tell him that. And I said, Joe, it's two days after the primary. Mary Pat and I are just taking a deep breath. We haven't thought about what we're going to do next in this race.STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's talk about the policy in this campaign right now.During your campaign, you ran as a straight-talking truth-teller, specific answers to America's challenges. And here's what you tried -- you told voters to question Mr. Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRISTIE: I tell everybody who goes to a Donald Trump event, if he gets asked a question, just ask him how. First, he says he's going to build a wall across the entire border between the United States and Mexico.How?How is he going to make the Mexicans pay for the wall?How?They are a sovereign nation.(END VIDEO CLIP)STEPHANOPOULOS: You're backing him now.What's the answer?CHRISTIE: The answer is he will do it --STEPHANOPOULOS: How?CHRISTIE: -- the fact -- the fact is that he's going to have to answer that question. And he will.You know, George, this is a February -- this is February of a campaign. And let's say this. You look at everybody else on that stage -- and there have been many more specifics from a lot of other folks on that stage. And that was part of my argument during the campaign. But there I am, as somebody who's --(CROSSTALK)STEPHANOPOULOS: Wait, wait a second. We're eight months into this campaign. The wall has been his signature issue. He says it's his go-to line whenever he needs applause. You've now had the Mexican president, two former Mexican presidents, the Mexican foreign minister in ""The Washington Post"" this morning, calls this a racist, ignorant and absurd proposal.You know that Mexico's not going to pay.CHRISTIE: Well, listen, George, I'm -- that's -- what would you expect Mexico to say?That's of course what they're going to say.And the --(CROSSTALK)STEPHANOPOULOS: How is Donald Trump going to force Mexico to pay?CHRISTIE: Listen, I think that there is great ways to be able to use diplomacy and other tools to be able to come to compromise with nations that are both our neighbors and around the world.And we're working on those things. And that's what leadership does. Strong leadership is able to exert those things and be able to talk to folks about what advantages and disadvantages are of certain policies.The fact of the matter is that there won't be any question about Mr. Trump's strength and his resoluteness in terms of getting the things done that he's wanted to get done. That's what his whole career is --STEPHANOPOULOS: But what's the answer to the how? That's the --(CROSSTALK)CHRISTIE: And this is the thing that I said. And he will answer that question. But you know, to me, I'm not answering the question for him this morning. That's his -- that's the way he will answer it.STEPHANOPOULOS: But he hasn't answered it.CHRISTIE: Listen, I think what he's talked about is the trade relationship and working on the trade relationship and he talked about that yesterday. And using that as a lever to get them to do things on immigration. And I think that's a perfectly appropriate way to discuss this and it is a part of the bilateral relationship that should be a part of the conversation --STEPHANOPOULOS: Before you were opposed to terrorists. That's what he's talking about.CHRISTIE: Listen, I'm not saying -- I'm not going to support everything that happens in any campaign. But what I will tell you is is that an appropriate conversation between two countries, there are all types of appropriate conversations to have between two countries. And that's what will happen when Mr. Trump's president.STEPHANOPOULOS: Your signature issue in the campaign was entitlement reform. You've been talking about it for years. You say reforming Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are essential. It's time for a candidate who speaks hard truth.Donald Trump is the only candidate said he's not going to touch Social Security. Here's what you said about that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRISTIE: I say Mr. Trump, what would you do on Social Security?When I become president, the entire country is going to get so wealthy, so amazingly wealthy and rich, that we're not going to have to worry about Social Security.(LAUGHTER)(END VIDEO CLIP)STEPHANOPOULOS: Again, the question is, how?CHRISTIE: Yes. And listen, I think that we need to do something on Social Security. And I've made that really clear. And so listen, Donald Trump and I are not going to agree on every issue.STEPHANOPOULOS: But this is the signature...CHRISTIE: And this...STEPHANOPOULOS: -- issue of your campaign.CHRISTIE: But it doesn't mean that you have to agree on every issue, George. Just -- it's not the signature issue of my campaign. The signature issue of my campaign was national security, keeping America safe and secure from terrorist attacks and making us a better ally and neighbor around the world. That was the signature issue (INAUDIBLE).STEPHANOPOULOS: I want to get to that...CHRISTIE: Now, Social Security is an important issue. And I've laid out my views on that and I'll certainly share my views with the candidate.The fact of the matter is, though, when you look up on that stage, no one else has a plan on Social Security, George.STEPHANOPOULOS: But he said...CHRISTIE: No one -- no one...STEPHANOPOULOS: -- at the debate on Thursday at the end...CHRISTIE: -- no one else has a plan on Social Security.So why aren't we testing all these other candidates, as well...STEPHANOPOULOS: I've -- I've asked all the candidates...CHRISTIE: -- on that -- on that issue?STEPHANOPOULOS: -- about this question...CHRISTIE: And none of them...STEPHANOPOULOS: -- on that issue.CHRISTIE: -- and none of them have an answer.STEPHANOPOULOS: But the question, at the debate on Thursday night, he said the answer on Social Security is eliminating waste, fraud and abuse.In all of your speeches, you said that's not an answer, we need hard truths.CHRISTIE: Listen, I've given my answer on Social Security, George, so I'm not saying -- I'm not disagreeing with what you're saying.What I'm saying to you is that...STEPHANOPOULOS: But you're disagreeing with Donald Trump.CHRISTIE: Well, what I'm saying is that he's going to give more complete answers as time goes on on these issues. And -- and let's hold every candidate to that same standard. Let's hold every candidate to that same standard.The difference in this -- in this race is that some members of the media, and others, want to hold Mr. Trump to a different standard than they want to hold the other candidates to.Let's get Senator Rubio, Senator Cruz...STEPHANOPOULOS: Don't you think they have been more specific...CHRISTIE: -- let's get Governor Kasich...STEPHANOPOULOS: -- than Donald Trump?CHRISTIE: Not on Social Security, they have not. Absolutely not, sir. I'm the only person who put out a specific plan on Social Security. So let's hold everybody to the same standard. And -- and I'm happy to do that.STEPHANOPOULOS: But just to be clear, you do not believe that you can solve the problem of Social Security by eliminating waste, fraud and abuse?CHRISTIE: No, I -- I put out what my plan is on Social Security. And, by the way, that was on a bigger issue. His answer on that was on paying for a tax cut. That was not just on Social Security. It was on paying for a tax cut.STEPHANOPOULOS: He's said that on Social Security many times.But I do want to get to national security, because you're right, you did talk about that and made that a central issue of your campaign, as well. And one of the core issues that Donald Trump has been this ban on having Muslims enter America.Here's what you said about that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRISTIE: The idea of banning all Muslims from this country is ridiculous. And the reason it's ridiculous is because you don't need to do that to make America safe.When Donald Trump said that, he was dead wrong. And he's dead wrong now.(END VIDEO CLIP)STEPHANOPOULOS: Is he dead wrong now?CHRISTIE: Listen, and that's not what he says any longer. He's backed off of that position over the course of time.STEPHANOPOULOS: Only for citizens.CHRISTIE: Over the -- well, but that's a big difference, George. That's a big difference from what his position...STEPHANOPOULOS: He's still banning Muslims...CHRISTIE: -- was.STEPHANOPOULOS: -- from coming into the United States.CHRISTIE: It's a big difference from where the position was and -- and what we need to do for...STEPHANOPOULOS: So you endorse the one he has now?CHRISTIE: -- (INAUDIBLE) excuse me. Let me answer, George.What we need to do is have a coherent national security policy that's very clear, that says that we need to go after folks who want to do harm to this country. And having good, competent law enforcement. Mr. Trump has talked about the idea of making sure we restore NSA authority, he's -- which some people in this race have not been in favor of, like Senator Cruz.He has stood up and said that he wants to make our military stronger, which we need to do. He's stood up for law enforcement in ways that other candidates in this race have not done.So let's not just take one section of it and make that the entire national security policy. There's been a lot of other conversations about it.And by the way, I'll continue to have conversations with him about this as the campaign goes forward, to be able to make all of these things more fulsome.But we're, again, at the end of February, George. This is the -- Donald Trump is going to...STEPHANOPOULOS: (INAUDIBLE) June?CHRISTIE: -- Donald Trump is going to be the Republican nominee for president of the United States. And he is going to bring this race to Hillary Clinton. He is the best candidate to beat Hillary Clinton in November and the best candidate to restore national security for our country.STEPHANOPOULOS: But -- but on -- on the Muslim ban, are you saying now that you endorse the ban on having non-citizen Muslims...CHRISTIE: No, that's not what I'm saying.STEPHANOPOULOS: -- (INAUDIBLE) from the United States?CHRISTIE: I'm saying that that's only one piece of an overall approach to national security.STEPHANOPOULOS: But you disagree with it?CHRISTIE: So I -- I said that very plainly. Listen, George, here's the bottom line. Elections are choices. And you look at the candidates up on the stage and you decide all things considered, who's the best choice.You know, I tell voters this all the time, if you want to vote for the candidate who you agree with 100 percent of the time, go home and look in the mirror.STEPHANOPOULOS: But -- but I...CHRISTIE: You're the only person you agree with 100 percent of the time, whether it's you or me.So you can -- we can sit here this morning and play the game of everything that -- I ran against the guy, so of course there's things that I disagree with him on. But this is now a choice. And of the candidates remaining on that stage, he is the best person to beat Hillary Clinton, which is job one for Republicans. We do not want Hillary Clinton in the White House. He is the best person to beat her and he is the best person to help keep America safe.STEPHANOPOULOS: But to do what?I've just pointed out three of the biggest issues in this campaign, the ones he talks about all the time. You disagree with him on all those issues.So when you say he's going to do what needs to be done, what exactly are you talking about?CHRISTIE: Well, listen, I'm talking about a whole bunch of things.First of all, George, we haven't even touched on the economy. And I think he's got a really solid record and job -- to help create jobs in this country and to make the tax code fairer, to make opportunity better, to lower regulation. He has laid out those plans.The fact is, he's going to do some things for this economy that need to be done to make America safer, not only from a national security perspective, but for people to invest in America again...STEPHANOPOULOS: Besides his tax plan...CHRISTIE: -- and create jobs.STEPHANOPOULOS: -- what are you referring to?CHRISTIE: Well, this -- he's -- he's laid out a plan on regularity reform, to lower regulations in this country. He's talked about the idea of making sure that small business folks are empowered in this country once again, to be able to create jobs for people.There -- there has been a lot of things that have been laid out tin this campaign, um, that -- that merit real consideration and real support.And -- and we're not going to agree on every issue. But I wouldn't agree if I were here this morning supporting any of the other candidates that remain on the stage. We would have some major disagreements with each other, because we ran against each other.But let me tell you, they're minor disagreements compared to what is going to happen if we have Hillary Clinton as president of the United States, who is moving so far to the left to beat Bernie Sanders that I don't know which one is the socialist, Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders.STEPHANOPOULOS: Finally, you...CHRISTIE: -- they're both now.STEPHANOPOULOS: -- finally, you talk about Donald Trump as the person who can be trusted. He still maintains that he saw thousands of people celebrating in New Jersey after the 9/11 attacks. You said that didn't happen, it was not factual.So if he continues to hold that position, isn't that a slander of your state citizens?CHRISTIE: Now, listen, I don't think he means it as that at all, as a slander of my state's citizens. You, what I think, though, is when I say he's -- can be trusted, this is a guy who, when he makes promises, he keeps them. Um, and I've seen that over the course of a 14 year relationship with him.I didn't just meet Donald Trump on the debate stage in August, George, of 2000 and -- and 15. I met Donald Trump in 2002 and have been friends with him since that time and gotten to know him. And the American people out there, you've listened to what's happening, George. The American people see him. They see someone who's strong, who's resolute, who's tough, who is not part of the Washington, DC establishment, that has really messed this country up and disappointed our people, both sides of the aisle.He's going to go down there and take an entirely different approach. That's an approach that America needs. And given the other options on the stage, let me tell you something, he's the strongest, best guy to be our nominee to beat Hillary Clinton and to be the next president of the United States.STEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Christie, thanks for joining us this morning.CHRISTIE: Thank you, George.STEPHANOPOULOS: Lots more ahead with our powerhouse roundtable.Plus, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley and Bernie Sanders join us live.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)STEPHANOPOULOS: We are joined now by Governor Nikki Haley of South Carolina who has endorsed Senator Rubio.Thank you for joining us, Governor Haley.We just heard Marco Rubio say he's going to stay in as long as it takes. But right now, we're looking at these Super Tuesday states. He's behind in every single state right now, has not won a single state yet. How can he go on if he's 0 for 15?GOV. NIKKI HALEY, (R) SOUTH CAROLINA: Oh, this is what we do in elections. You keep fighting until the very end. And that's why you're seeing him do rallies three and four times a day. You don't know until election day. And I think we've seen that in every state. There's been some surprises. And he continues to surprise in every state that he comes to.And if you look at his rallies, they're getting bigger and bigger. And the most amazing part is look at who is in the rallies: young, old, all races, all types of people. He has is really starting a conservative movement that's picking up a lot of people we haven't seen in a long time.STEPHANOPOULOS: You seem to call out Donald Trump in your response to the State of the Union back in January. But it wasn't until this week that we really saw Marco Rubio take on Mr. Trump. Did he wait too long?HALEY: I don't know if he waited too long, but I'll tell you Donald Trump is everything we hear and teach our kids not to do in kindergarten. And we have seen this behavior over and over again that's unacceptable. And I think what we saw from Marco is exactly what we tell our children also, if a bully hits you, you hit back.I think he hit back and he showed that's he's willing to lead. He's willing to fight. And he's going to have the passion to do it.STEPHANOPOULOS: Some would say he's stooping to the same level.HALEY: I don't know if you stoop to the same level. What you don't do is you walk away from it. I mean, again, when a bully comes after you, you go back.I think he punched. I think he punched hard. I think it was on policy. I think he made sure that everybody understood that there are a lot of questions that Donald Trump hasn't answered. It is amazing. I'm going to count it. You could be undergoing an audit. There's no reason he can't release last year's tax returns. Why is he not doing that?And you look at all these issues, this is one more project that Donald Trump is doing. Trump University, Trump Vodka, Trump Airlines, Trump Mortage all failed projects. This is one more project. And we're really concerned about where that's going to be.And I think it's right for Marco to bring those things out and to keep on bringing those out.STEPHANOPOULOS: What will a win for Donald Trump in the nomination fight mean for your party?HALEY: Well, it's scary. I mean, this is where we think these next few states matter, because it will start to ask him the questions and get the answers.You know, he's -- there are two presidential candidates right now undergoing legal issues: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. There's two presidential candidates that are disclosing information: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. And we need to make sure we get that. What we know right now is, we've got a candidate that's being accused of fraud with Trump University. We've got students that have a lawsuit against him.We're seeing a lot of things from Donald Trump with no answers. I've seen him talk about being for universal health care. I've seen him talk about wanting to do things and he's not giving us the answers for it.So, I think what he'll do the Republican Party is really make us question who we are and what we're about. And that's something we don't want to see happen.STEPHANOPOULOS: You just heard Governor Christie say one of the big reasons he's supporting Donald Trump he think he's the only candidate, the only candidate left in this race, who can defeat Hillary Clinton.HALEY: That's just no true. I mean, Chris is a dear friend, but none of us understand why he did this.What I will tell you is, Donald Trump can't be Hillary Clinton. His negatives are so high, his cap is at 35 percent. It is impossible for him to win a general. And so that's why we've said Marco Rubio is the only one that can defeat Donald Trump. And Marco Rubio can beat Hillary Clinton and will win in November.STEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Haley, thanks for joining us this morning.HALEY: Thank you so much, George.STEPHANOPOULOS: We're joined now by Bernie Sanders. He joins us this morning.Thank you for joining us, Senator Sanders. Appreciate you being with us this morning.So what do you make of what happened in South Carolina last night. Nearly a 50 point win for Senator Clinton -- Secretary Clinton.SANDERS: We got decimated, George. We got decimated. The only positive thing for us is we won the actually -- the 29 years of age and younger vote. And that was good. But we got killed.But I'm in Minnesota now. We think we're going to do very well in Minnesota on Super Tuesday, Colorado we're going to do well, Oklahoma we're going to do well. I think we're going to win in Massachusetts. And I believe we're going to win in Vermont. And we're going to do better than people think in other states.George, we began this campaign, as you know, at 3 percent in the polls, 60 or 70 points behind Secretary Clinton. We have come a very long way. Our message about a rigged economy -- rich get richer, everyone else gets poorer -- is resonating.And I'll tell you what else is resonating, a corrupt campaign finance system that's allowing billionaires to buy elections.I think we have the momentum. I think it's going to be a tough fight. I think we can win this thing.STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, and Senator Sanders, from the very start you've been a straight talker to come right out and say you were decimated. You're continuing that tradition as well.Let me just follow up on South Carolina for one second. You saw that vote in the African-American community, something like 85 percent for Hillary Clinton. You've got going forward about 25 percent of the voters in the Democratic primaries are African-Americans. Aren't you going to have to do much better, reach out to that community, to have a chance for this nomination?SANDERS: Yes. Absolutely. But I do think -- no argument with you. You are correct. But I think you're going to see us doing -- and I think the polls indicated it, much better within the African-American community outside of the deep south. You're going to see us much better in New York State where I think we have a shot to win, in California and in Michigan.But you're right, we're going to have to do a lot better.But I think what we are doing is putting together a coalition of working class people, of young people, of many other folks who understand that economy today is not working for the middle class, it's working for the people on top, people who have strong reservations about Secretary Clinton's foreign policy, a vote the war in Iraq.So we think we have come a long way; we think we've got a lot of work in front of us. But, George, I think we can win this.STEPHANOPOULOS: Looking ahead to Super Tuesday, new polls out this morning show Secretary Clinton with large leads in those Southern states you just talked about: Texas, Tennessee and Georgia. She's going to build up delegates there.You're going to win big in your home state of Vermont.Where else can you win on Super Tuesday?And if you don't win in other states, how can you go on?SANDERS: Well, we're going to go on to California, by the way, where we think we have a real shot and where most -- that's the state with the most delegates -- Barb Reich (ph), former Clinton Secretary of Labor, just endorsed me the other day. I think we have a good chance to win in Massachusetts. In Massachusetts, a lot of young people are burdened with this outrageous student debt. The young people and their parents want public colleges and universities, to be tuition free and they want the wealthy and large corporations to start paying their fair share of taxes.We were in Oklahoma the other day, in Tulsa. We had a wonderful, wonderful turnout. We're going to Oklahoma City later today. We were in Texas just yesterday, George. We had 10,000 people out in Austin; 8,000 people out in Dallas. It's a tough state for us. But I think we're going to do better than that polling indicated.So I think we have a shot to win a number of states on Super Tuesday, do better than people thought and think in other states. And I think in some of the larger states like Michigan, New York State, California, we've got a shot to win those states.STEPHANOPOULOS: And as you say, on to California; thanks for joining us this morning, Senator Sanders.SANDERS: Thank you."

Gov. Terry McAuliffe will no longer have to answer questions about his potential role in a Clinton administration. And U.S. Rep. Robert C. Bobby Scott and a handful of Republican hopefuls can shelve their battle plans for a special election to fill Kaines seat.As Donald Trumps stunning victory over Hillary Clinton rocks national politics, few states are feeling the consequences as swiftly as Virginia.Kaines failure to ascend to the vice presidency simplifies Virginias electoral calendar, but Trumps win shook up the 2017 governors race thats already underway.Corey Stewart, a 2017 GOP gubernatorial hopeful who served as chairman of Trumps Virginia campaign for almost a year but was fired last month for aggressively protesting the Republican National Committee, declared in an interview that Trumps victory propels him to frontrunner status for the GOP nomination. He attacked Republican rival Ed Gillespie, an early leader in gubernatorial fundraising and endorsements, as being insufficiently loyal to the president-elect.Ed Gillespie treated Donald Trump like he had typhoid, Stewart said. He would not appear with him on stage. He would not mention his name unless he was condemning him.A former Republican National Committee chairman, Gillespie has kept his distance from Trump while voicing support for the GOP ticket. He introduced Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, Trumps running mate, at two rallies, but was noticeably absent from the Trump campaigns Virginia leadership committee that included the other two Republican gubernatorial candidates, Rep. Robert J. Wittman, R-1st, and state Sen. Frank W. Wagner, R-Virginia Beach.In a statement, Chris Leavitt, executive director of Gillespies political action committee, said Gillespies support for the Trump-Pence ticket was clear from the beginning.Nows the time to bring our country and party together, but once again Corey is putting his personal political ambitions first, Leavitt said. And if he wants to anoint himself, thats fine. We see how well Hillary Clintons coronation went.With no U.S. Senate vacancy for McAuliffe to fill, the governors race will unfold without the added drama of a special election for Kaines seat. McAuliffes pick would have had to defend the seat in a special election next year and again in 2018 when it comes up for its regularly scheduled election.Scott, D-3rd, was widely seen as the favorite to get the nod from McAuliffe, who declined to publicly discuss Senate prospects until after Election Day.Wittman was rumored to be considering switching to run for Kaines Senate seat if it came open. A spokesman said Wednesday that his plans for 2017 remain the same, adding that Wittman is thrilled to be a part of the chance that Republican victories in the House, Senate and White House represent. Wittman was easily re-elected to his congressional seat Tuesday.With the Senate seat now a moot point for next year, all eyes will be on the governors race.Virginias race is expected to draw national interest as one of only two gubernatorial races along with New Jerseys scheduled for what will be Trumps first year as president.Though Clinton lost nationally, she won Virginia by roughly 5 points, continuing the streak of statewide wins for Democrats. She ran up large margins in the key counties of Fairfax, Loudoun, Prince William and Henrico, a sign that Democrats hold demographic advantages that Republicans have struggled to overcome in state races.The Republican candidate for governor who is selected in a June primary will face Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph S. Northam. Democrats have sought to link the four Republican candidates to Trump. The Democratic Party of Virginia launched a website late last month intended to hold Republican gubernatorial candidates accountable for supporting and enabling the most dangerous candidate to ever be nominated by a major party.But instead of Trump serving as a past embarrassment for Republicans looking to move on, Trump will have taken up residence across the Potomac as Virginians choose a new leader.In a statement, Northam congratulated Trump and said he was disappointed in the result but proud of Clinton and Kaine.We will continue to advocate for our values like defending womens access to reproductive health care and equality while building on our economic progress by focusing on workforce development, attracting new industries and promoting our quality of life, Northam said.Stewart, a Prince William supervisor, said he hopes to implement the Trump agenda on a state level by cracking down on illegal immigration, replacing the Affordable Care Act and scrapping regulations on businesses.But Stewarts decision to take part in a protest outside the RNCs headquarters in Washington seems to have burned bridges with the Trump campaign.Mike Rubino, the Trump campaigns Virginia state director, said Stewart acted like a petulant child and hurt Trumps chances by dividing the party.He constantly pitted people against each other, Rubino said. He was actively running for governor on my bosss coattails while my boss was seeking the highest office in the land. That, to me, is disloyalty.Stewart called his alliance with Trump a Hail Mary pass thats now paying off.Ive embraced Trump and defended him when other people wouldnt, Stewart said. And I believe that loyalty will be returned.#inform-video-player-3 .inform-embed { margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; }

Today’s indictments clearly demonstrates that Vladimir Putin is neither a Democrat nor a Republican – this is not a partisan issue, and we cannot allow a foreign country to actively interfere in our political dialogue and divide us as a nation against each other.
http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/jan/07/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-state-can-severely/	"	The state is able to sharply curtail contract bargaining rights for state employee unions."	mostly true	['Jobs', 'Labor', 'State Budget']	http://www.nytimes.com/	http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/04/business/04labor.html?_r=1&emc=eta1	2011/01/07	“We can no longer live in a society where the public employees are the haves and taxpayers who foot the bills are the have-nots,” Mr. Walker, a Republican, said in a speech. Many of the proposals may never become law. But those that do are likely to reduce union influence in election campaigns, with reverberations for both parties. In the 2010 elections, Republicans emerged with seven more governor’s mansions and won control of the legislature in 26 states, up from 14. That swing has put unions more on the defensive than they have been in decades. But it is not only Republicans who are seeking to rein in unions. In addition to Mr. Cuomo, California’s new Democratic governor, Jerry Brown, is promising to review the benefits received by government workers in his state, which faces a more than $20 billion budget shortfall over the next 18 months. “We will also have to look at our system of pensions and how to ensure that they are transparent and actuarially sound and fair — fair to the workers and fair to the taxpayers,” Mr. Brown said in his inaugural speech on Monday. Many of the state officials pushing for union-related changes say they want to restore some balance, arguing that unions have become too powerful, skewing political campaigns with their large war chests and throwing state budgets off kilter with their expensive pension plans. But labor leaders view these efforts as political retaliation by Republicans upset that unions recently spent more than $200 million to defeat Republican candidates. “I see this as payback for the role we played in the 2010 elections,” said Gerald W. McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the main union of state employees. Mr. McEntee said in October that his union was spending more than $90 million on the campaign, largely to help Democrats. “Now there’s a bull’s-eye on our back, and they’re out to inflict pain,” he said. In an internal memorandum, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. warned that in 16 states, Republican lawmakers would seek to starve public sector unions of money by requiring each government worker to “opt in” before that person’s dues money could be used for political activities. “In the long run, if these measures deprive unions of resources, it will cut them off at their knees. They’ll melt away,” said Charles E. Wilson, a law professor at Ohio State University. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Of all the new governors, John Kasich, Republican of Ohio, appears to be planning the most comprehensive assault against unions. He is proposing to take away the right of 14,000 state-financed child care and home care workers to unionize. He also wants to ban strikes by teachers, much the way some states bar strikes by the police and firefighters. “If they want to strike, they should be fired,” Mr. Kasich said in a speech. “They’ve got good jobs, they’ve got high pay, they get good benefits, a great retirement. Mr. Kasich also wants to eliminate a requirement that the state pay union-scale wages to construction workers on public contracts, even if the contractors are nonunion. In addition, he would like to ban the use of binding arbitration to settle disputes between the state and unions representing government employees. Labor leaders, who argue that government employees are not overpaid, worry that many of these measures have a much better chance of enactment than in previous years because of Republican electoral gains and recession-ravaged taxpayers’ reduced sympathy toward government workers. It pointed in particular to six states, including several former union strongholds, where Republicans control the governor’s mansion and both houses of the legislature: Indiana, Maine, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Naomi Walker, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.’s director of state government relations, said many voters would oppose the antiunion efforts. “I think folks in these states are going to ask whether this is the right time to weaken unions when corporations are amassing more power than ever,” she said. “We’ve been fighting against privatizing Social Security and sending jobs offshore and to get the best deal for the unemployed. Union leaders particularly dread the spread of right-to-work laws, which prevail in 22 states, almost all in the South or West. Under such laws, unions and employers cannot require workers to join a union or pay any dues or fees to unions to represent them. Unions complain that such laws allow workers in unionized workplaces to reap the benefits of collective bargaining without paying for it. Pointing to lower wages in right-to-work states, unions say the laws lead to worse wages and benefits by weakening unions. But lawmakers who are pushing right-to-work laws argue that they help attract investment. “The folks who work day-to-day in economic development tell us that the No. 1 thing we can do to make Indiana more attractive to business is to make Indiana a right-to-work state,” said Jerry Torr, an Indiana state representative who backs such legislation. Some union leaders say that proposals like right-to-work laws, which have little effect on state budgets, show that Republicans are using budget woes as a pretext to undercut unions. “They’re throwing the kitchen sink at us,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. A group composed of Republican state lawmakers and corporate executives, the American Legislative Exchange Council, is quietly spreading these proposals from state to state, sending e-mails about the latest efforts as well as suggested legislative language. Michael Hough, director of the council’s commerce task force, said the aim of these measures was not political, but to reduce labor’s swollen power. “Government budgets have grown and grown because of the cost of employees’ pensions and salaries,” he said. A version of this article appears in print on January 4, 2011, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Strained States Turning to Laws To Curb Unions.

Rubio fundraiser to ask why he is putting fossil fuel industry donations above his constituents’ safetyORLANDO, FL — Senator Marco Rubio hasn’t held a town hall in months — saying his constituents “get rude and stupid” at them — so earlier this evening, 19 year old constituent September Porras made her way into his fundraiser to ask him why he’s taking his cues from the fossil fuel executives bankrolling his campaign rather than the people of Florida who face the threat of climate change every day. [ Video ]In 2016 alone, Senator Rubio received $753,201 from the oil and gas industry, second only to Ted Cruz, and has refused to accept the scientific consensus that climate change poses a serious threat to Floridians’ health, safety, and economic security.“This is personal for me,” said Orlando resident September Porras, 19. “My father and grandmother both work outside and each year they work in hotter and more dangerous conditions. My family should be worth more to Senator Rubio than oil and gas industry money.“Rubio keeps putting the interests of the fossil fuel industry CEOs and lobbyists who bankroll his campaigns over everyday Floridians who are scared about what climate change means for our communities,” she added.“We could create tens of millions of jobs for working people stopping climate change and protecting Americans’ health and safety, but politicians like Mr. Rubio and the corrupt CEOs backing them are holding us back,” said Varshini Prakash, a spokesperson for Sunrise. “If they don’t clean up their act, we will replace them with real leaders who will fight for the health and wellbeing of all people.”Throughout the Congressional Recess this August, Sunrise members around the country will be at town halls and fundraisers to #ShineALight on the corruption and negligence of elected officials and call on them to take bold stands against Trump and fossil fuel CEOs’ attacks on our environment and health.###Sunrise is a movement to stop climate change and create millions of good jobs in the process. We’re building an army of young people to make climate change an urgent priority across America, end the corrupting influence of fossil fuel executives on our politics, and elect leaders who will stand up for the health and well-being of all people.

Unclassified @HillaryClinton emails should be released. You can see mine, here jebbushemails.com.” Bush’s attempt to score quick political points exposes him to a powerful hypocrisy attack. As governor, Bush used private emails; thus far he has not disclosed them all. There is even early media speculation that Bush’s actions may have skirted Florida law.Key Points:Bush used a personal email address as governor, and there are messages missing. As the Washington Post reporters, “Bush used his personal email address, jeb@jeb.org, to conduct official, political, and personal business…” but Bush’s email disclosure website (which was already public and available at the Florida state archives) lacks many key messages, including any messages between Jeb Bush and his brother, then-President George W. Bush.Media accounts establish that Bush, not the State of Florida, decided which private emails to disclose – apparently nothing would have stopped the Bush team from selectively leaving out politically problematic emails. As the Tampa Bay Times reported, “The Bush files, though enormous, are not complete” because they lacked “emails the governor deemed not relevant to the public record.” In other words, Bush selected what was “relevant” or not for the public record, not civil servants.The numbers do not add up. In 2007 Bush claimed he received 2.5 million emails on his public accounts, and 550,000 emails on his private accounts (Source, Naples Daily News, 7/12/07 ). Bush’s “disclosure” only contains a total of 250,000 emails. (Source, New York Times, 2/9/15 )There are media reports that Bush only recently “completed” handing over emails, despite leaving office eight years ago, potentially violating the law. A Bloomberg politics reporter Michael Bender tweeted today that “FL law requires govs to turn over emails after leaving office. Jeb didn’t finish turning over emails until last year.” He further tweeted that “Bush may not have complied with FL law until considering a presidential campaign. 119.021(4)(a).” That statute requires that “Whoever has custody of any public records shall deliver [them], at the expiration of his or her term of office…” American Bridge researchers submitted a records request today in an effort to confirm or disconfirm the allegation.Media reports indicate Bush also housed his private emails on a personally owned email server. Today, MSNBC political correspondent Kaise Hunt tweeted that “Jeb Bush owns the server that hosts his personal email, his spokeswoman says.”Bush Conducted Public Business Over Private Email; Hand Selected Which To Turn Over To ArchiveTampa Bay Times: Bush Conducted All His Communication On His Private Jeb@Jeb.Org Account; Hand-Selected Which To Turn Over To The State Archive. According to the Tampa Bay Times, “The former governor conducted all his communication on his private Jeb@jeb.org account and turned over the hand-selected batch to the state archives when he left office. Absent from the stash are emails the governor deemed not relevant to the public record: those relating to politics, fundraising and personal matters while he was governor. Compared to Scott, however, who rarely communicates by email, the contrast is stark.’ [Tampa Bay Times, 1/3/15 ]Tampa Bay Times: Bush Released Private Emails Used For State Business; Files “Are Not Complete.” According to the Tampa Bay Times, “The files released from the state archive resulted in a stream of positive national press for the former governor — ‘Jeb Bush’s emails depict a hands-on governor,’ the Washington Post proclaimed. ‘Jeb answered immigrant pleas,’ the Hill wrote.

Loved and liked."""	mostly true	['Polls and Public Opinion']	http://abcnews.go.com/	http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/transcript-abc-news-anchor-david-muir-interviews-president/story?id=45047602	2017/01/26	"On Wednesday, Jan. 25, 2017, ABC News ""World News Tonight"" anchor David Muir interviewed President Donald Trump in the White House. DAVID MUIR: Mr. President, it's an honor to be here at the White House. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much, David. DAVID MUIR: Let me ask you, has the magnitude of this job hit you yet? PRESIDENT TRUMP: It has periodically hit me. And it is a tremendous magnitude. And where you really see it is when you're talking to the generals about problems in the world. And we do have problems in the world. Big problems. The business also hits because the -- the size of it. The size. I was with the Ford yesterday. And with General Motors yesterday. The top representatives, great people. And they're gonna do some tremendous work in the United States. They're gonna build plants back in the United States. But when you see the size, even as a businessman, the size of the investment that these big companies are gonna make, it hits you even in that regard. But we're gonna bring jobs back to America, like I promised on the campaign trail. DAVID MUIR: And we're gonna get to it all right here. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Good. DAVID MUIR: Mr. President, I want to start -- we're five days in. And your campaign promises. I know today you plan on signing the order to build the wall. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Correct. DAVID MUIR: Are you going to direct U.S. funds to pay for this wall? Will American taxpayers pay for the wall? PRESIDENT TRUMP: Ultimately it'll come out of what's happening with Mexico. We're gonna be starting those negotiations relatively soon. And we will be in a form reimbursed by Mexico which I will say ... DAVID MUIR: So, they'll pay us back? PRESIDENT TRUMP: Yeah, absolutely, 100 percent. DAVID MUIR: So, the American taxpayer will pay for the wall at first? PRESIDENT TRUMP: All it is, is we'll be reimbursed at a later date from whatever transaction we make from Mexico. Now, I could wait a year and I could hold off the wall. But I wanna build the wall. We have to build the wall. We have to stop drugs from pouring in. We have to stop people from just pouring into our country. We have no idea where they're from. And I campaigned on the wall. And it's very important. But that wall will cost us nothing. DAVID MUIR: But you talked -- often about Mexico paying for the wall. And you, again, say they'll pay us back. Mexico's president said in recent days that Mexico absolutely will not pay, adding that, ""It goes against our dignity as a country and our dignity as Mexicans."" He says ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: David, he has to say that. He has to say that. But I'm just telling you there will be a payment. It will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form. And you have to understand what I'm doing is good for the United States. It's also going to be good for Mexico. We wanna have a very stable, very solid Mexico. Even more solid than it is right now. And they need it also. Lots of things are coming across Mexico that they don't want. I think it's going to be a good thing for both countries. And I think the relationship will be better than ever before. You know, when we had a prisoner in Mexico, as you know, two years ago, that we were trying to get out. And Mexico was not helping us, I will tell you, those days are over. I think we're gonna end up with a much better relationship with Mexico. We will have the wall and in a very serious form Mexico will pay for the wall. DAVID MUIR: What are you gonna say to some of your supporters who might say, ""Wait a minute, I thought Mexico was going to pay for this right at the start."" PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I'd say very simply that they are going to pay for it. I never said they're gonna pay from the start. I said Mexico will pay for the wall. But what I will tell my supporters is, ""Would you like me to wait two years or three years before I make this deal?"" Because we have to make a deal on NAFTA. We have to make a new trade deal with Mexico because we're getting clobbered. We have a $60-billion trade deficit. So, if you want, I can wait two years and then we can do it nice and easily. I wanna start the wall immediately. Every supporter I have -- I have had so many people calling and tweeting and -- and writing letters saying they're so happy about it. I wanna start the wall. We will be reimbursed for the wall. DAVID MUIR: When does construction begin? PRESIDENT TRUMP: As soon as we can. As soon as we can physically do it. We're ... DAVID MUIR: Within months? PRESIDENT TRUMP: I would say in months. Yeah, I would say in months. Certainly planning is starting immediately. DAVID MUIR: People feel ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: We'll be having some really good, really solid plans within a short period of time. DAVID MUIR: When people learn of the news of this wall today there are gonna be a lot of people listening to this. And I wanna ask about undocumented immigrants who are here -- in this country. Right now they're protected as so-called dreamers -- the children who were brought here, as you know, by their parents. Should they be worried -- that they could be deported? And is there anything you can say to assure them right now that they'll be allowed to stay? PRESIDENT TRUMP: They shouldn't be very worried. They are here illegally. They shouldn't be very worried. I do have a big heart. We're going to take care of everybody. We're going to have a very strong border. We're gonna have a very solid border. Where you have great people that are here that have done a good job, they should be far less worried. We'll be coming out with policy on that over the next period of four weeks. DAVID MUIR: But Mr. President, will they be allowed to stay? PRESIDENT TRUMP: I'm gonna tell you over the next four weeks. But I will tell you, we're looking at this, the whole immigration situation, we're looking at it with great heart. Now we have criminals that are here. We have really bad people that are here. Those people have to be worried 'cause they're getting out. We're gonna get them out. We're gonna get 'em out fast. General Kelly is -- I've given that as his number one priority. DAVID MUIR: Senator Jeff Sessions, your pick for attorney general, as you know during his confirmation hearing said that ending DACA, this is President Obama's policy protecting the dreamers -- that, ""Ending it certainly would be constitutional."" That you could end the protection of these dreamers. Is that a possibility? PRESIDENT TRUMP: We're gonna be talking with -- attorney general. He will soon be the attorney general. He's done fantastically well. We're all very proud of him. I thought he was treated very, very unfairly. He's a brilliant man and he's a very good man. He'll do a fantastic job. I'll be speaking to him as soon as he's affirmed. DAVID MUIR: So, it's a possibility. PRESIDENT TRUMP: We will be talking to the attorney general. DAVID MUIR: I wanna ask you about something you said this week right here at the White House. You brought in congressional leaders to the White House. You spoke at length about the presidential election with them -- telling them that you lost the popular vote because of millions of illegal votes, 3 to 5 million illegal votes. That would be the biggest electoral fraud in American history. Where is the evidence of that? PRESIDENT TRUMP: So, let me tell you first of all, it was so misrepresented. That was supposed to be a confidential meeting. And you weren't supposed to go out and talk to the press as soon as you -- but the Democrats viewed it not as a confidential meeting. DAVID MUIR: But you have tweeted ... DAVID MUIR: ... about the millions of illegals ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: Sure. And I do -- and I'm very ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: ... and I mean it. But just so you -- it was supposed to be a confidential meeting. They turned it into not a con... Number two, the conversation lasted for about a minute. They made it -- somebody said it was, like, 25 percent of the ... It wasn't. It was hardly even discussed. I said it. And I said it strongly because what's going on with voter fraud is horrible. That's number one. Number two, I would've won the popular vote if I was campaigning for the popular vote. I would've gone to California where I didn't go at all. I would've gone to New York where I didn't campaign at all. I would've gone to a couple of places that I didn't go to. And I would've won that much easier than winning the electoral college. But as you know, the electoral college is all that matters. It doesn't make any difference. So, I would've won very, very easily. But it's a different form of winning. You would campaign much differently. You would have a totally different campaign. So, but ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: ... you're just asking a question. I would've easily won the popular vote, much easier, in my opinion, than winning the electoral college. I ended up going to 19 different states. I went to the state of Maine four times for one. I needed one. I went to M-- I got it, by the way. But it turned out I didn't need it because we ended up winning by a massive amount, 306. I needed 270. We got 306. You and everybody said, ""There's no way you get to 270."" I mean, your network said and almost everybody said, ""There's no way you can get to ..."" So, I went to Maine four times. I went to various places. And that's the beauty of the electoral college. With that being said, if you look at voter registration, you look at the dead people that are registered to vote who vote, you look at people that are registered in two states, you look at all of these different things that are happening with registration. You take a look at those registration for -- you're gonna s-- find -- and we're gonna do an investigation on it. DAVID MUIR: But 3 to 5 million illegal votes? PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, we're gonna find out. But it could very well be that much. Absolutely. PRESIDENT TRUMP: But we're gonna find out. PRESIDENT TRUMP: In fact, I heard one of the other side, they were saying it's not 3 to 5. It's not 3 to 5. I said, ""Well, Mr. Trump is talking about registration, tell--"" He said, ""You know we don't wanna talk about registration."" They don't wanna talk about registration. You have people that are registered who are dead, who are illegals, who are in two states. You have people registered in two states. They're registered in a New York and a New Jersey. They vote twice. There are millions of votes, in my opinion. Now ... DAVID MUIR: But again ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: I'm doing an ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: ... investigation. David, David, David ... DAVID MUIR: You’re now, you’re now president of the United States when you say ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: Of course, and I want the voting process to be legitimate. DAVID MUIR: But what I'm asking ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: The people that ... DAVID MUIR: ... what I'm asking that -- when you say in your opinion millions of illegal votes, that is something that is extremely fundamental to our functioning democracy, a fair and free election. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Sure. Sure. Sure. DAVID MUIR: You say you're gonna launch an investigation. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Sure, done. DAVID MUIR: What you have presented so far has been debunked. It's been called ... DAVID MUIR: ... false. PRESIDENT TRUMP: No, it hasn't. Take a look at the Pew reports. DAVID MUIR: I called the author of the Pew report last night. And he told me that they found no evidence of voter ... DAVID MUIR: ... fraud. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Really? Then why did he write the report? DAVID MUIR: He said no evidence of voter fraud. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Excuse me, then why did he write the report? PRESIDENT TRUMP: According to Pew report, then he's -- then he's groveling again. You know, I always talk about the reporters that grovel when they wanna write something that you wanna hear but not necessarily millions of people wanna hear or have to hear. DAVID MUIR: So, you’ve launched an investigation? PRESIDENT TRUMP: We're gonna launch an investigation to find out. And then the next time -- and I will say this, of those votes cast, none of 'em come to me. None of 'em come to me. They would all be for the other side. None of 'em come to me. But when you look at the people that are registered: dead, illegal and two states and some cases maybe three states -- we have a lot to look into. DAVID MUIR: House Speaker Paul Ryan has said, ""I have seen no evidence. I have made this very, very clear."" Senator Lindsey Graham saying, ""It's the most inappropriate thing for a president to say without proof. He seems obsessed with the idea that he could not have possibly lost the popular vote without cheating and fraud."" I wanna ask you about something bigger here. Does it matter more now ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: There's nothing bigger. There's nothing bigger. DAVID MUIR: But it is important because ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: Let me just tell you, you know what's important, millions of people agree with me when I say that if you would’ve looked on one of the other networks and all of the people that were calling in they're saying, ""We agree with Mr. Trump. We agree."" They're very smart people. The people that voted for me -- lots of people are saying they saw things happen. I heard stories also. But you're not talking about millions. But it's a small little segment. I will tell you, it's a good thing that we're doing because at the end we're gonna have an idea as to what's going on. Now, you're telling me Pew report has all of a sudden changed. But you have other reports and you have other statements. You take a look at the registrations, how many dead people are there? Take a look at the registrations as to the other things that I already presented. DAVID MUIR: And you're saying ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: And you're gonna find ... DAVID MUIR: ... those people who are on the rolls voted, that there are millions of illegal votes? PRESIDENT TRUMP: I didn't say there are millions. But I think there could very well be millions of people. That's right. DAVID MUIR: You tweeted though ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: And I also say this ... DAVID MUIR: ... you tweeted, ""If you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally, I won the popular vote."" PRESIDENT TRUMP: David, and I also say this, if I was going for the popular vote I would've won easily. But I would've been in California and New York. I wouldn't have been in Maine. I wouldn't have been in Iowa. I wouldn't have been in Nebraska and all of those states that I had to win in order to win this. I would've been in New York, I would've been in California. I never even went there. DAVID MUIR: Let me just ask you, you did win. You're the president. You're sitting ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: That’s true. DAVID MUIR: ... across from me right now. PRESIDENT TRUMP: That's true. DAVID MUIR: Do you think that your words matter more now? PRESIDENT TRUMP: Yes, very much. DAVID MUIR: Do you think that that talking about millions of illegal votes is dangerous to this country without presenting the evidence? PRESIDENT TRUMP: No, not at all. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Not at all because many people feel the same way that I do. And ... DAVID MUIR: You don't think it undermines your credibility if there’s no evidence? PRESIDENT TRUMP: No, not at all because they didn't come to me. Believe me. Those were Hillary votes. And if you look at it they all voted for Hillary. They all voted for Hillary. They didn't vote for me. I don't believe I got one. Okay, these are people that voted for Hillary Clinton. And if they didn't vote, it would've been different in the popular. Now, you have to understand I -- I focused on those four or five states that I had to win. Maybe she didn't. She should've gone to Michigan. She thought she had it in the bag. She should've gone to Wisconsin, she thought she had it because you're talking about 38 years of, you know, Democrat wins. But they didn't. I went to Michigan, I went to Wisconsin. I went to Pennsylvania all the time. I went to all of the states that are -- Florida and North Carolina. That's all I focused on. DAVID MUIR: Mr. President, it does strike me though that we're relitigating the presidential campaign, the election ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: No, no. We're looking at it for the next time. No, no, you have to understand, I had a tremendous victory, one of the great victories ever. In terms of counties I think the most ever or just about the most ever. When you look at a map it's all red. Red meaning us, Republicans. One of the greatest victories ever. But, again, I ran for the electoral college. I didn't run for the popular vote. What I'm saying is if there are these problems that many people agree with me that there might be. Look, Barack Obama -- if you look back -- eight years ago when he first ran -- he was running for office in Chicago for we needed Chicago vote. And he was laughing at the system because he knew all of those votes were going to him. You look at Philadelphia, you look at what's going on in Philadelphia. But take a look at the tape of Barack Obama who wrote me, by the way, a very beautiful letter in the drawer of the desk. Very beautiful. And I appreciate it. But look at what he said, it's on tape. Look at what he said about voting in Chicago eight years ago. It's not changed. It hasn't changed, believe me. Chicago, look what's going on in Chicago. It's only gotten worse. But he was smiling and laughing about the vote in Chicago. Now, once he became president he didn't do that. All of a sudden it became this is the foundation of our country. So, here's the point, you have a lot of stuff going on possibly. I say probably. But possibly. We're gonna get to the bottom of it. And then we're gonna make sure it doesn't happen again. If people are registered wrongly, if illegals are registered to vote, which they are, if dead people are registered to vote and voting, which they do. There are some. I don't know how many. We're gonna try finding that out and the other categories that we talk about, double states where they're -- registered in two states, we're gonna get to the bottom of it because we have to stop it. Because I agree, so important. But the other side is trying to downplay this. Now, I'll say this -- I think that if that didn't happen, first of all, would -- would be a great thing if it didn't happen. But I believe it did happen. And I believe a part of the vote would've been much different. DAVID MUIR: And you believe millions of illegal votes ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, we're gonna find out. DAVID MUIR: Let me ask you this ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: We're gonna find out. And -- and, by the way, when I say you're gonna find out. You can never really find, you know, there are gonna be -- no matter what numbers we come up with there are gonna be lots of people that did things that we're not going to find out about. But we will find out because we need a better system where that can't happen. DAVID MUIR: Mr. President, I just have one more question on this. And it's -- it's bigger picture. You took some heat after your visit to the CIA in front of that hallowed wall, 117 stars -- of those lost at the CIA. You talked about other things. But you also talked about crowd size at the inauguration, about the size of your rallies, about covers on Time magazine. And I just wanna ask you when does all of that matter just a little less? When do you let it roll off your back now that you're the president? PRESIDENT TRUMP: OK, so I'm glad you asked. So, I went to the CIA, my first step. I have great respect for the people in intelligence and CIA. I'm -- I don't have a lot of respect for, in particular one of the leaders. But that's okay. But I have a lot of respect for the people in the CIA. That speech was a home run. That speech, if you look at Fox, OK, I'll mention you -- we see what Fox said. They said it was one of the great speeches. They showed the people applauding and screaming and -- and they were all CIA. There was -- somebody was asking Sean -- ""Well, were they Trump people that were put--"" we don't have Trump people. They were CIA people. That location was given to me. Mike Pence went up before me, paid great homage to the wall. I then went up, paid great homage to the wall. I then spoke to the crowd. I got a standing ovation. In fact, they said it was the biggest standing ovation since Peyton Manning had won the Super Bowl and they said it was equal. I got a standing ovation. It lasted for a long period of time. What you do is take -- take out your tape -- you probably ran it live. I know when I do good speeches. I know when I do bad speeches. That speech was a total home run. They loved it. I could've ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: ... gotten ... DAVID MUIR: You would give the same speech if you went back ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: Absolutely. DAVID MUIR: ... in front of that wall? PRESIDENT TRUMP: People loved it. They loved it. They gave me a standing ovation for a long period of time. They never even sat down, most of them, during the speech. There was love in the room. You and other networks covered it very inaccurately. I hate to say this to you and you probably won't put it on but turn on Fox and see how it was covered. And see how people respond to that speech. That speech was a good speech. And you and a couple of other networks tried to downplay that speech. And it was very, very unfortunate that you did. The people of the CIA loved the speech. If I was going to take a vote in that room, there were, like, 300, 350 people, over 1,000 wanted to be there but they couldn't. They were all CIA people. I would say I would've gotten 350 to nothing in that room. That's what the vote would've been. That speech was a big hit, a big success -- success. And then I came back and I watched you on television and a couple of others. DAVID MUIR: Not me personally. PRESIDENT TRUMP: And they tried to demean. Excuse me? DAVID MUIR: Not me personally. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Not you personally but your network -- and they tried to demean the speech. And I know when things are good or bad. A poll just came out on my inauguration speech which was extraordinary that people loved it. Loved and liked. And it was an extraordinary poll. DAVID MUIR: I guess that's what I'm getting at. You talked about the poll, the people loving your inaugural speech and the size of your ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: No, because you bring it up. DAVID MUIR: I'm asking, well, on day one you ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, you just brought it up. I didn't bring it up. I didn't wanna -- talk about the inauguration speech. But I think I did a very good job and people really liked it. You saw the poll. Just came out this morning. You bring it up. I didn't bring it up. DAVID MUIR: So, polls and crowd size and covers on Time, those still matter now that you're here as president. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, you keep bringing it up. I had a massive amount of people here. They were showing pictures that were very unflattering, as unflattering -- from certain angles -- that were taken early and lots of other things. I'll show you a picture later if you’d like of a massive crowd. In terms of a total audience including television and everything else that you have we had supposedly the biggest crowd in history. The audience watching the show. And I think you would even agree to that. They say I had the biggest crowd in the history of inaugural speeches. I'm honored by that. But I didn't bring it up. You just brought it up. DAVID MUIR: See, I -- I'm not interested in the inaugural crowd size. I think the American people can look at images side by side and decide for themselves. I am curious about the first full day here at the White House, choosing to send the press secretary out into the briefing room, summoning reporters to talk about the inaugural crowd size. Does that send a message to the American people that that's -- that's more important than some of the very pressing issues? PRESIDENT TRUMP: Part of my whole victory was that the men and women of this country who have been forgotten will never be forgotten again. Part of that is when they try and demean me unfairly 'cause we had a massive crowd of people. We had a crowd -- I looked over that sea of people and I said to myself, ""Wow."" And I've seen crowds before. Big, big crowds. That was some crowd. When I looked at the numbers that happened to come in from all of the various sources, we had the biggest audience in the history of inaugural speeches. I said the men and women that I was talking to who came out and voted will never be forgotten again. Therefore I won't allow you or other people like you to demean that crowd and to demean the people that came to Washington, D.C., from faraway places because they like me. But more importantly they like what I'm saying. DAVID MUIR: I just wanna say I didn't demean anyone who was in that crowd. We did coverage for hours ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: No, I think you’re demeaning by talking the way you're talking. I think you're demeaning. And that's why I think a lot of people turned on you and turned on a lot of other people. And that's why you have a 17 percent approval rating, which is pretty bad. DAVID MUIR: Mr. Trump, let's talk about many of the things that have happened this week. Chicago. Last night you tweeted about the murder rate in Chicago saying, ""If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible carnage going on I will send in the feds."" PRESIDENT TRUMP: Right. DAVID MUIR: You will send in the feds? What do you mean by that? PRESIDENT TRUMP: It's carnage. You know, in my speech I got tremendous -- from certain people the word carnage. It is carnage. It's horrible carnage. This is Afghanistan -- is not like what's happening in Chicago. People are being shot left and right. Thousands of people over a period -- over a short period of time. This year, which has just started, is worse than last year, which was a catastrophe. They're not doing the job. Now if they want help, I would love to help them. I will send in what we have to send in. Maybe they're not gonna have to be so politically correct. Maybe they're being overly political correct. Maybe there's something going on. But you can't have those killings going on in Chicago. Chicago is like a war zone. Chicago is worse than some of the people that you report in some of the places that you report about every night ... DAVID MUIR: So, I will send ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: ... in the Middle East. DAVID MUIR: ... you mentioned federal assistance. There's federal assistance and then there's sending in the feds. I'm just curious would you take action on your own? PRESIDENT TRUMP: I want them to fix the problem. You can't have thousands of people being shot in a city, in a country that I happen to be president of. Maybe it's okay if somebody else is president. I want them to fix the problem. They have a problem that's very easily fixable. They're gonna have to get tougher and stronger and smarter. But they gotta fix the problem. I don't want to have thousands of people shot in a city where essentially I'm the president. I love Chicago. I know Chicago. And Chicago is a great city, can be a great city. DAVID MUIR: And if they’re unable to fix it? PRESIDENT TRUMP: It can't be a great city. Excuse me. It can't be a great city if people are shot walking down the street for a loaf of bread. Can't be a great city. DAVID MUIR: And if they are unable to fix it, that's when you would send in the feds? PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, so far they have been unable. It’s been going on for years. And I wasn't president. So, look, when President Obama was there two weeks ago making a speech, very nice speech. Two people were shot and killed during his speech. You can't have that. DAVID MUIR: Let me ask ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: They weren't shot at the speech. But they were shot in the city of Chicago during his speech. What -- what's going on? So, all I'm saying is to the mayor who came up to my office recently -- I say, ""You have to smarten up and you have to toughen up because you can't let that happen. That's a war zone."" DAVID MUIR: So, this is an ""or else."" This is a warning? PRESIDENT TRUMP: I want them to straighten out the problem. It's a big problem. DAVID MUIR: Let me ask you about a new report that you were poised to lift a ban on so-called CIA black sites of prisons around the world that have been used in the past. Is that true? PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I'll be talking about that in about two hours. So, you'll be there and you'll be able to see it for yourself. DAVID MUIR: Are you gonna lift the ban? PRESIDENT TRUMP: You're gonna see in about two hours. DAVID MUIR: The last president, President Obama, said the U.S. does not torture. Will you say that? PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I have a general who I have great respect for, General Mattis, who said -- I was a little surprised -- who said he's not a believer in torture. As you know, Mr. Pompeo was just approved, affirmed by the Senate. He's a fantastic guy, he's gonna be the head of the CIA. And you have somebody fabulous as opposed to the character that just got out who didn't -- was not fabulous at all. And he will I think do a great job. And he is -- you know, I haven't gone into great detail. But I will tell you I have spoken to others in intelligence. And they are big believers in, as an example, waterboarding. DAVID MUIR: You did tell me ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: Because they say it does work. It does work. DAVID MUIR: Mr. President, you ... DAVID MUIR: Mr. President, you told me during one of the debates that you would bring back waterboarding and a hell of a lot worse. PRESIDENT TRUMP: I would do ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: I would do -- I wanna keep our country safe. I wanna keep our country safe. DAVID MUIR: What does that mean? PRESIDENT TRUMP: When they're shooting -- when they're chopping off the heads of our people and other people, when they're chopping off the heads of people because they happen to be a Christian in the Middle East, when ISIS is doing things that nobody has ever heard of since Medieval times, would I feel strongly about waterboarding? As far as I'm concerned we have to fight fire with fire. Now, with that being said I'm going with General Mattis. I'm going with my secretary because I think Pompeo's gonna be phenomenal. I'm gonna go with what they say. But I have spoken as recently as 24 hours ago with people at the highest level of intelligence. And I asked them the question, ""Does it work? Does torture work?"" And the answer was, ""Yes, absolutely."" DAVID MUIR: You're now the president. Do you want waterboarding? PRESIDENT TRUMP: I don't want people to chop off the citizens or anybody's heads in the Middle East. Okay? Because they're Christian or Muslim or anything else. I don't want -- look, you are old enough to have seen a time that was much different. You never saw heads chopped off until a few years ago. Now they chop 'em off and they put 'em on camera and they send 'em all over the world. So we have that and we're not allowed to do anything. We're not playing on an even field. I will say this, I will rely on Pompeo and Mattis and my group. And if they don't wanna do, that's fine. If they do wanna do, then I will work for that end. I wanna do everything within the bounds of what you're allowed to do legally. But do I feel it works? Absolutely I feel it works. Have I spoken to people at the top levels and people that have seen it work? I haven't seen it work. But I think it works. Have I spoken to people that feel strongly about it? Absolutely. DAVID MUIR: So, you'd be okay with it as ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: I wanna keep ... DAVID MUIR: ... president? PRESIDENT TRUMP: ... no, I wanna -- I will rely on General Mattis. And I'm gonna rely on those two people and others. And if they don't wanna do it, it's 100 percent okay with me. Do I think it works? Absolutely. DAVID MUIR: Mr. President, I wanna ask you about refugees. You're about to sign a sweeping executive action to suspend immigration to this country. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Right. DAVID MUIR: Who are we talking about? Is this the Muslim ban? PRESIDENT TRUMP: We're talking about -- no it's not the Muslim ban. But it's countries that have tremendous terror. It's countries that we're going to be spelling out in a little while in the same speech. And it's countries that people are going to come in and cause us tremendous problems. Our country has enough problems without allowing people to come in who, in many cases or in some cases, are looking to do tremendous destruction. PRESIDENT TRUMP: You look at what's happening ... DAVID MUIR: Which countries are we talking about? PRESIDENT TRUMP: ... you'll be hearing about it in two hours because I have a whole list. You'll be very thrilled. You're looking at people that come in, in many cases, in some cases with evil intentions. I don't want that. They're ISIS. They're coming under false pretense. I don't want that. I'm gonna be the president of a safe country. We have enough problems. Now I'll absolutely do safe zones in Syria for the people. I think that Europe has made a tremendous mistake by allowing these millions of people to go into Germany and various other countries. And all you have to do is take a look. It's -- it's a disaster what's happening over there. I don't want that to happen here. Now with that being said, President Obama and Hillary Clinton have, and Kerry have allowed tens of thousands of people into our country. The FBI is now investigating more people than ever before having to do with terror. They -- and it's from the group of people that came in. So look, look, our country has a lot of problems. Believe me. I know what the problems are even better than you do. They're deep problems, they're serious problems. We don't need more. DAVID MUIR: Let me ask you about some of the countries that won't be on the list, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia. Why are we going to allow people to come into this country ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: You're going to see -- you're going to see. We're going to have extreme vetting in all cases. And I mean extreme. And we're not letting people in if we think there's even a little chance of some problem. DAVID MUIR: Are you at all ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: We are excluding certain countries. But for other countries we're gonna have extreme vetting. It's going to be very hard to come in. Right now it's very easy to come in. It's gonna be very, very hard. I don't want terror in this country. You look at what happened in San Bernardino. You look at what happened all over. You look at what happened in the World Trade Center. Okay, I mean, take that as an example. DAVID MUIR: Are you at all ... DAVID MUIR: ... concerned -- are you at all concerned it's going to cause more anger among Muslims ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: Anger? DAVID MUIR: ... the world? PRESIDENT TRUMP: There's plenty of anger right now. How can you have more? DAVID MUIR: You don't think it'll ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: Look, David ... DAVID MUIR: ... exacerbate the problem? PRESIDENT TRUMP: ... David, I mean, I know you're a sophisticated guy. The world is a mess. The world is as angry as it gets. What? You think this is gonna cause a little more anger? The world is an angry place. All of this has happened. We went into Iraq. We shouldn't have gone into Iraq. We shouldn't have gotten out the way we got out. The world is a total mess. Take a look at what's happening with Aleppo. Take a look what's happening in Mosul. Take a look what's going on in the Middle East. And people are fleeing and they're going into Europe and all over the place. The world is a mess, David. DAVID MUIR: You brought up Iraq and something you said that could affect American troops in recent days. You said, ""We should've kept the oil but okay maybe we'll have another chance."" What did you mean by that? PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, we should've kept the oil when we got out. And, you know, it's very interesting, had we taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS because they fuel themselves with the oil. That's where they got the money. They got the money from leaving -- when we left, we left Iraq, which wasn't a government. It's not a government now. And by the way, and I said something else, if we go in and do this. You have two nations, Iraq and Iran. And they were essentially the same military strength. And they'd fight for decades and decades. They'd fight forever. And they'd keep fighting and it would go -- it was just a way of life. We got in, we decapitated one of those nations, Iraq. I said, ""Iran is taking over Iraq."" That's essentially what happened. DAVID MUIR: So, you believe we can go in and take the oil. PRESIDENT TRUMP: We should have taken the oil. You wouldn't have ISIS if we took the oil. Now I wasn't talking about it from the standpoint of ISIS because the way we got out was horrible. We created a vacuum and ISIS formed. But had we taken the oil something else would've very good happened. They would not have been able to fuel their rather unbelievable drive to destroy large portions of the world. DAVID MUIR: You've heard the critics who say that would break all international law, taking the oil. But I wanna get to the words ... DAVID MUIR: ... that you ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: Wait, wait, can you believe that? Who are the critics who say that? Fools. DAVID MUIR: Let, let me ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: I don't call them critics. I call them fools. DAVID MUIR: ... let me talk about your words ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: We should've kept -- excuse me. We should've taken the oil. And if we took the oil you wouldn't have ISIS. And we would have had wealth. We have spent right now $6 trillion in the Middle East. And our country is falling apart. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Our roads -- excuse me. Our roads, our bridges, our schools, it's falling apart. We have spent as of one month ago $6 trillion in the Middle East. And in our country we can't afford to build a school in Brooklyn or we can't afford to build a school in Los Angeles. And we can't afford to fix up our inner cities. We can't afford to do anything. Look, it's time. It's been our longest war. We've been in there for 15, 16 years. Nobody even knows what the date is because they don't really know when did we start. But it's time. It's time. DAVID MUIR: What got my attention, Mr. President, was when you said, ""Maybe we'll have another chance."" PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, don't let it get your attention too much because we'll see what happens. I mean, we're gonna see what happens. You know, I told you and I told everybody else that wants to talk when it comes to the military I don't wanna discuss things. I wanna let -- I wanna let the action take place before the talk takes place. I watched in Mosul when a number of months ago generals and politicians would get up and say, ""We're going into Mosul in four months."" Then they'd say, ""We're going in in three months, two months, one month. We're going in next week."" Okay, and I kept saying to myself, ""Gee, why do they have to keep talking about going in?"" All right, so now they go in and it is tough because they're giving the enemy all this time to prepare. I don't wanna do a lot of talking on the military. I wanna talk after it's finished, not before it starts. DAVID MUIR: Let me ask you, Mr. President, about another promise involving Obamacare to repeal it. And you told The Washington Post that your plan to replace Obamacare will include insurance for everybody. That sounds an awful lot like universal coverage. PRESIDENT TRUMP: It's going to be -- what my plan is is that I wanna take care of everybody. I'm not gonna leave the lower 20 percent that can't afford insurance. Just so you understand people talk about Obamacare. And I told the Republicans this, the best thing we could do is nothing for two years, let it explode. And then we'll go in and we'll do a new plan and -- and the Democrats will vote for it. Believe me. Because this year you'll have 150 percent increases. Last year in Arizona 116 perecent increase, Minnesota 60 some-odd percent increase. And I told them, except for one problem, I wanna get it fixed. The best thing I could do as the leader of this country-- but as wanting to get something approved with support of the Democrats, if I didn't do anything for two years they'd be begging me to do something. But I don't wanna do that. So just so you unders-- Obamacare is a disaster. It's too expensive. It's horrible health care. It doesn't cover what you have to cover. It's a disaster. You know it and I know it. And I said to the Republican folks-- and they're terrific folks, Mitch and Paul Ryan, I said, ""Look, if you go fast -- and I'm okay in doing it because it's the right thing to do. We wanna get good coverage at much less cost."" I said, ""If you go fast we then own Obamacare. They're gonna put it on us. And Obamacare is a disaster waiting to explode. If you sit back and let it explode it's gonna be much easier."" That's the thing to do. But the right thing to do is to get something done now. DAVID MUIR: But you ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: So I wanna make sure that nobody's dying on the streets when I'm president. Nobody's gonna be dying on the streets. We will unleash something that's gonna be terrific. And remember this, before Obamacare you had a lot of people that were very, very happy with their health care. And now those people in many cases don't even have health care. They don't even have anything that's acceptable to them. Remember this, keep your doctor, keep your plan, 100 percent. Remember the $5 billion website? Remember the website fiasco. I mean, you do admit that I think, right? The website fiasco. Obamacare is a disaster. We are going to come up with a new plan ideally not an amended plan because right now if you look at the pages they're this high. We're gonna come up with a new plan that's going to be better health care for more people at a lesser cost. DAVID MUIR: Last question because I know you're gonna show me around the White House. Last question on this. You've seen the estimate that 18 million Americans could lose their health insurance if Obamacare is repealed and there is no replacement. Can you assure those Americans watching this right now that they will not lose their health insurance or end up with anything less? PRESIDENT TRUMP: So nobody ever deducts all the people that have already lost their health insurance that liked it. You had millions of people that liked their health insurance and their health care and their doctor and where they went. You had millions of people that now aren't insured anymore. DAVID MUIR: I'm just asking about the people ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: No, no. DAVID MUIR: ... who are nervous and watching ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: We ... DAVID MUIR: ... you for reassurance. PRESIDENT TRUMP: ... here's what I can assure you, we are going to have a better plan, much better health care, much better service treatment, a plan where you can have access to the doctor that you want and the plan that you want. We're gonna have a much better health care plan at much less money. And remember Obamacare is ready to explode. And you interviewed me a couple of years ago. I said '17 -- right now, this year, ""'17 is going to be a disaster."" I'm very good at this stuff. ""'17 is going to be a disaster cost-wise for Obamacare. It's going to explode in '17."" And why not? Obama's a smart guy. So let it all come do because that's what's happening. It's all coming do in '17. We're gonna have an explosion. And to do it right, sit back, let it explode and let the Democrats come begging us to help them because it's on them. But I don't wanna do that. I wanna give great health care at a much lower cost. DAVID MUIR: So, no one who has this health insurance through Obamacare will lose it or end up ... PRESIDENT TRUMP: You know, when you ... DAVID MUIR: ... with anything less? PRESIDENT TRUMP: ... say no one I think no one. Ideally, in the real world, you’re talking about millions of people. Will no one. And then, you know, knowing ABC, you'll have this one person on television saying how they were hurt. Okay. We want no one. We want the answer to be no one. But I will say millions of people will be happy. Right now you have millions and millions and millions of people that are unhappy. It's too expensive and it's no good. And the governor of Minnesota who unfortunately had a very, very sad incident yesterday 'cause he's a very nice guy but -- a couple of months ago he said that the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. He's a staunch Democrat. Very strong Democrat. He said it's no longer affordable. He made that statement. And Bill Clinton on the campaign trail -- and he probably had a bad night that night when he went home -- but he said, ""Obamacare is crazy. It's crazy."" And you know what, they were both right. DAVID MUIR: Mr. President, thank you. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much. Appreciate it."

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.WOLF BLITZER, HOST: We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer reporting from St. Paul, Minnesota. We're here at the Xcel Energy Center, where the Republicans are scheduled, and repeat scheduled, to open their national convention here tomorrow. But so much is up in the air right now because of Hurricane Gustav. It's a monster storm, and it's approaching the U.S. Gulf Coast, including New Orleans, this only three years after Hurricane Katrina. And Republicans, including the president of the United States and the vice president of the United States, both of whom were scheduled to come here tomorrow, Monday, to address this Republican gathering, all of that remains unclear right now. what the Republicans are going to do because of Hurricane Gustav.We have reporters all over the Gulf Coast right now monitoring what's going on. We're also standing by for remarks from Michael Chertoff, the secretary of homeland secretary. He's over at Andrews Air Force base just outside Washington in Maryland. You see that small plane with the insignia ""United States of America"" on it. That plane will carry him down to the Gulf Coast to be on top of what's going on.So many people remember the enormous blunders three years ago in advance of Hurricane Katrina. They are desperately trying right now to avoid similar blunders right now.We're going to get the latest update from our Severe Weather Center. Reynolds Wolf is standing by for that. Also, Sean Callebs. He's on the road right now. He's actually driving north of New Orleans towards Baton Rouge. Sean Callebs is in a vehicle, and we want to show our viewers some of that -- some of the lines, some of the mass evacuation that is going on, and we're going to go to Sean Callebs momentarily.But Reynolds Wolf, let me get an update first on what exactly is the status of Gustav, where is it right now, and where is it heading?REYNOLDS WOLF, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Right now, Wolf, the center of the storm is about 466 miles from New Orleans. Just to give our viewers at home an idea of how far away that is, that's roughly the distance of New York -- from New York to Cleveland, Ohio.The storm is getting closer as we speak. It was weakening a little bit over the last hour. Now it appears that the back side of the north half of the storm is beginning to fill in. It is getting stronger. Winds of 120 miles per hour, gusting to 145. It is still a major, major hurricane, and the latest path that we have, Wolf, from the National Hurricane Center shows the storm continuing that northwestern trajectory, roughly around, say, 15, 16 miles per hour. And the storm expected to make its way into the north central Gulf as we get to early Monday morning. Winds of 145 miles per hour.BLITZER: Over at Andrews Air Force base. Stand by.SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY MICHAEL CHERTOFF: ... somewhere between Vermilion Bay and New Orleans in Louisiana. Again, it's possible this will change, but this is where most of the prediction seems to be centered.The storm is moving a little more quickly than we were seeing late yesterday, which means it will arrive within certainly 24 hours in terms of tropical storm winds. At the same time, that may benefit us a little bit by minimizing the strengthening.We're still looking, however, at what may be a low Category 4 or a high Category 3 storm.And, again, you know, as with all storms, these can be tricky. These can change.That means that we basically have the rest of Sunday to complete the evacuation of the coast of Louisiana, as well as evacuation activities in Texas and Mississippi.I spoke to the president early this morning at some length about the state of preparations. He's fully committed to throwing all of the assets of the federal government into this fight.I was over at the FEMA headquarters talking to our DOD partners, General Renuart of Northcom, as well as our state partners in Louisiana. The main evacuation is going well. We are concerned because a number of the hospitals that originally planned to shelter in place have now decided they are going to actually try to evacuate their critically ill and medical needs patients. As a consequence, we've had to increase the tempo of our air flights into New Orleans in order to make sure that we can accommodate the flow. We're going to be watching this very carefully today.I spoke to my counterpart in Canada, Stockwell Day. The Canadians have released to us a number of aircraft that we are also going to be using to evacuate these special medical needs people. So this is going to be probably the most important challenge we're going to be addressing during the course of the next 12 hours.Again, I want to warn people that notwithstanding the predictions, the storm can still change, and, therefore, I would not have let people drop their guard in Mississippi or in parts of Texas simply because it looks like the main hurricane is going to be impacting in New Orleans.Finally, remember, once the hurricane makes landfall, it continues to be a dangerous weather event. The prediction is it will move northwest across Louisiana into east Texas. There's going to be a lot of rainfall. That means there can be localized flooding. And so we're going to have to be following this carefully over the next several days.So with that, I'll take some questions.QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, will you be staying in the region during the storm to ride it out?CHERTOFF: I will.QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)CHERTOFF: Well, I've actually lived through Katrina and any number of disasters over the last three and a half years, so I think I'm well trained and well prepared. I'm well supported in terms of my ability to communicate back to the president and back to Washington, so I'm comfortable that I'm not going to lose touch. And so I'm not worried about my own safety. QUESTION: Can you speak to the situation with evacuations? (inaudible) available for New Orleaneans, were you aware of any issues with that?CHERTOFF: There was an issue where some of the contract buses apparently did not make their appearance. This is probably the case with almost any emergency, which is the plan -- as soon as you make contact with the enemy, the plan starts to suffer some alteration.The good news here is that really good work with the state authorities allowed us to backfill on the buses, using school buses and other transportation. So the report I got this morning is that that was moving well.But, again, we have backup capabilities, particularly military capabilities, should we need them.I do want to emphasize the window is closing. Once you get tropical storm winds, there's no more evacuation.I've also heard reports that some people are still determined to try to ride the storm out in the coast. That strikes me as exceptionally foolish. I think the local authorities have made it very clear, and I saw them doing it this morning, that the National Guard will protect people's property. People should heed the instructions to evacuate and protect their own lives.So, you know, we're prepared for the fact that we may have to improvise today if various elements of what we're relying upon don't live up to expectation. We've got some margin for doing that, but this is something that we're literally -- we've been working on overnight and we'll be working on all during the rest of the day, and I expect to get down to the evacuation areas myself later today to make sure that everybody is fully focused on this.QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE). How likely is it that we can avoid the problems that Katrina posed?CHERTOFF: Well, I think there's no question that we're doing much better than we did in Katrina. If you look at the evacuation, it's begun a whole 24 to 36 hours earlier than Katrina. The preparations for people with medical needs, people without automobiles, I think we've already seen the benefit of that.Every storm is different. This storm is going to come in differently than Katrina did. It's going to move to the west of New Orleans. That's actually bad news, because the most powerful part of the storm is actually the right side of the storm. So it's going to be in some ways more challenging than Katrina, because there's going to be a broader range of people who have to evacuate.But, having worked over the last several days with the state and local authorities, I think they are well focused and well integrated with what we are doing.Nevertheless, as I say, it's going to be a very, very tough event. Depending on how strong the storm is, we're going to see a different level of impact with respect to New Orleans itself and some of the coastal communities. If we wind up lucky and it's a Category 3, then I anticipate we're going to get less damage than a Category 4. We may not know what we're going to have at landfall for, you know, some period of time, because, again, there's some weather activity at high altitude that may yet affect the way in which the storm comes in.So we're prepared for the worst. We're also prepared, frankly, to improvise, and we've got a plan B. What we need is the maximum level of cooperation from the individual public.UNKNOWN: Final question, and then we've got to get going.QUESTION: Secretary, during Katrina, (inaudible). Do you believe that you have that now, during (ph) and after?CHERTOFF: Yes, I have to say we are -- we do have a unified command and control. We are embedded with the state. The state is embedded with us. There's been no disconnect in terms of the ability to work together.Like with any other emergency, you know, the people on the ground are the people who are going to have to accurately report what's happening.CHERTOFF: That's been going on so far.When we have hitches -- and we've had some hitches -- we've been able to recover and adapt. And that's really, over the next 48 hours, what the name of the game is.It's going to be to adapt to unforeseen emerging circumstances. That's what an emergency is. And that's what I'm going to go down to make sure we can do.So I'm looking forward to getting down there so we can get our hands on the situation.QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) CHERTOFF: Again, the levees are stronger than Katrina. I've seen the barrier at the 17th Street Canal. That is an effective barrier. However, if you get a Category 4 storm, there is a real likelihood of getting some overtopping.Additionally, rain is a big factor here. Even if there's no overtopping of the levees, rain will likely cause some flooding in New Orleans, so that's why evacuation becomes critical.And, again, we -- you know, we've got to hope the storm diminishes a little bit, but we have to be prepared for the worst.Thanks very much. We'll see you down there.BLITZER: There he is, Michael Chertoff. He's about to get on that plane, fly off to the Gulf Coast. He says he wants to be personally in charge of what's going on. All of us, of course, recalling the disaster leading up to Hurricane Katrina almost exactly three years ago.Let's go to the head of FEMA right now. David Paulison is joining us from FEMA headquarters.Mr. Paulison, thanks very much for coming in. Are you guys ready this time?FEMA DIRECTOR DAVID PAULISON: We have been ready. We've been on the ground. You heard Secretary Chertoff talk about what we're doing. We pre-positioned buses, ambulances. We have trains on the ground that are moving people out. We have a tremendous amount of aircraft and the Department of Defense flying people out. All of these things were put in place prior to the storm as opposed to Katrina that came in after the storm. So, yes, we're all ready.Do we have challenges? No question about it. We've got several hospitals that we're going to shelter in place, and now they've asked to be evacuated, so we're working through that. We've worked all night long to make sure that we're flying more aircraft in. Canada is lending us aircraft to make sure we have enough planes to get people out of there, get them out of harm's way.BLITZER: The last time we all remember the lack of communications. The left hand of the U.S. government couldn't speak to the right hand of the U.S. government. There was no real coordination between federal, state, and local authorities. The radio frequencies weren't -- weren't compatible.Has all that been repaired? Can you assure the American people right now that there is this level of cooperation, you, the state, and local authorities?PAULISON: Wolf, the -- your observation is absolutely correct. During Katrina, the level of communication -- not the radio communication, per se, but just being able to talk to each other, being on the same page -- simply did not happen in Katrina. We have put in place our National Incident Management System. We'll use the unified command. Every afternoon at noontime, we have video conferences where everybody is on board.We have the states on there. We have all the Department of Defenses on there. All the federal agencies that are having a part of this are a part of that videoconference. And for an hour-and-a-half, we go through every issue to make sure everybody understands what it is.I was down there the day before yesterday with Secretary Chertoff. The state and the local communities are in sync with each other that we did not see during Katrina. The states are talking to each other.I was just watching the contraflow and how well that's going. When Louisiana asked with contraflow where they have to work with Mississippi and Texas, that is happening. The governors are talking to each other.It's the best piece of communication that I've seen in a long, long time, and it's working very well.BLITZER: There was an editorial Friday in the New York Times. I'll read this -- this section from it. ""Three years after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, residents there are nervously watching the progress of Tropical Storm, threatening to be Hurricane Gustav."" It's now a Category 3 or 4.""No less nerve-racking is the knowledge that federal emergency planners have failed to come up with a new strategy for providing housing to disaster victims.""Is the New York Times right in their editorial?PAULISON: No, they're not. We have a national strategy housing plan that came out for '08. Our national housing strategy we just released last month. We have plans in place to make sure we can take care of people.There is -- you know, we're not going to use travel trailers, obviously, but we have mobile homes, we have Katrina cottages, we have Mississippi cottages, we have apartments, we have hotels and motels. There's a whole process that we're going to use to make sure people have a place to stay. We're not going to repeat the same mistakes we did in Katrina.There's -- it's a different agency, Wolf. It really is, a different philosophy of being proactive and not reactive, working as partners with the state, instead of working independently, an entirely different type of system.Again, are we going to have our challenges? No question about it. This is a very, very dangerous storm.So right now, we're focused on evacuations, working with the state, working with the local communities to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to evacuate. We don't want anyone -- anyone to stay in the city and try to ride the storm out. We want them to get out and move to a safe place.BLITZER: And one final question, Administrator Paulison. Is it your sense right now that Gustav could be actually worse, more devastating than Katrina?PAULISON: That's a possibility. Yesterday, it briefly went to a Category 5, then back down to a Category 4. This morning, thank goodness, it's a Category 3. But it has to go across the rest of the gulf.If it comes in at a different angle, it will test parts of the levee that were not tested during Katrina. The Corps has done a yeoman's job of rebuilding the levees, making them higher and stronger, but there are still a lot of vulnerabilities.This could be a -- this could be a much worse storm. Hopefully, it won't be, but the possibilities are definitely there.BLITZER: And New Orleans is -- based on everything you know right now, right sort of in the bull's eye?PAULISON: That's the way it appears to be right now. Now, you know, with the hurricanes, after it came off of Cuba, it's going to be difficult to predict for a few hours exactly where it's going to go.We've been getting reports from the hurricane center 150 miles one way or the other, but right now it looks like it's heading right towards New Orleans or just to the west of New Orleans. BLITZER: FEMA Administrator David Paulison, Mr. Paulison, good luck to you. Good luck to all the men and women you command. We're all counting on you, as you know.PAULISON: Thank you, Wolf, I appreciate it. Appreciate your support.BLITZER: Thank you very much.And as you can see, this is a monster storm with very, very dangerous ramifications.I want to go back to Reynolds Wolf at the CNN Severe Weather Center.Reynolds, I interrupted you before when we went to Michael Chertoff, the secretary of homeland security, who was at Andrews Air Force Base getting ready to fly down to the Gulf Coast.All right, walk us through this process, where it is right now, where it's heading. And you just heard the FEMA administrator say New Orleans could be right in the bull's eye.WOLF: Absolutely. Wolf, one thing we've got to remember though, too, is, when Katrina made landfall, you'll remember that Katrina didn't even make a direct hit on New Orleans. In fact, it passed to the east, which meant that, if it passes to the east, it means that New Orleans was affected by the western half of the storm, the weakest part of the storm.The way the path plays out -- I want you to follow this -- go from now into tomorrow morning, where it is expected to strengthen back up to a Category 4 storm with winds of 145 miles per hour. And then the forecast of the National Hurricane Center brings the storm on the eastern side. The eastern side of the storm is what will be affecting parts of New Orleans.So New Orleans could be affected by the strongest part, the heaviest rainfall, the biggest storm surge, the strongest winds, on that side is -- and I'm thinking that the eye will make landfall about 60 to 70 miles to the southwest of New Orleans sometime tomorrow afternoon between the hours of, say, 1 o'clock and 3 o'clock local time.And because it's going to be that side, the right-hand side, which Secretary Chertoff was talking about, that does mean that New Orleans will be hit by the strongest part of the storm.Still, you look at that cone of probability, of uncertainty, if you will, there's a chance the storm could veer off a little bit more to the east, perhaps a bit to the west, but, still, a storm of this size, hundreds of miles wide, there's no question that New Orleans is going to be affected.BLITZER: And when you say it could still veer off a little bit, that's as a result of the water temperatures, the winds as it goes across the Gulf Coast, is that right?WOLF: Actually, what we have is we have an area of high pressure that is setting up over the Ohio Valley. And it's that area of high pressure, Wolf, that moves in a clockwise rotation. And actually the upper level winds can steer -- we refer to them as steering currents -- can actually push this storm a little bit farther off to the west.If they weaken a little bit, well, the storm tends to turn a little bit more to the east. So it all depends a lot on those upper- level winds.Now, you were talking about water temperatures. Water temperatures are the big thing that really can strengthen this storm.In fact, just to the south -- actually, to the north of Cuba at this time, we have an area that we refer to as the gulf loop current, where you have water that comes in right between the Yucatan Channel to the northwest of Cuba and then back into the Strait of Florida, this is a -- really, really warm water, water temperatures anywhere from, say, the mid- to upper 80s.And that's like high-octane fuel for these storms. And that's what really could intensify this storm, cause it to gain in strength to a Category 4, perhaps even a Category 5 storm before all is said and done. BLITZER: Well, we're praying for everyone affected by this.Reynolds, stand by. I know you're getting constant updates. We're going to come back to you.We're standing by to speak to the Florida governor, Charlie Crist. He certainly knows a great deal about hurricanes. It looks like Florida is going to be spared this time, but there's another hurricane potentially out there called Hanna. We're going to talk to Charlie Crist, the governor of Florida, in a moment.BLITZER: Also, this Republican Convention, you see it here, I'm here at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul. Everything is up in the air right now based on what's happening along the Gulf Coast. We'll update you on what we know right after this. You're watching a special LATE EDITION. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Welcome back to our special LATE EDITION. I'm Wolf Blitzer reporting. We're here on the floor at the Republican National Convention. It's supposed to get started tomorrow, but everything right now is up in the air. They are trying to reconsider what to do as Hurricane Gustav moves towards the Gulf Coast with New Orleans right in the center of it, could be in the bull's eye.Right now we just heard from the FEMA administrator, David Paulison, and from the secretary of homeland secretary, Michael Chertoff. The governor of Florida, Charlie Crist, is joining us now from St. Petersburg.Governor, God knows you and all Floridians have had your wealth of experience, share of experience on hurricanes. Correct me if I'm wrong, Florida at least as far as Gustav is concerned, has been spared, is that right?GOV. CHARLIE CRIST, R-FLA.: Well, it looks better for us now than it did, say, yesterday. But we're still concerned in the panhandle about rip currents and things of that nature. We also had some bands that came through the Fort Myers area this morning and had some tornado warnings in the Florida Keys.So we're concerned about it. We're concerned for our neighbors too. And we want to make sure that anything that Florida can do to help our friends out in Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, we stand at the ready to do so.And I've talked to my fellow governors about that fact and communicated with our director of emergency management, Craig Fugate, this morning, to reach out and make sure they know that we're here to help and anything that we can do to be of assistance, that's exactly what we want to do.BLITZER: Can you believe, Governor, that this is virtually the same -- this is the third anniversary of Katrina and that New Orleans could be hit with a devastating Category 3 or Category 4 or maybe even a Category 5 hurricane right now. Can you believe that? CRIST: No, Wolf, it's hard to believe, it really is. But, you know, things happen, and you just have to be prepared and I think that's the watchword. And I've got to tell you, Governor Jindal is doing a great job. I just listened to your interview with Secretary Chertoff and Director Paulison with FEMA.I've been in communication with them this week as well and I couldn't be more pleased for the people of Louisiana and the entire Gulf Coast for the response from our federal government, the working and coordinated effort between the governors of the Gulf states.It is inspiring to see. People are prepared and it's a much different situation than three years ago, and that's a good thing for the people.BLITZER: And as you know, Governor, there's another storm brewing in the Caribbean right now, in the Atlantic, Hanna, right now, and there's some projections showing that Florida could be hit. What do we know about Hanna?CRIST: Well, we know that we're concerned about it, there's no question there. Again, I was talking to our meteorologists this morning, and they told me that some of the models really have sort of blown up, and we're not sure exactly where it will go over the next three or four days, but certainly Florida could be in its sights.It depends on this high weather stuff and the high pressure that you get from these steering currents that they talk about so much in the weather rooms. And so we're watching and monitoring that as well. It's like we have one on our left and one on our right and we're sort of in the middle of the eye of it.And we want to do everything we can to monitor the situation, to be vigilant, to first and foremost, put the people of Florida and our Gulf State neighbors and their health, safety, and welfare at the forefront.BLITZER: Are you going to be able to come out here to St. Paul and participate in this Republican Convention?CRIST: Well, it's looking less likely. It all depends on what happens with these storms. I mean, you know, first things first, and that is protect the people of my state and make sure that we're doing everything we can to support them, give them care and comfort and be there for them.We just had Tropical Storm Fay that came through and hit Florida an unprecedented four times. Regrettably, 14 of my fellow Floridians lost their lives as a result of that. So first and foremost, we need to be here for the people, and that's what I'm going to do.BLITZER: Gloria Borger is here, our senior political analyst, Governor. She has a question she wants to ask you.CRIST: Good morning, Gloria. GLORIA BORGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Governor, what strikes you -- good morning. What strikes you as the most different between now and three years ago when Katrina struck?CRIST: I think it's the level of preparation and the fact that so many people have, you know, been on the front side of this rather than the back side, really addressing the needs of the people in terms of making sure they get out, that there is safe passage in order to get north in Louisiana, that all the roadways are headed in the same direction.It's a tremendous, well-coordinated, well-planned effort. You know, we learned from our past mistakes in life, and clearly that's what has happened here. The Katrina example is not a good one and a dark cloud over America at that time.But you learn from those experiences, you move forward and from those kinds of mistakes of the past you get better. And the federal government, the state governments, and the local responders, God bless them, are doing great and coordinating incredibly well, and that's really a benefit to the people and their safety and their security.BLITZER: Governor Crist, thanks very much for joining us. Good luck to everyone in Florida, not only as far as Gustav is concerned, but Hanna, which is brewing out in the Atlantic right now. We'll stay in close touch with you.CRIST: Thank you, Wolf. Thank you, Gloria.BLITZER: And there are new developments happening here in St. Paul, Minnesota, right now. What's going to happen to this Republican Convention? Our John King has been doing some digging. He's standing by, he's here with us. We'll take a quick break. Much more of our coverage right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Welcome back. We're here on the floor of the Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minnesota, but everything is up in the air right now. We don't know if this convention will take place, whether it will be abbreviated or what's going on. But John King is here, and you've been doing some reporting. What are you hearing from the organizers?JOHN KING, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Number one, we will get an official announcement sometime early this afternoon. They are having another set of meetings today. They had meetings late into the night last night.We know already, even though the White House says the president is unlikely to come, we're told he's not coming. They are just saying that for now...BLITZER: He was supposed to speak Monday night, and the vice president, Dick Cheney, was supposed to be here Monday as well.KING: Unless the storm suddenly does an unexpected u-turn, which we all know won't happen, unfortunately, the president will not be here. He'll focus on hurricane preparations. I'm told that everything is on the table, including the possibility of delaying the start tomorrow, or, increasingly more likely, is trying to pack the convention into one or two days before the hurricane makes landfall or before the damage is most severe.They have to nominate John McCain. The party has to go through a process to officially nominate him, and they are trying to figure out how do they do that most efficiently and not have a big party going on during the hurricane.And this is at Senator McCain's insistence. He's down in the Gulf Coast area today. He's flying there right now. He's spoken in the last 24 hours to everybody from Mike Chertoff, the homeland security secretary, to all those Gulf state governors, including Governor Crist, who you just had on; Haley Barbour of Mississippi; Bobby Jindal in Louisiana. And he says, let's do what we need to do, but let's not, A, have a political celebration and B, do anything that disrupts or takes resources away.So we'll get an official announcement later this afternoon, but we're guaranteed very substantial changes to the planned program. BLITZER: Because our meteorologist, Reynolds Wolf, says this hurricane could hit New Orleans between 1:00 and 3:00 p.m. Central Time tomorrow, Monday afternoon.KING: Right, and that's the hard part. They want to wait -- that's one of the key elements, what is the exact timing. Can they get the business done before it makes landfall, or get it done at least as fast as possible? Or should they delay and wait until after, and give it a couple of days to see what happens? But if they do that and it is a severe and significant storm, then the country is in the middle of a recovery effort, possibly a rescue effort. So this is the very -- this has never happened before to a major political party, so they are making very difficult decisions, and the top McCain campaign command is here, and Senator McCain is obviously keeping in touch as he travels to the region.BLITZER: Rick Davis, the campaign manager, is already here in St. Paul and is meeting with organizers, and we expect some word later this afternoon, is that right?KING: Yes, we will.BLITZER: Alex Castellanos, you're a Republican strategist. What should the Republicans do about this convention, given the fact that Hurricane Gustav is a Category 4 monster with New Orleans, we just heard from the FEMA administrator and from Michael Chertoff, New Orleans, bull's eye. Could be right in the middle of it?ALEX CASTELLANOS, GOP STRATEGIST: I think most people here, I talked to the delegates and they are all very concerned that this is certainly not a time for a bunch of political hoopla. The delegates here are saying, look, what can we do to help? Can we turn this into an opportunity to do something and have a positive impact on this?The experience last time is very clear, that when you have something like this happen, this is a time for Americans to come together and put politics at the back of the line, and that's the message that Republicans want to send out of this convention.BLITZER: Is that what you're hearing, Gloria?BORGER: Talk about turning this into a big fund-raiser for social service organizations. It's not only a question of scheduling and whether you truncate the convention, but it's a question of tone, as I think is what Alex is talking about.You can't be out there attacking your political opponent while people's lives are threatened in this country, and so everyone here is very, very well aware of that, Wolf. So, you know, it will be condensed, but it will be different. And maybe they will raise money for the Red Cross and maybe they will start raising money for all sorts of social service organizations. They will do whatever they can, because they realize that this is something that would turn the American public off, quite frankly.BLITZER: Right. I can only imagine what the Louisiana delegation is going through right now, wondering should they come, should they not come, should they be with their loved ones?I want to bring in Donna Brazile, our Democratic strategist. Donna, you're in Washington right now, but all of our viewers know you're from Louisiana and you have a lot of family members down there. What's their status?DONNA BRAZILE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, thank you, Wolf, first of all. They got out this time. Mayor Nagin made it very clear that people should evacuate, and as of 2:00 a.m. this morning, my last sibling got out. And she made it to Memphis about an hour ago. I have family now scattered in five states. But, Wolf, this is for those of us who remember Katrina three years ago, this time they heeded the warnings. They left.BLITZER: And what are you hearing about other friends and acquaintances, the overall situation? Is it really better this time? Because we hear it's better that they learn the lessons of Katrina, and people are doing a better job getting out of the whole Gulf Coast area that could be hit, especially in the New Orleans area, which is so vulnerable, as all of our viewers know. Are you satisfied with what you're hearing, Donna?BRAZILE: Yes, Wolf. You know, my major concern, outside of my family, of course, is the people in New Orleans. There are so many people that cannot afford to get out of harm's way. And Mayor Nagin, the state government, the federal government, all worked together to coordinate buses. There were buses in practically all of the important neighborhoods of the low-lying areas -- Algiers, even across the river. People were able to get there, get on those buses. They are heading to Shreveport, they are heading to points north.The mayor also has called in emergency workers to evacuate some of the hospitals. You've covered a lot of this, but I just want to let you know personally, just talking to people -- I served on the Louisiana Recovery Authority. This time around, people feel that the government, the federal government, the state government and the local government, everyone is working together, and people have the essential information to get out there. They know the routes to take. The buses are there. They are giving them supplies, and we're also able to get the pets out this time as well.BLITZER: What do you think, Donna, the Republicans should do right now about their convention? It's supposed to begin tomorrow. It's supposed to go on until Thursday night, but it potentially is not going to happen, or at least there will be a truncated version of the convention.BRAZILE: Well, as you well know, there are certain things that must take place procedurally, but I think at some point, they should suspend the rules, go ahead and nominate John McCain and his running mate, the governor of Alaska, and just really take this moment to help those Americans who are fleeing the entire Gulf Coast, and to assist them in their recovery efforts. Because, as you well know, once that storm hits, emergency supplies will have to be sent into the region to help those who may have been stranded, as well as to help those who will have to figure out how to get back home and rebuild their lives again.BLITZER: And let me ask Alex, quickly, do you agree?CASTELLANOS: Yes, absolutely. And Donna made a good point, and that is there is business that does have to be taken care of.BLITZER: (inaudible) nominate, you have to nominate a candidate.CASTELLANOS: If we do not take care of that business, John McCain doesn't get on the ballot in a lot of states. There is no presidential election.BLITZER: But they can do all that in half an hour, or an hour if they want.CASTELLANOS: I don't know how long it takes, but it certainly doesn't take four days.BLITZER: Yes.BORGER: You know, Wolf, there is particular sensibility on the Republican side about this issue, because George W. Bush was blamed for failures in the rescue efforts in Hurricane Katrina. John McCain has made it a point to say that he would have managed that differently. And so every Republican I talked to here understands that particularly for the Republican Party, they have got to have the right tone and they have got to do it right this time.BLITZER: All right, guys, I want everybody to stand by, because we have a lot more. We're watching Hurricane Gustav. It's moving, it's moving towards New Orleans and the Gulf Coast right now. There's enormous danger, not only in Louisiana but potentially Mississippi and Texas. We're watching what's going on.BLITZER: We'll give you a complete update.We're also here at the convention, the Republican Convention. We don't know if there will be a convention, how long of a convention. As soon as we know what's going on, we'll share it with you. This is a special LATE EDITION and we'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Welcome back to the floor of the Republican National Convention. I'm Wolf Blitzer. This is a special LATE EDITION. We're watching what's happening here at the Republican Convention, all the planning that has been going on for weeks and months up in the air right now because of Hurricane Gustav, it's a Category 4 monster right now moving right towards the Louisiana coast, including New Orleans.We have a new forecast. They are about to release a new forecast very, very soon at the top of the hour. Stand by. We'll see if there has been any changes in intensity or direction. We'll bring you that momentarily.But I want to go to the floor of the convention right now. CNN's Howard Kurtz of our ""RELIABLE SOURCES"" is standing by with three really plugged-in reporters who can give us a good sense of what they know about this convention and the impact it's facing as a result of Gustav -- Howie.HOWARD KURTZ, HOST, ""RELIABLE SOURCES"": Thanks, Wolf. Well, all the reporters have dragged themselves here from Denver but not before being rocked by McCain's choice of Sarah Palin to be his running mate. So will McCain and Palin get the same kind of coverage here in St. Paul that Barack Obama and Joe Biden did at the Democratic Convention?Joining me now is Dana Milbank, Washington Post columnist and CNN contributor; Lynn Sweet, Washington bureau chief of The Chicago Sun- Times; and Roger Simon, chief political columnist for politico.com. We'll get to the hurricane in just a minute.But, Dana, seconds after Palin's name leaked, the TV pundits, the anchors were saying, is she qualified to be a heartbeat from the presidency? Is she a token woman? How fair was that?DANA MILBANK, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Of course she's qualified, she was a former Miss Wasilla. But, look, it took everybody by surprise, the announcement made us collectively in the media look like a bunch of fools because we were authoritatively proclaiming the short list and she wasn't actually on it.So there were complaints of sort of soft sexism actually from the right and the left. But in general I think she got a pretty good splash out of it there.KURTZ: Your publication Politico said this was a desperate move by John McCain. Isn't it a tad early for that judgment?ROGER SIMON, CHIEF POLITICAL COLUMNIST, POLITICO: Yes, what has upset the media is that we realize we're no longer John McCain's base. He made this decision for another base, the social conservatives in the Republican Party and we're sort of shocked and dismayed by that.But, you know, her choice makes some sense on a number of levels.KURTZ: On the coverage of this woman who most of America doesn't know, Lynn Sweet, she has been described as an ex-beauty queen, Dana has already taken that shot, a woman who goes ice fishing and likes to eat mooseburgers.There seems to be a little bit of a subtle mockery here that some might say is sexist.LYNN SWEET, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, THE CHICAGO SUN-TIMES: Actually, I think quite the opposite right now because they have gotten out a fuller resume. It is their job to tell the whole story. She's also an athlete, a mayor, government official, mother of five, and that is just her biography.This is an election where story line means a lot. It has taken Obama partly to where he is today. I...KURTZ: But Politico also asks the question, how will she balance raising her five kids with the demands of a national campaign or being in the White House, a question that would never be asked of a man?SWEET: And right. And people that start the coverage like that I think are looking at it through a lens that is unfair right and could be called sexist. I think that will go away. Part of this happens when the media is surprised, Howie. And the usual thing that...KURTZ: We're supposed to be professionals. Who cares if we're surprised. So we got it wrong.SWEET: Well, I think...KURTZ: It wasn't Romney. It wasn't Pawlenty.SWEET: And then that hurts the mainstream press because if there's one thing left in this very competitive reporting atmosphere, is that the blogosphere will say, well, what good are we if we couldn't even figure this out ahead of time or game it enough to put her on the media list?SIMON: You know, there's nothing wrong with waiting for reality. I'm not sure it is really our duty to guess 48 hours in advance what we're going to know 48 hours in the future.KURTZ: Well, especially when McCain hadn't quite made up his mind. But does a conservative woman, Dana Milbank, who is fervently opposed to abortion and certain forms of gay rights get different treatment from the media -- some would say the liberal media, than a liberal woman might if Barack Obama had picked a woman or if he had picked Hillary?MILBANK: You know, i do give the blogosphere some credit here because we are getting hammered in the media from both the right, as would you expect it, but also from the left, the same people who were complaining about our treatment of Hillary Clinton, a lot of them are coming out and saying, hey, you're being unfair. So there is a bit of consistency to it.So yes, I think inevitably there's a little bit of that going on, but that's not the dominant theme, I think.KURTZ: How much is the hurricane as it barrels down the Gulf going to draw media attention away from what's happening here in this arena?SIMON: Oh, I think we're going to see a split screen convention where, you know, half the screen or more is going to be Katrina and the other half is going to be here. They are talking about canceling whole days or canceling the nomination itself.I think it's like letting the terrorists win. I think they ought to go ahead with this thing, forget about the balloon drop. The balloons are there but it's a cliche anyway. They can do all sorts of stuff. They can contribute blood here. They can pass the hat for money. They can make serious speeches.But this does serve a legal purpose. They are choosing a nominee for the Republican presidential campaign.KURTZ: And of course, we have to decide how much attention we're going to place on a very important convention here and the introduction of Sarah Palin and all of that. But, on the other hand, a million people have been evacuated from the Gulf.Let's look back briefly at the Democratic Convention. All the things that were in the media about the Hillary revolt, the roll call, the stadium, the Greek columns, none of that seems very important after the convention actually took place. Did we focus on the wrong things?SWEET: Well, I think it was this very situational and for the time it was ephemeral that we were writing about which why we correctly, I think, are moving on. The McCain people counted on the announcement of his vice presidential choice to capture the headlines.And now between this and the hurricane the -- all of the success of the Obama convention will not be what we're focusing on because the story line has moved on, Howie. KURTZ: Barack Obama got rave reviews, some would say, gushing reviews for his big speech at Invesco Field. McCain obviously is not that kind of orator so is there likely to be a real difference in the way the speeches are covered and contrasted by our journalistic colleagues?MILBANK: Likely to be a huge difference. I mean, Bill Maher on Friday night was suggesting that the anchors on another network were ready to have sex with the candidate that night.I think there is going to be a huge disparity in the treatment, but a lot of it has to do with this candidate named Gustav. So a lot will be situational rather than reflecting some sort of a media bias. KURTZ: Leaving the weather -- the extreme weather aside, is it fair for us to go crazy over one candidate who happens to be a great speaker, doesn't necessarily mean he's going to be a great president versus John McCain?MILBANK: Right.SIMON: The bar is lowered for McCain. Everyone knows he is not the speaker that Barack Obama is.And he's had difficult moments. He really needs a TelePrompTer. He doesn't like to read speeches. And when you make him read a speech, he reads it from the podium, and tends to put his head down, and his campaign spends a lot of time working with him on it.All he has to do is be sincere, and warm, and strong, and experienced, and look presidential.KURTZ: And beat the media's expectations. That's the game.SIMON: Which may not be hard.KURTZ: Roger Simon, Lynn Sweet, Dana Milbank, thanks for joining us.Wolf Blitzer, back to you.BLITZER: Howie, thanks very much. Thank the reporters, as well.We're just getting in from the National Hurricane Center an update on where Hurricane Gustav is moving right now, its intensity. Our severe weather expert, Reynolds Wolf, is standing by. We're going to go to him momentarily.Also, Susan Roesgen, she's in New Orleans. She's getting ready, like others are, for this monster storm. Much more of our special coverage right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Let's go right to Reynolds Wolf.Reynolds, you have an update from the National Hurricane Center on Hurricane Gustav?WOLF: That's right, Wolf. This just in. Winds are still at 120 miles an hour, gusting to 150. It's about 400 miles or so from New Orleans.The latest we have for you, Wolf, is that it has picked up quite a bit of its forward speed, still to the northwest, but at a little bit of a faster clip.Originally, we thought that it was going to make landfall around -- anywhere between 1 o'clock or 3 o'clock local time. Now it appears that, as we get into early Monday morning, winds will be at 135, still a major hurricane, but making landfall around noontime local time.You'll also notice, Wolf, we do anticipate the storm will actually increase to a Category 4 storm shortly before making landfall.Still, New Orleans, right there in that cone of uncertainty, by all sorts of the imagination, will catch the brunt of the storm, in terms of a tremendous amount of rainfall, some strong wind gusts, well in excess of 100 miles per hour, and storm surge that could be in excess of 15 feet, certainly a rough time for the Crescent City.We are going to keep a sharp eye on this, Wolf. And as we get more updates, we're going to pass them on to you.BLITZER: And how would this compare -- very briefly, Reynolds -- with Katrina?WOLF: Katrina, you'll remember, passed a little bit more to the east, which actually, at that time, New Orleans actually caught the weakest part of the storm.The biggest reason why we had the issues with Katrina really had very little to do with just the sheer force of Katrina, but rather just because of the failure of the levees. And you had, of course, the widespread problems in New Orleans.This time, you're going to have more direct contact with this storm in New Orleans. It could be devastating, there's no question.BLITZER: All right. Stand by, Reynolds. We're going to be coming back to you.We're going to go to Susan Roesgen. She's in New Orleans right now. Much more of ""Late Edition"" right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: This is a special ""Late Edition."" I'm Wolf Blitzer.We're here in St. Paul, Minnesota, getting ready for what's supposed to be the Republican National Convention, but everything is up in the air right now because of a monster storm, Hurricane Gustav. It's moving towards the U.S. Gulf Coast.It's a Category 3, Category 4. It could become a Category 5 storm, with New Orleans right in the bull's eye.We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer reporting.Let's get the latest, because only moments ago the National Hurricane Center issued an update. Reynolds Wolf is standing by.Update our viewers on what we know about this storm, Reynolds.WOLF: All right, Wolf. The latest we have is the storm, Hurricane Gustav, now a Category 3 storm, still a major hurricane. We've seen some weakening since the overnight hours. And right now, winds still strong at 120 miles per hour. It's about 400 miles or so just from New Orleans.It is moving to the northwest at 17 miles an hour. That is the biggest change we've seen with the storm since the earlier update. We've seen a little bit of a greater speed in its forward progress as it treks its way to the northwest.And the latest we have from the National Hurricane Center shows the storm continuing on that northwest trajectory, expected to make landfall somewhere to the southwest, I'd say about 60 to 70 miles southwest of New Orleans.Notice this, Wolf, a key thing right here: winds increasing to 135 miles an hour early Monday morning. What they expect is the National Hurricane Center is banking that this storm is going to move into an area of minimal sheer aloft. That's winds high aloft that can tear the storm apart. The structure is very important for the storm to retain its power.The second thing it's going to run into, an area of water temperatures that will be into the mid- to upper 80s. That's like high-octane fuel for these huge powerhouse storms.And we anticipate the storm will make landfall somewhere in that area, again, just at the southwest of New Orleans, sometime around noon tomorrow. It's going to bring anywhere from, say, 13 to 18 feet of storm surge, heavy rainfall, winds well in excess of 100 miles per hour.Then the storm will begin to die out once it moves over central Louisiana. And then notice into Wednesday and into Thursday, it all but pulls -- actually, pulls up stationary, for the most part, dumping quite a bit of rain. Some places in Texas, Louisiana could see well over a foot of rainfall by the middle and the late half of next week.A huge powerhouse, no question, Wolf.BLITZER: Reynolds, show our viewers the projections. There have been various computer projections of where this storm will actually hit, how wide it might be. I want to put that up on the screen for our viewers.WOLF: Absolutely. What we're talking about is -- the layman's term for this would be the spaghetti models. The reason why we call them the spaghetti models is because, plain and simple, they look like lines of spaghetti.You'll see in the map behind me different computer models showing the current location of Gustav. And then you have computer models that show the storm possibly moving up towards Mobile, Alabama, maybe even past Dauphin Island, or maybe even closer to Houston, not far from Texas Bay.Now, there are two models that the National Hurricane Center watches very closely. One is called the GDFL. This other one they watch is one that we call the HWRF.Well, those two models, they look at both of those. Those are the ones that -- they're usually the most reliable models.And then they use their own expertise. And these guys are the very best in the business. And they indicate the storm, or at least they think, that the storm will move its way, as I mentioned, just to the southwest of Louisiana.The thing is, though, Wolf, these storms are very hard, very difficult to follow. The storms -- remember, rotating storms, on a rotating planet, spinning over choppy water. You've got all kinds of winds aloft that can push the storm in a different direction, many variables that can change the storm minute by minute, hour by hour.And it's something you have to watch very carefully, no question.BLITZER: Reynolds, stand by. We're going to be getting back to you.Susie Roesgen is on the scene in New Orleans. But before we go to her, John King is getting some new information -- Susie, stand by for a moment -- new information about this convention and the impact from Hurricane Gustav.KING: White House press secretary Dana Perino, Wolf, just a few moments ago has now officially confirmed that neither the president nor the vice president will come here for the convention.Both President Bush and Vice President Cheney, we are told now, will stay in Washington or perhaps go to places affected by the storm. But because of Hurricane Gustav, they have made the decision now that they will not come.The president and vice president, obviously, were on the program Monday night, the opening night of the convention. The White House says, as of now, First Lady Laura Bush still plans to attend.But as we discussed a bit earlier, they will have an announcement in an hour, maybe two hours from now -- they're in meetings this morning finalizing it -- on dramatic changes to the convention program. And there's a possibility this convention could be delayed or they could even squeeze it down and try to do all the official business in one day or so.They're watching what Reynolds Wolf was just reporting. They're watching the track of the storm, the strength of the storm, before they make the final decisions. And there's so much anguish among the planners, the people who have spent months and years planning this gathering.But they understand, because of the severity of this storm, they can't have a big political party. Exactly the changes we'll know soon, but we're beginning to see the evidence of it now with the official word that neither the president nor the vice president will come. BLITZER: And it's potentially possible they could -- if there is a convention at all, they could address the convention via satellite.KING: They could. The plan for the president, if there is a convention, is to address via satellite. We don't have a backup plan for the vice president just yet.But the theme of this convention was supposed to be service anyway. Now they're making dramatic plans about maybe trying to raise money, maybe trying to -- you know, take a blood drive. What can they do to help the people affected by this storm, as opposed to having a big political party?But, again, the rules require them to nominate John McCain. John McCain -- they have to do the official business. I was just told a few minutes ago they could, in a worst-case scenario, do that in about two hours.BLITZER: And they have to nominate the vice presidential nominee, as well, Sarah Palin, the governor of Alaska.Stand by. We're going to talk about all of this fallout. Former Senator Fred Thompson is here. Gloria is here with us, as well.But I want to go to New Orleans right now. Susie Roesgen is on the scene for us.You've lived there for some time. You no longer live there, but you know this story about as well as anyone.Susie, set the scene for us right now. Is New Orleans evacuated? Have thousands of people already left? Are more leaving right now?SUSAN ROESGEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Oh, absolutely, Wolf, so many more than during Katrina and so much earlier. Many people got out on city buses. They got out on Amtrak trains. The famous city of New Orleans has been taking people out of this city.People who have their own transportation are getting out. I think the city is going to be very empty within the next few hours, except for the hospitals. There are a few hospitals, Wolf -- and I'm in front of one of them, Children's Hospital.Behind me, there are 80 patients, 80 child patients in here, 47 of whom are in critical care units. They're not going anywhere. They might not survive a rushed evacuation.So the doctors and nurses here, many of them, have volunteered to stay behind. They say they've got 70,000 gallons of diesel fuel, enough to power generators here for three weeks. They're ready. They believe that they're going to be safe.They're going to have a contingent of police officers and firemen. There are also other hospitals, a few others around the city, that are going to stay open. Wolf, if they have to get out of here, which could be the case -- you never know -- let me show you what they have over here, something they did not have in Hurricane Katrina. Since then, they have built a second floor helipad, and that's the way they'll get these patients out of here, if they have to.But right now they think they can withstand it. Everybody else in this city, Wolf, gets the message. Get out. Don't try to ride it out.BLITZER: And what about those people who have pets? We remember the thousands, tens of thousands who refused to leave the last time. They didn't want to leave their cats or their dogs behind. What are the -- what are the authorities doing about that situation right now?ROESGEN: Well, you know, Wolf, you'd have to be a pet owner to understand. This is like children to many people. Their pets are like their children.So, yes, the city this time around started evacuating people with their pets first, got them on some of those buses, got them to shelters in the northern part of the state, so the city is trying to do everything to stop any possible excuse, including, Wolf, there was looting last time.People were afraid to leave their homes because they said, ""We don't want our homes to be looted,"" and there was that. This time around, a contingent of 3,000 national guardsmen here protecting the city. So there's no excuse this time. Everyone needs to get out.BLITZER: Susie Roesgen is on the scene for us. We have a whole team of reporters, our intrepid, very courageous reporters who are on the scene. They're getting ready for this. Anderson Cooper is there, as well. We're going to check in with all of them. Stand by for that.And Mayor Ray Nagin of New Orleans, he's getting ready for a news conference to update us on what's happening in that city. This is virtually almost exactly three years since Hurricane Katrina, and now New Orleans once again in the bull's eye of a major hurricane, a hurricane, Category 3 right now, but that could go up to a Category 4 or even a Category 5.We'll continue our coverage of this hurricane, the impact on this Republican convention, and much more. This is a special ""Late Edition."" We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Welcome back to St. Paul, Minnesota. We're here on the floor of the Republican National Convention. It's supposed to start tomorrow, but everything right now unclear because of Hurricane Gustav. We've just been told, and you heard John King report it here live, that both President Bush and Vice President Cheney, they've decided they are not coming here to St. Paul. They were supposed to address this convention tomorrow, but because of this monster storm that's supposed to hit early afternoon tomorrow and potentially in New Orleans itself, they are not coming, and we're waiting to see what the convention organizers are going to do.We're standing by for a news conference. Mayor Ray Nagin in New Orleans is going to be briefing reporters on his city. On this, the third anniversary of Katrina, New Orleans once again facing another devastating storm. We'll go there live once Mayor Nagin starts speaking, but let's talk a little bit about what all of this means for the Republican National Convention and more.Joining us is Senator Fred Thompson, the former senator from Tennessee, former Republican presidential candidate. Senator, thanks very much for joining us.FORMER U.S. SENATOR FRED THOMPSON: Good to be with you.BLITZER: I don't remember a time when a political convention has been postponed or consolidated, truncated because of a natural disaster like this. You've been going to these conventions for a long time. Do you remember anything like this at all?THOMPSON: No, I don't. It just reminds us, I suppose, of the importance of events and the importance of things that haven't happened yet in our lives and certainly with regard to politics. And, you know, we just have to take them as they come and try to do the right thing.You know, I'm very impressed. It looks like the evacuation is going well. State and local officials are working together. Republican and Democrats are all being responsible in what they are saying and trying to do about it. And maybe here in the midst of this most political part of the political season, we can actually focus on, you know, some important things together.BLITZER: That would be good. I assume you agree, though, that at a time when people are fleeing their homes and there could be a huge disaster, it's no time for Republicans to be seen on this convention floor partying and hoopla and having a great time.THOMPSON: That's absolutely correct, but there's more to it than that. There's a reality underneath the appearance, and that is that people are concerned about what's happening down there, and people have loved ones and friends, and it's a part of our country. And, you know, we don't want to be diverted from attention on to that.KING: Have you heard anything, Senator, from the organizers about how they hope -- we know they are going to dramatically change the schedule, perhaps condensing the convention, but there's also talk of turning this into a service event, trying to take advantage, if you will, of all the people who are here and use volunteerism, fund- raising, something to help those who are affected by the storm. Still fluid, or are they starting to nail these things down?THOMPSON: I don't know, you know, I really don't know about that. I haven't been here very long myself. I was supposed to make a little talk tomorrow night about the relevant (ph) time, and of course that -- everything is all up in the air.Sounds like a good idea to me. I know that John McCain and Governor Palin are going down to Mississippi today, if they are not already there, and are going to be doing what they can there. I'm sure the Obama campaign is going to respond appropriately also. And, you know, we'll do the same thing here.It's unfortunate, of course, a lot of wonderful people and good workers coming from all over the country to a great expense to come here and celebrate together. But, again, we've got to keep our priorities straight.BORGER: Is this a particular matter of sensibility for Republicans, given the mismanagement of Hurricane Katrina?THOMPSON: No, I don't think so. The administration received a lot of criticism last time, no question about it. So did state and local government, you know, and there's enough blame to go around there, but that's kind of all in the past now. And it has some relevance, I guess, from that standpoint, but, you know, John...BORGER: John McCain has criticized the president's management.THOMPSON: Well, of course. I mean, I guess my point is there's no carry-over there as far as Republicans are concerned now, because they have got a leader now who has been critical when criticism was called for, and who is always about, you know, service and sacrifice and leadership, and that's what you're seeing now in his reaction to what's happening there.BLITZER: I suppose, Senator, you like all of us were pretty surprised at John McCain's decision to pick the Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate. Be honest.THOMPSON: For a change?(LAUGHTER) I was surprised and delighted. I think it was an absolute -- you know -- great thing. This -- she is the kind of person that all of us in the Beltway and outside the Beltway are always talking about that we want, you know, somebody -- an outsider, somebody who will not get sucked in by the political process, somebody who is independent, somebody who will stand up to corruption and all that kind of thing. Well, guess what, that's exactly what you got.BLITZER: But the criticism...THOMPSON: And in many cases, she is a mirror of John McCain in that regard.BLITZER: The criticism is those are all excellent attributes that she has, but she has limited experience, a governor for less than two years, and really no national security or foreign policy experience.THOMPSON: Well, Wolf, I hate to break this to you, but you don't get national security experience by being on Sunday talk shows, and that's where a lot of these fellows get theirs. And you don't get national security experience from sitting on the floor of the Senate or the House and listening to what goes on there.The fact of the matter is, she's been in -- so some of those who claim it really don't have much either. She's been in public service for about 13 years now, state and local government. She is a reformer. She has experience not only in politics but in life. She's a mother of five children, and from an infant to a young man going into the military. And she has more experience than Barack Obama.So I think as long as we can continue to compare her experience with the presidential nominee of the Democrats, we're going to be in pretty good shape.BLITZER: Go ahead.BORGER: What do you say to those voters who are concerned about John McCain's age -- he's 72 years old -- and who wonder whether not that she has the executive experience, but whether she could be commander in chief?THOMPSON: Well, John's age, if you ever tried to keep up, I'm sure you have...BORGER: I have.THOMPSON: ... tried to keep up with John McCain. Everybody ought to try to keep up with John McCain. You know, I used to go on these codels with him, and...BLITZER: Those are congressional delegates, for the outside-the- Beltway crowd.(LAUGHTER) THOMPSON: Yes. And you know, he's kind of a two countries a day guy. And I think his 96-year-old mother will be here at the convention, so I'm not worried about John McCain.But, again, are we comparing the qualifications and experience of our vice presidential nominee with the Democrats' presidential nominee. I mean, does eloquence make up for his lack of experience? I don't think so.BLITZER: I think we understand what you're trying to say, Senator. Thanks very much for coming in.THOMPSON: Thanks a lot.BLITZER: All right, we're going to take another quick break, but we're following Hurricane Gustav right now. It's moving through the Gulf of Mexico, and guess what? It's heading towards New Orleans. We'll have a complete update.We'll also get a very different perspective from what we just heard from Senator Thompson. Senator Chris Dodd, the Democratic senator from Connecticut, he's standing by live. Our continuing coverage will resume right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: And welcome back to the floor of the Republican National Convention here at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul, Minnesota. We're waiting for word on whether or not there will be a convention. It's supposed to go on for four days beginning tomorrow but already we've heard that both President Bush and Vice President Cheney will not, repeat, not be attending because of Hurricane Gustav, a monster storm moving through the Gulf of Mexico right now with New Orleans right in the bull's eye, and that's having enormous ramifications on what's going on here but much more important on the lives of so many people along the Gulf Coast of the United States.Let's bring in Senator Chris Dodd. He's joining us now live from Washington. Senator Dodd is a Democratic senator, former Democratic presidential candidate.Thanks very much for coming in. What do you think the Republicans -- just as an outsider, you're a Democrat, what would be appropriate for them to do right now?SEN. CHRISTOPHER J. DODD, D-CONN.: Well, listen, Wolf, there's no doubt in my mind what's going on here. Had this -- the Bush administration not let this city drown basically three years ago, we wouldn't even be talking about this.It's a major storm coming through obviously and a lot of concern about it, but it was the failure of the Bush administration's actions three years ago that are creating all of this conversation, including the discussion about canceling or modifying the convention.So clearly that's what's going on here and it's a reminder at a time when, again, we're talking about leadership in the country, talking about a new direction for our nation, change in the country, that the Republican ticket here is one that really causes a lot of concern for people because this candidate has said over and over again he wants to have four more years like the eight years of the Bush administration.And candidly, that's one of the marks of that administration, of course, was the total failure to respond to a major American city in trouble.BLITZER: All right. I'm going to get to the political story in a moment, but based on everything you know, is the federal government right now, FEMA, the Department of Homeland Security, are they ready to deal with state and local authorities in Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, wherever this hurricane hits? Have they learned the lessons of Katrina?DODD: Well, I can only hope so, Wolf. But again, there has been a lot of stories since then. Now we've got new leadership at FEMA, and my only prayer and hope would be that they are doing exactly what they should have been doing three years ago.And so that's my concern at this particular moment. Glad to see there's a lot of concern about this in action, but I'll repeat what I said to you a moment ago. Don't have any illusions about this. Had they not failed miserably three years ago in dealing with Katrina, we wouldn't be having this conversation today.BLITZER: John King is here, and Gloria Borger, they're here. They're joining me in the questioning -- John.KING: Senator, I want to jump in on that point, you honestly believe that John McCain, a man you know well -- I know you disagree with him, that he would have a four-day political party, a balloon drop, a ""so what, I don't care"" convention had Katrina not happened, even with Gustav bearing down on the coast of the United States and another tropical storm, Hanna, potentially following behind it?He would do it anyway and just have a party, you honestly believe that?DODD: Well, I think this clearly, and John was critical of the Bush administration, but there's a concern about whether or not this administration, the Bush administration, one whose policies he has endorsed, will handle this appropriately.If there was a lot of confidence that those in authority today would respond to this as they should have, then frankly I think the convention would go on. There would be concerns about it, they would be talking about it, John, but they wouldn't be talking about canceling a convention.BORGER: Well, Senator Dodd, if this were your convention, what would you do?DODD: Well, again, I think you'd have appropriate people down there...BLITZER: All right. Hold on. Senator Dodd, hold on a second. The mayor of New Orleans, Ray Nagin, is just starting to speak. I want to listen in to hear what he's saying. Listen to this.MAYOR RAY NAGIN (D) NEW ORLEANS: All right. We ready? Everybody good?Good morning, everyone. We're here for the latest update from the city of New Orleans as it relates to the latest threat of Hurricane Gustav. I want to start by talking to you about the city- assisted emergency plan that we've been implementing for the past couple of days. We're now up to about 14,000 or 15,000 people that we have moved through the system and gotten out of town. Interesting enough, last night from midnight to 5:00 a.m., we worked all night, we moved 392 people and 36 people who were wheelchair- bound.I would like to publicly thank RTA, the employees from RTA who have been doing an incredible job of staying on the job and moving our citizens out of harm's way.As you know, we are planning to stop pickups at the 17 or the 15 pickup sites at noon today. That's our official stop time. But let me assure the public that we will continue with limited bus service. It won't be as frequent, as many as before, and we're going to try and continue that service until about 2:00 or 3:00 this afternoon.Let me repeat. The official stop time is noon today for city- assisted plan, but we're going to continue to service until 2:00 or 3:00 this afternoon to try and accommodate any late people who are coming.And I want to once again thank RTA for their incredible work. Let me get to the storm. The storm, as most of you know, is still headed our way. Nothing has changed as far as we can tell from the direction of the storm.It's a Cat. 3 right now, Category 3, but everyone that we have talked to in the latest update still say that this storm is going to be extremely powerful as a Category 4 storm, with winds of 150 miles an hour, sometimes gusting much higher than that.There is a little bit of good news in that the storm is moving at a much faster pace, and a fast-moving storm is a little bit better for us, not much better, but a little bit better. It's moving at 16 miles per hour, and it's still scheduled to slightly stall off the coast of Louisiana, which is not necessarily the best of news for us.One other threat tonight, since we're on the wrong side, if you will, of the storm, we should start to see tornado threats starting tonight and in the morning, which is something that we're going to have to really watch and pay attention to.So this is still a big ugly storm. It's still strong. And I strongly urge everyone to leave. On the contraflow, the contraflow is in effect. It started at 4:00 a.m. this morning. It's slow, but it's moving smoothly, going east is much slower.And we must let our citizens know that if you're going out I-10 east towards Mississippi, you will have to get off of I-10 and use 59 north when you get past Mississippi. I-10 east going towards Mississippi, once you get to a certain point, you will have to change to 59 north. So I'm going to make sure that everyone understands that.As it relates to mandatory evacuation, our mandatory evacuation went into effect this morning at 8:00 a.m. for the west bank, which is the area that the storm is still pointing towards to have the most impact, so we wanted to give our citizens time on the west bank to get out of town.We would then move to a noon mandatory evacuation on the east bank, 8:00 a.m. for the west bank and noon for the east bank.Everyone who evacuates, we will try and get you back in the city as soon as it's safe to come back. Whether you went out on a bus, a train, or a plane, whether you drove yourself out, we're going to try and get you back.I am asking the city council -- I am strongly asking the city council to go with my key staff members -- and I'm only going to keep a very small skeleton crew here, because of the severity of this storm, to set up what we're calling continuity of government.We don't know what's going to happen here in New Orleans, so I'm asking the city council to go with certain key staff members to set up a governmental station in Baton Rouge, so we can pass ordinances and government continue -- can continue to function.The next big announcement for today is that I want to announce that we have already filed with the clerk of court that we will be implementing this afternoon a curfew, a dusk-to-dawn curfew that will take into effect this afternoon starting at sunset. And we will continue that until the storm threat is open. We will start a curfew to this afternoon, once the sun sets.On one other point I'd like to make before I turn it over to the council president, I have two more points. On the trailers, I want to thank all of our citizens who have heeded our warning to get out of those trailers.We have done some sweeps around the city. And we can find -- and we find, fortunately, that most people have moved out of those trailers.But I want to talk to any citizen that is thinking of staying in the city, and they may have a home that is next to or near a trailer. Those trailers are on cinder blocks and, you know, what have you. They are only wind-rated to 35, 40 miles an hour.When this storm hits, those trailers will move around quite a bit. As a matter of fact, most some of them will become projectiles and will start to fly around the city. So be very careful if you decide to stay in the city and you're near a travel trailer, because they will be moving around in the city.Let me reiterate: Our call is for you to evacuate now. It's a mandatory evacuation for the west bank that started at 8 a.m. And for the east bank, we will be implementing a curfew at dusk this afternoon. The tropical storm is -- I mean, the hurricane is still severe and growing stronger, and it's scheduled to hit us as a Category 4 storm. Tropical storm-force winds could arrive in New Orleans as early as daybreak on Monday.And then, finally, I just talked to the sheriff and to the police chief. I just want to send a strong message out to anybody who's thinking about lingering around and becoming a looter. Looting will not be tolerated.We have doubled the police force, doubled the National Guard force that we had for Katrina, and looters will go directly to jail. You will not get out -- you will not get a pass this time.As a matter of fact, anybody who is caught looting in the city of New Orleans will go directly to Angola, directly to Angola. You will not have a temporary stay in the city. You'll go directly to the big house in general population, all right?So I want to make sure that every looter, potential looter, understands that. You will go directly to Angola prison. And God bless you when you go there.I'm going to turn it over to Council President Jackie Clarkson.JACKIE CLARKSON, NEW ORLEANS CITY COUNCIL PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And thank you...BLITZER: All right, so there it is, strong words from the mayor. If you are caught looting in New Orleans, you're going to go to that prison at Angola. He also announced there will be a dusk-to-dawn curfew, mandatory evacuations. Thousands of people are fleeing the Gulf Coast right now.Hurricane Gustav, right now it's a Category 3 storm, but it could intensify to a Category 4, maybe even a Category 5 storm. And it's potentially devastating, especially now as it takes direct aim on New Orleans, on this, the third anniversary of Hurricane Katrina.We were talking with Senator Chris Dodd, the Democratic senator from Connecticut, the former Democratic presidential candidate.You hear those words, Senator Dodd, from the mayor of New Orleans, whose community was so devastated only three years ago, it's hard to believe that this community could be further devastated now on the third anniversary of Katrina. Just give us your thoughts on the chances of this happening.DODD: Well, Wolf, if you'd written this up in a novel, no publisher would have taken it. This is too -- it's too bizarre to even suggest somehow that this could happen.And I, having traveled down there shortly after Katrina, and traveled that coast, from New Orleans all the way down to Mobile, it was unbelievable. Mississippi, I mean, all of that area, it's hard to imagine. I know people talked about it, and certainly CNN reported widely what had happened, but even the images of it are hard to portray the actual reality of it.So clearly the mayor -- and I commend him for it, the steps he's taking, the announcements he's making, certainly much better preparation now than was the case three years ago. And we applaud them for that.But the point, again, that we have to come back to here, you're sitting at a convention. Clearly, they're going to have to make decisions about whether or not to go forward.But, again, the point I want to make to you here, since we are talking about a political campaign with about 65 days to go, is the Republican nominee is one that has endorsed George Bush's overall policies.Now, he was critical of the handling of Katrina, as virtually everyone was at the time. But it seems to me it's important to remember Katrina symbolizes the failure of the Bush administration to respond to a major crisis in our country. And that's a point here that should not be forgotten at this hour.BLITZER: Hold on one second, Senator. We only have time for one more question, and I want you to respond to what Senator Fred Thompson, the former U.S. senator from Tennessee, said, himself a former Republican presidential candidate, that the vice presidential running mate for John McCain, the Alaska governor, Governor Sarah Palin, has more executive experience than the top of the Democratic ticket, Senator Barack Obama.DODD: Well, it's a ridiculous -- of course, Fred is my good friend, and he does a great job on ""Law and Order,"" and he's a great prosecutor. But I think of Elizabeth Dole, I think of Jodi Rell, the governor of Connecticut, I think of Kay Bailey Hutchison, I think of Susan Collins, Olympia Snowe.I can recite off the top of my head a number of Republican candidates, women who were far more qualified, with all due respect to Sarah Palin.So, again, John has made a choice here, but the suggestion somehow this is a wise choice -- this is the choice of Dobson, Robertson, and Limbaugh. This is a -- this is a real sop to the extreme conservative elements of the Republican Party.John McCain's knees buckled, because he was fearful of what the extreme right was going to say about this ticket. That's what this comes down to.BLITZER: Senator Dodd, thanks very much for joining us.DODD: Thank you very much, Wolf.BLITZER: All right, Senator Chris Dodd from Connecticut. We're standing by for another update on Hurricane Gustav. It's heading directly towards New Orleans and the Gulf Coast. We'll update you on that. Much more of our coverage from the Republican National Convention, which right now is really up in the air because of Gustav, we'll continue right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Welcome back. We're here on the floor of the Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minnesota. This is a special ""Late Edition.""This convention was supposed to start tomorrow, but it could be in free fall right now, given what's happening along the Gulf Coast. They're preparing for landfall around midday tomorrow early afternoon, and New Orleans right now in the bull's eye.John King and Gloria Borger are here with me.John, we heard two very different assessments from Senator Chris Dodd, the Democrat, former Senator Fred Thompson, the Republican. You know, as much as people would like to say politics is going to go away because of a natural disaster like this, politics very much going to be -- especially in this political season, going to be with us.KING: And Senator Dodd seeing an opportunity there to make the Democratic case that the Republicans are canceling, changing, modifying their convention because of the hangover from Katrina, if you will.And there's no doubt about it that Americans remember Katrina, and they remember and they have blamed the Bush administration, state and local officials, as well, but the president runs the country, and the president took a lot of blame for that. And there's no question that fallout continues.However, I do think it is fair to say that John McCain would have modified somewhat had Katrina never happened in the first place, just because they do understand, all the people around him, that you can't be having a party and a balloon drop if a major American city, New Orleans or somewhere else, is underwater.BLITZER: I think that's a fair assessment.What do you think?BORGER: Sure. And I think, in many ways, the Republicans can look at this as an opportunity, if they want to be crassly political about it, to show that the theme of this convention, which John was talking about earlier, which is service, can actually be worked on publicly.If you want to hold a telethon, if you want to donate to Red Cross, if you want to send people from the convention to the Gulf Coast, I mean, there are -- there are all kinds of things the Republicans can do at this convention to show that John McCain and Sarah Palin care and would manage a hurricane very differently from the way George W. Bush managed Katrina.KING: And that will happen. There will be -- there will be a component of service. We still don't know about the schedule. I'm told there will be dramatic changes announced probably in an hour or so, but we do know the convention planners have already been in touch with the Red Cross. They're going to definitely raise money and have other service components using the delegates who are here to get them involved in the effort.John McCain is down there today. Some of the other stuff is still in a flux, because it's a very difficult decision. But we do -- one thing they -- by rules, they have to nominate a candidate. They will do that. Everything else I'm told is in flux, because they're trying to get the latest on the storm.BLITZER: And we do know that the president of the United States and the vice president of the United States, both of them have decided they're not coming here tomorrow. They were both supposed to address this convention tomorrow, but George Bush and Dick Cheney have decided they're not coming here.We'll take another quick break. Much more of our coverage on this special ""Late Edition"" right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) BLITZER: We're here at Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul, Minnesota. This is where the Republicans were supposed -- they're scheduled to hold a convention for four days beginning tomorrow. But as we've been reporting, everything up in the air right now.Only within the last half hour or so ago, we learned that both President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney will not be attending this convention. They were supposed to be here tomorrow.Let's assess what's going on, as Hurricane Gustav moves towards New Orleans and the Gulf Coast.Joining us now is Tara Wall, the editorial page editor of the Washington Times, and Roland Martin. Both are CNN contributors.Tara, what should the Republicans do as far as this convention is concerned?TARA WALL, WASHINGTON TIMES: Well, I trust they'll do the right thing. They'll use their judgment to make the calls that are necessary and that are needed.I will -- I would anticipate probably a more truncated schedule, if you will. I think that already you've seen these schedules pared back quite a bit.So I would expect to see quite a bit and that the Republicans and John McCain will make the right decision in deciding how to go forward.BLITZER: I assume you agree, right, Roland?ROLAND MARTIN, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: No, I would say that they nominate John McCain tomorrow and shut the convention down. And if this hurricane hits on Tuesday and it brings the level of devastation that we're likely to see, there's not going to be any media coverage of this convention.And so any kind of advantage you want to get out of it, frankly, you're not going to get. And so it doesn't make any sense to pare anything down. You nominate John McCain, and you shut it down, because there will be nothing to talk about, frankly, come Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.BLITZER: Because the hurricane, Roland, is supposed to hit early afternoon tomorrow. Monday, at least right now, it's projected to hit around New Orleans, maybe between noon or 1 o'clock local time, Central time.So what you're saying is, is even though the -- even though it hits, go ahead, do the formal business of nominating a presidential candidate and a vice presidential candidate, and then get out of Dodge.Is that a good -- a good piece of advice, Tara? WALL: Well, I think, again, you're already seeing some of that. I mean, of course, President Bush is not coming. Vice President Cheney is not coming. You see, of course, the three governors aren't coming. All these people played a major role in this convention. They won't be there.So, again, it probably, yes, will likely be a more truncated convention. Whether that's one days, two days, I think, again, that's the -- they'll figure out what the responsible thing is to do to make sure they're dealing with the issue at hand, as well as dealing with the business of their party and the nominee.So I expect perhaps that could be a one- to two-day convention. But, again, I mean, it's not my call, so...BLITZER: Right. It's not any of our call. We're all waiting and hopefully in the next hour or two we'll get the word from these organizers of the Republican convention what they plan on doing.Let me ask both of you, because I haven't spoken to you since John McCain announced that the Alaska governor, Sarah Palin, would be his running mate.Tara, first to you. Good choice, bad choice, what do you think?WALL: I've got to tell you, it was a proud day for me as a black woman and American last week, with the first black nominee of any major party and the first woman of the Republican Party as a major nominee, second in history, so I'm proud all around on that end.And I think, quite frankly, I was skeptical from the beginning when I heard about her name a few months ago. When you read the woman's record, experience or not, the experience that she does have is pretty impressive.And I've heard from conservatives all weekend they are re- energized and fired up about this candidate. Say what you will, the conservative base is fired up about her.MARTIN: Hey, Wolf...BLITZER: Roland, Roland -- hold on, Roland -- a proud day for you, too?MARTIN: Not necessarily, because -- I mean, first of all, what I find to be interesting is, I mean, as a native Texan, you know, I hate the fact that Kay Bailey Hutchison didn't get the job, because she's far more qualified than the Alaska governor.But, also, as an Evangelical -- and John King knows it, because he's (inaudible) election -- I mean, Mike Huckabee was the best choice. Here's a guy who was the governor of Arkansas for 11 years, an ordained minister, who won the Iowa caucus. Right now, McCain is behind in Iowa.MARTIN: If you want to galvanize grassroots evangelicals... WALL: But he -- no, he had issues...(CROSSTALK)MARTIN: Tara, Tara, one second.WALL: He had issues with fiscal conservatives.MARTIN: Tara, one second. If you want to galvanize grassroots evangelicals, you go after the guy who won the Iowa Caucus where you're down right now. So, I'm sorry, I think he's a much better pick than she is.WALL: Well, she covers all of those. She is evangelical, she is a Christian, she is a reformer, she is very conservative, she has bucked her own...MARTIN: She's unproven.WALL: She has bucked her own party. She is absolutely not unproven, when you go and you look at her record and what she has fought up against and what she has fought for. The short time in office that she has had, she has fought against -- she has fought against the government, she has fought against her own party, she has cut her own salary. The woman has...MARTIN: Who delivered the evangelicals in the primary?WALL: And she...MARTIN: Who delivered them? Huckabee did.WALL: And she is staunchly pro-life. Not to take away anything from Mike Huckabee...MARTIN: So was Huckabee!WALL: ...but some of the problems Huckabee had was with fiscal conservatives. And those are some of the problems that he posed. Look, there are a number of...BLITZER: All right. Guys...WALL: ...great candidates, but I think when you're looking at someone outside of Washington, the folks that talk about the change, this is the real kind of...MARTIN: Huckabee is from Arkansas.WALL: ... outside of Washington change that folks are talking about.MARTIN: Huckabee is from Arkansas.BLITZER: All right. Roland, hold your fire. Hold your fire, Roland, because I know you're anxious to respond, but we're going to have plenty of time to talk about Sarah Palin and John McCain and Barack Obama and Joe Biden.Stand by. Much more of our coverage coming up here. We're at the Republican National Convention, but Hurricane Gustav continues to move towards New Orleans in the Gulf Coast. We'll update you on what we know right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: You just heard live here on CNN, the mayor of New Orleans, Ray Nagin, announce that there's a dawn-to-dusk curfew in New Orleans starting tonight and that looters will immediately go to a prison. No holding places or anything like that. They go to jail right away. They're having enormous, enormous preparations under way along the Gulf Coast. We're watching this.But I want to go down to the floor of this convention, which may or may not take place starting tomorrow. Ed Henry is on the floor for us right now.What are you hearing, Ed, from where you are? Because it seems everything is up in the air.ED HENRY, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. And everyone you talk to who is just filtering in to St. Paul, all of these Republicans who have been planning this for almost two years now are wondering, they're asking us what's going on.The latest is, everyone is behind the scenes basically on conference calls, talking to one another. As you mentioned earlier, as John King did, Rick Davis, the campaign chairman, is trying to reach out to Republicans, figure out the best way to handle this. This is an unprecedented situation.But Republicans realize that in the middle of this, what could be a catastrophic storm, they can't possibly show the American people images of them partying, having a good time, launching political attacks.So they want to find the right balance at this point. So what obviously seems likely is somehow shrinking it, somehow getting all of the business into a smaller amount of time without canceling the whole thing together.But obviously everything is on the table right now, but as John has been saying, you have to at the very least nominate John McCain as well as Sarah Palin. And let's face it, in fairness to John McCain, he has to get some time in the spotlight at some point this week.Barack Obama just had his hour in prime time. The Democrats had a full week to make their case to the American people. So the Republicans are just trying to find a balancing act -- Wolf.BLITZER: All right. Jessica Yellin is on the floor as well.Jessica, thousands of Republicans are coming in, delegates, supporters, family members, friends. They're coming in. There's one thought of maybe turning this into some public service, a fund-raiser for the people who are going to -- about to be devastated along the Gulf Coast.You've been speaking with delegate delegates, what are you hearing?JESSICA YELLIN, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, they know that the theme of the convention is ""service first."" And it seems to them a fitting way to take care of both honoring what this convention is about and also acknowledging what's going on in the Gulf Coast.I think delegates here who are just beginning to arrive are perfectly amenable to that option and there is some anxiety that they wouldn't want to be seen partying, in essence, while this is going on in the Gulf.So the idea is to whip out cell phones, to make care packages, whatever it takes to acknowledge the Gulf Coast.BLITZER: Jessica, stand by. Ed Henry, stand by. We're going to continue our coverage, give you an update on Hurricane Gustav and a lot more coming up right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: These are aerial photos just coming in to CNN right now from New Orleans. If you get closer -- and we're going to show our viewers some closer shots -- it looks almost eerie what's going on in New Orleans, as thousands, tens of thousands of people have been forced to evacuate.We've seen long lines of cars heading north, getting out of the city. There's a mandatory evacuation. The mayor of New Orleans, Ray Nagin, just announcing a dusk-to-dawn curfew starting tonight.And anyone caught looting, anyone, he says, caught looting, there will be no pity at all. They go right to Angola. That's an -- that's an awful prison in Louisiana. And he says they'll be sent right into the general prison population. Trust me. You don't want to be there, so don't start looting in New Orleans.These are long gas lines you're seeing from these aerial photos. As vehicles try to get out of the city, they need gas. And there are long lines, as well.You can see what's going on, people getting out of town as quickly as they possibly can. They're taking no chances on this, the third anniversary of Hurricane Katrina.We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer.We're reporting here from the Republican National Convention. We're on the floor of this convention, which was supposed to start tomorrow and continue for four days, but it doesn't look like that's going to happen. Everything right now is up in the air. The White House has just announced that both President Bush and Vice President Cheney will not be coming to St. Paul, Minnesota, tomorrow. They were both scheduled to address this convention tomorrow, but both will remain either in Washington or head over to the Gulf Coast to be in charge of this hurricane disaster.Let's get an update from Reynolds Wolf. He's at the CNN Weather Center.Reynolds, only a little while ago, the National Hurricane Center gave us an update. Tell our viewers who may be just be joining us in the United States and around the world what we know about Gustav. WOLF: OK, Wolf. Here's the latest.The latest we have for you, the storm currently is winds sustained -- maximum sustained winds of 120 miles per hour. It's got some gusts, though, that have been much stronger, going to 150, moving to the northwest at 17 miles an hour.That is the biggest change we've seen so far in the forecast, is the forward progress, moving to the northwest, I mentioned, going from 16 to 17 miles an hour. That could make a tremendous difference when this storm makes landfall.Right now, the center is about 414 miles away from New Orleans. Here's the center; here's New Orleans. The latest path we have from the National Hurricane Center shows the storm still moving on that track, going to the northwest.As it moves to the northwest, it is expected, at least in the forecast from the National Hurricane Center, to strengthen quite a bit, going from a Category 3 storm to a Category 4, with maximum sustained winds around 135 miles an hour early into Monday, and then making landfall just to the southwest of New Orleans, possibly within 70 miles of the city, then moving in to parts of central Louisiana, and then back into Texas and Louisiana.Now, one thing to mention with this, Wolf, is that you have this -- this cone of probability, of uncertainty, if you will. The storm could still move a little bit more to the east, perhaps push back to the west. Many changes can take place in the storm, and we have to watch it very carefully.Something else we'd like to share with you and the viewers, some numbers that we've got from FEMA. You'll notice these are numbers that we have from a program from FEMA called HAZUS that gives us an estimation of what is in the path of the storm and what might be affected.Roughly 5.6 million people in the path of this storm. Roughly 2 million buildings could see an estimated damage in excess of $26.7 billion. Also in the path, 217 hospitals, 722 police stations.Now, to give you an idea, a meteorological sense of what this storm can bring, remember, if it is a Category 4 storm, or at least a strong 3, we could have a storm surge that could be in excess of anywhere from, say, 13 to 18 feet, that on top of the high tides you might have on the southern coast of Louisiana. And, of course, that water could really pile up in places like Lake Pontchartrain.Small residences, mobile homes could be completely destroyed in a storm like this, large trees blown down, knocking down power lines, widespread power outages certainly a possibility. Terrain lower than 10 feet above sea level may flood, requiring massive evacuations.And you'll remember that much of Louisiana is built below sea level. It's kind of in a bowl, if you will. So with a storm of this magnitude, I would say flooding is definitely going to be a certainty, not just in places like New Orleans, Wolf, but when this storm begins to stall out, especially in parts of northern Louisiana and into Texas, we're going to be talking about widespread flooding, massive flooding well into next week, possibly into Wednesday, Thursday, maybe even next weekend.Back to you.BLITZER: And, Reynolds, when you say the -- the landfall could be about 70 miles southwest of New Orleans, the point has to be made -- and I want you to underscore it -- that, if you're on the east side of that landfall, that's potentially the most dangerous part.We heard the mayor of New Orleans, Ray Nagin, said they're on the bad side of this hurricane. Explain what he means.WOLF: What he means by that is that, on the right-hand side of the storm, you happen to have the biggest weight of, say, the power of the storm. The storm, Wolf, is spinning in a counterclockwise motion.Imagine, viewers at home, you're looking at my back. If I'm a heavyweight boxer, and I'm a right-handed guy, and I've got a really strong right hook, well, my hook is going to be strongest going in this direction.So you have that counterclockwise flow, the sheer weight of the water, the wind, the rain, all going around the center of circulation. Places like Pensacola, Mobile, New Orleans, especially New Orleans would tax the sheer brunt of this storm.Now, if you'll remember, in Katrina, Katrina was actually a Category 3 when it made landfall and it was just to the east of New Orleans. It actually made landfall in parts of Mississippi.So New Orleans actually got -- was affected by the weakest part of the storm. This scenario, should it follow out by the National Hurricane Center, it will be the opposite, the storm really affecting -- the strongest part of the storm affecting New Orleans. And that is what Mayor Nagin was referring to.BLITZER: Because he's really worried that, as bad as Katrina was, this one could be even worse. Fortunately, it looks like everyone has learned a lot of lessons from Katrina and they've got their act together. We can only hope that the federal, state, and local authorities are really doing what they need to be doing to save lives right now.All right, stand by. We're going to come back to Reynolds, because he's constantly getting updates.I want to go to New Orleans right now. Susie Roesgen is there for us.Set the scene. When we heard the mayor earlier -- and we're hoping to get him on the phone so we can ask him a few questions, Susie -- this is something that New Orleans has dreaded since Katrina. You know, who would have thought that, almost exactly three years later, it was about to happen again?But tell us what's going on. You're there.ROESGEN: Well, I've got to tell you, Wolf, I was here also in Hurricane Katrina. And in that time period, we would have been watching Reynolds' track go back and forth and back and forth. People were waiting, because we really felt that the storm was going to go to the east or the west of us, far enough that we wouldn't feel it.This time, people here in New Orleans are getting out. They know what a catastrophic event Katrina was. They know that the levees failed. They don't know that they'll be safe again here. This is even a more powerful storm, so most people have gotten out.But there are the hospitals, and there are a few hospitals, including, Wolf, the one that I'm here this morning, Children's Hospital, where they've decided to keep these hospitals open. At Children's right now, there are 80 young patients, more than half of whom are in critical care units.And that means that it would be very difficult to evacuate those patients. It would be hard for them. So doctors and nurses have volunteered to stay here. They're going to stay and watch the young patients.The hospital has trucked in 70,000 gallons of diesel fuel to keep the generators going. They think, Wolf, that they can withstand this and ride it out here for three weeks. And we're going to be here and see how they're doing.If they have to, they will get the patients out by helicopter, but they're not planning to do it. They're planning to stay.Just about everybody else in the city, Wolf, has gotten out, either by charter buses, or by the Amtrak trains, or in their own cars. They didn't even wait for the mayor to say, ""Get out. This is the mother of all storms,"" as Mayor Nagin put it. They knew it. They got out already.Wolf?BLITZER: So based on your experience three years ago -- you were there during Hurricane Katrina, Susie -- and based on what you're seeing right now, I think it's fair to say that it looks like a lot of people have learned lessons and they're really paying attention, they're doing a better job right now than three years ago. Is that your assessment?ROESGEN: Oh, absolutely. The mayor said it in his speech, but he didn't need to remind us here in New Orleans. He said, if you stay, you might be using an ax to hack your way out of the roof.This is what thousands of people did here. They were flooded. The water forced them up, up, up. They were chopping their ways out of a roof -- out of their roofs to get out in the big flood.So people here got the message. Some of them -- I've got to tell you, though, Wolf, and this is something we need to think about as we go forward after the hurricane -- and that's how many New Orleanians will come back.I have talked to so many of my friends here who say, you know what, even if it doesn't hit, Wolf, even if it doesn't come here and devastate the city, as it might, they're not coming back. They say they've had it.They've rebuilt their homes. They stuck it out. They waited for the federal money. Some of them didn't even get it. They're here now. And they say, ""You know what? We can't go through this anymore. We're done.""So it will be very interesting to see what happens to this city, wherever the hurricane might go.BLITZER: And I want you to be very, very careful, Susie Roesgen. All of our reporters and producers and camera crews, they're staying in New Orleans and in the area to make sure we get all the accurate information. Anderson Cooper is there for us, as well.We're going to have much more coverage of what's going on with Hurricane Gustav as it moves towards New Orleans and the Gulf Coast. We're also going to have much more coverage on how it will impact what was supposed to be a Republican National Convention in St. Paul.The Republican leader in Congress, John Boehner, he's here with us. The former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle with weigh in. Much more of our coverage right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: By the tens of thousands, they're fleeing New Orleans right now. The mayor has just declared a dusk-to-dawn curfew tonight. And he says anyone violating that curfew -- and especially anyone found looting -- immediately goes to jail.We're here at the Republican National Convention, where the schedule is very much tentative because of Hurricane Gustav, which is moving towards New Orleans and the Gulf Coast.John King has been doing some reporting on what we know. What we do know is that the president and the vice president, they've decided they're not coming to St. Paul.KING: The president and the vice president are not coming. Laura Bush, the first lady, is still scheduled to be here for Monday night's opening session.I'm told that they have made some tentative decisions, Wolf, and there will be some very complicated changes to the convention program. That's all they're willing to say right now, because while Rick Davis, the chairman of the McCain campaign, is here, he met with convention planners today, and they went through all of the contingencies, including getting an update on the path of Gustav.John McCain is on his way to Mississippi at this hour to go down and get a look at the preparations for the storm from the Gulf Coast area. And they want to talk to him before he will make the final decisions about the implementation.But they have reached some tentative decisions about what I'm told are very complicated changes to the convention program. We don't know exactly what they are.We do know that the convention planners have been in touch with the Red Cross and other service organizations to try to do some things here. The delegates will be here to try to see how they can take advantage of this mass of people, if you will, and get them involved in some sort of service, fundraising and otherwise, to help those who are about to be affected by this storm.BLITZER: So translate this disaster maybe into something good coming out of here, because it would be, I guess, unseemly to be partying and having hoopla while an American city and the Gulf Coast could be destroyed again, three years after Katrina.KING: No doubt the tone of the convention will change significantly.BLITZER: Obviously that has to happen.All right, the Republican leader, the minority leader in the House of Representatives, is here, John Boehner. Nancy Pfotenhauer is here, a senior adviser to the McCain campaign. Gloria Borger is joining us in the questioning.What do you think, Mr. Leader? What should these convention organizers, your fellow Republicans, do right now?REP. JOHN A. BOEHNER, R-OHIO: Well, I think everyone is concerned about the people who live along the Gulf Coast. This is going to be a serious natural disaster, and I think people ought to be sensitive to this, and John McCain, especially.John McCain's someone who's always put the country first. And, clearly, when you look at this potential disaster, putting the country first is the right thing to do.BLITZER: So what should they do? In terms of -- you have a four-day convention that's supposed to happen. Do you truncate it into two days, one day, two hours? What do you do?BOEHNER: There will be an announcement in several hours about how the convention will proceed and when it will proceed. Those decisions, I think, are close to being finalized (OFF-MIKE) there'll be an announcement soon. And everyone will know just how we're going to proceed with the convention.BLITZER: Nancy, what do you think? Because, you know, you work for John McCain. He's your boss. This is a sensitive -- very sensitive issue you've got to deal with right now, because thousands of people's lives are on the line.NANCY PFOTENHAUER, MCCAIN CAMPAIGN ADVISER: Absolutely. And that's why he's already been in touch with, obviously, Governor Barbour, but also Governors Crist, Governors Riley, Governor Jindal, just to try to get a feel for their anticipation of what will occur. And that's going to inform his decisions.But, you know, action -- I've always said actions speak louder than words. And he's on the plane out there right now to assess the situation on the ground. And he's going to take advice from the people who are experts and who are out there. And that's going to directly impact how we spend our time over the next several days.BORGER: All right, Congressman Boehner, I want to ask you to put on your congressional hat for a moment, because you folks in Congress spent an awful lot of time and money investigating why the levees failed and how to fix the levees. You spent about, what, $15 billion?BOEHNER: Fifteen to twenty billion dollars.BORGER: So what's your sense about whether the levees are going to be able to withstand whatever's coming at them?BOEHNER: Well, you have to understand that, while the money was appropriated, only about 20 percent of the work upgrading the levees has been accomplished. This is a long process that's going to take another three, or four, or five years to raise the height of these levees.And these are unusual levees. These wouldn't be like levees you'd see here in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Because they have to be so much higher, the width of the levees is so much wider. And so it's a massive job.But over the next three or four years, you'll see all of those levees up. But the levees today are in better shape than they were when Katrina hit.BORGER: Right, but it's still only one-fifth completed, you said, right?BOEHNER: That's correct. In terms of the new designs, the new heights.KING: If you listen to Democrats today, many of them are making the case that your tone will change more dramatically here because of the hangover, the legacy, the political damage on the Bush administration from Katrina. A fair assessment?BOEHNER: I think everyone learned a lot from Katrina. Clearly, the federal government wasn't ready. A lot of the state governments weren't ready. And, frankly, I don't think the people in America were ready for such a horrific natural disaster.And so I think what we see now is that we're all more sensitive. We're all more prepared for -- for what could occur. And, clearly, if you look at the precautions that are being taken today in New Orleans, they're light years ahead of what happened prior to Katrina.BLITZER: Nancy, we heard from Senator Chris Dodd just a little while ago really saying that this decision by John McCain, your boss, to ask the Alaska governor, Sarah Palin, to be his running mate was -- you know, I'm paraphrasing now -- really bad, because he's suggesting that there were so many other Republican women, Kay Bailey Hutchison, a senator from Texas. He had a whole bunch of names who were clearly more qualified, God forbid, to become commander-in-chief than Sarah Palin.Go ahead. Make the case why this woman, with no real national security or foreign policy experience, is ready on day one, as John McCain had said earlier, ready to become commander-in-chief.PFOTENHAUER: I think that Governor Palin has -- she's just had a remarkable journey. She has actually challenged the status quo. She's a reformer with a record of reform, and Senator McCain respects that.You know, it's one of those things where -- to get points on the board with John McCain, you have to prove that you're willing to do something when it's difficult and unpopular. And -- and if it's the right thing to do when it's difficult to do, then he has respect for you.She earned his respect. And she's earned it with the people of Alaska. She's the most popular governor in the country. She's already gotten through things like a pipeline that they tried to get through for 30 years, and she's gotten it through.BLITZER: But on a basis of one meeting he had with her earlier this year in February, she's a finalist to become his running mate?PFOTENHAUER: Wolf, she won it on the merits. He wasn't selecting who he was going to want as a drinking buddy or a pal. He was selecting someone who has the -- who has the proven reform record to come in and help him shake up this town.And, frankly, that's not somebody like a Joe Biden, who has spent more time in government than out.PFOTENHAUER: I mean, Senator -- our number two on the ticket is more qualified than Barack Obama is, the number one on the Democratic ticket. And Senator Biden, I mean, they threw over change right off the side of the bathtub, if you will, with Senator Biden, because he is, if not a creature of Washington, he has spent more time in government than out.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: But in fairness -- hold on, hold on. In fairness, Senator McCain has spent, what, 26 years in Washington, so you're implicitly criticizing your boss?PFOTENHAUER: No. What I'm -- but Senator McCain has during that period of time challenged his own party when they were wrong. He has taken on the status quo. He has worked across party lines to do things that were difficult. And we all know that, because this is our town.(CROSSTALK)BORGER: ... answers that commander-in-chief question, and maybe the congressman would want to take that.BOEHNER: I just find this conversation that has gone the last two days almost appalling. And it comes from liberal Democrats who want to criticize the selection of Governor Palin. And it's almost like, if you're not a Washington insider, you don't count. You can't possibly know what it's like.Listen, she has got more executive experience than Barack Obama and Joe Biden put together.BORGER: Or John McCain?BOEHNER: And when you look at the job, the job of being president or vice president, it's an administrative job. She actually has made decisions. When you're a senator, you get to decide yes or no. You get to go out and make some statements. But when you're the governor, you actually have to make decisions that have consequences.Now -- and for them to belittle this very accomplished woman, I think is -- they're doing so at their own peril. PFOTENHAUER: I agree. I think they've been dangerously dismissive of this woman's accomplishments and I think that's going to come back to bite them.BLITZER: All right. We're out of time for this discussion, but this discussion will continue. I have no doubt. Thanks, guys, very much for coming in. We'll get a different perspective, Tom Daschle, the former Senate majority leader, a longtime supporter of Barack Obama, he's standing by live and I'm sure he has a different assessment of what's going on.We'll also update you on Hurricane Gustav as it's moving towards New Orleans and the Gulf Coast. Much more of our coverage. We're here at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul, Minnesota, where there's supposed to be a Republican Convention starting tomorrow. We'll see if it will start tomorrow. Stay with us, LATE EDITION continues right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Welcome back. We're here in St. Paul, Minnesota, at the Republican National Convention, which is supposed to begin tomorrow and continue for four days, but that schedule now completely up in the air.The president of the United States, George Bush, the vice president, Dick Cheney, they're not coming tomorrow. They had been scheduled to address this convention tomorrow. All of this because Hurricane Gustav is moving towards New Orleans and the Gulf right now.It's supposed to make landfall early afternoon tomorrow, Monday, maybe around noon Central time, 1:00 p.m. Eastern, maybe a little bit later. It's a Category 3 monster right now, but it could go up to a Category 4, maybe even a Category 5. Winds of about maybe even 170 miles an hour.The enormity of this, on the third anniversary of Katrina, simply unbelievable as we're watching what's going on. Stand by, we'll have a complete update on the hurricane. But we're also watching the political fallout of the race for the White House. Joining us now is the former Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle. He was an early and very robust supporter of Barack Obama. He still is.Senator Daschle, thanks very much for coming in.TOM DASCHLE (D), FMR. SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: My pleasure, Wolf.BLITZER: John King and Gloria Borger are here. They're going to join me in the questioning. Just as an outside -- you're not a Republican, you have nothing to do with this convention, but what do you think the Republicans need to do right now, because potentially New Orleans and the entire Gulf Coast could be under water pretty soon?DASCHLE: Well, Wolf, I don't think there's any choice. But the whole country needs to focus on this incredible emergency. And our thoughts and prayers go out to everybody in the path of the hurricane, especially those in New Orleans.You know, we don't think about politics at this point as much as we think about survival. That story you had about the children, 60 children in a hospital who we know are going to have to ride through that storm in the next few days is just a phenomenal illustration of the consequences of what this is all about.So it's almost hard to talk or think about politics or the convention when you have that much life and that much at stake.BLITZER: We know there were horrible mistakes made three years ago in advance of Katrina and during and after Katrina by the federal government, state authorities, local government in New Orleans itself. Are you confident right now that they've learned the lessons and that they have their act together? DASCHLE: You know, I'm not confident. I sure hope they do. I hope that whatever lessons learned are applied. And you know, we're seeing indications, perhaps, that things are better and that the preparation is better and that both at the city level, the state level, and hopefully now at the federal level we're going to have our act together unlike anything we've seen before.But three years ago it was an absolute disaster. And I think the response was almost as bad as the disaster itself. And I'm just hopeful that we've pulled our act together adequately enough to deal with this in a far more successful manner.BLITZER: All right. I want you to respond to what we just heard from Congressman John Boehner, the minority leader in the House of Representatives, and Nancy Pfotenhauer, a senior adviser to Senator McCain's campaign, that Sarah Palin, the governor of Alaska, has more actual experience in...(AUDIO GAP)DASCHLE: Wolf, I...BLITZER: Can you hear me, Senator?DASCHLE: Oh, I lost -- now I can hear you. I just lost it for a minute.BLITZER: All right.BLITZER: Let me repeat the question.DASCHLE: OK.BLITZER: We heard from John Boehner, the minority leader in the House of Representatives just moments ago, and Nancy Pfotenhauer, a senior adviser to John McCain's campaign, that Sarah Palin, the governor of Alaska, McCain's running mate, has more experience actually in running government than Barack Obama. DASCHLE: Well, it's actually -- the choice is somewhat mystifying to me, Wolf. It's inexplicable. John McCain, for the last year, has basically said one thing. The next president of the United States is going to have to have the ability to focus the experience and all of the resources it's going to take to be a strong person in foreign policy and make the decisions necessary to get us through this very, very difficult challenges we face.So who does he pick? Somebody who has absolutely no experience in that regard. The only explanation to me is that he buckled, he knuckled under to the extreme right-wing pressures that he was feeling these last several weeks. That's the only real explanation I can think of.BORGER: Well, Senator, it's Gloria. Senator, what do you say to those women though who like the idea of having a woman on the national ticket? These folks here before were saying that some of the Democrats have moved dangerously close to being sexist in their criticism of Governor Palin.DASCHLE: This has nothing to sex, Gloria, at all, or sexual -- you know, just the fact is, you've got a lot of very strong women. Kay Bailey Hutchison's name has been mentioned several times. You know, she would have been a perfect choice.DASCHLE: There are a lot of other Republican women who could have easily filled this role, if that's what he was looking for.I think they have to be concerned about what message it may send about being too patronizing with regard to the transparency of this choice, as well.So it's not the woman issue at all. I think it's -- it's really a question of, how much is John McCain going to listen to the right wing as he makes these critical decisions? And at least so far, it's pretty clear: 100 percent of the time.KING: Senator, it's John King here. Let me talk to you about your region of the country. Barack Obama has tried to change the map, to try to put the Dakotas in play, Montana in play, Colorado, other states out in the West.What about Sarah Palin out there, a governor who comes from the state of Alaska, who is a hunter and a sportswoman, who has a lifetime membership in the NRA? Is it possible that she could be an asset out in the West?DASCHLE: Well, it's interesting that they're looking for assets, John, in that regard. I think what it says is that the Republicans recognize that they're in trouble in the West.We've seen the trend over the last couple of cycles with governors, senators, and congressmen -- we have more and more on the Democratic side. I think the West is more in play than it's ever been before.So in addition to the right-wing concerns that he might have had, I think the other issue is, do I need to shore up the West with a nominee from the West? And that may have been part of his calculation.BLITZER: Senator Daschle, thanks very much for joining us.DASCHLE: My pleasure, Wolf.BLITZER: And we're going to continue our coverage here on this special ""Late Edition."" We'll update you on Hurricane Gustav, as it's moving through the Gulf of Mexico, moving towards New Orleans and the Gulf Coast, and continue our political coverage from this Republican convention. Right now, everything here, everything is literally up in the air. We're hearing that some announcements are going to be made fairly soon. As soon as we know what the Republicans plan on doing, we'll share it with you. Stay with us. ""Late Edition"" continues right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: And joining us now, the Republican governor of South Carolina, Mark Sanford, and the Republican congressman from Virginia, Eric Cantor. By all accounts, he was on the short list to be a vice presidential running mate.Let me go to Governor Sanford first. South Carolina, as we know over the years has had to deal with its share of hurricanes. I know you're anxious to try to help if you can those folks in Louisiana, or Mississippi, or Texas that are about to be impacted by Hurricane Gustav.What do you think? Is the federal government ready right now to deal with state and local authorities? Have they learned the lessons of Katrina?GOV. MARK SANFORD, R-S.C.: I believe so. There was a real after-action review, both at the state level, the federal level, the local level in the wake of Katrina. And, you know, the federal government, if you want to call it that, is very much standing forward in this storm cycle. So, yes, I think that they're prepared.I would also say, at the state level, you have what are called EMAC agreements, wherein states help other states out and cities help other cities out.I just had a conversation this morning. The city of Charleston is already in the process of sending law enforcement folks to that part of the world, because, indeed, many hands make light work. And if that storm hits, as we suspect it will, there's going to be a lot of work to be done.BLITZER: And I'm sure if a hurricane were moving towards South Carolina, you'd be grateful for any help you could get from your fellow governors elsewhere who could dispatch whether law enforcement or emergency medical personnel, National Guard troops, or whatever.Eric Cantor, what do you think? I know you were planning on coming out here to St. Paul. What do you think these Republican organizers of this convention need to do now, given the enormity of what's about to happen in New Orleans and elsewhere in the gulf?REP. ERIC CANTOR, R-VA.: Well, Wolf, it is correct. I'm about to head out in a couple of hours. Obviously, we've been told that there's going to be an announcement coming soon as to how the convention will proceed.There's no question, though, that this will change the tone of the convention. We must and should be focused on the folks in the gulf region that are facing once again a life-threatening hurricane.And this is a time when our country really shuns politics and wants to focus on the most important thing, which is making sure that the people of that region survive and escape this horrific storm heading for them.BLITZER: We got some pictures -- we're just getting in some pictures of President Bush. He's been over at FEMA headquarters, and he's been speaking. We'll show some of these pictures to you.But, Governor Sanford, I assume you were going to be leading the South Carolina delegation here in St. Paul. What are you hearing? What do you think should be done?SANFORD: Well, I'll leave that up to, you know, those in charge on that front as to exactly what will be done, but, I mean, it's a national convention. This sort of thing happens every once four years.And what needs to be remembered about any storm is we certainly send thoughts, we certainly send prayers. We're already in the process of sending aid.But this is a part of a national debate that we're having, a national conversation that we're having as Americans as to what comes next come the elections in November.And so whether it's moved back or whether it's held at, you know, the date that's planned, I don't know. But what I do know is this is part of a much larger debate that can't be disrupted at the end of the day by a storm, a tornado, a flood, you name it, because that election is going to take place come November.BLITZER: You're saying that debate over who should be the next president of the United States...SANFORD: Correct.BLITZER: ... whether it should be John McCain or Barack Obama. That's a huge debate. But some say, Congressman Cantor, you know, given this natural disaster that's about to take place, maybe it would be wise for both of these parties to put politics aside, at least right now, and focus in exclusively on the human side of this hurricane.CANTOR: You know, it's really up to John McCain. And I think that he has shown, in terms of being the head of our party going into this election, and the fact that a theme of this convention is putting country first, I know that John McCain has over a 20-year track record of doing just that.And so there's no question in my mind that he'll make the right call as to how we're going to proceed in St. Paul. He's made the right call every step of the way during this race. And I'm confident that the same will occur this week and that the country will have its priorities straight, making sure that the people in the gulf are safe. BLITZER: What's the reaction in South Carolina among your Republican base to Senator McCain's surprise decision to pick Sarah Palin, the governor of Alaska, to be his running mate?SANFORD: Across the board, a lot of people are elated and excited.It's interesting. My wife was talking to a couple of girlfriends yesterday, and they were all keyed up about a woman they've never heard about, but very much loved her life story.SANFORD: The fact that you have somebody who begins in the PTA and cares about different things, and ends up governor of Alaska and now a vice presidential nominee is an exciting story, whether from a woman's perspective or from a policy person's perspective. If you look at her track record from a standpoint of challenging the status quo, which very much needs to be challenged in a place like Washington, D.C., or from the standpoint of stewardship, actually watching out for the taxpayer dollar, I mean, I think it's telling that you had somebody that turned away a $400 million bridge to nowhere because she says that's not a good use of taxpayer resources.BLITZER: All right. Governor, we've got to leave it right there. Governor Sanford, Congressman Cantor. The president of the United States is over at FEMA headquarters and he's been speaking there, and we're getting the tape in right now. So I want to listen to the president of the United States.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: Here at FEMA headquarters, where I just received a briefing. I've also come to thank the people behind me for working the long hours that they're doing to make sure that we've got the preparations in place for Hurricane Gustav.There has been a lot of work done to get ready for the storm. Across the Gulf Coast, there's governors and state officials and local leaders that are taking this storm very seriously and are preparing proactively.Secretary Chertoff and FEMA Administrator Paulison report that the federal government has prepositioned teams of emergency managers, doctors, ambulances, search-and-rescue teams, aircraft and commodities throughout the region. There are millions of meals and millions of liters of water prestaged, as well as a lot of blankets and cots.In other words, there's a lot of preparation that had gone into the anticipation of this storm.We're working with governors to identify and secure out-of-state shelter for people in the path of the storm. Several states, including Missouri, Texas, and New Mexico are preparing to and have accepted a lot of evacuees. People are leaving those areas that are of concern, and we're working hard to make sure that they have a place to go.The Army Corps of Engineers informs me that while the levees are stronger than they've ever been, people across the Gulf Coast, especially in New Orleans, need to understand that in a storm of this size, there is serious risk of significant flooding.My message to the people of the Gulf Coast is this storm is dangerous. There's a real possibility of flooding, storm surge, and high winds. Therefore, it is very important for you to follow the instructions and direction of state and local officials. Do not put yourself in harm's way or make rescue workers take unnecessary risk. And know that the American people stand with you and that we'll face this emergency together.In the coming days, I encourage people across our nation to help their neighbors in need and contribute to charities, such the Red Cross. You can volunteer your time to help those in need. And of course, you can pray for those who might be suffering.In light of these events, I will not be going to Minnesota for the Republican National Convention. I'm going to travel down to Texas tomorrow to visit with the emergency operations center in Austin, where coordination among federal, state, and local government officials is occurring. I intend to go down to San Antonio, where state and local officials are prepositioning relief materials for Texas and Louisiana, and I'll have a chance to visit with residents of both states who have been evacuated.I will not be traveling to Louisiana tomorrow, because I do not want my visit to impede in any way the response of our emergency personnel.I've been talking to the governors, yesterday and today. I also spoke with Mayor Nagin of New Orleans to make sure that they're getting everything they need from the federal government to prepare for what all anticipate will be a difficult situation.I hope to be able to get to Louisiana as soon as conditions permit.This nation has come to know the strong and resilient spirit of the people of the Gulf Coast. They've made it through great challenges in the past and they're going to make it through this one as well. In the meantime, all those preparing for this storm are in our thoughts and our prayers from me, and Laura, and our whole nation.Thank you very much.(END VIDEOTAPE)BLITZER: And so there he is, the president of the United States at FEMA headquarters, announcing he's heading off to Texas to help monitor what's going on and will get to the scene as soon as he can. This is always a difficult proposition for a president, because on the one hand, you want to be there and see what's going on, and on the other hand, you don't want to disrupt important emergency activities that are going on.John King is here. This is quite a contrast from three years ago, when the president was on vacation as Katrina was moving forward and he basically flew over. You remember that picture of him looking out of Air Force One, flying over Katrina. They're deliberately and anxiously taking a very aggressive, active step right now. The president canceling his trip here to St. Paul to address this convention.KING: A very different tone and a very different assessment from all of the federal officials. That picture is actually interesting, if you go back and look at it. President Bush looked out the window. They took that picture from Air Force One. He did not want to land at that time because he thought he would take so much of the law enforcement and security personnel and be a distraction, so that picture is actually unfair.However, the overall federal response, everybody would concede from the White House on down, was beyond disappointing. It was horrible. As was -- many people criticized state and local officials. But that picture became a metaphor for it. The picture itself was actually a smart decision by the president not to put Air Force One on the ground at a time that he would distract so much attention. But it became part of the greater narrative, which was a huge federal failure.BLITZER: We're getting some live pictures in from New Orleans right now. We'll take another quick break and continue our coverage. Hurricane Gustav, it's moving towards New Orleans and the Gulf Coast on this, the third anniversary of Katrina. It's a powerful Category 3 monster right now. It could go up to a 4 or 5. ""Late Edition"" continues right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Welcome back to St. Paul, where this Republican convention very much up in the air right now.Bill Bennett, our contributor, is joining us. You're not shy. Give these Republicans, your fellow Republicans, Bill, some advice. What should they do about this four-day convention, which is supposed to begin tomorrow?BILL BENNETT, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, be careful, because this may be a bigger hurricane than Katrina, we understand. I heard Mayor Nagin say last time, I urged you to leave, this time I'm telling you, get your butts out of town. So this is obviously very serious. And it's another opportunity, I should say, for the federal government to respond, and hopefully respond in a better way.BENNETT: But John McCain has to be very sensitive to what the suffering might be in New Orleans, so I think the possibility of canceling a day or two days or day-and-a-half is very real.BLITZER: We're maybe an hour away from some sort of formal announcement, is that right, John?KING: Yes. We know they've made some tentative decisions. They want Senator McCain to sign off on them. He is on his way down to the Gulf Coast area. If I'm right, Mississippi is his first stop.I'm told the leading proposal is to shorten the convention by a day or so. They have to gavel it into order tomorrow, or else legally they cannot nominate John McCain for president. So they will gavel the program in on Monday. They may shorten the Monday program, but they do need to convene the convention officially.And then I'm told the leading proposal is to shorten it for a day, and a lot of people around here are being told that day would be Tuesday, when they think you'll have the most impact with the storm and then a recovery effort under way, and perhaps ask the delegates here to participate in some service to help out, pitch in in a relief effort.But we're waiting for the final decisions. There's no doubt there will be significant changes. And it looks like we'll have a shorter official program maybe by a day, maybe by a bit more. We'll know soon.BLITZER: The -- it's going to be shorter obviously because the president of the United States and the vice president of the United States, they're not coming here. They were supposed to both address this convention tomorrow. These are difficult decisions that these party organizers, Gloria have to make.BORGER: Sure. Because, don't forget, this has been planned for years, no matter who the nominee was going to be. But I think everybody understands that there has to be a tonal shift.Conventions are celebrations, they're parties, people wear silly hats and buttons and everything else. And I think, you know, when you have a crisis going on in the country, I think what John was saying, which is essentially, turn this into some kind of telethon or fund- raising opportunity, is something that is really being talked about.BLITZER: And they might want to think about doing that not only for the 20,000 or so folks who were planning on coming here to St. Paul, but nationally, nationwide, because there is going to be a lot of need for help as a result of this...BORGER: And you'll have coverage.BLITZER: ...monster.BORGER: You'll have coverage.BLITZER: All right. Let's take another quick break and continue our coverage on the other side. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Let's go right to Reynolds Wolf and get an update on Hurricane Gustav as it moves through the Gulf of Mexico, towards the Gulf Coast, New Orleans, right in the bull's eye.What do we know?WOLF: The latest we know, Wolf, is that winds are still at 120 miles per hour, gusting to 150. It's about 400 miles from New Orleans. We've been telling you all morning long about people evacuating. And we now have word from FEMA that there have been many people that have been leaving Louisiana, going into Mississippi. And they have been clogging the roadways, pulling their FEMA trailers.Now what FEMA would like you to do, is if you happen to have a FEMA trailer, leave it. All you need to do is get yourself, your prized possessions, and just leave the coastline. Your trailers can be replaced, your life cannot.The storm is still expected to march its way to the west- northwest, doing so at a rate of about 17 miles an hour. It may increase in speed, Wolf, but it may also increase in power, going to Category 4 status as we get into Monday. Then at some point tomorrow, expect it to make landfall.Right now the forecast path has it just to the southwest of New Orleans, coming onshore. And as we get into Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, the storm going from a tremendous wind storm and rainstorm, and of course the storm surge, into a big rainmaker for parts of Texas, Louisiana, where this could be a big flood threat into much of next week.So it's going to be a tremendous story that we're going to follow here at CNN. Of course, we're your hurricane headquarters. We'll keep you up to speed with the latest information. Back to you.BLITZER: Yes. We're not going to leave this story at all. A quick thought, Bill Bennett, what do you want to hear? What's the most important thing John McCain should be saying? We're about to hear from him pretty soon. He's in Mississippi.BENNETT: John McCain is a guy with a right sense of mission and purpose. The whole theme of John McCain's life is live for something larger than yourself. He was bugging George Bush about this after 9/11. He was bugging George Bush about this after Katrina. And he was -- he has been doing this for years.So I think -- I don't think there's any posturing in John McCain's standing up and saying, now it's time for all of us to pitch in. This is what his life has been.BLITZER: Bill Bennett is going to be here with us. Gloria is here. John King is here. We're not going far away. We expect some kind of formal announcement from the RNC, from the Republican Convention here in St. Paul, Minnesota, within an hour, maybe less, maybe a little bit more. Once that happens, we'll share that with you.If there's a news conference, we'll bring it to you live. We'll be watching all of this very closely. I'm Wolf Blitzer in St. Paul. ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" starts at the top of the hour."

""The plus for the globalists? They said it would reduce global warming because one of the causes of global warming is...you guessed it...the old fashioned Tom Edison light bulb.""The letter seeks contributions and support for S.B. 395, the Better Use of Light Bulbs (BULB) Act, sponsored by Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., which seeks to repeal the light bulb efficiency standards included in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.""Help put an end to governmental interference in our lives! Help put an end to Mr. Obama interfering with free enterprise!"" the letter urges, referring to President Barack Obama.We are checking several claims from these light bulb letters, and in this one, we will tackle the central claim that, ""Democrats have already voted to ban our conventional lights bulbs (that you and I use even today!) in favor of dangerous fluorescent light bulbs.""First off, it's not accurate to pin the law entirely to Democrats. It's true that more Democrats than Republicans voted for the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. But it got a measure of bipartisan support. It passed the House with a 264-163 vote (with 36 Republicans voting in favor). And in the Senate, the vote was 65-27 (with 20 votes in favor from Republicans). And it was signed by Republican President George W. Bush. We also explore the issue of whether fluorescent bulbs release ""dangerous"" amounts of mercury into the environment in a separate fact-check. But the bigger issue here is the claim that the bill bans incandescent light bulbs.Sec. 321 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 spells out the new standards, essentially requiring that light bulbs be 25 percent more efficient than they are now. Specifically, a 100 watt light bulb is to be replaced with a bulb using no more than 72 watts of electricity while still providing comparable light output. The 75-watt, 60-watt and 40-watt bulbs must be replaced by bulbs using no more than 53, 43 and 29 watts respectively. The law phased in the new requirements: first the replacements for the 100-watt bulbs by Jan. 1, 2012; followed by the lower watt bulbs in ensuing years.The curlicue compact fluorescent bulbs and LED light bulbs easily meet the new efficiency standards. But we couldn't find any language in the law that specifically bans incandescent bulbs.So we asked Ron Arnold of the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise Action Fund to back up the claim that the law ""outlaws"" incandescent light bulbs.Arnold said the bill is filled with vague and confusing language and that there is a de facto ban because the standards are so stringent that no manufacturers will be able to build incandescent bulbs that meet them.""We believe 'ban' is an accurate term because there is no such thing as what they require,"" Arnold said.""If it's available, where can I buy it?"" he asked. ""Why doesn't Home Depot carry them?""Actually, they do, said Randy Moorhead, VP of government affairs at Philips Electronics, one of the three major manufacturers of light bulbs in the U.S.Philips' new EcoVantage bulb, a halogen incandescent light bulb that runs on 72 watts but throws off as much light as a standard 100 watt bulb (and lasts just as long), shipped out to Home Depot in April, he said. Philips also offers a premium bulb that costs more, but lasts three times longer. Both bulbs are more expensive than the current 100 watt incandescent bulbs, but they more than pay for themselves in savings on electricity to power them (more on that in another fact-check).The two other big players in the industry, Osram Sylvania and GE, have also developed new halogen incandescent bulbs that meet the new efficiency standards. But for those, you'll have to head to Lowe's.Moorhead said industry representatives were closely involved in the legislative process to develop the new efficiency standards and would never have supported a ban of incandescent bulbs. The companies, as well as the legislators who drafted the bill, were keenly aware that the new standards could be met through the development of halogen incandescent light bulbs, he said. ""You don't have to buy fluorescent bulbs,"" said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.Jen Stutsman, a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy, said the claims about a ban on incandescent light bulbs are simply wrong.""It doesn't ban a specific type of light bulb,"" she said.This one is a clear call for us. It's true that the current versions of incandescent light bulbs will be phased out of existence. Compact fluorescent and LED bulbs offer more efficient alternatives, but if incandescent light is your thing, the major light bulb makers have you covered. They have developed and shipped halogen incandescent bulbs that meet the new efficiency standards, so there is no basis in fact to claim they have been banned in favor of fluorescent bulbs. We rule this claim Pants on Fire.Advertisement"

Gardner Selby on Tuesday, July 17th, 2012 at 6:47 p.m.At a San Antonio stop during his July 17, 2012, fundraising swing through Texas, President Barack Obama followed up a defense of the 2010 health-care overhaul by saying: ""We’re not going backwards when it comes to immigration.""Referring to Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Obama continued: ""My opponent says the Arizona law should be ‘a model for the nation.’"" Audience members booed. Obama then referred, without details, to his administration’s recent decision not to seek deportations of young, otherwise law-abiding illegal immigrants.""I believe we can secure our borders and give opportunities to people who are striving and working hard -- especially young people who have been raised in this country and see themselves as Americans. That was the right thing to do. We're not going backwards; we're going forwards.""We wondered if Obama journeyed backward by saying Romney called the Arizona immigration law a model for the nation -- which he also said later the same day at the Austin Music Hall.Noticeably, the president’s statement repeated a claim we checked before by U.S. Rep. Charlie Gonzalez, D-San Antonio. Gonzalez said in a March 27, 2012, conference call organized by the Democratic National Committee that while in Arizona, Romney had said he believes that the state’s much-debated immigration-enforcement law — which originated in 2010 as Senate Bill 1070 — should be the template for federal immigration laws, a stance that Gonzalez described as disturbing.Gonzalez’s comment to reporters: ""Gov. Romney has actually (said) — while he was in Arizona, of course, and I understand that he was basically maybe playing up to the Arizona crowd — he felt that SB 1070, which has made its way up to the Supreme Court of the United States and will be argued in April, he believes that it should be the template, it should be the model for United States immigration law, not comprehensive immigration reform as the more responsible individuals in Congress have been espousing for a number of years, but an extreme version of an anti-immigrant law passed by the Arizona Legislature.""After Gonzalez made that statement, the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2012 threw out parts of the Arizona law that would have made state crimes out of federal immigration violations including provisions requiring immigrants to obtain or carry immigration registration papers, making it a state criminal offense for an illegal immigrant to seek work or hold a job and allowing police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without warrants, as reported by The Associated Press.However, the court let stand a ""show me your papers"" requirement that police officers check the status of people stopped for various reasons who might appear to be in the U.S. illegally. Even then, the AP reported, the justices said the provision could be subject to additional legal challenges. And they removed some teeth by prohibiting officers from arresting people on immigration charges.According to the AP, Romney did not immediately comment on the decision, though he said he believes that ""each state has the duty — and the right — to secure our borders and preserve the rule of law, particularly when the federal government has failed to meet its responsibilities.""Now back to whether Romney referred to the Arizona law as a model.In our check of Gonzalez, DNC spokesman Ricardo Ramirez pointed us to an answer Romney gave during the Feb. 22, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Arizona. We found that Romney did not say in the debate that Arizona's 2010 law should be adopted by Congress in lieu of comprehensive immigration reform; his reply to a question focused instead on a different, older Arizona statute.That said, we see how his reply could be misread.As John King of CNN framed his question to Romney, crowd members applauded mention of Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona’s Maricopa County, shown in attendance, who is known for his advocacy of tough immigration policies. Then King said to Romney: ""You've talked, governor, about self-deportation, if businesses do their job, asking for the right documents, the people will leave. But what about arresting? Should there be aggressive, seek them out, find them and arrest them as Sheriff Arpaio advocates?""""You know, I think you see a model here in Arizona,"" Romney answered. ""They passed a law here that says, that says that people who come here and try and find work, that the employer is required to look them up on E-Verify. This E-Verify system allows employers in Arizona to know who's here legally and who's not here legally. And as a result of E-Verify being put in place, the number of people in Arizona that are here illegally has dropped by some 14 percent, where the national average has only gone down 7 percent.""E-Verify is a federal, Internet-based system that employers can use to verify whether someone is authorized to work in the United States. Participation is voluntary for most U.S. businesses; there is no federal mandate. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s website says that more than 280,000 employers across the country are using the system.After the Arizona debate, many reporters, opinion columnists, Democrats and liberal groups interpreted that statement by Romney as him saying that SB 1070 as a whole should be a model, either for the nation or for other states.However, Dan Nowicki, the Arizona Republic’s national political reporter, questioned those interpretations in a March 3, 2012, news article , pointing out that Arizona’s requirement that businesses use E-Verify is not contained in SB 1070 but in an earlier state law, the Legal Arizona Workers Act.""It's clear from the (debate) transcript that Romney was describing part of the state's 2007 employer-sanctions law, which has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court,"" Nowicki wrote. ""That Arizona law requires employers to use a federal electronic system to verify whether new hires are eligible to work in the United States and provides punishment for companies that hire undocumented immigrants.""According to Nowicki’s article, Romney spokesman Ryan Williams told the Republic that in the Arizona debate, Romney was referring to the E-Verify requirement as the model and not SB 1070. Williams reiterated that statement to us in an email.Ramirez, of the DNC, also pointed to the rest of Romney’s debate response in the Feb. 22 debate as backup for Gonzalez’s claim.The remainder of Romney’s answer: ""So going back to the question that was asked, the right course for America is to drop these lawsuits against Arizona and other states that are trying to do the job Barack Obama isn't doing. And I will drop those lawsuits on day one. I'll also complete the fence. I'll make sure we have enough Border Patrol agents to secure the fence. And I will make sure we have an E-Verify system and require employers to check the documents of workers, and to check E-Verify. And if an employer hires someone that has not gone through E- Verify, they're going to get sanctioned just like they do for not paying their taxes. You do that, and just as Arizona is finding out, you can stop illegal immigration. It's time we finally did it.""So, Romney in the debate saluted the E-Verify element of a 5-year-old Arizona law — which was not part of the 2010 immigration-enforcement law that Gonzalez says Romney called a model for the nation.Then again, Romney also said he would end the federal challenge to the 2010 law on his first day as president.Obama’s campaign, asked to back up his San Antonio claim, emailed a statement describing Romney as extreme on immigration issues. The statement did not show that Romney considers the Arizona law a model for the nation.Our rulingObama could legitimately have targeted Romney’s vow to immediately drop the federal challenge to Arizona’s immigration-enforcement law as president. Instead, the Democrat’s statement mischaracterizes Romney’s salute to Arizona’s 2007 mandate that employers electronically verify the legal status of employees. That E-Verify requirement was not in the 2010 Arizona law.We rate Obama’s claim as False.Advertisement"
