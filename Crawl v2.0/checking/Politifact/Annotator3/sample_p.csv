Jack Kingston of Georgia, the ranking GOP member on the appropriations subcommittee that oversees the FDA, said the number of cases of food-borne illnesses in the country does not justify the $1.4 billion the new law is estimated to cost over the first five years.""I would not identify it as something that will necessarily be zeroed out, but it is quite possible it will be scaled back if it is significant overreach,"" said Kingston, who is likely to become chairman of the subcommittee when Republicans assume control of the House in January.""We still have a food supply that's 99.99 percent safe,"" Kingston said in an interview. ""No one wants anybody to get sick, and we should always strive to make sure food is safe. But the case for a $1.4 billion expenditure isn't there.""In testimony before Congress in March, FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said that user fees collected from food companies and farms would pay for most of the increased inspections and other costs associated with the legislation. But a provision for user fees in the House version was cut from the final language, leaving the government to foot the entire cost.""We're going to have to evaluate everything and set priorities at a time of reduced appropriations for all the different discretionary programs,"" said Rep. Tom Latham (R-Iowa), who serves on the FDA appropriations subcommittee and, along with Kingston and the panel's two other Republicans, voted against the food safety bill. The food safety legislation ""is going to have to compete with everything else.""Michael Herndon, an FDA spokesman, declined to comment.The legislation, expected to be signed into law by President Obama by the end of the month, is the first major change to the nation's food safety laws since 1938. It comes after a series of national outbreaks of food-borne illnesses linked to foods as varied as spinach, peanuts and cookie dough.""A bill that's signed by the president is an unfinished clay pot,"" said Carol Tucker-Foreman, a food policy expert at the Consumer Federation of America and a former senior official at the Department of Agriculture. ""You have the basic structure there, but what it looks like in the end depends on the attitude of the congressional funders and how vigorously the agency chooses to implement it.""The measure will affect about 80 percent of the food supply that is regulated by the FDA. But it will not affect meat, poultry and some egg products, which are overseen by the Department of Agriculture.The overhaul is designed to shift the mission of the FDA from reacting to tainted food after an illness has occurred to preventing outbreaks in the first place.It requires manufacturers and farmers to develop strategies to prevent contamination, then continually test to make sure they work. The legislation also gives the FDA the authority to recall food; currently, it must rely on food companies to voluntarily pull products off the shelves. And the bill would give the FDA access to internal records at farms and food-production facilities.CONTINUED 1 "

I'm Lester Holt, anchor of ""NBC Nightly News."" I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate.The participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. The commission drafted tonight's format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns.The 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long. We'll explore three topic areas tonight: Achieving prosperity; America's direction; and securing America. At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead-off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond. From that point until the end of the segment, we'll have an open discussion.The questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns. The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying.I will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment, as we welcome the candidates: Democratic nominee for president of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: How are you, Donald?(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Good luck to you.(APPLAUSE)Well, I don't expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled. We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and we're going to press for specifics. I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people.Candidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values. So, let's begin.We're calling this opening segment ""Achieving Prosperity."" And central to that is jobs. There are two economic realities in America today. There's been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation. However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works?CLINTON: Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together. Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot. First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.I want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business. We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.CLINTON: I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing. If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work. I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under. So let's have paid family leave, earned sick days. Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.How are we going to do it? We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you. We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country. You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better. I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.HOLT: Secretary Clinton, thank you.Mr. Trump, the same question to you. It's about putting money -- more money into the pockets of American workers. You have up to two minutes.TRUMP: Thank you, Lester. Our jobs are fleeing the country. They're going to Mexico. They're going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight. Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.So we're losing our good jobs, so many of them. When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world. They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much.So Ford is leaving. You see that, their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They're all leaving. And we can't allow it to happen anymore. As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis. They left -- fired 1,400 people. They're going to Mexico. So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.TRUMP: We cannot let it happen. Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan. It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.Companies will come. They will build. They will expand. New companies will start. And I look very, very much forward to doing it. We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.HOLT: Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?CLINTON: Well, I think that trade is an important issue. Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent. And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions. And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again. In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy.We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives. I understand that. You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.I don't buy that. I have a different experience. My father was a small-businessman. He worked really hard. He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going.And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow. That's the kind of economy I want us to see again.HOLT: Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can. You've talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you've promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans. How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas? How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?TRUMP: Well, for one thing -- and before we start on that -- my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.Our country's in deep trouble. We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China. They're the best, the best ever at it. What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing.So we have to do that. We have to renegotiate our trade deals. And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do.Let me give you the example of Mexico. They have a VAT tax. We're on a different system. When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax. When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately. When they sell into us, there's no tax. It's a defective agreement. It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it.Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me.But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently. She's been doing this for 30 years. And why hasn't she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective. Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact...HOLT: Let me interrupt just a moment, but...TRUMP: Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement. They should have been doing this for years. What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion. We cannot do it any longer, Lester. HOLT: Back to the question, though. How do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers? How do you make them bring the jobs back?TRUMP: Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving. I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them. They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck. But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.And once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies. So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving. We have to stop them from leaving. And that's a big, big factor.HOLT: Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here.CLINTON: Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago. We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. He said, back in 2006, ""Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money."" Well, it did collapse.TRUMP: That's called business, by the way.CLINTON: Nine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs. Five million people lost their homes. And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.Now, we have come back from that abyss. And it has not been easy. So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.They've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy. Take clean energy. Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century. Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it's real.TRUMP: I did not. I did not. I do not say that.CLINTON: I think science is real.TRUMP: I do not say that.CLINTON: And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad. And here's what we can do. We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. We can have enough clean energy to power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity.So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.HOLT: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: She talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company, our country. That was a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that one.Now, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work. Our energy policies are a disaster. Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt. You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.The Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it. He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.So I will tell you this. We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs. And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they're not doing it.And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone.And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this. You've been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now? For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.CLINTON: Well, actually...TRUMP: I will bring -- excuse me. I will bring back jobs. You can't bring back jobs.CLINTON: Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.TRUMP: Yeah, for 30 years.CLINTON: And I have -- well, not quite that long. I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again...TRUMP: Well, he approved NAFTA...(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: ... million new jobs, a balanced budget...TRUMP: He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.CLINTON: Incomes went up for everybody. Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we're actually going to look at the facts.When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test. Will they create jobs in America? Will they raise incomes in America? And are they good for our national security? Some of them I voted for. The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against. And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.But let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy. I think it is a part of it, and I've said what I'm going to do. I'm going to have a special prosecutor. We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable.When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent. We increased them to China 50 percent. So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.HOLT: Very quickly...TRUMP: But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...CLINTON: Well, I've been a senator, Donald...TRUMP: You haven't done it. You haven't done it.CLINTON: And I have been a secretary of state...TRUMP: Excuse me.CLINTON: And I have done a lot...TRUMP: Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.CLINTON: Well, that's your opinion. That is your opinion.TRUMP: You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent. NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it. Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate. But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA. Nothing will ever top NAFTA.CLINTON: Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out. I wrote about that in...TRUMP: You called it the gold standard.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.CLINTON: No.TRUMP: And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.CLINTON: Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts. The facts are -- I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated...TRUMP: Not.CLINTON: ... which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't. I wrote about that in my book...TRUMP: So is it President Obama's fault?CLINTON: ... before you even announced.TRUMP: Is it President Obama's fault?CLINTON: Look, there are differences...TRUMP: Secretary, is it President Obama's fault?CLINTON: There are...TRUMP: Because he's pushing it.CLINTON: There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world. And I think it's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again. That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt.TRUMP: But you have no plan.CLINTON: But in -- oh, but I do.TRUMP: Secretary, you have no plan.CLINTON: In fact, I have written a book about it. It's called ""Stronger Together."" You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore...TRUMP: That's about all you've...(CROSSTALK)HOLT: Folks, we're going to...CLINTON: ... or at an airport near you.HOLT: We're going to move to...CLINTON: But it's because I see this -- we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth. We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.So we have a very robust set of plans. And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.TRUMP: You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history. You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. You are going to drive business out. Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place.And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan. I'm very proud of it. It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs. But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.When I go around -- Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over. And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing -- the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation. You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business. And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.I'm going to cut regulations. I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.HOLT: Let me get you to pause right there, because we're going to move into -- we're going to move into the next segment. We're going to talk taxes...CLINTON: That can't -- that can't be left to stand.HOLT: Please just take 30 seconds and then we're going to go on.CLINTON: I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so...TRUMP: Facts.CLINTON: So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact-checker. So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look. Because what I have proposed...TRUMP: And take a look at mine, also, and you'll see.CLINTON: ... would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt. What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses. What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy. And I think it's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.HOLT: Well, you just opened the next segment.TRUMP: Well, could I just finish -- I think I...(CROSSTALK)HOLT: I'm going to give you a chance right here...TRUMP: I think I should -- you go to her website, and you take a look at her website.HOLT: ... with a new 15-minute segment...TRUMP: She's going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion.HOLT: Mr. Trump, I'm going to...TRUMP: And look at her website. You know what? It's no difference than this. She's telling us how to fight ISIS. Just go to her website. She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website. I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.HOLT: The next segment, we're continuing...CLINTON: Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS.HOLT: ... achieving prosperity...TRUMP: No, no, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.CLINTON: No, we're not. No, we're not.TRUMP: See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do. No wonder you've been fighting -- no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.CLINTON: That's a -- that's -- go to the -- please, fact checkers, get to work.HOLT: OK, you are unpacking a lot here. And we're still on the issue of achieving prosperity. And I want to talk about taxes. The fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy.Secretary Clinton, you're calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans. I'd like you to further defend that. And, Mr. Trump, you're calling for tax cuts for the wealthy. I'd like you to defend that. And this next two-minute answer goes to you, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Well, I'm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs. They're going to expand their companies. They're going to do a tremendous job.I'm getting rid of the carried interest provision. And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy. It's a great thing for the middle class. It's a great thing for companies to expand.And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can't bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what -- is so bad.So what they're doing is they're leaving our country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country. And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back.Instead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together. Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.And here's the thing. Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion. I happen to think it's double that. It's probably $5 trillion that we can't bring into our country, Lester. And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful.But we have no leadership. And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.HOLT: All right. You have two minutes of the same question to defend tax increases on the wealthiest Americans, Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.TRUMP: Why not?CLINTON: Why not? Yeah, why not?(LAUGHTER)You know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case...TRUMP: There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country.HOLT: This is -- this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.TRUMP: Yes.CLINTON: Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester. We've looked at your tax proposals. I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas. I happen to support that.TRUMP: Then you didn't read it.CLINTON: I happen to -- I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit. But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do. You've proposed an approach that has a...TRUMP: Who gave it that name? The first I've -- who gave it that name?(CROSSTALK)HOLT: Mr. Trump, this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes.CLINTON: ... $4 billion tax benefit for your family. And when you look at what you are proposing...TRUMP: How much? How much for my family? CLINTON: ... it is...TRUMP: Lester, how much?CLINTON: ... as I said, trumped-up trickle-down. Trickle-down did not work. It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009. Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.And a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that. And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.CLINTON: I don't think top-down works in America. I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate. Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy. Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top.HOLT: Mr. Trump, we're...TRUMP: Typical politician. All talk, no action. Sounds good, doesn't work. Never going to happen. Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on.Now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression. And believe me: We're in a bubble right now. And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down.We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble. And we better be awfully careful. And we have a Fed that's doing political things. This Janet Yellen of the Fed. The Fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level. And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job. The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.HOLT: Mr. Trump, we're talking about the burden that Americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns. And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to -- who he owes it to and any business conflicts. Don't Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest?TRUMP: I don't mind releasing -- I'm under a routine audit. And it'll be released. And -- as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released.But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have. It shows income -- in fact, the income -- I just looked today -- the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million. If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised.But that's the kind of thinking that our country needs. When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year. You know what that is? That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.HOLT: The IRS says an audit...TRUMP: Excuse me.HOLT: ... of your taxes -- you're perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit. And so the question, does the public's right to know outweigh your personal...TRUMP: Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit. Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years. I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited. I said, do you get audited? I get audited almost every year.And in a way, I should be complaining. I'm not even complaining. I don't mind it. It's almost become a way of life. I get audited by the IRS. But other people don't.I will say this. We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of. I will release my tax returns -- against my lawyer's wishes -- when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted. As soon as she releases them, I will release.(APPLAUSE)I will release my tax returns. And that's against -- my lawyers, they say, ""Don't do it."" I will tell you this. No -- in fact, watching shows, they're reading the papers. Almost every lawyer says, you don't release your returns until the audit's complete. When the audit's complete, I'll do it. But I would go against them if she releases her e-mails.HOLT: So it's negotiable?TRUMP: It's not negotiable, no. Let her release the e-mails. Why did she delete 33,000...HOLT: Well, I'll let her answer that. But let me just admonish the audience one more time. There was an agreement. We did ask you to be silent, so it would be helpful for us. Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns. You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it. We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit.So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns? And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.CLINTON: Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks. Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.TRUMP: That makes me smart.CLINTON: So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health. And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide.And the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate. They don't give you all the details that tax returns would. And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see. And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding.And we'll guess. We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding. But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts? Who does he owe money to? Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.HOLT: He also -- he also raised the issue of your e-mails. Do you want to respond to that?CLINTON: I do. You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail. TRUMP: That's for sure.CLINTON: And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently. But I'm not going to make any excuses. It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.HOLT: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: That was more than a mistake. That was done purposely. OK? That was not a mistake. That was done purposely. When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they're not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it's disgraceful. And believe me, this country thinks it's -- really thinks it's disgraceful, also.As far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns. That I can tell you. You learn a lot from financial disclosure. And you should go down and take a look at that.The other thing, I'm extremely underleveraged. The report that said $650 -- which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money. It's not a lot of money relative to what I had.The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was -- actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion. And the $650 isn't even on that. But it's not $650. It's much less than that.But I could give you a list of banks, I would -- if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks. These are very fine institutions, very fine banks. I could do that very quickly.I am very underleveraged. I have a great company. I have a tremendous income. And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way. It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country's a mess, you know, it's one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything's in great shape, our airports. Our airports are like from a third world country.You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible -- you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land -- we've become a third world country.So the worst of all things has happened. We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess. We haven't even started. And we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw. Whether it's 6 or 5, but it looks like it's 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice.And it's really a shame. And it's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem. Our country has tremendous problems. We're a debtor nation. We're a serious debtor nation. And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas.HOLT: We'll let you respond and we'll move on to the next segment.CLINTON: And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years. (APPLAUSE)And the other thing I think is important...TRUMP: It would be squandered, too, believe me.CLINTON: ... is if your -- if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that. You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.And, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald. I've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do.We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses. It's a beautiful facility. It immediately was put to use. And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do...TRUMP: Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work...CLINTON: Well, to...TRUMP: Which our country should do, too.CLINTON: Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them?I can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you. He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.And when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times. There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once. You call yourself the King of Debt. You talk about leverage. You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.TRUMP: Wrong. Wrong.CLINTON: Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.HOLT: Let's let Mr. Trump...CLINTON: And we need to be very clear about that.TRUMP: So, yeah, I think -- I do think it's time. Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites. I built an unbelievable company. Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places. It's an unbelievable company.But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there. And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.Now, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws. But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company. My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. And that's what I do.But what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me. I'll give you an example. We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.But we're opening the Old Post Office. Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money. I'm a year ahead of schedule. And that's what this country should be doing.We build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they're supposed to cost. We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don't have people that know what they're doing.When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy. The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule. And we should be able to do that for our country.HOLT: Well, we're well behind schedule, so I want to move to our next segment. We move into our next segment talking about America's direction. And let's start by talking about race.The share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it's been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings of African-Americans by police, as we've seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa. Race has been a big issue in this campaign, and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap.So how do you heal the divide? Secretary Clinton, you get two minutes on this.CLINTON: Well, you're right. Race remains a significant challenge in our country. Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system. We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.And we've got to do several things at the same time. We have to restore trust between communities and the police. We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary. Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.CLINTON: Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods. So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform. I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform. So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal. And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together. So we have to do two things, as I said. We have to restore trust. We have to work with the police. We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them. And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today.HOLT: All right, Mr. Trump, you have two minutes. How do you heal the divide?TRUMP: Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order. And we need law and order. If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country.And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country.I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just -- just came in. We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very -- I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he'll because it's so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot.In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st. Thousands of shootings. And I'm saying, where is this? Is this a war-torn country? What are we doing? And we have to stop the violence. We have to bring back law and order. In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed. We have to bring back law and order.Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York. It brought the crime rate way down. But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it.We have gangs roaming the street. And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants. And they have guns. And they shoot people. And we have to be very strong. And we have to be very vigilant.We have to be -- we have to know what we're doing. Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything. We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.HOLT: Your two -- your two minutes expired, but I do want to follow up. Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men.TRUMP: No, you're wrong. It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her. And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed.HOLT: The argument is that it's a form of racial profiling.TRUMP: No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them.These are felons. These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.You need more police. You need a better community, you know, relation. You don't have good community relations in Chicago. It's terrible. I have property there. It's terrible what's going on in Chicago.But when you look -- and Chicago's not the only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places. You need better relationships. I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.TRUMP: You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good.But you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently. So there's some bad things going on. Some really bad things.HOLT: Secretary Clinton...TRUMP: But we need -- Lester, we need law and order. And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people. And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.HOLT: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I've heard -- I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country.TRUMP: Ugh.CLINTON: You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids. There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe. There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective. Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective. It did not do what it needed to do.Now, I believe in community policing. And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991. Property crime is down 40 percent. We just don't want to see it creep back up. We've had 25 years of very good cooperation.But there were some problems, some unintended consequences. Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses. And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated. So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system. We cannot just say law and order. We have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.We need to have more second chance programs. I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system. You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans. So there are some positive ways we can work on this.And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us. Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets. In a lot of places, our police are outgunned. We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country. If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun. So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.HOLT: Secretary Clinton, last week, you said we've got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias. Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people?CLINTON: Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police. I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other. And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.I've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago. They admit it's an issue. They've got a lot of concerns. Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.CLINTON: They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance. And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.HOLT: Mr. Trump...TRUMP: I'd like to respond to that.HOLT: Please.TRUMP: First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists. I agree with you. When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of. These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment.But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists. And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off. But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth. And that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's been horribly met, as you know. I think you've apologized for it. But I think it was a terrible thing to say.And when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away. Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them. And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.I think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders. Five hundred murders is a lot of murders. It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?But we went from 2,200 to 500. And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg. And it was terminated by current mayor. But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact.CLINTON: Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders. So there is...TRUMP: No, you're wrong. You're wrong.CLINTON: No, I'm not.TRUMP: Murders are up. All right. You check it.CLINTON: New York -- New York has done an excellent job. And I give credit -- I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked. And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well.Look, one murder is too many. But it is important that we learn about what has been effective. And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want. Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?But let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods. And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.HOLT: This conversation is about race. And so, Mr. Trump, I have to ask you for five...TRUMP: I'd like to just respond, if I might.HOLT: Please -- 20 seconds.TRUMP: I'd just like to respond.HOLT: Please respond, then I've got a quick follow-up for you.TRUMP: I will. Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians. They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years.The African-American community -- because -- look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated. They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that's what it is. They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years.HOLT: Mr. Trump, let me...(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: Well, I -- I do think...TRUMP: And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities -- and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place. You decided to stay home, and that's OK. But I will tell you, I've been all over. And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities. And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.HOLT: Mr. Trump, I...CLINTON: I think -- I think -- I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Mr. Trump, for five years, you perpetuated a false claim that the nation's first black president was not a natural-born citizen. You questioned his legitimacy. In the last couple of weeks, you acknowledged what most Americans have accepted for years: The president was born in the United States. Can you tell us what took you so long?TRUMP: I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say. Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of Secretary Clinton. And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard. And you can go look it up, and you can check it out.TRUMP: And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened. Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it. They were pressing it very hard. She failed to get the birth certificate.When I got involved, I didn't fail. I got him to give the birth certificate. So I'm satisfied with it. And I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it.HOLT: That was...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.HOLT: I will let you respond. It's important. But I just want to get the answer here. The birth certificate was produced in 2011. You've continued to tell the story and question the president's legitimacy in 2012, '13, '14, '15...TRUMP: Yeah.HOLT: .... as recently as January. So the question is, what changed your mind?TRUMP: Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it. I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate. And I think I did a good job.Secretary Clinton also fought it. I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true. Look, it's true. Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager. And she was involved. But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.HOLT: I'm sorry. I'm just going to follow up -- and I will let you respond to that, because there's a lot there. But we're talking about racial healing in this segment. What do you say to Americans, people of color who...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Well, it was very -- I say nothing. I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it. He should have produced it a long time before. I say nothing.But let me just tell you. When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community. I think you can see that.And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion. And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.HOLT: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, just listen to what you heard.(LAUGHTER)And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.But it can't be dismissed that easily. He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen. There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy. He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. And the birther lie was a very hurtful one. You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity. And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high. And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down.HOLT: Mr. Trump, you can respond and we're going to move on to the next segment.TRUMP: I would love to respond. First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama. You treated him with terrible disrespect. And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are. It doesn't work that way. You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures. I don't think you can deny that.But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true. So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work. It really doesn't.Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued. We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do.TRUMP: I notice you bring that up a lot. And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you. Maybe I'm trying to save the money.But, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing? Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things.I'll go one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. And it's a tremendously successful club. And I'm so glad I did it. And I have been given great credit for what I did. And I'm very, very proud of it. And that's the way I feel. That is the true way I feel.HOLT: Our next segment is called ""Securing America."" We want to start with a 21st century war happening every day in this country. Our institutions are under cyber attack, and our secrets are being stolen. So my question is, who's behind it? And how do we fight it?Secretary Clinton, this answer goes to you.CLINTON: Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries. There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money.But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states. The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia. There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this. I know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really...(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: ... tough, long game here. And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee. And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information. We need to make it very clear -- whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else -- the United States has much greater capacity. And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information.And we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have. We don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare. But we will defend the citizens of this country.And the Russians need to understand that. I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do. And that's why I was so -- I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans. That is just unacceptable. It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information -- in administrations...HOLT: Your two minutes have expired.CLINTON: ... have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief. It's comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.HOLT: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes and the same question. Who's behind it? And how do we fight it?TRUMP: I do want to say that I was just endorsed -- and more are coming next week -- it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here -- admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country. That just happened, and many more are coming. And I'm very proud of it.In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE. They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration. I was just endorsed by ICE. I was just recently endorsed -- 16,500 Border Patrol agents.So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge. OK? Because look at the mess that we're in. Look at the mess that we're in.As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said. We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not. I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't -- maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?TRUMP: You don't know who broke in to DNC.But what did we learn with DNC? We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Look what happened to her. But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of. That's what we learned.Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over.We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game. ISIS.So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is -- it is a huge problem. I have a son. He's 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it's hardly doable.But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. But that's true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.HOLT: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing. I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS. It does involve going after them online. I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere.But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate.We're making progress. Our military is assisting in Iraq. And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership. I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden. And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles. Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.HOLT: You mention ISIS, and we think of ISIS certainly as over there, but there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando. I'll ask this to both of you. Tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump?TRUMP: Well, first I have to say one thing, very important. Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS. ""We will take out ISIS."" Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster. And ISIS was formed.So she talks about taking them out. She's been doing it a long time. She's been trying to take them out for a long time. But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that. And then you wouldn't have had them.Or, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income. And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.HOLT: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard. Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.TRUMP: Wrong.CLINTON: That is absolutely proved over and over again.TRUMP: Wrong. Wrong.CLINTON: He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.CLINTON: But the larger point -- and he says this constantly -- is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama.And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.But let's talk about the question you asked, Lester. The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States? That's the most important part of this. How do we prevent attacks? How do we protect our people?And I think we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information. I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey. You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami. And they brought him down. And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.So we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East. That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of.We're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism. We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations. Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community.They're on the front lines. They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else. They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.HOLT: Mr. Trump...TRUMP: Well, I have to respond.HOLT: Please respond.TRUMP: The secretary said very strongly about working with -- we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen. You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess. Under your direction, to a large extent.But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly. They were choking on the sanctions. And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going.But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO? And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson. I did really well. But I have common sense. And I said, well, I'll tell you. I haven't given lots of thought to NATO. But two things.Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share. Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest -- but I said, they do not focus on terror. And I was very strong. And I said it numerous times.And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division. And I think that's great. And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO. It's a lot of money to protect other people. But I'm all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also.And they're going to do that. And that was -- believe me -- I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton. And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops. Not only that, you named the day. They couldn't believe it. They sat back probably and said, I can't believe it. They said...CLINTON: Lester, we've covered...TRUMP: No, wait a minute.CLINTON: We've covered this ground.TRUMP: When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened. It should have never happened. Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS. But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant. Now it's in over 30 countries. And you're going to stop them? I don't think so.HOLT: Mr. Trump, a lot of these are judgment questions. You had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion. What makes your...TRUMP: I did not support the war in Iraq.HOLT: In 2002...TRUMP: That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she -- frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.HOLT: My question is, since you supported it...TRUMP: Just -- would you like to hear...HOLT: ... why is your -- why is your judgment...TRUMP: Wait a minute. I was against the war in Iraq. Just so you put it out.HOLT: The record shows otherwise, but why -- why was...TRUMP: The record does not show that.HOLT: Why was -- is your judgment any...TRUMP: The record shows that I'm right. When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows? Essentially. I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto. We talked about the economy is more important. I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity. I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox. And Sean Hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and I spoke to him about it -- he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war.HOLT: Why is your judgment better than...TRUMP: And when he -- excuse me. And that was before the war started. Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people -- he's willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him. I was against the war. He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war.And I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there. But nobody called Sean Hannity. And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started. I think in '04. But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq.And one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely -- because if you read this article, there's no doubt. But if somebody -- and I'll ask the press -- if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started. He and I used to have arguments about the war. I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing. It's going to destabilize the Middle East. And that's exactly what it's done. It's been a disaster.HOLT: My reference was to what you had said in 2002, and my question was...TRUMP: No, no. You didn't hear what I said.HOLT: Why is your judgment -- why is your judgment any different than Mrs. Clinton's judgment?TRUMP: Well, I have much better judgment than she does. There's no question about that. I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?(LAUGHTER)I have a much better -- she spent -- let me tell you -- she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising -- you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names -- oh, temperament, let's go after -- I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament. I have a winning temperament. I know how to win. She does not have a...HOLT: Secretary Clinton?TRUMP: Wait. The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control. I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem.HOLT: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Whew, OK.(LAUGHTER)Let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO. You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all. And you know the only time it's ever been invoked? After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb. They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration. They had built covert facilities. They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away.And we had sanctioned them. I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough. So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran.And we did drive them to the negotiating table. And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot. That's diplomacy. That's coalition-building. That's working with other nations.The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship. He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I'd blow them out of the water and start another war. That's not good judgment.TRUMP: That would not start a war.CLINTON: That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted. And the worst part...TRUMP: No, they were taunting us.CLINTON: ... of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons. He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons. He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine...TRUMP: Wrong.CLINTON: ... have a good time, folks.TRUMP: It's lies.CLINTON: And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling. That is the number-one threat we face in the world. And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material. So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.TRUMP: That line's getting a little bit old, I must say. I would like to...CLINTON: It's a good one, though. It well describes the problem.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: It's not an accurate one at all. It's not an accurate one. So I just want to give a lot of things -- and just to respond. I agree with her on one thing. The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks.Nuclear is the single greatest threat. Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries. They do not pay us. But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune. That's why we're losing -- we're losing -- we lose on everything. I say, who makes these -- we lose on everything. All I said, that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we're doing. We can't defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million...HOLT: We need to move on.TRUMP: Well, wait, but it's very important. All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out. We're a country that owes $20 trillion. They have to help us out.HOLT: Our last...TRUMP: As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree. It is the single greatest threat that this country has.HOLT: Which leads to my next question, as we enter our last segment here (inaudible) the subject of securing America. On nuclear weapons, President Obama reportedly considered changing the nation's longstanding policy on first use. Do you support the current policy? Mr. Trump, you have two minutes on that.TRUMP: Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. But Russia has been expanding their -- they have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint.I looked the other night. I was seeing B-52s, they're old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them. We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do first strike.I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over. At the same time, we have to be prepared. I can't take anything off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal. Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. Iran has power over North Korea.And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea. And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that? Why didn't you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. Nobody's ever seen that before. That turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages. It certainly looks that way.So you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history. The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems. All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much.HOLT: Your two minutes is expired.TRUMP: And they're going to end up getting nuclear. I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day. Believe me, he's not a happy camper.HOLT: All right. Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.CLINTON: Well, let me -- let me start by saying, words matter. Words matter when you run for president. And they really matter when you are president. And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them.It is essential that America's word be good. And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe. I've talked with a number of them. But I want to -- on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good.It's also important that we look at the entire global situation. There's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran. But personally, I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that.And Donald never tells you what he would do. Would he have started a war? Would he have bombed Iran? If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be. But it's like his plan to defeat ISIS. He says it's a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan.So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues. People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do. Can they rely on us? Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values? That's what I intend to do. I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home.We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...HOLT: Your two minutes is...CLINTON: ... to be given any opportunities at all.HOLT: ... is expired.TRUMP: Lester, one thing I'd like to say.HOLT: Very quickly. Twenty seconds.TRUMP: I will go very quickly. But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place. Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.HOLT: Mr. Trump...TRUMP: And it's a big problem. And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars. We cannot be the policemen of the world. We cannot protect countries all over the world...HOLT: We have just...TRUMP: ... where they're not paying us what we need.HOLT: We have just a few final questions...TRUMP: And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability. We need heart. We need a lot of things. But you have to have some basic ability. And sadly, she doesn't have that. All of the things that she's talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let's say, while she had great power. But they weren't taken care of. And if she ever wins this race, they won't be taken care of.HOLT: Mr. Trump, this year Secretary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party. Earlier this month, you said she doesn't have, quote, ""a presidential look."" She's standing here right now. What did you mean by that?TRUMP: She doesn't have the look. She doesn't have the stamina. I said she doesn't have the stamina. And I don't believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.HOLT: The quote was, ""I just don't think she has the presidential look.""TRUMP: You have -- wait a minute. Wait a minute, Lester. You asked me a question. Did you ask me a question?You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals. You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia. I mean, can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia? And with all of the money they have, we're defending them, and they're not paying? All you have to do is speak to them. Wait. You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don't believe that Hillary has the stamina.HOLT: Let's let her respond. CLINTON: Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: The world -- let me tell you. Let me tell you. Hillary has experience, but it's bad experience. We have made so many bad deals during the last -- so she's got experience, that I agree.(APPLAUSE)But it's bad, bad experience. Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can -- name -- you almost can't name a good deal. I agree. She's got experience, but it's bad experience. And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.HOLT: We are at -- we are at the final question.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well, one thing. One thing, Lester.HOLT: Very quickly, because we're at the final question now.CLINTON: You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina. But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said...TRUMP: I never said that.CLINTON: .... women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.TRUMP: I didn't say that.CLINTON: And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman ""Miss Piggy."" Then he called her ""Miss Housekeeping,"" because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name.TRUMP: Where did you find this? Where did you find this?CLINTON: Her name is Alicia Machado.TRUMP: Where did you find this?CLINTON: And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet...TRUMP: Oh, really? CLINTON: ... she's going to vote this November.TRUMP: OK, good. Let me just tell you...(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Mr. Trump, could we just take 10 seconds and then we ask the final question...TRUMP: You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials. Some of it's said in entertainment. Some of it's said -- somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.But you want to know the truth? I was going to say something...HOLT: Please very quickly.TRUMP: ... extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, ""I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice."" But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue. They're untrue. And they're misrepresentations.And I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice. And I don't deserve that.But it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done. It's hundreds of millions of ads. And the only gratifying thing is, I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money...HOLT: We have to move on to the final question.TRUMP: ... $200 million is spent, and I'm either winning or tied, and I've spent practically nothing.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: One of you will not win this election. So my final question to you tonight, are you willing to accept the outcome as the will of the voters? Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I support our democracy. And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. But I certainly will support the outcome of this election.And I know Donald's trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope the people out there understand: This election's really up to you. It's not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want. So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does.HOLT: Mr. Trump, very quickly, same question. Will you accept the outcome as the will of the voters? TRUMP: I want to make America great again. We are a nation that is seriously troubled. We're losing our jobs. People are pouring into our country.The other day, we were deporting 800 people. And perhaps they passed the wrong button, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption, but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens. Ended up becoming citizens. And it was 800. And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don't even know.HOLT: Will you accept the outcome of the election?TRUMP: Look, here's the story. I want to make America great again. I'm going to be able to do it. I don't believe Hillary will. The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her.(APPLAUSE)HOLT: All right. Well, that is going to do it for us. That concludes our debate for this evening, a spirit one. We covered a lot of ground, not everything as I suspected we would.The next presidential debates are scheduled for October 9th at Washington University in St. Louis and October 19th at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. The conversation will continue.A reminder. The vice presidential debate is scheduled for October 4th at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. My thanks to Hillary Clinton and to Donald Trump and to Hofstra University for hosting us tonight. Good night, everyone.1 of 18"

And the political team of ABC News has been out in force throughout this state. And we just wanna say to the people of Iowa, we are endlessly struck by how seriously you take your role as first in line for the vote.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Every four years first.DIANE SAWYER: That is true. And it's 24 days now and counting until the voting begins in the caucuses. And-- and it's at the time for closing arguments, so let us introduce the presidential candidates from the Republican party for the United States of America here at the debate tonight.Former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, Governor Rick Perry of Texas, former Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts (AUDIENCE WHOOP), former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich of Georgia (AUDIENCE WHOOP), Texas Congressman Ron Paul, (APPLAUSE) and Congresswoman from Minnesota, Michele Bachmann. (APPLAUSE) Thank you all.Before we begin if we can just one note, because George and I have been talking and all of us have been talking to many of you about what it takes to run for the presidency in this country right now. And we are talking about the determination, the physical stamina, the road you travel, the miles you travel and the sacrifices your families make as you do it. So we thought maybe at the end of this year-- the-- the end of this road does approach, we could all just salute your commitment to the presidential race and to democracy in this country. We salute you.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: The rules of the debate are pretty straightforward, the candidates have negotiated them, agreed to them. They're gonna forgo opening statements and then they will give, they've agreed, one minute responses to questions from Diane and me, 30 seconds for rebuttal to those. And we wanna show everybody at home that the candidates can see as well, this clock right here. And we'll shift from green to yellow to red over the course of the allotted time.The audience here at Drake was chosen by the Iowa Republican Party, and all of you at home can follow on ABCNews.com and Yahoo.com. You can even join the discussion by downloading Yahoo's Enter Now app on your iPhone, and with that you can actually pitch in with opinions during this debate.DIANE SAWYER: So it is time to begin. And people are telling us that they do feel it's time to choose. And the number one issue on which they're going to choose, jobs in America. And we would like to hear from all of you in this opening round. And the question is this: what is your distinguishing idea, distinguishing, from all of the others on this stage, about how to create jobs in this create, how to bring jobs back from overseas. And if you will, how many jobs do you think you can create and how long will that take? And Speaker Gingrich, will you lead us off?NEWT GINGRICH: Well, I think that there's a clear record, I worked with Ronald Reagan in the early '80s and his recovery program translated into today's population of about 25 million new jobs in a seven-year period. As Speaker of the House, I worked with-- President Clinton and he followed with a very similar plan.And we ended up with about 11 million new jobs in a four-year period. Went down to 4.2% unemployment. Starts very simply, taxes, lower taxes, less regulation, an American energy plan, and actually be positive with our people to create jobs. The opposite of the Obama plan, which is higher taxes, more regulation, no American energy, and attack people who create jobs with class warfare.So I think there are a number of steps you can take. I would start with zero capital gains, hundreds of billions of dollars would pour into the country, I'd go to 12.5% corporate tax rate, that would bring in at least $700 billion in repatriated money back from overseas. I would then go to 100% expensing for all new equipment-- abolish the (UNINTEL) news-- write it off in one year, and I'd abolish the death tax penalty. Those steps would begin to dramatically create jobs.DIANE SAWYER: And I want to turn to Governor Romney, if I can. Because you've given a number and you've given a time frame, 11.5 million jobs in four years, aiming for six percent-- unemployment rate at the end of the first time. What is the distinguishing idea to do that?MITT ROMNEY: Well, having spent my life in the private sector, I understand where jobs are created. They're not created in government, they're not created in Washington. They're created on Main Streets and streets all over America. And to help make America the most attractive place in the world for investment, for new enterprise, for entrepreneurs and for job growth, there's seven things you have to do. There's not just one, there's seven.One, make sure that our employer tax rates are competitive with other nations. They're not now. We're the highest in the world. Number two, get regulators and regulations to recognize their job is not to burden the-- the private enterprise system, but to encourage it. Number three, to have trade policies that make sense for America, not just for the people with whom we trade.This president has not done that. And China, that's been cheating, has to be cracked down on. Number four, we have to have energy policies that take advantage of our extraordinary energy resources. Number five, the rule of law, and the Boeing-- effort on the part of the N.L.R.B. violated that. Number six, grade institutions to create human capital, and number seven, finally a government that doesn't spend more money than it takes in.DIANE SAWYER: And Congressman Paul, a number as a time frame and an idea.RON PAUL: My -- approach is slightly different. Where I think all for less taxes and less regulations, we recognize this. But I emphasize the fact that you have to know why we have a recession, and why we have unemployment before you can solve the problem. And the re-- the financial bubbles are created by excessive credit and stimulation by the Federal Reserve. And then you have bubbles and you have to have a correction.The-- this stimulus creates es-- excessive debt and malinvestment. As long as you don't correct that and you maintain the debt and the malinvestment, you can't get back to economic growth again. Unfortunately, so far what we have done, is we have not liquidated the debt, we have dumped the debt on the American people through TARP funding and-- and as well as the Federal Reserve.So the debt is dumped on the people. And what did we do? We bailed out the people that were benefiting during the formation of the bubble. So as long as we do that, we're not gonna have economic growth. We-- you did the same thing in the Depression, the Japanese are doing it right now, so it's time we liquidate the debt and look at monetary policy. And then, of course, lower taxes. And I would like to-- do in the first year, cut $1 trillion, 'cause that is the culprit, big spending and big government.DIANE SAWYER: I wanna come back to those of you with another direct question of whether there is a number of jobs that can be created and a time frame you can tell the American people you can do it in. But I want to turn to Governor Perry for your distinguishing idea.RICK PERRY: Yeah, the distinguishing mark is-- a tax policy that puts a flat tax in place of-- 20%. And you-- as they've said, you get rid of the regulatory burden that's killing people. And I have a record of doing that as the governor of the state of Texas over the last 11 years. We created over a million jobs in that state while America lost over two million jobs.So there's a very clear blueprint of how to make this work. But I wanna talk about one other issue, and-- and Congressman Paul touched on it. And it's this idea, I can-- I can on a map diagram the problem that we've got in America today. And it d-- it's this direct line between Washington D.C. and Wall Street. And it's the corruption that's gone on. It's the idea of TARP. It's the idea of $7.7 trillion that we didn't even know was being put into these peoples and these banks.That's what Americans are really upset with. And it's gonna take an outsider who can come in to put in the model of taxes and regulation. And-- and be able to balance that budget by the year 2020 with 18% of G.D.P. That's what the American people want, and an outsider like Rick Perry is gonna do that.DIANE SAWYER: All right, Congresswoman Bachmann?MICHELE BACHMANN: Well-- one of our former competitors was Herman Cain and he always reminded us of the 9-9-9 plan. And what I would like to do is have the Win-Win-Win plan. And the way that we can do that is first addressing the tax code. I'm a former federal tax lawyer. And that literally, we will create millions of dollars if we abolish the tax code and embrace a pro-growth policy not only by lowering the rates for businesses, but by individuals as well.And making it a tax code that applies fairly and the same to all Americans. That's very important. And something else I wanna do with my tax code policy is make sure that everyone pays something. Because today, 47% of the American people pay nothing in federal income tax. Everyone benefits by the country, they need to pay. But also, one of my ""Win"" points is with American energy production.If we legalize American energy, we'll create 1.4 million jobs in just a few years' time. And here's something we-- else that we can do under the ""Win"" plan. We can cut government bureaucracy, which is ObamaCare. N.F.I.B. tells us, that's the small business agency, that we will lose 1.6 million jobs over five years if we keep ObamaCare. I wanna-- I am committed to repealing ObamaCare, Dodd-Frank, cutting out the E.P.A., and we'll save millions of jobs if we do that.DIANE SAWYER: Senator Santorum?RICK SANTORUM: Well, I was just down in Fremont County, which is down in the far southwest corner of the state, and they just lost about, a couple hundred jobs at a ConAgra plant down there. And Governor Branstad and Lieutenant Governor Reynolds understand, that's why they asked us to have a forum here in Pella a few weeks ago on manufacturing.They understand that the heartland of America is suffering because the manufacturing economy of this country continues to go down. We used to have 21% of people employed in this country in manufacturing, it's now nine. And it hurts disproportionately small town and rural America. So what I learned from traveling around Iowa is we had to get a plan together that'll revitalized manufacturing.So I took the corporate tax, not the 12%. I zeroed it out for all manufacturers. We want manufacture, we want ""Made in the U.S.A."" to be the moniker under my administration. We want an administra-- we want-- to put a platform together that's gonna repeal regulations that are crushing our-- our b-- manufacturers and businesses. I'll repeal, one thing a president can do, he can't pass a law, but he can repeal regulations.And Barack Obama has given us-- a bevy of regulations that need to be repealed, starting with a lot of our energy regulations that driving up our energy costs. That's another part of d-- of the plan, is to-- to make sure we have lower electricity rates, that we have oil and gas drilling going on here, so manufacturing can afford to be here. You put together that plan, we will get-- not only revitalize the economy, we'll-- we'll take care of an area of the ec-- of this country that has suffered in-- in recent times. And that's rural and small-town America.DIANE SAWYER: I just wanna point out, I think that Governor Romney is the only one who actually gave a four-year, first-term number, which was again, 11.5 million jobs. Wondered if anyone else wanted to come in with a four-year, first-term promise for the American people.RICK SANTORUM: I'm not--MALE VOICE #2: Well--RICK SANTORUM: --I-- I-- I-- I'm not gonna make a promise, because I don't believe you s-- I don't believe that government can sit there and-- and-- and from the top down dictate how many jobs are here. What we can do is we can create an atmosphere for businesses to thrive. And we know what that means. Less regulation, where-- a regulation that works for-- for-- for businesses, taxation that makes us competitive, a litigation environment that makes us competitive.You create the platform. You create the-- you create that petri dish, you'll get lots of things growing there. And I don't need-- some government bean counter to tell us we've got a right-- right program to be able to c-- create jobs in this country.DIANE SAWYER: I wanna move on if I can, to another question which represents some of the urgent and tough choices presidents have to make, because this one is coming up soon, December 31st. And it is the payroll tax cut. And as we know, the payroll tax cut, which funds the Social Security-- fund in this country is part of the argument, part of the debate, part of the consideration about the economy in this country right now.And-- by some estimates, if this tax cut expires on December 31st, it could add as much as $1,000 to the tax burden of American working families. And I know you are divided down the middle, if I can turn to you, Congresswoman Bachmann, and we know that you are a tax attorney, and-- you're familiar with these issues. Should this tax cut go?MICHELE BACHMANN: Well, I-- this tax shouldn't-- cut shouldn't have been put in the first place, the payroll tax extension, because last December, I fought against this. And I encouraged my colleagues not to go down this road. This is President Obama's plan, a temporary gimmick, not permanent solution. That's what the business community is looking for.That's where real jobs will be created. The reason why this is so detrimental to the economy as well is that this blew a hole, in other words, it took away $111 billion away from the Social Security Trust Fund. This is a very real issue for senior citizens, because we have to pay the Social Security checks that are going out.I'm completely different from b-- Barack Obama on this issue. I don't agree with Barack Obama. We have candidates on this stage that are standing with Barack Obama on this issue. But this year alone, it-- this will also cost the Social Security Trust Fund another $112 billion. And we don't have enough money this year in the Social Security Trust Fund to put out those checks.Which means, we have to go to the General Treasury to get the money. And trust me, when you open the door to the General Treasury, the only thing that comes out are moths and feathers. There's nothing in there. So we have to recognize, we can't spend money that we don't have. And that's what Barack Obama's trying to do. Temporary gimmicks, not permanent solutions--DIANE SAWYER: But (UNINTEL) is a decision that does have to be made in three weeks. And Governor Romney, you have said it's a ""temporary Band-Aid,"" but you have indicated that you are in favor of keeping it. So how do you differ from Congresswoman Bachmann? Is it worth it?MITT ROMNEY: Well, I don't wanna raise taxes on people-- particularly people in the middle class that are suffering right now under the Obama economy. It's a temporary tax-- cut, and it'll help people in a d-- very difficult time. But-- but let's-- let's recognize, this is just a Band-Aid.The extraordinary thing is, we have a president who's been in office three years with a fiscal crisis and a jobs crisis. The-- these unemployment numbers we're seeing, they're not just statistics, they're real people. They're young people that can't start their lives, can't go to college, they're people in their 50s that ex-- expected to be in their big earning years, and they're not gonna be able to-- to have the-- the kind of future they hope for.And-- and this is a president who has not, at this stage, put forward a plan to get this economy going again. All he does is talk about little Band-Aids here and there throwing gasoline on a fire, on a few embers. The right thing to do is to talk about how he's gonna make America competitive again. I spoke with businesspeople all over the country and have been one myself for 25 years.People aren't investing in America because this president has made America a less attractive place for investing and hiring than other places in the world. That's got to change. And it's a shame that we've got a president who thinks that being hands-on in the economy means working on his golf cred. You know, the-- the-- the right course for America is to have a president who understands the economy and will make that his-- his focus and put in place a plan to get this economy going.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I wanna grab that-- this conversation, but-- but very quickly, I believe Speaker Gingrich is also for extending the payroll taxes and so is Congressman Paul, Governor Perry, I believe you're against it-- some are so tur--RICK PERRY: Very much so.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Yeah, you're the only one I-- what is your position on it?RICK PERRY: Is there a Social Security Trust Fund and-- or not? And is the Social Security system gonna be funded by payroll taxes or not? And the President of the United States runs around and talks about how Republicans don't care about Social Security and how they're gonna-- they're gonna rip apart the Social Security system, and he's the one defunding the Social Security system.We're either gonna have a serious debate on how to fix Social Security, and we're not gonna do it by taking resources away from Social Security to pay benefits. So I'm-- I'm all for tax cuts, I-- I mean, I'll welcome the president to sit down with-- Republicans in Congress to work on a tax cut that's gonna create growth in the economy. But to-- to take the Social Security Trust Fund that is-- that is so sacrosanct to the Democrats when it comes for election time.And then to use that as a tax and then try to beat up Republicans for-- for not supporting the tax cut is-- is absurd. You either care about Social Security and you wanna fund it, or you don't.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: So it's very divided. Three and three, Congressman Paul, 30 seconds rebuttal, Senate--RON PAUL: Well-- well I want to-- extend the tax cut, because if you don't, you raise the taxes. But I wanna pay for it. And it's not that difficult. In my proposal, in my budget, I wanna cut hundreds of billions of dollars from overseas. The trust fund is gone. But how are we gonna restore it? We have to quit the spending. We have to quit this being the policemen of the world.We don't need another war in Syria and another war in Iran. Just get rid of the embassy in Baghdad. We're pretending we're comin' home from Baghdad. We built an embassy there that cost a billion dollars and we're putting 17,000 contractors in there, pretending our troops are coming home. I could save--(GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: UNINTEL)RON PAUL: --and we don't have to raise taxes on Social Security-- on the-- on the-- on the-- on the tax--(OVERTALK)GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: As I said, I do wanna broaden this out, and all of you have been debating for the past several months-- two big questions for this nomination fight. Who has the most consistent conservative candidate among you, and which of you is best able to defeat President Obama? And Governor Romney, Speaker Gingrich crystallized his argument a couple of weeks ago. He said, and I quote, ""I'm a lot more conservative than Mitt Romney, and a lot more electable than anyone else."" (LAUGH) I know you don't agree with that thought. (LAUGH)MITT ROMNEY: Well, of course I don't agree with that. (LAUGHTER) I don't think most people agree with that. Speaker Gingrich has been in government for a long time and we can look at his record, we can look at my record. But really, this is more about-- about us talking about what we believe. And w-- and whether we can lead the country at a time when-- when we need to restore the kind of values that make America the greatest nation on Earth.We have in Washington a president who believes in a fundamental transformation of America into an entitlement society. Where the government takes for some from some and gives to everybody else. And the only people that do real well in that setting are the people in the government. This nation was founded on the principle of being a merit society, where education, hard work, risk taking, have lifted certain individual, and they have helped lift-- lift the entire nation.That's what's going on today. And the reason I oughta be the nominee of our party is I believe I can take that message to our president and to the American people. And they'll say, ""Mitt Romney understands the economy 'cause he's lived in it."" I understand a merit-based society, I believe in the principles that made America the greatest nation on Earth. And Speaker Gingrich and I have a lot of places where we disagree, we'll talk about those--GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Why don't you name them?MITT ROMNEY: What, places where we disagree? Let's see-- we can start with-- with his idea to-- to have-- a lunar colony that would mine-- minerals from the-- from the moon, I'm not in favor of spendin' that kinda money-- to do that. (LAUGHTER) He said that he would-- he would like to-- eliminate in some cases the child labor laws so that kids could clean schools. I don't agree with that-- that idea.His plan in capital gains, to remove capital gains for people-- at the very highest level of income is different than mine. I'd-- I'd-- eliminate capital gains, interest, and dividends for people in middle income. So-- we have differences of viewpoint on-- on some issues. But-- but the real difference, I believe, is our backgrounds. I spent my life in the private sector.I-- I understand how the economy works. And I believe that for Americans to-- to say goodbye to President Obama and elect a Republican, they need to have confidence that the person they're electing knows how to make this economy work again and create jobs for the American middle class.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Your response?NEWT GINGRICH: (THROAT CLEAR) Just a second. You had four allegations, do I get four responses?GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Take your time. (LAUGHTER)NEWT GINGRICH: Okay. Let's start with the last one, let-- let's be candid. The only reason you didn't become a career politician is you lost to Teddy Kennedy in 1994. (LAUGHTER)MITT ROMNEY: Now-- now wait a second, that-- (AUDIENCE BOOING) I mean you'll-- Okay, go ahead.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: --you'll get another response, go ahead.MITT ROMNEY: Okay. (LAUGH)NEWT GINGRICH: Do I-- do I get to-- continue--MITT ROMNEY: Please, please.NEWT GINGRICH: No, and I'm just saying, I've-- I looked at it, I thought, you know, I'm a citizen, I've served the country in many ways, you're a citizen, you served the country in many ways. But it's a bit much, you'da been a 17-year career politician by now, if you'd won. That's-- that's all I'm saying on that one.Now number two, I'm proud of trying to find things that give young people a reason to study science and math and technology and telling them that some day in their lifetime, they could dream of going to the moon, they could dream of going to Mars. I grew up in a generation where the space program was real, where it was important, and where frankly it is tragic that NASA has been so bureaucratized, aims at you-- Iowa-- Iowa State's a perfect example.Iowa State's doing brilliant things, attracting brilliant students. I wanna give them places to go and things to do. And I'm happy to defend the idea that America should be in space and should be there in an aggressive, entrepreneurial way. Third, as to schools, I think virtually every person up here worked at a young age. What I suggested was, kids oughta be allowed to work part-time in school, particularly in the poorest neighborhoods, both because they could use the money.If you take one-half of the New York janitors who are unionized and paid more than the teachers, an entry-level janitor gets paid twice as much as an entry-level teacher. You take half of those janitors, you could give virtually-- you could give lots of poor kids a work experience in the cafeteria and the school library and-- and front office, and a lot of different things.I'll stand by the idea, young people oughta learn how to work. Middle class kids do it routinely. We should give poor kids the same chance to pursue happiness. Finally (APPLAUSE) on-- finally on capital gains taxes I asked you about this at Dartmouth (?). I'm astonished, you're a businessman. You wanna create jobs. A $200,000 cap on or capital gains tax cut is lower than Obama.Now you know if you really wanna create jobs, you wanna-- you wanna encourage the people who make more than $200,000 who actually have capital to invest the capital in the U.S. I'll stick with zero capital gains will create vastly more jobs than your proposal--(OVERTALK)GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Romney, your response, then I wanna bring in the others.MITT ROMNEY: Yeah, yeah. My proposal actually does create 11.5 million jobs, and it does so by a higher-- a G.D.P. growth rate than we've seen over these last Obama years. And-- and in my view, the place that we could spend our precious tax dollars for a tax cut is on the middle class, that's been most hurt by the Obama economy. That's where I wanna eliminate taxes on interest dividends and capital gains.And with regards to the idea that if I'da beaten Ted Kennedy I coulda been a career politician, that's probably true. If I would've been able to get in the NFL liked I hope when I was a kid, why, I woulda been a football star all my life too, (LAUGHTER) but-- but I-- but I-- (APPLAUSE) I spent-- I spent my life in the private sector. Losing to pl-- Teddy Kennedy was probably the best thing I coulda done for-- for preparing me for the job I'm seeking, because it-- it put me back in the private sector. I worked in the private sector, I learned lessons that are desperately needed in Washington.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I wanna bring--MITT ROMNEY: We don't need-- we don't need folks who are lifetime-- lifetime Washington people to-- to-- to get this country out of the mess it's in. We need people from outside Washington, outside K Street. And by the way, one more thing, to have kids work in the-- in the library and to-- and to help out in school and to clean the blackboards does not require changing our-- our-- our child labor laws in this country. We of course should encourage more kids to--(OVERTALK)GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: We will-- we will come back to that, I wanna bring Congressman Paul in on this, because-- Congressman, you've been running ads that are quite tough--RON PAUL: Quite what?GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Quite tough on Speaker Gingrich here in Iowa this week, accusing him of quote, and this is a quote from your ad, ""serial hypocrisy."" Why do you think Speaker Gingrich is a hypocrite?RON PAUL: Well, he's been on different positions, you know, on so many issues. You know, single payer-- he's taken some positions that are not conservative. He-- he supported the TARP funds. And-- the other-- really annoy-- should've (LAUGH) annoyed a lot of people, he received a lot of money from Freddie Mac. Now, Freddie Mac is essentially a government organization.While he was earning a lot of money from Freddie Mac, I was fighting over a decade to try to explain to people where the housing bubble was coming from. So Freddie Mac is bailed out by the tax payers. So in a way, Newt, I think you probably (LAUGH) got some of our tax payer's money. They g-- they got taxed, and they got money on, and they're still getting bailed out.But-- you're a spokesman for 'em and you received money for 'em, so I think-- I think this is-- something that-- the people oughta know about. But there's been many positions, and you have admitted many of the positions where you have changed positions. But-- you know, if you were lookin' for a consistent position, you know, I-- I think there's gonna be a little bit of trouble anybody competing with me on consistency. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)(OFF-MIC CONVERSATION)NEWT GINGRICH: Well, first of all, as you say in your own, normally in your own speeches, the housing bubble came from the Federal Reserve inflating the money supply. Now, that's the core of the housing bubble and I happen to be with you on auditing the Fed and on fund-- and frankly on firing Bernanke. Second, I was never a spokesman for any agency, I never did any lobbying for any agency. I offered strategic advice. I was in the private sector. And I was doing things (LAUGHTER) in the private sector.RON PAUL: Oh come-- okay, okay. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)(OVERTALK)RON PAUL: --private sector. (LAUGH)NEWT GINGRICH: And-- and when you're in the private sector, and you have a company and you offer advice like McKinsey does, like a bunch of other companies do, you're allowed to charge money for it.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: All right--NEWT GINGRICH: Ca-- ca-- it's called free enterprise.RON PAUL: It's the tax payer's money though, we had to bail these people out--NEWT GINGRICH: Well I was-- I'm not for bailing them out, in fact, I'm for breaking them up.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Let me bring Congresswoman Bachmann in on this, because you make similar accusations against Speaker Gingrich. You called him a ""poster boy of crony capitalism."" Did he answer your concerns?MICHELE BACHMANN: Well, when you're talking about taking over $100 million, and when your office is on the Rodeo Drive of Washington D.C., which is K Street, and you're taking money to influence the outcome of legislation in Washington, that's the epitome of the establishment, that's the epitome of a consummate insider. But your question was, who's the proven con-- constitutional conservative in this race, and that would be me.I'm 55 years old, I've spent 50 years in the real world as a private business woman living real life and-- and building a real business. But you have to take a look at the candidates that-- that are on the stage. You started out with Mitt Romney with Newt Gan-- Gingrich, asking them about whether or not they're the conservative in this race.But you have to take a look. You-- when you look at Newt Gingrich, for 20 years, he's been advocating for the individual mandate in healthcare. That's-- that's longer than Barack Obama. Or if you look at Mitt Romney as the governor of Massachusetts, he's the only governor that put into place socialized medicine. No other governor did. Our nominee has to stand on a stage and debate Barack Obama and be completely different.I led 40,000 Americans to Washington D.C., to the Capitol, to fight ObamaCare. I didn't advocate for it. If you look at-- at-- at Newt/Romney, they were for ObamaCare principles. If you look at Newt/Romney, they were for cap and trade. If you look at Newt/Romney, they were for the illegal immigration problem. And if you look at (LAUGH) Newt/Romney, they were for the $700 billion bailout. And you just heard Newt/Romney is also with Obama on the issue of the payroll extension.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Okay.MICHELE BACHMANN: So if you want a difference, Michele Bachmann is the proven conservative. It's not Newt/Romney.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You threw-- you threw a lot out there. (APPLAUSE) So let's get both-- both of them a chance to respond, Speaker Gingrich, you go first, because you were in there twice-- also on r-- on-- Romney, and then--NEWT GINGRICH: Okay-- those four points--GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: --Senator Romney, right go ahead.NEWT GINGRICH: Well, Michele, you know, a lot of what you say just isn't true, period. I have never-- I have-- I oppose cap and trade, I testified against it, the same day that Al Gore testified for it. I helped defeat it in the Senate through American solutions. It is simply untrue. I fought against ObamaCare at every step of the way. I did it with-- the Center for Health Transformation was actively opposed, we actively campaigned against it.You know, I think it's important for you, and the-- this is fair game, and everybody gets to-- to-- to pick fights. It's important that you be accurate when you say these things. Those are not true. And most of the money I made, frankly, I made in ways that are totally-- had nothing to do with anything you've described. I did no lobbying, no representation. And frankly, my-- my speech-- my-- my speech money and other things I did, they had nothing to do with that.It was a lot larger source of income. So, you know, I've had 24 books and I've had 13 New York Times best-sellers. Now-- that was not people who wanted influence running around buying my books. I know that doesn't fit your model, it happens to be true.MICHELE BACHMANN: Can I respond? (APPLAUSE)GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Thirty seconds, then Governor Romney.MICHELE BACHMANN: Well you'd have to go back to 1993 when Newt first advocated for the individual mandate in healthcare, and as recently as May of this year, he was still advocating for the individual mandate in healthcare. And Governor Romney sent his team to the White House to meet with President Obama to teach them how to spread the RomneyCare model across the nation. That's why I say, Newt/Romney, you've got to have our nominee as someone who is a stark, distinct difference with President Obama.Who can go toe to toe and hold him accountable. President Obama knows me in Washington D.C. I've taken him on on issue after issue. Our nominee has to be willing to not agree with Barack Obama the-- on these issues, but stand 180Â° opposite of all the candidates on this stage I've been fighting President Obama for every year that I've been there, and I've taken him on. And I will take him on in the debate and defeat him.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Romney. (APPLAUSE)MITT ROMNEY: I know Newt Gingrich. And Newt Gingrich is a friend of mine. But, he and I are not clones, I promise. (LAUGH) That-- that is not the case. So this Newt Gingrich thing, we gotta get that out of our mind altogether-- Newt and Romney thing, sorry. Let-- let me say this about-- about health care. One, I didn't send a team of anybody to meet with Barack Obama. I wish he'd have given me a call. I wish when he was putting together his health care plan, he'd have had the courtesy and-- and perhaps the judgment to say, ""Let me-- let me talk to a governor. Let's talk to somebody who's dealt with a real problem that-- that understands this topic,"" and get on the phone.I'd have said (BACKGROUND VOICE), ""Mr. President, you're going down a very, very bad path. Do not continue going down that path because what you're gonna do is you're gonna raise taxes on the American people. You're gonna cut Medicare. Let's not forget, only one president has ever cut Medicare for seniors in this country, and it's Barack Obama. We're gonna remind him of that time and time again.And finally, the plan we put in place in Massachusetts, it deals with the 8% of our people who didn't have insurance. The 92% of people who did have insurance, nothing changes for them. If I'm President of the United States, we're gonna get rid of ObamaCare and return, under our constitution, the 10th Amendment, the responsibility and care of health care to the people in the states.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I wanna bring Governor Perry-- (APPLAUSE) you've heard this argument, I wonder which side you come down on.RICK PERRY: Yeah, well, I-- I'm-- I'm stunned, 'cause-- the fact of the matter is, you know, Michele kinda hit the nail on the head when we talked about the individual mandate. Both of these gentlemen have been for the-- individual mandate. And I'm even more stunned, Mitt, that you said you wished you could've talked to Obama and said-- ""You're goin' down the wrong path,"" because that is exactly the path that you've taken Massachusetts. The Beacon Hill study itself said that there's been 18,000 jobs lost because of that individual mandate.The study continued to say that there've been over $8 billion of additional cost. I wish you coulda had the conversation with the people of Massachusetts a long time before that phone call would've been with-- the-- President Obama, 'cause the fact of the matter is, you're for individual mandate. And you can get up and stand-- up and talk about, you know, ""I'm against it now. And I'm gonna-- rescind ObamaCare. I'm gonna repeal ObamaCare."" But the record is very clear. You and Newt were for individual mandates. And that is the problem. And the question is then, ""Who can stand on the stage, look Obama in the eye, and say, 'ObamaCare is an abomination for this country,'?"" And I'm gonna do that. And I can take that fight to him and win that fight.DIANE SAWYER: Governor Romney, (INAUDIBLE). (APPLAUSE)MITT ROMNEY: A good deal of what you said was right. Some was wrong. Speaker Gingrich said that he was for a federal individual mandate. That's something I've always opposed. What we did in our state was designed by the people in our state for the needs of our state. You believe in the 10th Amendment. I believe in the 10th Amendment. The people of Massachusetts favor our plan three to one. They don't like it, they can get rid of it. (COUGH) That's the great thing about (COUGH) a democracy, where individuals under the 10th Amendment have the power to craft their own solutions.By the way, the-- the problem with President Obama's plan is it does three things we didn't in my opinion, among others. I understand we disagree on this. But among others, one, it raises taxes by $500 billion. We (NOISE) didn't raise taxes. Two, it cuts Medicare by $500 billion. We didn't do that, either. And three, it doesn't just deal with the people that don't have insurance. It's a 2,000-page bill that takes over health care for all the American people. It is wrong for health care. It's wrong for the American people. It's unconstitutional. And I'm absolutely adamantly opposed to ObamaCare.And if I'm the President of the United States, I will return to the people and the states the power they have under the constitution and they can craft the solutions they think are best for them. And my view-- you had a mandate in your state. You mandate that girls at 12 years old had to get a vaccination for-- for a sexually-transmitted disease. So it's not like we have this big difference on mandates. We had different things we mandated over. I-- I wanted to give people health insurance. You want to get young girls-- a vaccine. There are differences.DIANE SAWYER: Governor, if we could ask Speaker Gingrich to respond.NEWT GINGRICH: Yeah, I-- I just wanna make one point that's historical. (CLEARS THROAT) In 1993, in fighting HillaryCare, virtually every conservative saw the mandate as a less-dangerous future than what Hillary was trying to do. The Heritage Foundation was a major advocate of it. After HillaryCare disappeared it became more and more obvious that mandates have all sorts of problems built into them. People gradually tried to find other techniques. I frankly was floundering, trying to find a way to make sure that people who could afford it were paying their hospital bills while still leaving an out so libertarians to not buy insurance. And that's what we're wrestling with. It's now clear that the mandate, I think, is clearly unconstitutional. But, it started as a conservative effort to stop HillaryCare in the 1990s.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Perry.RICK PERRY: I'm-- I'm-- (THROAT CLEARING) I'm listenin' to you, Mitt, and I'm hearin' you say all the right things. But I read your first book and it said in there that your mandate in Massachusetts which should be the model for the country. And I know it came out of-- of the-- the reprint of the book. But, you know, I'm just sayin', you were for individual mandates, my friend.MITT ROMNEY: You know what? You've raised that before, Rick. And-- you're simply wrong.RICK PERRY: It-- it-- it was true then. (CHUCKLE) It's true now.MITT ROMNEY: That-- now, this-- Rick, I'll-- I'll tell you what. (CHUCKLE) 10,000 bucks-- (APPLAUSE) $10,000 bet?MITT ROMNEY: Oh, okay, I-- I'll--RICK PERRY: I'll show you the-- I'll-- I'll-- I'll show you the book.MITT ROMNEY: I wrote-- I've got the book. And--RICK PERRY: And we'll show-- (LAUGH)MITT ROMNEY: And I-- and I-- and I wrote the book. And I haven't-- and chapter seven is a section called The Massachusetts Model. And I say as close as I can quote, I say, ""In my view, each state should be able to-- to fashion their own program for the specific needs of their distinct citizens."" And then I go on to talk about the states being the laboratories of democracy. And we could learn from one another. I have not said, in that book, first edition or the latest edition, anything about our plan being a national mo-- model imposed on the nation.The right course for America, and I said this durin' the debates the last time around, I'll say it now and time again, is to let individual states-- this is a remarkable nation. This idea of federalism is so extraordinary. Let states craft their own solutions. Don't have ObamaCare put on us by the federal government.MICHELE BACHMANN: George and Diane--(OVERTALK)MICHELE BACHMANN: George and Diane, can I just say something? This is such an important issue. We have one shot to get rid of ObamaCare, that's it. It is 2012. Do we honestly believe that two men who've just stood on this stage and defended RomneyCare when it was put in place in Massachusetts and the individual mandate when he proposed it in 1993, are they honestly going to get rid of it in 2012?MITT ROMNEY/NEWT GINGRICH: Yes.MICHELE BACHMANN: This is going to be a very-- (LAUGH) but, I don't think so. (CHEERING) It's gonna be a very heavy lift.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I gotta get Senator Santorum in here.MICHELE BACHMANN: It's gonna be a very heavy lift.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator.RICK SANTORUM: This is not about what you say at a debate or what you say in a campaign when you're talking to audiences that you wanna get-- that you-- that you know what you wanna hear. Back in 1994 when they would-- I was running for the United States Senate and I did not support an individual mandate and I was a conservative, I supported something called Medical Savings Accounts that I drafted with John Kasich when I was in the House because I believe in bottom-up solving the problems in America, not top-down government solutions.That's what I learned-- I actually learned it, some of it, in listening to some of your GOPAC tapes. But, you've strayed on that issue, as you have on others. The record is important. But what the question was about a consistent conservative, well, you can't talk about whether someone's consistent unless you look at their record. And I'd agree with Michele. I mean, I think Michele has been consistent in-- as-- as a consistent conservative. But, she's been fighting and losing. I fought and won. I was in the United States Senate and I fought and-- and passed Welfare Reform. It-- I was the principal author when I was in the United States House and was-- and-- and managed the bill on the floor of the United States Senate.I was the-- leader on-- on pro-life issues and pro-family issues. And I fought those issues and endured tough debates and won. I went out and fought on na-- national security issues, conservative things like putting sanctions on Iran. And again, the consistent track record of being there in good times and in bad, and I think you heard the difference-- you're not gonna hear them talk about all the positions I took and flip-flopped on. I was there. I led. And I won.And if you're lookin' for someone who can be a consistent conservative, and there's others on this platform, but who can lead the fight, win the issues, and plus, win in states that are important for us to win elections like Pennsylvania and--GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I-- I-- I'm tryin' to be-- we've tried to-- I'll-- I'll-- I'll risk using the word, we've tried to be liberal with the time. But, the time (LAUGH)-- (UNINTEL)close as we can. We-- and we are running up against a commercial break, but it did invoke you kinda swimming backwards, so 30 seconds to respond.MICHELE BACHMANN: Well, you know, I think the important thing to know is that you fight and that you lead. And I led when I-- I was-- when I was in the United States Congress, we were in the minority. Nancy Pelosi wasn't interested in my pro-- pro-- pro-- growth policy on health care. But, I didn't sit on my hands. I saw what was happening to this country. Our country was going to lose because of socialized medicine.And so I did everything I could, including bringing and leading 40,000 people to the Capitol to get the attention of the-- of the Congress to get rid of ObamaCare. As President of the United States, my proven consistent record will be that I will take on every special interest. I will take on K Street. And I will pre-lobby. And I'll make sure that I help elect 13 more Republican U.S. Senators so we have 60 senators in the Senate, a full complement in the House. And I won't rest until we repeal ObamaCare. You can take it to the bank.RICK SANTORUM: But, if I can-- if I can res-- if I can respond to that, because she referenced that-- she referenced there (BACKGROUND VOICE) are differences between the two of us, I was in the minority in the House of Representatives, too. And along with Jim Nussle from here in Iowa, I-- we formed a-- a group called the Gang of Seven and we won. We exposed the House banking scandal. We overturned a huge scandal. We-- we sent the-- eventually sent the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Dan Rostenkowski ended up in jail, because, no, we didn't just fight. But we fight and we figured out a way to win, even in the minority.DIANE SAWYER: And we wanna thank all of you. And again, these are the rules that you set up. We wanna be fair. And we wanna hear everything you have to say. These issues are so important. But, it really does help if you stick to the rules that were agreed on. And we appreciate that. And if-- we could, when we come back, we're gonna tackle some other very big issues, immigration, big questions about foreign policy, and also one about states and family values. And that will be when we come back. (MUSIC)ANNOUNCER: You're watching live ABC News coverage of the Iowa Republican Party debate. (MUSIC)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MITT ROMNEY: (MUSIC) The real difference, I believe, is our backgrounds. I spent my life in the private sector. I understand how the economy works. And I believe that for Americans to-- to say goodbye to President Obama and elect a Republican, they need to have confidence that the person they're electing knows how to make this economy work again and create jobs for the American middle class.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Your response?NEWT GINGRICH: (CLEARS THROAT) Just a second. We had four allegations. Do I get four responses?GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Take your time. (THROAT CLEARING) (CHUCKLE)NEWT GINGRICH: Okay. Let's-- let's start with the last one. Let's be candid. The only reason you didn't become a career politician is you lost to Teddy Kennedy in 1994. (BOOS)MITT ROMNEY: Now-- now wait a second, now wait a second. That's-- that was-- that was--GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: That was-- you'll-- you'll get another response, go ahead.NEWT GINGRICH: Do-- do I get to go ahead and continue?MITT ROMNEY: Please, please.NEWT GINGRICH: No, and I'm just saying--MICHELE BACHMANN: You want a difference, Michele Bachmann is a proven conservative. It's not Newt Romney.MALE VOICE: You threw-- you threw a lot out there. (APPLAUSE)ANNOUNCER: Back live from Des Moines, Iowa (INAUDIBLE).(OFF-MIC CONVERSATION)ANNOUNCER: Live from Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, once again, Diane Sawyer and George Stephanopoulos.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: We are back. It has been a rocking debate so far. And we want to get to another issue that you all talked about extensively in this campaign, and that is values, family, and faith. Governor Romney and Governor Perry, you both made it a feature of ads you ran in Iowa this week, which leads to this question from our partners at the Des Moines Register. And we're gonna show it up on the screen. ""Should voters consider marital fidelity in making their choices for president?"" And-- and Governor Perry, in South Carolina this week you said this is an important issue. Why?RICK PERRY: Well-- it-- I said that-- not only did I make a vow to my wife, but I made a vow to God. And-- that's pretty heavy liftin' in my book. When I make a vow to God-- then-- I would suggest to you that's-- even stronger than a handshake in Texas. (APPLAUSE)GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: The question is-- is about its relevance to the presidential race. So, let me just follow up quickly. Do you think a candidate who breaks his marital vows is more likely to break faith with voters?RICK PERRY: Well, you know, I-- I think the voters are wise enough to figure that one out. I've always kind of been of the opinion that-- if you cheat on your wife, you'll cheat on your business partner. So-- I think that-- issue of fidelity is-- important. I mean, it's-- it-- it's a characteristic of which people look at-- individuals, whether it's in their business lives or whether it's in their personal lives, or whether it's pickin' someone that-- served-- in public office for them.Individuals who have been-- fidelit-- in-- in fidelity with-- with their spouse-- I think that sends a very powerful message. If you will cheat on your wife, if you will cheat on your spouse, then why wouldn't you cheat on your business partner or why wouldn't you cheat on anybody for that matter?GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Santorum, you ran this week, last Sunday, and you-- summed up your position of character counts. You said this is relevant as well.RICK SANTORUM: I-- I think character issues do count. And I think-- all-- all of-- all of your record-- personal as well as political record is there-- for the public to look at. I would not say it's a disqualifier. I wouldn't go that far. I think people make mistakes and-- you are held accountable to those mistakes and-- the public can listen to-- the circumstances and-- and make their decision.But certainly, it's a factor. And it-- and it should be a factor. You're electing a leader. You're electing someone that trust is everything, and particularly in this election. This election, the people of this-- of Iowa-- I hear this all the time. Who can we trust? And I-- I go out and talk about my record. I talk about the fact that I've been married 21 years and have seven children.I talk about the fact that I'm-- I have a record of consistent-- and-- and conservative politics. I talk about-- you know, my past. I think that's important, and for the people to go and determine whether they're trustworthy enough to earn their support.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Congressman Paul, what's your view on this?RON PAUL: You know, I think character is, obviously-- very important. I-- I don't think it should be necessary to have to talk about it. I think it should show through in the way we live. And I think it should show through in-- in a marriage. And I happen to have been married for 54 years and family person. But, I don't think we should have to talk about it. But, you know what? (UNINTEL) is-- every bit as important. It-- if your marriage vows are important, what about our oath of office? That's what really gets to me.That's where you're really on the line as a public figure. And that's where I think a lot of people come up real short. Because there's many times that I have been forced to Congress because I take my oath very seriously. I am up sometimes, believe it or not, voting all by myself (CHUCKLE) thinking that, ""Why aren't there people paying att-- why don't they read Article One, Section Eight?"" You know, if-- if we took that oath of office seriously in Washington, we'd get rid of 80% of the government.The budget would be balanced. We'd have sound money. And we would have prosperity. And we wouldn't be the policemen of the world. We wouldn't have a Federal Reserve System, and we wouldn't be invading the privacy of every single individual in this country with bills like the Patriot Act. We'd have a free society and a prosperous society. (APPLAUSE)GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Romney, you-- you chose to make your family and your faith-- the feature of your first ad here in Iowa this week. Why?MITT ROMNEY: Well, actually-- the president, President Obama's PAC-- came out with an ad attacking me-- and said that I'm-- I'm not a person of core values, I'm not-- I don't have a core. And we said-- you know in my prior campaigns I've come out with ads that show who I am and why I've gotten in this race. And that relates to my family and my kids. I'm really concerned about America. I think the issue people have to concentrate on is-- is, ""Who can lead America to a place where we-- we don't become a Greece or an Italy?""Because, frankly, that's the path we're on. That's where we're going. Who can make sure that America's values, our merit-based society, continues to be the-- the hallmark of what allows our economy to create jobs? Who can make sure that it's good to be middle class in America again? Who can make sure that America is the job-creating engine it once w-- once was? Who can make sure that the kids going to school know that when they get outta school, they're gonna have a job waiting for them that meets the-- the-- the kinda skills that they've created?I-- I believe I'm that person. And-- and part of my motivation for doing those things is I love this country, I love the values of this country, a-- and I wanna make sure that-- that my kids and my grandkids, and I have quite a few of them, 16, that they have an America that's as prosperous as the America that I've enjoyed and just as free.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I wanna get-- Congressman-- Congresswoman Bachmann and then Speaker Gingrich, you wrap this up.MICHELE BACHMANN: Well, the founders spoke about this. And the question was asked, ""What is it that we need to have in the president?"" And they wrote in the Federalist Papers. They didn't look at wealth. They didn't look at education. They didn't look at position. (COUGH) They looked at just one issue. And it was, ""What's the measure of a man? Or, what's the measure of a woman, in our case, for being the next president of the United States. Will they keep their word? Will they be a man or woman of integrity?"" That's what they cared about.That was more important than anything else. And I think-- here in Iowa, that's what I've seen. That is also what people care about. Who are you, really? What is your center? What's your core? What's your world view? What drives you? And so people want to know, ""What's your faith?"" I'm-- I'm a Christian. I'm-- I'm unashamed and unapologetic about that. I have a strong faith. I made a proclamation of my faith in Christ when I was 16. And I don't mind if people ask me those questions or ask me about my husband or our family. I'm happy to talk about that, because after all, people (COUGH) need to take the measure of the man or the measure of the woman when they make that decision.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Speaker Gingrich, what do voters need to know about this issue from your perspective?NEWT GINGRICH: Well, (CLEARS THROAT) first of all, I think it is a real issue. And people have to look at the person whom they're gonna loan the presidency. And they have the-- they have the right to ask every single question. They have to have a feeling that this is a person that they can trust with the level of power we give to the presidency. And I think it's a very, very important issue. And I think people have to render judgment. In my case, I've said up-front openly I've made mistakes at times. I've had to go to God for forgiveness. I've had to seek reconciliation. But I'm also a 68-year-old grandfather. And I think people have to measure who I am now and whether I'm a person they can trust. And all I can tell you is that, you know, I am-- delighted at the way people have been willing to look at who I am, to look at what my record has been, and the amount of support we're getting from the American people and from all across the State of Iowa, the number of people who have supported-- the candidacy of real change and a record of real change.DIANE SAWYER: And I'd like to turn now, if we can, to the issue of immigration. And so many people talk about it in their living room, talk about it around their dinner tables at night-- if I can. And can we just do one thing for the interest of time? Can we stipulate that every single person on this stage tonight has said the number one thing to do is secure the borders, secure the borders, secure the borders, secure the borders. You may have slightly different prescriptions to do it. But, we stipulate that, that that's what you all want to do first.I'd like to turn, now, the question, the 11 million undocumented people in this country. And Speaker Gingrich, I'm gonna come back to you because you have talked about citizen review boards to review individual cases, that treated them in individual basis. You-- you've-- you mentioned the fact that someone who's been here 25 years, served the community, should get special consideration under this board. How many years is the threshold for your-- is it five years-- has served the community under the criteria that you've set out before, five years also a candidate?NEWT GINGRICH: I think, first of all, that anybody you would apply to a-- the citizen review board idea came out of a selective service model. It was used as draft boards in World War II. We relied on the local citizens to render judgment about who oughta be deferred, who oughta be drafted. Did they have local knowledge? That's the starting point.Second, I started wi-- with-- with cases that I think are very hard to-- to argue about. Someone who's been here 25 years, somebody who has been a good local citizen, may well belong to your church, has children and grandchildren in the United States, and I will just say flatly, I do not believe the people of the United States are gonna send the police in to rip that kinda person out and ship them outta this country, (COUGH) particularly because those are precisely the people that end up in churches as sanctuaries.And I think we oughta be honest about that. I think most of the workers who are here who have no ties to us should go home immediately. I think we should make deportation dramatically easier. This is, I think frankly we oughta make English the official language of government. And we oughta have an effective guest worker program with very severe penalties for those employers who hire people illegally.DIANE SAWYER: But, the Pew Center for Hispanic Center, as you know, has said that maybe 3.5 million people could come under the criteria that you laid out.NEWT GINGRICH: I-- I don't think there's 3.5 million people who've been here 25 years.DIANE SAWYER: But they're talking about people who have been here 15 years. 15 years.NEWT GINGRICH: Well, I wasn't. They were. You used a number that doesn't relate to my proposal.DIANE SAWYER: But, under the criteria that you have set out, do you have a threshold on the number of people you would consider before the review board?NEWT GINGRICH: Well, I-- that's why you have the citizen review panel. The per-- the person has to have been here 25 years, have genuine ties to the community, be a good citizen, and have an American family sponsor them. And they still don't get citizenship. This is not amnesty. They get residency. And they pay a penalty in order to get residency.DIANE SAWYER: Okay, I'm gonna turn it to k-- to Governor Romney because we heard Speaker Gingrich say we're not gonna round people up and deport them. And I think at one point-- you said something similar in a meeting at Bloomberg that-- that they're not going to be tracking everybody down and moving them out. And yet, to our colleague David Muir-- wanna try to clarify something. You said, ""You seem to indicate that people should go back home to their country."" And in some cases it may mean as much as five years if they get at the back of the line or more. Are you saying-- how many people should be sent back home to their countries? Should they be tracked down to establish who they are, sent back home to their country?MITT ROMNEY: I-- I believe that any time that we start talking about a-- a form of amnesty, whether it's technically amnesty or not, when we start talking about how people have been able to come here and stay illegally for some period of time, that they're gonna be able to stay here permanently and become a permanent resident of the United States with-- with rights to our education system, our health care system, and so forth, we will then create another magnet that draws people into our country illegally.So, the right course for us is to, once again, talk about what you described. Secure the border. Once we do that, we can start talking about the 11 million or whatever number that may be that are in the country illegally. My own view is those 11-- 11 million people should register the fact that they're here in the country. They should be given some transition period of time to allow them to-- settle their affairs and then return home and get in the-- in line at the back of the line with everybody else that wants to come here.Don't forget, when we talk about-- about-- the difficulty of people going home, there are millions of people who-- many of whom have relatives here in this country who are in line, who want to come here. I want to bring people into this country who have skill, experience, family here who want to draw them in. I do not want to do something. (NOISE) I do not want to do something which encourages another wave of illegal immigration. So, from my view-- viewpoint, the key-- the key measure is this: No favoritism for permanent residency or citizenship for those that have come here illegally.DIANE SAWYER: So, you've said all 11 million. If I could Governor Perry-- there is a case or there are a number of these cases of-- of people who have signed up for the military, the U.S. military, who have been undocumented but nonetheless go and sign up. What should happen with them?GOVERNOR RICK PERRY: Well, let me-- address the issue that you asked from the start, and obviously securing that border is the-- is the key. And any of these conversations that we're having now are nothing more than intellectual-- discussions until you secure that border.But if this country would simply enforce the laws that are already on the book, you think about all of the laws that we have that are already out there, laws that clearly saw-- that-- that, ""Here are punishments,"" and, ""Here's what will happen."" If this country would simply enforce the laws that we have on the book-- I will tell you one thing: As the president of the United States, you will not see me sending my Justice Department to sue states like Arizona that are havin' to sovereign rights, I think, put in jeopardy by our Justice Department.You will not see a catch and release program like this administration has today th-- where people who are caught who are illegally in this country, and because they haven't been (RUSTLING) caught in a violent situation, they're released. Released into the general population. That's the problem that we've got in this country.I would suggest to you we spend time with the laws that we've got on the book being enforced, we'll have a substantial smaller number of people of which we're gonna have to make decisions about at that particular point in time. And then we can have a legitimate conversation about immigration reform.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I wanna change subjects now because-- (APPLAUSE) foreign policy was-- Speaker Gingrich caused something of a stir overnight in the Middle East with comments he made in interview with the Jewish channel in which he called the Palestinians an invented people. And-- I just wondered-- G-- Congressman Paul, if I can start with you: Do you agree with that characterization, that the Palestinians are an invented people?CONGRESSMAN RON PAUL: N-- no, I don't agree with that. And that's just stirrin' up trouble. And I-- I believe in a non-interventionist foreign policy. I don't think we should get in the middle of these squabbles. But to go out of our way and say that so-and-so is not a real people? Technically and historically, yes-- you know, under the Ottoman Empire, the Palestinians didn't have a state, but neither did Israel have a state then too.But this is how we get involved in so many messes. And I think it just fails on the side of-- practicing a little bit of diplomacy, getting ourselves (LAUGH) into trouble mentioning things that are unnecessary. The people in those regions should be dealing with these problems; we shouldn't be dealing with these things.But-- historically, it-- it-- you know, under the Ottoman Empire, that i-- that is-- technically-- correct. But to make these decisions in deciding what the settlement's going to be should be the people that are involved. This idea that we can be the policemen of the world and settle all these disputes, I mean, soon we'll have to quit because we're flat out broke. But we-- we cannot continue to get into these issues like this and-- and-- and-- and getting ourselves into more trouble.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Speaker Gingrich, as I've said, this has caused quite a reaction in-- in the Middle East. The chief Palestinian negotiator, Sa-- Saeb Erekat, said, ""Mark my words: These statements of Gingrich will be the ammunition and weapons of the bin Ladens and the extremists for a long, long time.""SPEAKER NEWT GINGRICH: How would he know the difference? Look from historic, George, simply. Is-- is what I said factually correct? Yes. Is it historically true? Yes. Are we in a situation where every day, rockets are fired into Israel while the United States, the current administration, tries to pressure the Israelis into a peace process?Hamas does not admit the-- the right of Israel to exist, and says publicly, ""Not a single Jew will remain."" The Palestinian Authority ambassador to India said last month, ""There is no difference between Fatah and Hamas. We both agree Israel has no right to exist.""Somebody oughta have the courage to tell the truth: These people are terrorists. They teach terrorism in their schools. They have textbooks that say, ""If there are 13 Jews and nine Jews are killed, how many Jews are left?"" We pay for those textbooks through our aid money. It's fundamentally-- time for somebody to have the guts to stand up and say, ""Enough lying about the Middle East.""GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Romney, (APPLAUSE) you just heard the Speaker say he was just telling the truth. Do you take any issue with that characterization of the Palestinians as an invented people?GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: I-- I happen to agree with-- with most of what the speaker said, except by going down and saying the Palestinians are an invented people. That I think was a mistake on the speaker's part. I-- I think-- you-- you-- I think the speaker would probably suggest that as well. I-- I don't think we want to--(SPEAKER NEWT GINGRICH: UNINTEL)GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: Maybe not. I-- (LAUGHTER) I think we're very wise to stand with our friends, Israel, and not get out ahead of them. This president decided he was gonna try and negotiate for Israel by sayin', ""Let's go back to the '67 borders."" That's not what Israel wanted to h-- hear.They-- Israel does not want us to make it more difficult for them to sit down with the Palestinians. Ultimately, the Palestinians and the Israelis are gonna have to agree on how they're gonna settle the-- the differences between them. And the United States--GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: --and the-- and the United States of America should not jump ahead of Bibi Netanyahu and say something that makes it more difficult for him to-- to do his job. My view is this: We stand with the Israeli people. We link arms with them. If we disagree with them, like this president has time and time again, we don't do it in public like he's done it, we do it in private.And we let the Israeli leadership describe what they believe the right course is going forward. We don't negotiate for the Israeli people. We stand with the Israeli people, stand with our friends, and make it very clear: We are gonna t-- we're gonna tell the truth, but we're not gonna throw incendiary words into a-- a place which is-- a boiling pot when our friends the Israelis would probably say, ""What in the world are you doin'?""GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: So there you have it, Mr. Speaker. He says this is gonna make life more difficult for the Israelis.SPEAKER NEWT GINGRICH: The Israelis are getting rocketed every day. The-- we're not making life more difficult. The Obama administration's making life more difficult. The fact is, the Palestinian claim to a right of return is based on a historically false story. Somebody oughta have the courage to go all the way back to the 1921 League of Nations mandate for a Jewish homeland, point out the context in which Israel came into existence, and ""Palestinian"" did not become a common term until after 1977. This is a propaganda war in which our side refuses to engage. And we refuse to tell the truth when the other side lies. And you're not gonna win the long run if you're afraid to stand firm and stand for the truth.GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: Of course you s-- of course you stand firm, and stand for the truth. But you don't speak for Israel.SPEAKER NEWT GINGRICH: I didn't.GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: If-- if-- if-- if Bibi Netanyahu wants to say what you said, let him say it. But our ally, b-- the-- the people of Israel, should be able to take their own positions and not have us negotiate for them.DIANE SAWYER: I want to turn, if I can, to--SPEAKER NEWT GINGRICH: But can-- can I just say one last thing? Because I didn't speak for the people of Israel. I spoke as a historian who's looked at the world stage for a very long time. I've known Bibi since 1984. I feel quite confident an amazing number of Israelis found it nice to have an American tell the truth about the war they are in the middle of and the casualties they're taking and the people who surround them who say, ""You do not have the right to exist, and we want to destroy you.""GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: I-- I've known-- I've-- (APPLAUSE) I've also known Bibi Netanyahu for a long time. We worked together at-- at Boston Consulting Group. And the last thing Bibi Netanyahu needs to have is not just a person who's an historian, but somebody who is also running for president of the United States, stand up and say things that create extraordinary tumult in-- in his neighborhood.DIANE SAWYER: Congresswoman--GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: And I'm president of the United States, I will exercise sobriety, care, stability. And make sure that in a setting like this, anything I say that can affect a place with-- with rockets going in, with people dying, I don't do anything that would harm that-- that process.And therefore, before I made a statement of that nature, I'd get on the phone to my friend Bibi Netanyahu and say, ""Would it help if I said this? What would you like me to do? Let's work together, because we're partners."" I'm not a bomb thrower, rhetorically or literally.DIANE SAWYER: Under the rules, we need-- your response. (APPLAUSE)SPEAKER NEWT GINGRICH: I think sometimes it is helpful to have a president of the United States with the courage to tell the truth, just as was Ronald Reagan who went around his entire national security apparatus to call the Soviet Union an evil empire and who overruled his entire State Department in order to say, ""Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall."" Reagan believed the power of truth restated the world and reframed the world. I am a Reaganite, I'm proud to be a Reaganite. I will tell the truth, even if it's at the risk of causing some confusion sometimes with the timid.GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: I think it's important (APPLAUSE)--GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Who's got the better of this argument, Congresswoman Bachmann? Who's got the better of this argument?CONGRESSWOMAN MICHELE BACHMANN: Who has the better of this argument?GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Yeah. (LAUGHTER)CONGRESSWOMAN MICHELE BACHMANN: In 1974, I went to Israel for the first time and I worked on a kibbutz for the summer. And I saw a brand new nation that had begun in 1948 and was making its way into the modernization that we know today. They're a first world nation. I was able to return as a member of Congress multiple times, and I also met with Fayad in Ramallah in the very room that Arafat used as his conference room. When I was in there, I-- I had asked Fayad about the issue that we were very concerned about, and that's how the Palestinians teach their children to hate the Jews and call them pigs and swine and descendants from Hades.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Okay, but do you think--CONGRESSWOMAN MICHELE BACHMANN: And I-- and let me finish--(OVERTALK)CONGRESSWOMAN MICHELE BACHMANN: And I have asked him about this very important issues, because how do you find peace when you continue to teach your children hatred? And asked Fayad about this issue, and he said, ""Oh, tha-- we don't do that anymore. Our textbooks aren't filled with that.""And I said, ""Oh really?"" I pulled out a manila envelope that I'd brought with me, and I pulled out the pages that I'd photocopied out of current books that were being used that clearly showed that. And he said, ""Oh, but these are old textbooks."" And he said-- I said, ""Really? Well, then why don't you send me the new textbooks that no longer say that and compare them with the old?"" And I checked my mailbox today; he still hasn't me those textbooks. That's what needs to change.DIANE SAWYER: Senator Santorum, let me put to you George's question. Who's got the better of the argument?SENATOR RICK SANTORUM: Well, I-- I think you have to speak the truth-- but you have to do so with prudence. I mean, it's-- it's a combination. Th-- and, you know, I-- I-- I sat there and I listened to both of 'em; I thought they both had-- made excellent points.But we're in a real-life situation. This isn't an academic exercise. We've got-- we have a-- we have an ally, and the policy of this country should be to stand shoulder to shoulder with our ally. And-- we-- we didn't have an ally in the Soviet Union. The only allies we had were sitting in gulags, and they desperately needed to hear the truth. And Ronald Reagan provided that truth.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: So-- so do we--SENATOR RICK SANTORUM: Here, we have--(OVERTALK)GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: --with prudence, would that be saying (NOISE) Palestinians are invented or not?SENATOR RICK SANTORUM: If I can finish my s-- comment, I'll get to that, George. (LAUGHTER) That-- that we-- we have an ally here that we have to work closely with. And I think Mitt's point was-- was the correct one. We need to be working with the Israelis to find out, you know what? Is this a wise thing for us to do, to step forward and to engage this issue? Maybe it is.My guess is, at this point in time, it's not. Not that we shouldn't tell the truth, but we should be talking to our allies. It's their fight. We are to be their ally, we're to be-- supporting them. And I'm-- I-- I've been out here very publicly-- that the Israelis have the right to determine what happens in their land. And all of Israel, including the quote-- you know, West Bank, is Israeli land. And we need to work with them as to the solution that works best for our ally.DIANE SAWYER: Governor Perry, close this--GOVERNOR RICK PERRY: Let me--DIANE SAWYER: --please.GOVERNOR RICK PERRY: --just say that I think this is a minor issue-- that the media is blowing-- way out of proportion. We have a president of the United States who has put the most muddled foreign policy in place that is causing the problems in the Middle East. Whether it goes back to two thousand and-- and-- nine when we had an opportunity to impact Iran, whether it has been the way that-- he stood back in Egypt and did not try to negotiate people who would come in that w-- could work with us, and now we have radical Islamists as the head of Egypt, whether it was leading from the rear, if you will, in-- in Libya.The idea that this president now, with Iran getting one of our predator drones in their possession, and he had two opportunities-- well, he didn't have two opportunities, he had two choices-- actually, he had three. And he chose the worst.And those two opportunities he had was to either retrieve that drone, or to destroy it, and he did the worst of the three and he did absolutely nothing. And the Russians and the Chinese will have our highly technical equipment now. This president is the problem, not something that Newt Gingrich said. (APPLAUSE)DIANE SAWYER: We have to take a break right now, and I just want to say that we have a partner in all of this, which of course is Yahoo. I want to put up a question which we want to address when we come back about the struggles of the middle class in this country. And we have a question on Yahoo about the last time those of you had a personal financial strain that forced you to cut back on a necessity, as so many people in the middle class say they do. What were the consequences you fa-- you faced, and will you weigh in on that? And that's when we come back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) (MUSIC)(REVIEW CLIPS NOT TRANSCRIBED)ANNOUNCER: Live from Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, once again, Diane Sawyer and George Stephanopoulos.DIANE SAWYER: And we welcome all of you back and, again, we thank the Republican candidates for president of the United States for debating here tonight. I'm gonna return to the Yahoo question, which brings the struggles of the middle class down to something personal for everyone who is behind a podium up there.And here's what it said: ""Many of us are forced to make cuts to continue necessities such as mortgage payments, groceries, transportation to work, and health care."" And then the question continues, they want to know, ""When is the last time you had a personal financial strain that forced you, not only to give up a luxury, but also to cut back on necessity? And what were the consequences you faced?"" This is from Andrew in Texas. And I'd like to start, Governor Perry, with you.GOVERNOR RICK PERRY: Well, obviously-- growin' up where I grew up-- there were some people that probably said-- as a matter of fact, I was on-- radio station here, WHO-- yesterday and-- and talked about my upbringing. And-- growin' up in a house that didn't have-- running water until I was five or six years old and-- and my mother-- sewin' my own clothes for me till I went off to college.And-- the idea that-- luxury really wasn't in my lexicon. But as I grew and as I-- went off and flew in the United States Air Force and I came back home, and as a 27-year-old boy-- well, I was a m-- grown man by then-- but I didn't have anything-- I-- my social security-- has a zero in 1978. So I'm sure I was givin' up some things that other people would consider to be luxuries.But the fact is-- I've never had a time in my life when I felt like that I gave anything up that I didn't have everything I needed. And-- I know there are people that are-- that are suffering in America today, and that's the reason we need to get this country back working and having people so that they can have a job. And the policies that I've laid out, and the record that I've had in the State of Texas for the last decade, clearly gives that record to the people of this country.DIANE SAWYER: Again, we just want to remind you that, when the red comes up, you-- the rules that were agreed on here. I'll do the two governors; Governor Romney grew up in very different circumstances. What about this question?GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: I didn't grow up poor. And if somebody is looking for someone who's grown up with that background, I'm-- I'm not the person. But I-- but I grew up with a dad who'd been poor, and my dad wanted to make sure I understood the lessons of hard work. And my mom and dad wanted to make sure that I understood the principles that made America the greatest nation on earth.And so they made sure we had jobs as we were growing up. They made sure we didn't spend money foolishly. And they made sure that I had-- a care and concern for other people. I was able to serve my church overseas, and to-- to meet people there that had very difficult circumstances in their life. I also spent time in this country, serving as a pastor in my-- in my church, and again, having the occasion to work with people that were really struggling. I saw marriages under great stress.You see, when-- when people lose jobs, marriages get strained, people's health gets affected-- people become depressed. And-- and I'm in this race, not-- not because I grew up without means, but because I understand what it takes to get America working again. And I love this country enormously and understand the principles and understand the specifics that it takes to get America creating jobs again. That's why I'm in the race.DIANE SAWYER: And Congressman Paul, what does this question evoke? How much does it matter to have personal experience?CONGRESSMAN RON PAUL: Well-- I feel very fortunate because-- although I was raised in-- in a system that-- in a family that was rather poor, but we-- (LAUGH) I didn't even know it. You know, it was durin' the Depression and World War II, and we didn't have very much, and I worked my way through college, and that was a natural instinct because that's what you were supposed to do. But-- I-- I-- I finally-- did a little bit better in medical school because I had my wife work our way through cool-- (LAUGH) medical school. (LAUGHTER) So that worked out a little bit better.But middle class is suffering, but not only because we bale out the rich and dump on the poor and they lose their jobs and they lose their houses, but there's a characteristic about monetary policy. When a country destroys its currency, it transfers wealth from the middle class to the wealthy, and this is what you're seeing today: the elimination of the middle class. And going to get a lot worse unless we address the subject overspending, over-borrowing, and printing too much money, and understanding the business cycle.DIANE SAWYER: Senator Santorum. (APPLAUSE)SENATOR RICK SANTORUM: I c-- I can say that I grew up in a very modest home and was very blessed to have-- all my basic needs met. And one of the most basic needs and the most important one that I've learned was that I was blessed to have a mother and a father. That was the most important gift that I was given, that I had two parents who were together, who loved me, who supported me and made me feel safe. And made the-- the-- the little things that no one would consider luxuries today feel like luxuries because I had that sense of security.Unfortunately, America, we see the family continuing to break down. And with that, the economic status of those families. Single-parent households in America now have poverty levels approaching 40%. So-- you not only have the lack of security and stability in so many cases, because moms are doin' heroic work tryin' to hold things together, but it's hard.And so what we can do as a federal government, we can do more importantly as the leader of this country, to try to promote this institution of marriage. Try to promote the family and try to nurture this environment that we have to-- to make sure that families are elevated and supported and fathers and mothers are there to take care of their families and-- and-- and-- and be there for their children. That's the most important luxury, is a mom and a dad.DIANE SAWYER: And Congresswoman Bachmann, someone said recently that troubled banks got a bailout, troubled homeowners got evicted. Your response on this question and the struggle for the middle class.CONGRESSWOMAN MICHELE BACHMANN: Well, I opposed the $700 bailout for Wall Street because Wall Street rolled the dice and they made some very foolish decisions. They were only too happy to pocket profits when times were good, but when times went south and things got sour then they decided to socialize their losses. And the-- American taxpayer was only too good to bail them out.There's people on this stage that-- supported that bailout; I didn't. Behind closed doors, I took on the Treasury secretary, Hank Paulson; I took on my own president because I knew this was going to be a very bad deal.You'd asked the question about luxuries and where we come from. I was born here in Iowa to a middle-class family, but my family went through a tragedy that millions of families go through: My folks got divorced. And when it happened, my mom found herself a single mom who'd been a full-time homemaker, she had four kids. We went to below poverty overnight. And when I was 13, I had to start getting a job to help out the family.I know what the-- it's like for single moms to struggle. And throughout most of our marriage, we're still coupon clippers today. We still go to consignment stores today. We get what that feels like. And I think it's important for the next president of the United States to be in touch with what real people struggle with across the country, and I have.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Speaker Gingrich? (APPLAUSE)SPEAKER NEWT GINGRICH: Well, let me say first of all, the-- that-- when I was young, we lived-- in an apartment above a gas station on the square in Holmestown (PH), Pennsylvania. I had relatives who were steel workers, others who were delivery men, some who worked in department stores. My dad was in the Army and we'd moved around, and he lived on the pay of a junior officer. By the time-- it was fairly frugal, but you-- you didn't feel desperate.Today, I've had several relatives in the last three years who've been out of work, who've had to go through very difficult times. My wife Callista runs Gingrich Productions as a company. It's a very small company, does basically movies and books and things like that. We have to meet a payroll. We have to find markets. We have to find-- you know-- d-- well, do-- do everything that small businesses go through. And I know how difficult this economy is at a practical level if you're a small business.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I wanna stick with Yahoo because as you-- we said at the start, we're getting real-time feedback from our Yahoo audience. Over 12,000 people have already weighed in on Yahoo and ABCNews.com. An-- and this is directed at-- at Speaker Gingrich and-- and-- and Governor Romney, because more than 72% say right now they want to hear more from you about your past support for health care mandates.That's something that they're still not fully satisfied with what they've heard-- (NOISE) from you. And-- and Speaker Gingrich-- I mean, Governor Romney, let me begin with you because-- you were clear. You've said you've always been against a federal mandate; you supported it in the State of Massachusetts. Where there has been some ambiguity, at least in the past, is whether you think that other states should try the mandate. Back in 2007, you said that you thought it would be good for most states to try it; now you say you wouldn't encourage other states to try. Can you explain that?GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: States can do whatever the heck they want to do; that's the great thing about-- (APPLAUSE) about our system. I-- I think there's a good deal that we did that people can look at and find as a model, that could--GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: The mandate?GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: --help other state-- if some-- if they want to, sure. They could try what they think is best. I-- that's-- it's up to other states to try what works for them. Some will like that; some will think it's a terrible idea. We had this idea of exchanges where people could buy insurance-- from companies, private companies-- we have no government insurance, by the way, in our state. It's all-- other than the federal Medicare/Medic-- Medicaid programs. It's all private pay. So people can learn from one another.But-- but my-- (LAUGH) my plan-- was designed for our state, and other states should have the right to create plans that work for them. And if they come up with something better than we did, then we can learn from them. But the idea of a federal government or a federal mandate, as you see with Obamacare, flies in the face of the Constitution, violates the tenth amendment. I think the Supreme Court will strike it down. If they don't, I will.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Speaker Gingrich-- Congresswoman Bachmann pointed out that as-- as late as May of this year, you supported some form of the mandate when everyone else had-- had come out against it. What finally tipped you over and convinced you that it was unconstitutional?SPEAKER NEWT GINGRICH: Well, I think first of all for the federal government to do it is unconstitutional because it means the Congress-- the Congress, which could compel you to purchase this item, could compel you to purchase any item. And so the question of freedom would be d-- would be missed. And any (MIC NOISE) majority could then decide to make you do virtually anything. I think that's part of why you're seeing a dramatic shift back towards limiting the federal government and towards imposing the tenth amendment as a very serious barrier.I-- I've been working on health issues since 1974. And I've been t-- and-- and I tried to find a way to break out of where we are, because the fact is the whole third-party payment model, whether public or private, has grown more and more expensive, more and more difficult to sustain. And helped found the Center for Health Transformation that-- for that reason, wrote a book called Saving Lives and Saving Money back in 2002.We need to fundamentally rethink the entire health system to move back towards a doctor-patient relationship, and back toward something like what Rick Santorum talked about with health savings accounts where people are directly engaged in their own health and in taking care of themselves to a much greater degree than they are in the current insurance system.DIANE SAWYER: If I can switch to this question, and-- and it is about health care, because a number of people-- in fact, I was just at a pharmacy here-- I-- have a cough. But I was (LAUGH) at the pharmacy here in Iowa, and the pharmacists were talking about a big-- driver of health care costs. And they specifically mentioned habits, unhealthy habits that we all need to learn to be better on at a young age. They talked about obesity, they talked about exercise. If I can ask you, Congressman Paul: Anything government should do on these fronts?CONGRESSMAN RON PAUL: On-- on medical? Or?DIANE SAWYER: On these fronts, specifically, of healthy behavior at very young-- ages for-- it's--CONGRESSMAN RON PAUL: No, essentially not, but they have to be-- a referee. If people are doing things that hurt other people, yes. But if you embark on instituting a society where government protects you from yourself, you're in big trouble, and that's what they're doing. (APPLAUSE)I think-- I think what we've had here is a demonstration of-- why should we have a candidate that's gonna have to explain themselves? 70% of the people want further explanations on what your positions are. So I think that it is endless. But you talk about the-- the Obamacare using force, but that's all government is, is force.I mean, do you have a choice about paying Medicare taxes? So there's not a whole of different-- you're forced to buy insurance. That's one step further. But you have to stop with force. Once government uses force to mold behavior or mold the economy, they've overstepped the bounds and they've violated the whole concept of our revolution and our Constitution. (APPLAUSE)GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: We-- we are running short on time. I just want to ask quickly, does anyone disagree with the first part of Congressman Paul's answer there, where he said the government really shouldn't be getting involved in these broader issues of behavior?GOVERNOR RICK PERRY: Listen, I happen to think that the states-- that's their call, not the federal government. The states should be able to make decisions on whether they-- Terry, you probably have some programs here-- in Iowa to get--(MALE VOICE: UNINTEL)GOVERNOR RICK PERRY: There you go. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) So-- it-- it-- it should be their call. But listen, this goes back, and-- and-- and Congressman Paul and I, you know, we disagree from time to time. But the real issues that we have in this country are that people are sick of Washington, D.C. They're sick of the money that they're seeing spent, they're sick of the fraud and the corruption that they're seeing.They're sick of seeing their-- their kids' futures mortgaged because we've got a Washington, D.C., that is out of touch with the country. It's the reason, when I talk about my overhauling Washington plan, and I've gotten a pretty good response across the country when I talk about goin' to a part-time Congress. Cut their pay in half, let 'em spend half the time in Washington, D.C. Send 'em back home to have a regular job like the rest of the people in their districts, and work under the laws that they pass. That I will suggest to you, along with a balanced budget amendment to the United States Congress, will go a long way toward stoppin' a lot of the nonsense that we're seeing comin' out of Washington--GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Now, it was Governor--GOVERNOR RICK PERRY: --D.C.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: --Branstad who said this is the-- healthiest--CONGRESSWOMAN MICHELE BACHMANN: Healthiest--GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: --state in the nation, and we will return to the healthiest state in the nation in just a minute.ANNOUNCER: (MUSIC) You're watching live ABC News coverage of the Iowa Republican Party debate.ANNOUNCER: Live from Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. Once again, Diane Sawyer and George Stephanopoulos.DIANE SAWYER: And George and I were just talking about the fact, the question we get so often is, why can't people who disagree show respect for each other, and can we all work together, even people who disagree, to move the country forward? And so--GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: So we're-- in form of closing, still we just want each of you, you're running against each other. But in these last few minutes, and just think of a minute where we will not run over to commercial, (LAUGH) tell us the one thing you've learned from someone else, one of your challengers, on stage. Senator Santorum?RICK SANTORUM: Well, I'll-- I'll go back to-- you know, the comment I made earlier. I mean, I-- when I was first running for office-- you know, Newt Gingrich was the guy that-- who's-- who's tapes I've listened to as a young man-- and tryin' to-- at 30 years old, deciding to run for Congress. He laid out-- a vision for conservative governance that-- that I-- adopted and-- and ran with in a very, very tough Congressional district outside of suburban Pittsburgh, so tough that no one gave me a chance of winnin' it.Fact, election night the Wall Street Journal called the Republican National Committee to find out the name of the guy that won. And they didn't even know my name at the RNC. (LAUGHTER) That's a true story. And-- and you don't get a lotta true stories. But that's a true story. And-- and so, you know-- I-- I came out of the blue as a conservative.Think that's, again, the-- the thing that distinguishes me. I-- I've run as a conservative in a 60% Democratic district and won in a 70% Democratic district and won in the State of Pennsylvania with almost a million more Republicans than Democrats and won. I defeated an incumbent and-- and won again. And-- in a year that George Bush lost the election by five, I won by six. And-- and I stuck by the conservative principles that Newt outlined in the-- in the late '80s. And-- and it's always served me well. I've been a consistent conservative.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Perry?RICK PERRY: I'd say-- Congressman Paul got me really intrigued with the whole-- the federal reserve. And I've spent a substantial amount of time reading about and Currency Wars, the book by James Rickards that-- but Congressman Paul is-- is-- is the individual in the stage that got me most interested in-- in a subject that I found to be quite interesting and at the root of a lotta the problems that we have. And I thank you for that. But the one thing that I found-- outside of-- of these fine-- individuals on this stage is that the people of this country, the people of this country really want to get America back on track.And Ri-- Congressman Keane, whether it's somebody like you and-- and your Idea Act that-- that we talked about the other day-- there are really good men and women in this country that wanna get this country back headed down a track. And they understand, Michele, just as you've said, that this election is about the future of this country. One of the most important elections, if not the most important election, and we gotta get it right.DIANE SAWYER: Over to you, Governor Romney. (APPLAUSE)MITT ROMNEY: I-- I always find-- the principle of leadership to be most interesting. And-- and as I look at the people on this stage, each exhibits different qualities of leadership. And they've each exercised leadership in different ways. Wha-- one of the about Ron Paul that always-- amazes me is when I come to a debate like this, the only signs I see are the Ron Paul people out there-- (LAUGHTER) in freezing. (APPLAUSE)In freezing temperatures, they're always there. He ignites an enthusiasm with a number of people. That's very exciting to watch. In choosing a president, it-- it's the qualities of leadership that are gonna make the difference. Because our positions on issues are-- are-- are important, of course.And I happen to think I've got the right positions on issues, of course. Or I wouldn't have 'em. But-- but fundamentally-- we know that down the road what's gonna de-- determine who is a great president or not is-- is their qualities of leadership in getting America back on track. And-- and-- and I believe-- right now-- and just as-- as Governor Perry just said, this is the time for real leadership because this country is going in a very dangerous direction. This is a time where America has got to return to principles that will keep us the hope of the earth and-- and the shining city on the hill. That light from that shining city has dimmed over the last three years. And I will help restore it. (APPLAUSE)GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Mister speaker.NEWT GINGRICH: Well, I-- I wanna say two people, one on the stage and one not. Governor Terry Branstad is my role model. Get outta politics for a while doin' something else, be involved in health care, (LAUGHTER) come back when you're clearly too old, too experienced, too tied to the past, win the governorship decisively, do a great job. (CHEERS) (APPLAUSE)And the-- the other-- I just wanna say two other people very briefly. Rick Perry got me engaged about three years ago on this whole tenth amendment in a big, serious way. And I think that he is-- he h-- he has helped ignite a fire that is gonna change America. And Rick Santorum's consistency and courage on Iran has been a hallmark of why, if we do survive, it will be in part because of people like Rick who've had the courage to te-- tell the truth about the Iranians for a long time. (APPLAUSE)RON PAUL: Well, I have learned that you should never give up on your opposition. Because if you're persistent, (LAUGH) and you present your case, they will come your way. So Rick, I appreciate it. (LAUGHTER) Rick, I appreciate it. (UNINTEL) appreciate it. You're open to the federal reserve. That's wonderful. But I-- I work from the assumption that freedom brings people together.And if you understand freedom, it's based on tolerance and nonviolence. So if it's tolerance, it should be bringing all kinds of people together and that's following our Constitution. And we shouldn't be fighting among ourselves. Because we shouldn't be fighting in Washington if we all take the same oath of office. Where does the fight come from? Somebody is messin' up somewhere. (LAUGHTER) So-- so I say that with persistence, I think that we can all prevail and come up with the right answers. (APPLAUSE)(OFF-MIC CONVERSATION)MICHELE BACHMANN: Well, I would agree with everything that's been said here tonight. But I would also add again, someone that I mentioned a little bit earlier and that was Herman Cain. Herman Cain, I think when he brought up the 999 plan, and that you can't have a debate without saying ""999"" in the debate, I think one thing that he showed us is the power of being very plain spoken.And also reducing something to a very simple level so people get it. And people were very excited about that plan. Because they could understand what that meant. And I think that's a challenge for every one of us; 'cause a lotta times, you can end up sounding and talking like a big bureaucrat in Washington. People don't want that. They don't want Washington. They want outside of Washington. And rightfully so. That's why I think in this race, I'm-- I'm the proven consistent conservative and I'm gonna go with win-win-win rather than 999.DIANE SAWYER: Well again, we are at the end of the (APPLAUSE) time agreed upon by all of you, the candidates. And we thank you so much and we thank the people of Iowa, 24 days the voting begins.GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: That's the time for us. We're gonna be back with our political team for their independent analysis. We're hearing lots of opinions on Yahoo and Twitter and Facebook. We'll get to that in just a minute. (MUSIC)ANNOUNCER: Much more to come as ABC's live coverage of the Iowa Republican Party Debate continues.

In the nation as a whole, Democratic candidates for Congress won 1.1 million more votes than Republicans, according to a tally of the popular vote kept by David Wasserman, the House editor of The Cook Political Report. But Republicans maintained their control of the House â making this one of a handful of elections in the last century where the party that won the popular vote for Congress did not win control of the House. Redistricting may sound esoteric, but it can have an impact on governing at the state and federal levels. It may have played a role in Michiganâs decision to pass anti-union legislation this week, a month after Mr. Obama won the state by nine points. Michigan Republicans drew the maps in the last two cycles, and even though Republicans lost some seats last month they were able to keep their majority with 54 percent of the seats in the stateâs House of Representatives, while getting just 45 percent of the popular vote. And since redistricting gives many members of Congress less competitive, more politically homogeneous districts, it is often cited as one of the factors exacerbating political polarization â a tension can be seen in the current fiscal debate. The latest round of redistricting is not the only reason Republicans lost the popular vote but won a majority of House seats, several political scientists and analysts said. Incumbency is a powerful weapon, they noted, and Republicans went into the election with a big majority in the House. A new election process in California pitted some Democrats against one another in the general election. And a number of political scientists pointed to what Jowei Chen, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Michigan, and Jonathan Rodden, a professor of political science at Stanford University, call âunintentional gerrymanderingâ in a forthcoming paper â the natural geographic patterns that lead many Democrats to choose to live in dense, urban areas with very high concentrations of Democrats, effectively packing themselves into fewer districts. âNow, more than ever in history, Democrats are clustered in a small number of these urban districts,â Professor Chen said in an interview.

You are already subscribed to this email. But it is undeniable that redistricting played a role as well. The new lines helped Republicans maintain their control of the House, largely because they were able to add more Republican voters to districts where Republicans won close races in 2010. Michael P. Democrats also drew gerrymandered lines in states where they controlled the process, but had less of an impact over all because they had control in fewer states, said Keesha Gaskins, a senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, which has been studying the impact of redistricting. In Illinois, where Democrats drew the maps, Republican Congressional candidates won 45 percent of the popular vote but only a third of the House seats. And in Maryland, Republicans won 35 percent of the votes but just 13 percent of the seats. An analysis by the Brennan Center found that the new lines that took effect this year may have changed which party won in at least 25 House districts this year, and that they helped Republicans win a net gain of six more seats than they would have won under the old maps. One particularly striking finding in their analysis highlights the power that comes with drawing the maps. In states where Republicans controlled the process, it found, their candidates won roughly 53 percent of the vote â and 72 percent of the seats. And in the states where Democrats controlled the process, their candidates won about 56 percent of the vote and 71 percent of the seats. An analysis by The New York Times of states where courts, commissions or divided governments drew the maps found a much smaller disparity between the share of the popular vote and the number of seats won in Congress. In those states, the analysis found, Democrats won slightly more than half the vote and 56 percent of the seats, while Republicans won 46 percent of the vote and 44 percent of the seats. A flavor of the politics behind the process in Ohio can be found in the exhibits of a lawsuit that challenged the new districts for state lawmakers. Ohio Republicans â who attended a training session on redistricting with a PowerPoint slide that counseled âKeep it secret, keep it safeâ â ran their redistricting operation from a room at a DoubleTree Hotel in Columbus that staff members sometimes called âthe bunkerâ in e-mails. The e-mails show that the Republicans drawing the maps paid close attention to the percentage of the vote Republicans got in past elections in each district. Ohioâs Republican-friendly districts for state lawmakers were upheld last month by the Supreme Court of Ohio, which ruled in a 4-to-3 decision that the stateâs Constitution does ânot explicitly require political neutrality, or for that matter, politically competitive districts or representational fairness, in the apportionment boardâs creation of state legislative districtsâ as long as the other legal requirements are met. Dr. McDonald, of George Mason University, said redistricting could have ramifications for the country, because as members of Congress are drawn into less-competitive districts, they may have less incentive to compromise. âTheyâre safe in their districts in the House of Representatives,â he said.

This is the second part in a two-part series on the race for California's 7th Congressional District. Read Part 1: Jones, BeraÂ Speak On Issues In Race For 7th Congressional DistrictÂ Democratic incumbent Ami Bera is being challenged for the 7th Congressional seat by Sacramento Sheriff Scott Jones, who is a Republican. Both men have faced controversy during their campaigns.Before Scott Jones became Sheriff, four female deputies sued the department for incidents of harassment and retaliation for whistleblowing. In support of that lawsuit, a female deputy alleged an ""inappropriate"" but consensual relationship with Jones while he was in a position of authority.Â The county lost the lawsuit and Jonesâ reputation took a hit. But, he denies the allegations and says there was no relationship.""I've conducted myself with integrity and ethics my entire career and these allegations that supposedly happened 13 years ago, but were never brought up until in this lawsuit a year or so ago, were found by two separate judges to not have Merit...""Bera was investigated when his father was caught illegally reimbursing friends and family for donations to Bera's campaigns.""The U.S. Attorney has been pretty clear that after an exhaustive investigation, neither I nor my campaign had any idea what was going on,"" says Bera. ""Look, my dad made a tragic mistake. You know, these are the consequences of it and it's a sad story. But, you know, to his credit, he admitted what he did and he has to face those consequences.""Jones responded to the conviction of Beraâs father by laying out a series of campaign finance reforms he says he would introduce if elected.""If you are the family member or related to a candidate either candidate or officeholder and you're donating. There should just be a simple check box on the form...so someone can look at an easy glance if they are a relative or family member of an office holder or a candidate.""Jones says laws should be changed to require campaigns report all donations within 24 hours and to notify people when they have donated the maximum amount allowed.Bera says he supports some campaign finance legislation.Â ""I'm a co-sponsor of the Disclose Act which would increase transparency,"" says Bera. ""I'm very much on board in terms of repealing Citizens United, get all this outside money out of campaigns and at the end of the day let's make campaigns about the people who can actually vote for you.""Bera says the election is about the economy.""You know, the Sacramento region was hit pretty hard by the recession. People are still struggling to recover. Things are a little bit better than they were 4, 6 years ago."" says Bera. ""But, as I go around and talk to folks, there's still a lot of middle-class families that are out there just working hard trying to get ahead. They've got kids on one side who may be graduating high school and want to go to college and they're struggling trying to figure out how to pay for college and then they've got aging parents as well.""In 2014, one of his deputies, Deputy Danny Oliver, and a Placer County detective, Detective Michael Davis Jr., were shot and killed. A Mexican national who had been deported four times has confessed.Jones says the killings spurred him to run for office.""For the district I think it's an opportunity for them to get representative leadership that they have not enjoyed over the last couple of terms,"" says Jones. ""You have Congressman Bera who has been largely ineffective in Congress. And I think the district deserves better and I think I can give them better.âJones wants to separate his Congressional campaign from the presidential race.""I'm running for Congress. Right? I'm running for a separate branch from the executive branch. I'm running on my own platforms,"" he says.Jones also says he has his own ideas, and own positions on issues.""My issues are out there and and well-established. So to unfairly paint either Congressman Bera for supporting Hillary or me for my willingness to vote for Donald Trump I think is a little bit unfair and I think a little bit beyond what the voters for this Congressional race actually care about,"" says Jones.Bera says Jones has already linked himself to Trump.""It's not a Donald Trump County. I mean it's not a place where Donald Trump should do well,"" says Bera. ""And that's why it was really surprising that Scott Jones came out so early in his support of Donald Trump.""Both men have been elected twice to their respective offices.Â "

Also, your primary care physician will have to admit you into a hospital -- as opposed to, oh letâs say, an emergency care doctor -- or Medicare wonât pay for it, again, because of Obamacare.Hereâs a portion of the chain email , which a reader in Northeast Portland forwarded to PolitiFact Oregon, with a plea for more information. She said it came from a friend:""Your hospital Medicare admittance has just changed under Obama Care. You must be admitted by your primary Physician in order for Medicare to pay for it! If you are admitted by an emergency room doctor it is treated as outpatient care where hospital costs are not covered. This is only the tip of the iceberg for Obama Care. Just wait to see what happens in 2013 & 2014! â¦ (ellipses)Please for the sake of many good people, please... pass this on. We all need to be informed.YOU ARE NOT GOING TO LIKE THIS...At age 76 when you most need it, you are not eligible for cancer treatment page 272.""The email goes on with a long list of other claims as assessed by a Judge David Kithil of Marble Falls, Texas. PolitiFact Oregon hopped to it.And we learned very quickly -- through the power of the Internet -- that a version of this chain email has been kicking around since 2009 , based on H.R. 3200, a 2009 bill that did not become law. Many of the claims have been debunked. In fact, FactCheck.org found just four of the 48 claims in the original email to be accurate. PolitiFact ruled two statements to be Pants on Fire. The chain email has morphed over the years, with new assertions added.As for the cancer-related statement, the email cites page 272 of H.R. 3200 to back up its assertion that seniors at 76 are not eligible for cancer treatment. Later, the email specifies that under Section 1145 of H.R. 3200, ""cancer hospital will ration care according to the patient's age.""Neither statement is accurate. There is no rationing, based on age or otherwise, on cancer treatment under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act signed into law in March 2010. Likewise, there is no rationing or cut-off age in 2009âs H.R. 3200 .H.R. 3200 contained a section on ""treatment of certain cancer hospitals ."" But the American Nurses Association described the section as ""the opposite of rationing . The section allows Medicare to pay cancer hospitals more if they are incurring higher costs."" FactCheck.org agrees with the nurses group. And again, the bill never became law.""All medically necessary treatment is covered by Medicare. Including cancer treatments, regardless of age,"" said Katherine Fitzpatrick with the Medicare Rights Center in Washington, D.C. and in New York.Yet, none of the debunking seems to matter, because four years later, the email lives on via the forward button. The Internet is unstoppable. What, we wondered, did the Texas judge think of his undying notoriety?""I wish it would die. I canât control it,"" David Kithil told PolitiFact Oregon. ""I donât know how something like that goes viral like that.""The former judge said he wrote a letter to his local newspaper in 2009, protesting the initial version of the health care act. The letter was published in the River Cities Daily Tribune , circulation 5,000. Somehow, he said, the letter was republished online. Kithil wants readers to disregard his letter as it is outdated and based on legislation that did not become law.""Iâve had calls from all over the country, 300 to 400 calls over three or four years on this,"" he said. He pleads with the callers, ""Donât pass it on. Itâs not accurate anymore. Trash it.""He says he still has problems with the Affordable Care Act, but thatâs neither here nor there.Both the Medicare Rights Center and AARP, the national organization for seniors, verified that hospital admittance has to do with billing under parts A or B of Medicare , the government health plan for seniors 65 and older. The Affordable Care Act reduces Medicare payments to hospitals with readmissions within 30 days for certain conditions , such as pneumonia, but thatâs not based on who admits the patient.Also, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid says Medicare has never covered vitamin B12 shots as a preventive benefit. Again, this isnât related to the Affordable Care Act.Older patients diagnosed with cancer need not worry that treatment will be rationed or denied under the Affordable Care Act. The claim is based on an inaccurate reading of a bill that went nowhere. We donât know where or how the specific age of 76 was added -- Kithil said he doesnât remember including a specific age in his letter.But we do know enough to rule this widely debunked and ridiculous-on-its-face statement a Pants on Fire.Advertisement"

Our politicians are stupid.KARL: Finally, can anyone step out of Trumpâs shadow? The two men flanking Trump on the debate stage, Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, did little to stand out. The two who may have helped themselves most, Senator Marco Rubio âSEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I mean how is Hillary Clinton going to lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck. I was raised paycheck to paycheck.KARL: And Ohio Governor John Kasich , who portrayed himself as an experienced, optimistic alternative to Trump.GOV. JOHN KASICH (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And for people that want to just tune him out, theyâre making a mistake. Now, heâs got his solutions. Some of us have other solutions.KARL: Whatever happens, with Trump in the rant, more people are now paying attention to this campaign than anybody could have guessed.(END VIDEOTAPE)STEPHANOPOULOS: Thanks to Jon Karl for that.And the man drawing all that attention joins us now, Donald Trump, on the phone.Good morning, Mr. Trump. Thank you for joining us.So you're hearing the rivals stepping up the rhetoric. Jeb Bush says you should apologize. Carly Fiorina had this Tweet. ""Mr. Trump, there is no excuse."" Scott Walker agrees.What's your response?DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I'll start off by saying Jeb Bush, on women's health issues, just destroyed his relationship with women, what he said a couple of days ago, if you want to really get down to the important stuff, because what he said about women and women's health issues was ridiculous. And I'm the exact opposite.And I've always had a great relationship to the women. The relationship has been amazing in terms of thousands of employees, top level employees. And, you know, George, I was one of the first people in the construction industry to put women in charge of major construction projects and my relationship has been great.Carly Fiorina, you know, she's having a lot of fun, but she doesn't discuss the fact that her tenure the Hewlett Packard was a disaster. She then run for the Senate, which nobody even talks about, and she lost in a landslide. And other than that, I wish her well. She's a very nice person.STEPHANOPOULOS: So -- so...STEPHANOPOULOS: -- so no apologies to Megyn Kelly?You don't think you said -- you -- you don't think you crossed the line there?TRUMP: No, not at all. I said -- look, she asked me a very nasty question. I have nothing against Megyn Kelly, but she asked me a very, very nasty question. And in the middle of her questioning, I brought up a statement, Rosie O'Donnell, and the entire place, it was the biggest combination of laughter and applause. The place went crazy. Interrupted her question. It -- it obviously shook her up a little bit.But she was very angry, you could see it. And I made the statement blood was falling from her eyes. And then I said blood was flowing from wherever. That -- and I just -- when I said that, I wanted to just get onto the -- I didn't say anything...STEPHANOPOULOS: So you did misspeak...TRUMP: -- I was (INAUDIBLE)...STEPHANOPOULOS: -- then?TRUMP: Excuse me, George. I was referring to nose, ears. They're very common statements. And only a deviant would think of what people said. Some people said only a deviant would even think that.Who would ever think that...STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, I mean it...TRUMP: -- George?STEPHANOPOULOS: -- it was widely seen as that. But I mean you did say (INAUDIBLE)...TRUMP: No, they built that up, George. They built it up. But only a -- and like literally a sick person would think that. And the only reason I even stopped my thought -- I didn't even say anything, because I stopped because I wanted to get onto the next subject, which I think was jobs, which was much more important to me. But I wanted to get on so I stopped, rather than saying nose or ears, because that's a very common coming from eyes, nose, ears. That's -- these are very common.And what it means is that a person is angry, very angry. She was very angry. And I was going to say it but I didn't...STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, you've now explained it...TRUMP: -- I didn't want to finish the statement and I stopped the statement short. (INAUDIBLE)...STEPHANOPOULOS: You've explained what you meant...(CROSSTALK)STEPHANOPOULOS: You've explained what you meant to say, but that is not what you said. And many people took it another way.But I do want to get into this -- your relationship with (INAUDIBLE)...TRUMP: They should not have taken it -- George, they should not have taken it another way. They should not have.STEPHANOPOULOS: You mentioned all the women you have hired in your businesses, but, you know, those -- those comments that Megyn Kelly talked about did check out. We went back and looked at them. And there was also this from your best-seller, ""The Art of the Comeback.""You wrote that, ""Women have one of the great acts of all times. The smart ones act very feminine and needy, but inside, they are real killers.""Real killers -- what did you mean by that?TRUMP: I say that with great respect. Women are tremendous. I find women to be -- I mean women -- I've had such an amazing relationship with women in business. They are amazing executives. They are killers.Now, when I say that about a man, it's very sad. If you say that about a man, it's considered a great honor. It's also a great honor when you say it about a woman because -- and that's the way it was meant.They are phenomenal. And I have many executives that are women. They are doing a phenomenal job. I pay them a tremendous amount of money. They make money for me. They make money for themselves. And in many cases, they truly are really talented and they can be killers. And you know what that statement means.And as a man, they love that statement. And women love it, also.Part of the problem...STEPHANOPOULOS: So -- so you're...TRUMP: -- George, part of the problem we have in this country, we're trying to be so politically correct that nobody can say anything anymore...STEPHANOPOULOS: But that -- that is the country you're...TRUMP: -- and it's a disgrace.STEPHANOPOULOS: -- that's the cre -- that's the country you're trying to become president of right now, and there is this impression out there that you've had this history of misogynist statements, that you are anti-women. You are responding to it right now, but you got people like the chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party saying you are a chauvinist. How are you going to combat that impression? Isn't it a problem for you?TRUMP: I don't think so at all, George. In the meantime, I'm doing very well in the polls with women. I've hired women, I have thousands working for me right now. They're doing phenomenally well in the top levels. I am doing great in the polls. You know, speaking about New Hampshire, I'm leading New Hampshire. I'm leading Iowa. I'm leading North Carolina and South Carolina. I'm leading the - and I mean, when I say leading, by big numbers leading, by very big. The numbers just came in from Georgia, I'm leading Georgia by phenomenal, by big numbers, and I'm leading in every national poll, and in some cases by double digits, and those are women voters, largely. And I'm doing very well with the women voters.STEPHANOPOULOS: Some other questions from conservatives about whether they will still support you after your entire record is known. Jon Karl talked about you were asked in the debate about single-payer health care, your support for that in the past. Also, back in 1999, you went on ""Good Morning America,"" also wrote in your book, calling for a 14.25 percent wealth tax. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)TRUMP: This would be a one-time tax. 14.25 percent. Against people with a net worth of over $10 million, $10 million or more. It would pay off in its entirety the national debt of $5.7 trillion. It would save $200 billion a year.(END VIDEOTAPE)STEPHANOPOULOS: You now say you're against that. But why were you for it then, why are you against it now?TRUMP: George, at the time, I was willing to do it. I was wealthy even then. That was a long time ago, but I was willing to do it, and it was a suggestion. I would have loved to have seen the national debt be paid off. We're going to soon be over $20 trillion, 18, actually close to 19 now. We're going to be more than $20 trillion. We should have paid off the national debt one way or the other.STEPHANOPOULOS: So let me ask you about that.TRUMP: But we have to do something.(CROSSTALK)STEPHANOPOULOS: Let me ask about you that. Back in 1999, you were for the wealth tax. You were for single payer.TRUMP: I was willing to do it. I was certainly willing to do it.STEPHANOPOULOS: I get that you were for that, then. You were for single payer then. You're not for it now. How can conservatives trust that you're not going to change again?TRUMP: Look, Ronald Reagan was a Democrat. In fact, he was on the liberal side of being a Democrat. And he changed, and he did a very good job. And I worked with him, and he liked me a lot, and I liked me a lot. But I worked with him. And he was a terrific guy, but he was a Democrat, and George, he was sort of a liberal Democrat, and he changed. And I have evolved, and I have evolved very strongly, and I'm a conservative and I have tremendous support, but I also have a lot of support among Democrats. You know, when you do your polls, if you look at your polls, I have support from all over the place, and people are actually shocked by it. Mr. Trump, you're leading in every poll.STEPHANOPOULOS: And you have supported Democrats more recently. Back in 2006, you and your son gave $77,000 to Democrats. That was the election that brought Nancy Pelosi to power, brought Harry Reid to power. They've since passed President Obama's agenda. Conservatives are against that. So how can conservatives trust you when you recently gave so much money to their opponents?TRUMP: Because, George, I made a net worth, I have a net worth of over $10 billion. I have been a world-class businessman, which is by the way what this country needs to make good trade deals instead of the way we're being ripped off by China and Japan and Mexico and everybody else. I was a businessman. I was a businessperson, and I supported everybody, because as a businessperson, you had to. And when I needed something, people were always there for me. If I supported somebody and three years later I needed something, they were always there for me. And by the way, George, I have to say this, that's what's wrong with the system. The lobbyists, the donors, all of these -STEPHANOPOULOS: That's what I want to get to.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: These people control everything.STEPHANOPOULOS: That's exactly the question I want to get to. It came in from someone on Twitter, Mike Costello, who said, ""He's essentially confessed to bribing politicians. Would you fix this or perpetuate it?""You've been part of the problem, how are you going to be part of the solution?TRUMP: No, I'm not -- no, I understand the system better than anybody did, because I was part of the system. But I would support a lot of people -- I was -- until two months ago, when I announced that I'm going to run for president and make our country great again, which is what I'm going to do, and people see it, but I understand the system better than anybody.But they come and they see. You look at Jeb Bush. He's raised over 100 -- he's raised $100 million more, I guess. And by the way, many of the people putting up those -- that money are friends of mine.These are not people that are putting it up because they like the color of his hair. These are people that are putting it up because they want something and they're going to get something. And with me, I don't want anybody's money. So I can actually straighten out the country without having people come -- special interests and everything else -- come and say, no, no, no, you can't do that, because so and so supported you.And I think it's one of the reasons that I'm killing everybody in the polls.STEPHANOPOULOS: So it's clear you're not backing down, full speed ahead on the campaign. You'll be in the next debate?TRUMP: We're doing fantastically well with the campaign. The -- the numbers are incredible. And you know that better than anybody, because you report them.And no, it's full speed ahead. I'm having a good time. I really love it.STEPHANOPOULOS: Donald Trump, thanks very much very much your time this morning.TRUMP: Thank you very much, George.STEPHANOPOULOS: And we are joined now by another candidate who broke through on Thursday night, Governor John Kasich of Ohio.Thanks for joining us this morning, Governor. You just heard Donald Trump. He is full speed ahead.Is that a problem for your party?GOV. JOHN KASICH (R), OHIO: George, I don't think about things that way. What happened on Thursday is I was relaxed and be able to -- I was able to talk about my record, balancing the federal budget, one of the chief architects, national security experiencing -- experience -- turning Ohio around.George, I don't really pay any attention to these other things because it's most important for me to be able to tell people who I am and you know, I'm kind of a positive guy. I want to lift people. I want everybody to be included and once we create economic growth, I want everyone to share in it.And look, I enjoyed myself on Thursday and I'm enjoying being on the campaign trail.STEPHANOPOULOS: You don't agree with Lindsey Graham who said the Republican Party has crossed the Rubicon, where Trump's behavior is becoming about Republicans, not about him?KASICH: Well, George, if I'm the nominee -- and you've known me for a long time -- I'm going to have a positive message of inclusion, economic growth, strong national defense. I mean, that's the way I've always been. I've been in politics for a long time. I've run in I don't know how many elections, many of them. And I've always been on the positive side of things.And I feel like, you know, frankly, I can help to shape this party. You know, I've talked about economic growth not being an end unto itself and the need to reach out to people who live in the shadows.And when you pay attention to what's being said in many corners of the Republican Party, people are beginning to talk about that. I consider that to be great progress because we want to make sure that the miracle that we call America is something that people believe that can be part of what their life is.STEPHANOPOULOS: That's one wing of the Republican Party, is what you tried to express on Thursday night but many others, including a lot of Democrats, were watching the debate and thought that the whole party was creating problems with women voters, a big story about that in ""The New York Times."" And it included this quote from Margaret Hoover, Republican strategist, who said not one candidate (INAUDIBLE) persuade women voters. There's a difference between pandering and vote counting. Thursday night GOP candidates did neither for women weary of the Republican brand.Your response?KASICH: Well, George, I can just tell you what I'm hearing. You know, in some ways, I feel like an astronaut that went up in a capsule and just splashed down and they haul me out of the capsule and put me on the deck of an aircraft carrier. And then all of a sudden, people took my picture. And now for somebody that's had a long record, people are beginning to know who I am.And, look, everywhere I'm going now, people are like slapping me on the back, saying, you did a great job because you know, you're unifying, you're positive. You're not out there attacking other people.So to me, George, I've always felt that the Republican Party needed to be more for things than against things because it's ideas; it's innovation that drives excitement, that drives support.So if you spend your time worried about somebody else, being negative, then you're not breathing life and energy into what you're doing.(CROSSTALK)KASICH: -- simple.STEPHANOPOULOS: You hope that's going to be successful you -- for you, you're going to be the nominee. But Thursday night you pledged to support the Republican nominee no matter what.Does that stand even if it's Donald Trump?KASICH: I'm a Republican, George; whoever the nominee is, I'm going to get behind him, plain and simple.And by the way, I'm not thinking about running (INAUDIBLE) --(LAUGHTER)KASICH: -- it's hard enough as a Republican.(LAUGHTER)STEPHANOPOULOS: One of your other hurdles is going to be the conservatives You weren't at that red state event we just saw Governor Bush at over the weekend. Erick Erickson, who organized it, put out this -- has said this.He said, ""I will not vote for president 2016 if Republicans decide to punish us with John Kasich as the presidential nominee or vice presidential nominee, not going to happen.""Do you have a problem with conservatives because of your support for expanding Medicaid, Common Core, openness to have --(CROSSTALK)KASICH: George, George --(LAUGHTER)KASICH: -- look, I was the chief architect of balancing the federal budget. We paid down the largest amount of the publicly held debt. We cut taxes on risk-taking when I was in Washington. I was very involved in welfare reform. I'm a cheap hawk. I want to reform the Pentagon while building a strong defense. In Ohio, we went from $8 billion in the hole to $2 billion in the black in our budget. Weâre up 250,000 jobs. Iâve cut taxes more than any standing governor by $5 billion, including killing the death tax. Our credit has risen. But because I think that people who live in the shadows who have been ignored, the mentally ill, who we stick in prison, they donât belong in prison. The drug addicted, who weâre rehabbing in Ohio, you know, we rehab them. The recidivism rate is 10 percent in Ohio.The working poor, we want to help them, but itâs like my mother used to say, George, itâs a sin not to help people who need help, but itâs equally a sin to continue to help those that need to learn how to help themselves. So I think thatâs a â I mean I donât know whatâs more conservative than that or who has a better record. But I do care about people. Thank God that itâs been placed in my soul, and Iâll continue to do it whether I win or not.STEPHANOPOULOS: And it looks like youâve got a lot of confidence this morning, along with Donald Trump. You are full speed ahead as well.Governor Kasich, thanks for joining us this morning.KASICH: (INAUDIBLE).STEPHANOPOULOS: Much more to come. Mike Huckabee, Rick Perry are live. Our roundtable breaks down the big debate. The Trump fallout. Who else won, who lost? Did it help or hurt the GOP?And later, this week marked the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act. Senator Cory Booker weighs in on where it stands today.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)STEPHANOPOULOS: Roundtable here and ready to go, weighing in on Donald Trump and that big Republican debate. The most watched ever. What will the GOP do for an encore?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)STEPHANOPOULOS: Thursday night, that big Republican debate, as we said, the most watched ever by a mile. Twenty-four million people turned in to watch those 10 candidates right there. Donald Trump, of course, dominated the headlines.Let's talk about that now. On our roundtable, joined by the Bloomberg political team, Mark Halperin, and John Heilemann, our own Donna Brazile, Sara Fagen, a Republican strategist, also CNBC contributor, and our own Matt Dowd.And, Matt, I'm thinking, so many people tuned in to that, Donald Trump, every headline since the debate. Three weeks ago he attacks John McCain on his war record. A lot of predictions that he's going to fall. He doesn't. You heard him this morning, full speed ahead. Is he diluting himself or right?MATTHEW DOWD, ABC NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, Donald Trump, as we've discovered, is very unshamable. He can't be shamed in the course of this. And I'm sorry doesn't seem to be a part of his lexicon. I think here - the - Donald Trump represents a whole group of voters that are totally disinfected from both parties who are sick and tired of the Washington establishment. But for me, I think there's three things about this that Donald Trump represents, a blending of entertainment and political news that we've arrived at where selfie (ph) replaces seriousness. Two, the idea that we have a bombastic bidder and belligerent culture that exists in politics today and he seems to represent that. But, three, more importantly, I have total confidence in voters who always do this in the course of this. They'll sort through this, they'll figure it out, and in the end both parties will nominate a competent people that could be president.SARA FAGEN, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Yes.STEPHANOPOULOS: You're nodding your head, Sara.FAGEN: Yes.STEPHANOPOULOS: You have seen more Republicans willing to call him out now.FAGEN: They are willing to call him out. But this - this just feels like that summer fling in high school that your parents tell you not to do but you can't help yourself. But by the time we get back to school, I think Donald is going to be fading well into - into the background of this race.And what was great about that debate was, there were really strong candidates on that stage. The governors, I thought, particularly did well. Marco Rubio did well. And any number of them are going to take on Hillary Clinton. And 24 million people were exposed to them.STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes, and we do want to talk more about the overall debate later on, but let's stick with Trump now for a minute.Mark Halperin, you heard him this morning, no apologies whatsoever, talking about his great record with women, pushing forward on the campaign. How do you think he pivots off of this?MARK HALPERIN, BLOOMBERG POLITICS: My sources say he's going to try to pivot to what his strength is. He's going to start talking about jobs and the economy and trade. He's going to put out a series of position papers.And his campaign is more professional than people realize. They're doing more of the things of organizing, of gathering names, of thinking about an advertising strategy. So I think going forward, the establishment, the other candidates, the press, it's kind of an iron triangle, saying Trump's dead; this is the beginning of the end.The people he's bringing in, the people he's attracting, I don't think he's going to go off necessarily --(CROSSTALK)HALPERIN: -- I'm not sure he's going to go down.(CROSSTALK)STEPHANOPOULOS: -- has he now established a ceiling? He's walled off a lot of Latino voters, walled off a portion of the women's vote, probably after all of this.What is his ceiling?JOHN HEILEMANN: Well, you know, George -- I -- you probably remember I did a couple of weeks ago on New Hampshire and did a focus group with people who liked Donald Trump a lot or leaning towards Donald Trump. And I gave them a lot of negative information about Trump, like as if they knew: single-payer health care, donations --(CROSSTALK)HEILEMANN: -- all of that stuff. And they didn't care. They were not moved off their enthusiasm for Trump. In fact, they kept rationalizing, finding it --(CROSSTALK)STEPHANOPOULOS: -- his core supporters.HEILEMANN: -- yes, people who really like him. And I think there's a chance that 20 percent may be his ceiling but it may also be his floor, which is to say it's going to be hard for him to go much past that, but those people may stick with him for the long haul and in a race with 16 or 17 candidates, 20 percent is enough to make a lot of trouble in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, if he --(CROSSTALK)STEPHANOPOULOS: And Donna, Democrats enjoying watching this.But is it a little bit of a trap, I wonder, if Donald Trump hangs out there, gives the other candidates time to develop over the course of this summer fling?BRAZILE: Well, I also think those other candidates should be happy that Donald Trump is occupying so much space, because I think what I saw on Thursday is that minute -- they don't have foreign positions. They have a lot of sound bites but not a lot of foreign position. And we didn't get to hear that.Look, I think this is beyond politics. This is about common decency. And Mr. Trump attacked not just on Megyn Kelly but other women. That will have a cumulative effect, not just on Mr. Trump but also I think on Republican brand --(CROSSTALK)FAGEN: I don't necessarily agree with that. I thought that the governors particularly were very substantive -- Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, even John Kasich was fairly substantive.And you're right, though, as the campaign unfolds, there's going to be more substance to this race. And Republicans should feel very good about the breadth in their talent right now.DOWD: George, I think the biggest mistake the Republicans on that stage made is dealing with Donald Trump, is somebody should have stood up and taken him on about -- on the women's issues that Megyn Kelly --STEPHANOPOULOS: At the debate --(CROSSTALK)DOWD: -- this shouldn't be about, oh, don't attack Megyn Kelly. This should be about don't attack Rosie O'Donnell. Don't attack Michelle Obama. Don't attack Wendy Davis in Texas. This is not just like defend your friends; they should stood -- somebody should have stood up, not waited two days later and say, oh, by the way, Donald Trump should have done that. On that stage and said a traditional value of Republicans or people should be --(CROSSTALK)BRAZILE: -- what he said to Megyn Kelly essentially, wait a minute, I've been treating you nice. I mean, he acted as if he was like, hey, if you don't be a nice girl, I'm going to get really mad -- that was misogyny.And Matt is absolutely right. Someone should have spoken up at that time.HALPERIN: He says that to men, too, all the time, not just to women.(CROSSTALK)HALPERIN: -- misogyny, there's two scenarios. One is Trump is a factor through Iowa. The other scenario is Trump disappears. What I think is the real story now in the second scenario, which most people think in the establishment is more likely, who's prepared for that moment? Who's prepared for the scrutiny that will come? Who's prepared to have the message? Who's prepared to step up and get -- Trump's vote if --STEPHANOPOULOS: That is the question we're going to address in our next roundtable.Thank you very much for setting it up.Coming up, who else won, who else lost, what do they think in Hillary's camp? All that plus Mike Huckabee and Rick Perry and how they're going to handle Trump now.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(MUSIC PLAYING)STEPHANOPOULOS (voice-over): Up next, THIS WEEK marks the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, the fight over its future playing out now all across the country. Senator Cory Booker weighs in live when we come back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(MUSIC PLAYING)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LYNDON JOHNSON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Millions of Americans are denied the right to vote because of their color. This law will ensure them the right to vote. The wrong is one which no American in his heart can justify. The right is one which no American true to our principles can deny.(END VIDEO CLIP)STEPHANOPOULOS (voice-over): Historic moment 50 years ago, Lyndon Baines Johnson signing the Voting Rights Act.Cory Booker, Senator Cory Booker from New Jersey (INAUDIBLE) says that that Voting Rights Act under threat right now.Thank you for joining us this morning. You and I have argued this, that the combination of the Supreme Court's decision back in 2013, which overthrew the key portion of the Voting Rights Act, efforts to pass new voter ID laws in dozens of states put the Voting Rights Act under a real threat.So I guess my question is what is the solution? Some like Martin O'Malley say you need a constitutional amendment to guarantee the right to vote.SEN. CORY BOOKER, D-N.J.: Well, first, I just want to press the case because many people don't understand that this Voting Rights Act -- the Voting Rights Act is under threat. And these voter ID laws which are being passed in many states have a disproportionate impact on poor folks --(CROSSTALK)STEPHANOPOULOS: Let me -- what's the harm in making sure that there's no fraud at the voting booth?BOOKER: I think that that's the point, which is there is no fraud at the voting booth. In fact, take Texas for example, where Lyndon Johnson's obviously from, they passed these voter ID laws. In the decade before it, 10 years, they only prosecute two people for in person voter ID, only two people. You're more likely to get struck by lightning in Texas than to find any kind of voter fraud.But yet they passed a law that even right now we saw that the circuit court said that there's 600,000 people being affected by this, disproportionately minority, disproportionately poor.So when you see all these voter restrictions taking advantage of the loopholes that were opened up in the Voting Rights Act by the Shelby decision, the lack of pre-clearance necessary, you suddenly see people racing to put in laws that really are as we see, a solution that's had no problem.And in fact, it's creating the problem of --STEPHANOPOULOS: -- do you need a constitutional amendment?BOOKER: You know, there's -- I've joined with Dick Durbin, with Senator Leahy, Senator Coons in a step before that. I don't think necessarily you need a constitutional amendment. I think there's things we can do administratively through -- legislatively to address that.But we need to understand that there has to be some kind of halt done to a lot of these movements to deny people voting rights. And I want to take it even a step further because, for me, right now, I look at the Voting Rights Act, borne not through the pen of Lyndon Johnson only, but before the ink was dried, it was a sweat, blood and effort of many people to expand voting access to Americans.But what we've also seen in this country since the 1970s is a rate restriction of voting rights in our country. What I mean specifically by that is in 1976, about 1.7 million Americans were denied their voting rights because of previous convictions. They had felony disenfranchisement. Well, since the 1970s, we had this explosion of this drug war, incredible explosion of mass incarceration in this country, disproportionately affecting poor people and minorities. And now we've come to a point in America in 2010, we had 5.85 million Americans who have lost their voting rights because of previous convictions. They paid their debt to society, many of them non-violent criminals.If that was a state, it would be the 20th biggest state in our nation.STEPHANOPOULOS: That -- that is -- that is just one issue, the criminal justice issue, that's also getting a lot of attention right now.We've seen the -- the rise of this Black Lives Matter movement over the last -- Matter movement over the last year, as well. It's gaining some steam.And there was a moment last night, Bernie Sanders was out in Seattle, where he was trying to speak. And I want to show you where he was actually talked down by members of the Black Lives Matter protests.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That is the only way that this...(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- don't back up.(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We will fight for black lives no matter what it takes.(END VIDEO CLIP)STEPHANOPOULOS: Is he getting fair treatment there?And -- and what more should be done to address this issue?BOOKER: Well, two things. First of all, Bernie Sanders is a friend and a colleague. I'm supporting Hillary Clinton in the -- in this election, but Bernie has become somebody I've had tremendous -- I have tremendous respect for and is an ally of mine in addressing issues in the United States Senate that affect minority communities. He has a long record of civil rights.But the anger you saw there, the -- from the protesters, this is a legitimate degree of frustration in this country, in a nation that has yet to confront what I believe are persistent civil rights issues, human rights issues.And you mentioned in the criminal justice system, yes, so now we know that we see -- there are some states where one in five black Americans don't have a right to vote because of this mass felony franchise.But that's just one thing. We have an overall cri -- prison system where we see that there's no difference in America between blacks and whites, between minorities and whites in using drugs. In fact, there's no difference in dealing drugs. Some studies show that young whites have more of a -- a chance of -- of being drug dealers, but yet we have an incarceration rate for drugs -- for drug use and for drug selling -- that is disproportionately seen in -- in communities of color.And the result of that has created these awful realities in America, where right now, we have more African-Americans under criminal supervision than all of the slaves in 1850, where we have a nation that has states like mine, that has 14, 15 percent African-Americans, but the prison population is over 60 percent black.And so when you know that it is no difference, but if you're an African-American, you're almost four times more likely to be caught for using marijuana than if you were white, when you see a criminal justice system that is not what the Supreme Court has etched in its wall, equal justice under the law, please understand that there is going to be an understandable reaction to that in our country.And the criminal justice system is so overbroad right now, that we, as a nation, are spending a quarter of a trillion dollars a year. We have -- we're 4 percent of the -- of the globe's population, 4 to 5 percent, but we have one out of every four imprisoned people here in this country.And so, yes, there's a reason to be upset.STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator -- Senator Corey...BOOKER: And there's a reason to act out.STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Corey Booker, thanks very much for your time this morning.BOOKER: Thank you so much.STEPHANOPOULOS: Up next, GOP candidates Mike Huckabee and Rick Perry both here live. More analysis from our Powerhouse Roundtable. And that other big moment in politics this week, Jon Stewart's final show.STEPHANOPOULOS: Up next, GOP candidates Mike Huckabee and Rick Perry both here live. More analysis from our Powerhouse Roundtable. And that other big moment in politics this week, Jon Stewart's final show.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JON STEWART, HOST: Rather than saying good-bye or good night, I'm just going to say -- I'm going to go get a drink.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It seems like this election has been a whole lot about a person who is very high in the polls but doesn't have a clue about how to govern, a person who has been filled with scandals and who could not lead. And, of course, I'm talking about Hillary Clinton.(END VIDEO CLIP)STEPHANOPOULOS: A little misdirection there from Governor Mike Huckabee, former governor of Arkansas, presidential candidate, Thursday night's debate.Governor Huckabee, thank you for joining us this morning.So you had a nice turn at the end of that debate on Thursday night. But Donald Trump has not backed down at all since that debate.What do you say about him now?MIKE HUCKABEE (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Look, he is connecting with a lot of people. But I think the rest of us are doing what were supposed to do, and that's focus on getting a message out, which is sometimes hard to do, because all the air in the balloon is going to Donald Trump right now.But that's OK, because this is a long process. And it's like a baseball season, George, there are some early games. That doesn't necessarily determine who's going to be in the World Series. And when we go to a debate, quite frankly -- and I heard your panel say that there wasn't a lot of substance.Well, it's hard to do a lot of substance when you're given either one minute or 30 seconds.So I would love to have an opportunity to stand on that stage and go into the details of why I defend things like Social Security and Medicare, why I believe in the fair tax.But it's sometimes hard, because all people want to ask me is what do I think about Donald Trump?STEPHANOPOULOS: But it -- but at what point does that become a real problem for your party and -- and do you have to stand up and do the other candidates have to stand up say, you know, enough is enough, he's not -- he's not going to be our nominee, we will not support him if he is?HUCKABEE: I don't think that's our role. I think our role is to run for president. It's the voters' role to determine who they are going to connect to.My job is to connect to the voters, not to disconnect them from Donald Trump. He's going to give his message, I'm going to give mine. And in time, we'll see which one really speaks to the heart, the soul and to the sense of option and opportunity for the American people.I think in the long-term, when I get a chance to really talk to people about how do we bring wages up for people at the bottom, 90 percent of the people in this country's wages have been flat for 40 years. There's some real hurt out there in America.And people right now are hurting so much, they're just angry. And Donald Trump is touching that.But now, people are going to start, I think, over the coming months, say but how do we fix this?How do we make it better?And some of us actually have fought through this quite a bit. And we've been through this process not just of running for president, but of governing. And we understand something about what it takes to move the needle to a new direction.STEPHANOPOULOS: I ask...HUCKABEE: And that's when the race is going to get even more serious.STEPHANOPOULOS: I actually agree with you. I think there was a fair amount of substance in the debate on Thursday night. It could have been even more if -- if you don't have the constraints that are always there in a debate.And one of the issues that all the candidates agreed on was defunding Planned Parenthood.But you went even further on Thursday night and I want to show that right here.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HUCKABEE: I think it's time to do something even more bold. I think the next president ought to invoke the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to ""The Constitution,"" now that we clearly know that that baby inside the mother's womb is a person at the moment of conception.(END VIDEO CLIP)STEPHANOPOULOS: The question is, what does that mean, invoking the Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendment?And there was a recent headline when you spoke back in Kansas, the ""Topeka Capital Journal,"" where the headline said, ""Mike Huckabee, Republican Presidential Candidate, Won't Rule Out Employing U.S. Troops, FBI to Stop Abortion.""Is that the fallout from invoking the Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendments?HUCKABEE: Well, that whole idea about the troops and the FBI didn't come from me. That -- those weren't my words. That was something that the ""Rolling Stone"" reporter said. And we know how reliable ""Rolling Stone"" is as a journalistic tool.So what I'm saying is, is that the real issue here is not whether we're going to give money to Planned Parenthood. Yes, that's important.But the bigger issue is, is that unborn child a human being?Because if it is, then the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment apply because we're dealing with...STEPHANOPOULOS: So what does that mean, though...HUCKABEE: -- personhood.STEPHANOPOULOS: -- in practice?HUCKABEE: Well, it means that you guarantee due process under the Fifth Amendment before you deprive someone of their life and liberty. It means, under the Fourteenth Amendment, there's equal protection under the law.Exactly how that plays out is one of the ways we -- we discover what does it take for Americans to finally wake up to the fact that we are violating the constitutional rights of human beings?And in the past, presidents have employed many different ways to make sure that...STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes, but would...STEPHANOPOULOS: -- would that mean calling in law enforcement...HUCKABEE: -- basic human rights are...STEPHANOPOULOS: -- in...HUCKABEE: -- are protected.STEPHANOPOULOS: Would it mean calling in law enforcement to prevent abortion?HUCKABEE: I think the bigger question is, let's -- let's establish the personhood of the individual. Let's make sure that America comes to grips with that.George, we can't keep defending the -- the loss of 60 million human lives over the past 42 years. We -- we're not acting like a civilized people in -- in the way in which abortion, in its unrestricted fashion, has continued.And even the politicians who pretend that they're not really for it, they're personally against it. They'll say things like let's keep it safe, legal and rare. It's not safe. I don't think it's legal. I think it violates the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights of an unborn person. And it certainly isn't rare. It happens 4,000 times a day. That's hardly rare.STEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Huckabee, thanks for joining us again this morning.I hope you'll come back soon.Rick Perry joins us now, former governor of Texas, also a presidential candidate. He was there on Thursday night in the early debate, joins us now from Iowa.We just heard Governor Huckabee right there.What do you think about that idea of invoking the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to protect the right to life?RICK PERRY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I think anyone who's seen the videos of the Planned Parenthood is offended, you know, regardless of where they may be on the issue of -- of choice or protecting life. And that's what he needs to be focused on, is these operations that are clearly outside the -- the bounds of not just humanity, but outside the bounds of our criminal laws.So one of the reasons we shut down Planned Parenthood in Texas -- and I might add, replaced those dollars with women's health care dollars that really went to the core and -- and then protected what the people of the state of Texas wanted to do, which is not be a place that expanded abortion.We have parental consent notification and we also had laws that -- sonogram bills and others to protect the life and -- and also to protect the life of those mothers.So, you know, that -- that's the real issue for us, is to give real options on women's health care and to restrict these -- these groups that are using out of the norm procedures to...STEPHANOPOULOS: You don't...PERRY: -- do these abortions.STEPHANOPOULOS: You know, you held your own in that first debate on Thursday, but it had about a quarter of the viewers of the prime time debate on Fox News.What is it going to take to get you into the second debate?And can you run an effective campaign if you're not?PERRY: Well, this is a long game, George. It's a -- it's six months until Iowa and that's the reason I'm in Iowa now. And it's going to be Iowa and -- and New Hampshire and South Carolina that puts our nominee on track. I know that's one of the things I learned in -- in 2011, you've got to spend a lot of time in Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina.You know, debates are important, but there is nothing that's more important than sitting in a town hall meeting or in a roping arena, as I was last night, in Iowa Falls, Iowa, talking to the people.They're the ones that are going to show up for the caucus and then the primaries in New Hampshire and South Carolina. That's where you'd better be spending a lot of your time.STEPHANOPOULOS: So you're in for the -- you're in for the first votes even if you don't get into the debates?PERRY: Well, sure. I mean, we're going to be engaged in this process. And it's going to be a fluid up and down, back and forth, it always is. One of the things I try to remind people was back in '07 Rudi Giuliani led the polls for almost a year. He and Fred Thompson, there was some celebrity going on there. And we may be seeing a bit of that right now.So I think this is a very fluid process. And it's going to change a lot. And I feel confident that they're interested in who has the executive experience, who has created jobs, who can -- I'm one of the few that's worn the uniform of the country. That's going to matter when people really get focused on the real issues and who the solution oriented candidates are going to be.STEPHANOPOULOS: Meantime, you have to contend with Donald Trump. You called him a cancer on conservatism, called him out fairly early. Has he finally gone too far? And do you think he's going to start to collapse?PERRY: Well, we'll see about that. That's, frankly, up to him. Any time a candidate, and I don't care who it is, having been the governor of Texas and had very close relationship with our men and women in uniform -- as a matter of fact, Marcus Luttrell came and lived with my wife and I for almost two years, a young man who was captured by the Taliban.And what Donald Trump said about him and others who have served our country so nobly was really offensive to me.So, I'm not going to be quiet. I'm going to call out Mr. Trump or anybody else for offending young people up to giving their lives for us. It's not a political game with me.So, I'm going to be very strong when it comes -- and I'm going to speak out loudly when anyone offends those men and women who are doing everything that they can to keep us free in this country.STEPHANOPOULOS: And governor, Perry, we look forward to having you back on the program. Thanks for joining us this morning.PERRY: Thank you.STEPHANOPOULOS: Up next, the roundtable back with more on that epic debate. Democratic infighting on Iran, and Jon Stewart's farewell after this from our ABC stations.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRIS CHRISTIE, GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY: I'll never forget you, Jon. But I will be trying.REP. CHARLES RANGEL, (D) NEW YORK: Good riddance, smartass.SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, (D) ILLINOIS: Don't go. Come back. Jon, I'm being sarcastic.HILLARY CLINTON, FRM. SECRETARY OF STATE: And just when I'm running for president. What a bummer.RAHM EMMANUEL, MAYOR OF CHICAGO: What has nine-and-a-half fingers and won't miss you at all? This guy.SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, (R) SOUTH CAROLINA: I'm sure you'll be missed by somebody.JOHN KERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE: You know, there are a lot of things happening around the world that keep me up at night, which is why I've relied on you to put me to sleep.SEN. JOHN MCCAIN, (R) ARIZONA: I'm Jon Stewart. I'm dumb. I'm stupid. Nah, nah, nah. So long, jackass.(END VIDEO CLIP)STEPHANOPOULOS: A little payback for Jon Stewart's final show. The other big show on Thursday night.I'm back now with the roundtable. We'll talk about that in a minute. But I do want to stick on the debate, Mark Halperin. We heard Sarah UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE say she thought some of the governors did well.What's your analysis of the other winners right here? It did seem that Marco Rubio, John Kasich did well, Jeb Bush, Scott Walker kind of middling.HALPERIN: There's a lot of debates to go. And I think, you know, Jeb Bush needs to do better than that if he is going to be the nominee. I don't think that performance was good enough. And I don't think most of his supporters or advisers think that was good enough.He was much better at RedState yesterday.None of these guys on the 10 person debate are rising so far to the occasion, but it is the summer. And I think all of them left there I think having learned that even the people who got the best reviews I don't think are strong enough at this point to win a general election. But there's plenty of time.STEPHANOPOULOS: We did see Carly Fiorina, that undercard John Heilemann do quite well in the first debate, but I want to take just a bit of issue with this idea that the summer debates -- you know, there's a lot of time. Of course, there is a lot of time left, but there's also no fact that the debates this time around do have the equivalent of like what the straw polls used to be, even an early primary.HEILEMANN: Well, and with only -- with the Republican Party having restricted the number of debates, having only one per month, there aren't that many big debates like this, fullscale, primetime debates between now and when the first votes are cast in Iowa. So, I think they all matter a lot. And obviously that audience the other night was enormous. So I think it matters a lot.I think Carly Fiorina was the one person who broke through from the undercard. I cannot imagine how -- one way or the other, she's not going to be on that main stage...STEPHANOPOULOS: Even if her polling numbers don't go up?HEILEMANN: ...in September. I just cannot see how they can not get a -- the one woman in the race up there on that stage, especially given the dynamics that played out, the negative (inaudible) that came up this last debate.FAGEN: Well, I think she's earned the right to be there, but at the same time you cannot have a debate with 15 people on the stage, it simply just isn't going to work. So there's got to be some level of criteria that these news organizations uphold.STEPHANOPOULOS: So what do they do if she's still at 1, 2 percent, not in the top 10.DOWD: She's not. I mean, in the aftermath -- first of all, she had an audience of 6 million people for an undercard debate, which is -- I think the numbers were the fourth largest primary debate ever on the undercard debate. And she -- the play that she got in the three days after basically saying...STEPHANOPOULOS: She's going up, you think?DOWD: She got -- after Trump, she got the most play in the entire conversation after that. I think she makes that average. She's in the top 10. And I think the person likely to drop out of the top 10 who barely made it in the last one who didn't get anything out of it is Chris Christie. Chris Christie who was the leading candidate a year-and-a-half ago is likely not to make this...STEPHANOPOULOS: Despite that exchange with Rand Paul?FAGEN: But he was strong. I thought Christie was quite strong.DOWD: I think in the aftermath, that's been forgotten. Christie at 3.5 percent.FAGEN: It's a fair point. In the aftermath of this debate, everything has been forgotten, because the only thing anyone is talking about is Donald Trump.Here is to me what is the bigger concern about Trump is if you look at the way the delegate process works, you need over 1,000 delegates to win the nomination. The first 15 days from February 1 through March 15, we're going to decide 45 percent of our delegates proportionally. And if we continue to see this noise in the system where nobody really breaks out and all these delegates are decide proportionally, this is going to go very late -- a very long fight.BRAZILE: You need 1,320 delegates, I believe, and that's why Ted Cruz is on this bus tour from South Carolina to Texas. Most of those delegates will be chosen during the process on March 1.STEPHANOPOULOS: He's got money, too.BRAZILE: He has -- that's right. And that's why I'm not discounting Ted Cruz in terms of his organization and ability to break through.FAGEN: Jeb Bush has money, Ted Cruz is strong...HALPERIN: Cruz and Bush both have money, and they are the only two really focused on a 35 state strategy going forward.DOWD: The money -- OK, I'm going to speak a little heresy to all of you -- money is not going to matter in this race, right. I think as you go along in the primary process, momentum matters. And whoever gains momentum, even if they're getting out spent.STEPHANOPOULOS: But what of Sarah is talking about, what if you have split winners. What if a Scott Walker wins Iowa, a Jeb Bush wins New Hampshire and Marco Rubio wins South Carolina.DOWD: I think the longer this goes where you have a large candidate field, the more actually Donald Trump has helped in that process, the more other candidates are helped in that process, and the longer this goes, I agree with that.But I want to touch on one thing, which is we talk about all of this and how it's going to hurt the GOP and all that, if a Republican emerges from this process who is thoughtful, who is a reasonable conservative, who is expansive in how they approach the country, that is going to give Hillary Clinton if she's the nominee a run for her money, because we don't talk a lot about her vulnerabilities. Here is somebody that is not liked by the country, that is distrusted by the country, and who the current incumbent president -(CROSSTALK)STEPHANOPOULOS: Donna Brazile, let me bring that to you, but last night, Bernie Sanders, we saw him get spoken down (ph) in Seattle, right after that event, 15,000 people in Seattle, there's a lot of energy.BRAZILE: And he's going to Portland, he's going to Oakland, and Bernie Sanders is really hot. He's hot right now, hot in terms of the passion in the Democratic Party, the passion of independents. But I want to go back to what Matt said about Hillary Clinton. Her numbers, she suffered since announcing her race, but you know what, look at her favorabilities and compare to some of the Republicans, who had more air time. I'm not concerned about Hillary Clinton right now, because I know she has an opportunity to regain all of that momentum once we start our debate process in October, but the Republican Party right now, they are being pulled so far to the right, I don't even think they're going to come back to the center.STEPHANOPOULOS: John Heilemann, 15 seconds.HEILEMANN: You cannot look at the enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders and not be worried if you're the Clinton campaign, and you can't look at her internal numbers especially on honest and trustworthy. He could beat her in Iowa. He could beat her in New Hampshire, and then -(CROSSTALK)STEPHANOPOULOS: That is all the time we have for today. Thank you all.

http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2015/may/27/commonwealth-institute/commonwealth-institute-says-most-va-corporations-d/	"Says ""roughly two-thirds of (state) corporations didnât pay any income tax in Virginia."""	mostly true	['Corporations', 'State Finances', 'Taxes']	http://thehalfsheet.org/	http://thehalfsheet.org/post/117779525698/livin-on-a-prayer	2015/05/27	Livinâ on a PrayerOn the day before state taxes are due, itâs worth taking a look at how Virginiaâs outdated revenue system hits low-income people harder than the wealthy and fails to maintain our top-notch schools and other services essential to a growing economy.Virginiaâs upside-down tax system requires the lowest-income workers to pay 8.9 percent of their incomes in taxes while the richest 1 percent only pay 5.1 percent. A big reason for this disparity is that middle class folks like the server at a local restaurant â in fact, anyone with income over $17,000 a year â pays the same marginal income tax rate as the millionaire ordering the special.And everyone - regardless of how much they make - has to pay the same tax rate for everyday essentials like food and gasoline. But the same rules donât apply to gold and platinum bullion, yachts, services like gym memberships, or stuff bought online, which are taxed differently, if at all, and are bought more often by the financially well off.If that werenât enough, low-income workers are forced to leave money on the table this time of year because they canât get a refund on the earned income tax credits they donât use. Meanwhile, large coal companies freely return their unused tax credits for cash, and the wealthy can buy tax credits from land others have preserved.And all the while, most large corporations arenât putting in their fair share to ensure our kids get a world-class education and to maintain the other essential services we know build a strong economy for us all. At last count, roughly two-thirds of corporations didnât pay any income tax in Virginia despite this being a time of record high corporate profits. Thatâs due in large part to the teams of accountants they deploy to exploit special tax breaks and reduce or eliminate what they owe. While a handful of energy and telecommunications companies are subject to a minimum tax, they represent the exception and not the rule.All these problems and game playing have come home to roost in our state budget, where the state has faced shortfalls year after year.Even after the recession was supposedly a thing of the past, Virginia lawmakers had to deal last year with a nearly $2.4 billion gap between what was slated for our schools, roads, and communities and how much money the state had to pay for those things. Lawmakers made cuts and used gimmicks to get out of that budget bind, further compromising our schools and other essential services. And now, after years of picking up more of the cost for schools, many localities are being forced to have tough conversations about cutting extra-curriculars and even eliminating full-day kindergarten.Virginiaâs basic income tax structure is the same as it was in 1987, the year âLivinâ on a Prayerâ by Bon Jovi was a Billboard hit single. That song may be a classic, but Virginiaâs future needs more to live on.âMassey Whorley, Senior Policy Analyst

All I remember is that I started getting really hungry, ate some chicken wings and passed out recalls the police officer, visibly traumatized by the latest events.The 3-month-old child was found in the microwave, covered in barbecue sauce, and was rushed to Springfields Mercy Hospital where doctors do not fear for his life.Police Officer Dwayne Johnson was the first on the scene and found a very confused and incoherent babysitter lying half-conscious in the familys living roomApparently, the baby sitter tried to cook the baby in the microwave oven but she was unable to do so, and was probably disoriented and lost consciousness moments later, explained Sheriff Deputy Anderson James of the Jefferson County Police Department. Teeth marks were found on the babys arms and legs but luckily he is unharmed he acknowledged, visibly distraught by the whole affair.The state of Missouri has led, for more than a decade, the nation in methamphetamine busts. A recent 2015 state-wide study revealed that more than 60% of adults aged 21 and higher have tried crystal meth at least once and close to 40% of respondents believed crystal meth should be decriminalized as a schedule 2 drug for medical use in treatment.16.6kSHARESShareTweetGoogleWhatsapp

Eugene Emery Jr. on Sunday, July 31st, 2011 at 8:00 a.m.Controversy continues to churn over the issue of voter identification one month after the General Assembly passed a voter ID bill. Gov. Lincoln Chafee signed it into law on July 2.Under the new law , voters in the 2012 election will be asked to show some form of identification; in 2014, theyâll be asked for an ID with a photo.Opponents have continued to complain that it's an expensive solution -- cost estimates for providing free IDs vary widely -- for a problem that essentially doesn't exist. They also maintain it will lower turnout of the poor, elderly and minorities.Supporters say requiring an ID is essential to the integrity of an election.The law allows registered voters without an ID to cast a provisional ballot. That ballot will be counted later if the local Board of Canvassers determines that the signature on the ballot application matches the signature on the person's registration.On July 19, GoLocalProv published a column by Travis Rowley, pundit, chairman of the Rhode Island Young Republicans, and a supporter of voter ID, arguing that past abuses made the new law necessary. (The column grew out of a challenge he accepted during the July 8 edition of Channel 36's ""A Lively Experiment "" to cite a single conviction for voter fraud in the state.)In the column, Rowley talked about cases in East Providence involving people who voted where they had their businesses -- not where they actually lived. He mentioned anecdotes of people supposedly posing as other voters, citing the claim of Rep. Anastasia Williams, a Providence Democrat.Williams says that she and her daughter went to their polling place in 2006, only to discover that two other people had used their names. (Rowley reported, incorrectly, that it was last year. Williams never filed a complaint.)At the end of his column, Rowley played the illegal immigrant card:""The RI Board of Elections has heard official testimony from Providence residents who claim to have witnessed known illegal aliens voting in local elections,"" he said.We were intrigued.So we called Robert Kando, executive director of the board, to find out about these cases.Kando said that during his six-year tenure with the board, it has heard just one such claim. A check of Journal archives uncovered no cases and former elections board Chairman Roger Begin, who served from 1994 to 2006, said he could not recall any instances.The case Kando recalled ""was during one of our recount hearings -- it was not the last election, it was a while ago -- where a losing candidate or the candidate's wife, who was looking for a new election, said, 'We saw people who we know aren't U.S. citizens and we know they voted.' The question then was, 'Who?' They said, 'It's just someone that we knew. But we didn't know their names.' ""Given that lack of specifics, Kando told us, ""there was no need to ask any more questions."" In addition, no complaint was ever filed with the board.So we sent messages to Rowley on July 22, via email and his website, to tell him what Kando said and to ask if he had additional information. While we waited for a response -- we have yet to receive one -- we did some further checking.With Kando's help, we went back and checked the records, including listening to the tape of the Sept. 20, 2006, meeting that served as the source of Kando's statement. It turned out that his recollection of that meeting five years ago was off a bit.The agenda included complaints from two unsuccessful Providence candidates who said they had seen evidence of voter fraud. The board took testimony from both Laura Perez and Eulogio Acevedo, along with hearing from Acevedo's wife, Maryelyn. Contrary to Kando's recollection, the Acevedos made no reference to fraud by illegal immigrants.But Perez did. She had lost to Grace Diaz in the District 11 primary and in her complaint letter she said, ""I personally witnessed an individual who voted but is not an American citizen."" She reaffirmed that statement during the hearing. Her other allegations of irregularities involved five people, but none of those complaints involved citizenship status.The board voted to send both complaints to the state police for investigation. Perez told us police never contacted her. Perez's letter gave no names. She told us she knew the identity of the woman -- and that the woman was in the country illegally -- but wasn't going to reveal the name until the state police contacted her.State police Lt. John Lemont, assistant detective commander, said he recalled the case, one of several that police were probing at the time. But in her letter, ""there wasn't information specific enough to go forward with an investigation. We therefore closed the investigation.""Asked if he's heard of other allegations of voter fraud involving illegal immigrants, Lemont said, ""I'm unaware of any other complaint, other than this one person."" There have been successful prosecutions, but those have been ""based on people voting in the wrong district.""The Sept. 20, 2006, elections board meeting also included a presentation by Terry Gorman, president of the then-fledgling Rhode Islanders for Immigration Law Enforcement. He was seeking support for a voter ID law. Gorman offered no evidence of voter fraud by illegal immigrants.The only other person to speak on the topic that day was Angel Taveras, now mayor of Providence, who was at the meeting to represent a client but stressed that he was testifying as a private citizen. He complained that citizenship status was being singled out. ""We should make sure there was NO fraudulent voting,"" he said, predicting that if an investigation is undertaken, ""I think what you're going to find is there is very little, if any, of it.""Perez herself, who believes a lot of the votes cast in her district were done by people paid to engage in voter fraud, said she doubts that many undocumented immigrants were engaging in the practice. ""Undocumented people are less likely to run that type of game,"" she said. ""They're not going to take the risk. For $100? Hell no.""So, in summary, when Rowley talks about the ""official testimony from Providence residents who claim to have witnessed known illegal aliens voting,"" his statement implies there were several complaints.There werenât.There was just one.In 2006.There's a grain of truth to his claim. Perez did report one case. But because Rowley substantially overstated the evidence regarding illegal immigrant voting, the Truth-O-Meter rates his statement Mostly False .(Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter .

U.S. Senator from New York. Author, Off the Sidelines. Pitcher, sometimes left fielder. Democrat.May 19, 2017America needs a real national paid family and medical leaveÂ planThere are no more excuses: Hardworking families struggling to get by need a national paid family and medical leave plan â and they need it now. Standing up for working families means ensuring we join the rest of the world in not forcing workers to choose between a desperately needed paycheck and caring for a family member. This is an essential part of rebuilding the middle class and improving an economy that is still leaving most Americans behind.The inclusion of paid leave in the Presidentâs budget is good news and a positive first step forward. But, as currently proposed, this plan falls far too many steps short of the realities working families face, and would leave far too many people behind, including seniors, parents with sick children, and even deployed members of the Armed Services.The Presidentâs plan also severely misses the mark of understanding how states manage their already overburdened Unemployment Insurance programs. This plan is set up for failure by forcing an unfunded mandate on states that most certainly canât afford to meet the challenge as proposed, and wouldnât be generous enough to be used by their workers. Using the low wage replacement included in the unemployment system will ensure that millions of low- and middle-income parents simply will not be able to afford to use this program, and will continue to go back to work weeks or even days after giving birth.I stand ready to work with the White House on The FAMILY Act. The FAMILY Act is modeled on state programs that have already proven to be successful. The FAMILY Act is an earned benefit that would provide comprehensive leave with adequate and affordable wage replacement, while leveling the playing field for small businesses. It rewards work and protects families, and it is supported by people around the country and businesses big and small.TRANSCRIPTSince this is an ideas conference, I brought one idea that Iâd like to challenge the President on to step up.I want to challenge the President to join us in fighting for a national paid leave program.Mr. President, if you are really standing up for working Americans, if you are really fighting for them, then there is no excuse not to have America join every industrialized nation in the world that already guarantees national paid leave.It is not just a womenâs issue; it is a middle-class economic issue that creates economic growth and rewards work in this country.Year after year, we are shortchanging our workforce and we are shortchanging our economy, and that should not be acceptable to any of us as Democrats.But this is important: If weâre going to pass a paid leave plan, it has to be a real paid leave plan, and let me explain what that is:It has to be gender-neutral. It has to allow you to care for not just a newborn infant, but a sick or dying family member.It should be a test of whether or not itâs real paid leave.Remember on the campaign trail, candidate Trump broke away from most of his party, and he announced that he supported paid leave? Made sense, right?Because paid leave shouldnât be a Democratic or Republican idea, because it rewards work, Because it helps us care for our families. Because it grows the economy.Itâs something that we should all agree on.But unfortunately again, this was another one of Donald Trumpâs empty promises.Real paid leave works like this:First: It has to be national, so a state like North Dakota or Nevada doesnât have to worry about not having enough population.We have enough population in New York. Thatâs why New York was able to pass paid leave. We have twenty million people.Second: Paid leave must be gender-neutral. That means it has to cover women and men.It has to cover husbands who want to care for their wives when they are sick. It has to cover sons who want to care for a dying parent.Third: Paid leave has to be comprehensive, and that means itâs not just about maternity leave. Itâs not just about babies.Because itâs not enough. You have to cover all illnesses.No one should ever have to choose between a paycheck and being able to sit with their dying mother who has been diagnosed with cancer or Alzheimerâs.We have to make sure that you can be with a child if theyâre sick or in a wheelchair or needs the care of their parent.It also has to be 12 weeks long. So thatâs long enough so that you can be with that infant, be with that sick parent, be with that dying family member.Fourth: It has to be sustainable.A national paid leave plan can only be sustainable if every worker in the entire country is part of it.So if itâs going to survive, everyone who would benefit needs to chip in. So it actually needs to be a universal earned benefit.Fifth: Paid leave has to be affordable and manageable, for workers and businesses alike. Particularly small businesses.Now, we have great data in from California. Itâs a statewide program. It has been up and running for ten years.What we know from California is that 90% of businesses said it had no negative impact, or a positive impact, on its bottom line.We also know that 99% of businesses said it had a positive impact on morale and retention.Small businesses around the country, in fact 70% of them, want a plan for paid leave, because they have to level the playing field.How are they going to compete with the Googles and the Facebooks of the world, and have that kind of cash flow? They just donât.And so if you donât have a national insurance plan, if you donât have national paid leave, they can never compete.Businesses also have seen the numbers. They know that this is good for the economy.If we had a national paid leave plan it would potentially put into the economy $21 billion dollars annually.And it makes sense, because a woman in her lifetime loses about $320,000 because we donât have paid leave.A man loses about $280,000 because we donât have paid leave.And to do a real paid leave plan, it shouldnât just be a tax cut for the good corporations that are already doing this.This is not about giveaways for successful companies.So we need a bill. We have a bill. Itâs called the FAMILY Act, and let me tell you what it does.Itâs a commonsense bill that passes a national paid leave plan.Itâs nationwide, itâs gender-neutral, itâs comprehensive, itâs sustainable, it affects all businesses alike, and itâs affordable.And let me explain to you what it costs. Itâs the cost of a cup of coffee a week. On average, itâs $2 a week.So just imagine this: Youâre asking every employer to say, âWould you buy one cup of coffee for each employee a week?â They overwhelming say, âYes, I would do that. I do that anyway.âFor a worker: âWould you put $2 a week into a savings plan, to know that when your mother is dying, you can be by her side; so that when you become pregnant, you can be with your infant?â Workers will say yes.So itâs not a lot of money. Itâs $2 a week. Thatâs $104 per year, per employee. Thatâs an amount of money that any business can afford.So I think this is something that makes sense, but I want to talk about how we are actually going to get it passed, and this is what matters the most for the people in this room.Weâve been stuck in an era, a Mad Men era, where our policies do not reflect the face of the workforce.7 out of 10 moms are working today. 4 out of 10 moms are primary or sole wage earners.So time has shifted. We need this national plan. It will help the economy grow.But somethingâs happening in America that I have never seen in my lifetime, and itâs about you.Itâs about the grassroots, and itâs the reason why so many of you showed up today.How many people here marched for the Womenâs March? How many?Nearly all of us, and we marched all across the globe, we marched in New York, we marched in Washington, we marched worldwide.And it was a moment in our history where people believed that their voice actually mattered.After seeing Donald Trump get elected, they said, âThis is not my country. I did not sign up for this. I donât agree with this person.âAnd what did they do? For the first time in their lives, people across America made a sign â they made a sign that talked about the issue that they cared most about.They talked about the issue that made them angry, the issue that they had passion for, the issue that they were not going to stand President Trump unwinding.So whether you were marching for Black Lives Matter, or marching for reproductive rights, or marching for LGBTQ equality, or marching for Muslims, or marching for immigration, or marching for clean air/clean water, it didnât matter.It was your issue. It was what you cared about.So if weâre going to pass a national paid leave plan, we are only going to pass it if every single one of you stands up and fights for it, and demands it, and says:âThis is important to me. Itâs important to my business. Itâs important to our economy. Itâs important to our families â because itâs about us.âAnd if we arenât willing to fight for it, it will never happen.This moment in time is about the democratization of democracy.Itâs about each individual having a voice.Itâs the 17 year old girl who tweets something that goes viral that makes the difference.Itâs the very creative person who creates a meme thatâs really funny, that says it exactly like the way it is.Thatâs whatâs happening today, and all of us need to be part of that.And if all of us are a part of it, we will win. We will defeat Donald Trump. Weâll defeat his horrific policies.And we will do good things like pass a national paid leave plan.Thank you all.One clap, two clap, three clap, forty?By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out.61

No bonds or other obligations may be issued pursuant to the provisions of 3Article XII, Section 19, of the Constitution of 1885, as amended, but this provision shall not be construed to prevent the refunding of any such outstanding bonds or obligations pursuant to the provisions of this subsection (a)(2).Subject to the requirements of the first paragraph of this subsection (a)(2), beginning July 1, 1975, all of the proceeds of the revenues derived from the gross receipts taxes collected from every person, including municipalities, as provided and levied pursuant to the provisions of chapter 203, Florida Statutes, as such chapter is amended from time to time, shall, as collected, be placed in a trust fund to be known as the âpublic education capital outlay and debt service trust fundâ in the state treasury (hereinafter referred to as âcapital outlay fundâ), and used only as provided herein.The capital outlay fund shall be administered by the state board of education as created and constituted by Section 2 of Article IX of the Constitution of Florida as revised in 1968 (hereinafter referred to as âstate boardâ), or by such other instrumentality of the state which shall hereafter succeed by law to the powers, duties and functions of the state board, including the powers, duties and functions of the state board provided in this subsection (a)(2).

All such bonds shall mature not later than thirty years after the date of issuance thereof. All other details of such bonds shall be as provided by law or by the proceedings authorizing such bonds; provided, however, that no bonds, except refunding bonds, shall be issued, and no proceeds shall be expended for the cost of any capital project, unless such project has been authorized by the legislature.Bonds issued pursuant to this subsection (a)(2) shall be primarily payable from such revenues derived from gross receipts taxes, and shall be additionally secured by the full faith and credit of the state. No such bonds shall ever be issued in an amount exceeding ninety percent of the amount which the state board determines can be serviced by the revenues derived from the gross receipts taxes accruing thereafter under the provisions of this subsection (a)(2), and such determination shall be conclusive.The moneys in the capital outlay fund in each fiscal year shall be used only for the following purposes and in the following order of priority:a.

For the deposit into any reserve funds provided for in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of bonds of any amounts required to be deposited in such reserve funds in such fiscal year;c. For direct payment of the cost or any part of the cost of any capital project for the state system theretofore authorized by the legislature, or for the purchase or redemption of outstanding bonds in accordance with the provisions of the proceedings which authorized the issuance of such bonds, or for the purpose of maintaining, restoring, or repairing existing public educational facilities.(b) REFUNDING BONDS. Revenue bonds to finance the cost of state capital projects issued prior to the date this revision becomes effective, including projects of the Florida state turnpike authority or its successor but excluding all portions of the state highway system, may be refunded as provided by law without vote of the electors at a lower net average interest cost rate by the issuance of bonds maturing not later than the obligations refunded, secured by the same revenues only.(c) MOTOR VEHICLE FUEL TAXES.(1) A state tax, designated âsecond gas tax,â of two cents per gallon upon gasoline and other like products of petroleum and an equivalent tax upon other sources of energy used to propel motor vehicles as levied by 4Article IX, Section 16, of the Constitution of 1885, as amended, is hereby continued. The proceeds of said tax shall be placed monthly in the state roads distribution fund in the state treasury.(2) 4Article IX, Section 16, of the Constitution of 1885, as amended, is adopted by this reference as a part of this revision as completely as though incorporated herein verbatim for the purpose of providing that after the effective date of this revision the proceeds of the âsecond gas taxâ as referred to therein shall be allocated among the several counties in accordance with the formula stated therein to the extent necessary to comply with all obligations to or for the benefit of holders of bonds, revenue certificates and tax anticipation certificates or any refundings thereof secured by any portion of the âsecond gas tax.â(3) No funds anticipated to be allocated under the formula stated in 4Article IX, Section 16, of the Constitution of 1885, as amended, shall be pledged as security for any obligation hereafter issued or entered into, except that any outstanding obligations previously issued pledging revenues allocated under said 4Article IX, Section 16, may be refunded at a lower average net interest cost rate by the issuance of refunding bonds, maturing not later than the obligations refunded, secured by the same revenues and any other security authorized in paragraph (5) of this subsection.(4) Subject to the requirements of paragraph (2) of this subsection and after payment of administrative expenses, the âsecond gas taxâ shall be allocated to the account of each of the several counties in the amounts to be determined as follows: There shall be an initial allocation of one-fourth in the ratio of county area to state area, one-fourth in the ratio of the total county population to the total population of the state in accordance with the latest available federal census, and one-half in the ratio of the total âsecond gas taxâ collected on retail sales or use in each county to the total collected in all counties of the state during the previous fiscal year. If the annual debt service requirements of any obligations issued for any county, including any deficiencies for prior years, secured under paragraph (2) of this subsection, exceeds the amount which would be allocated to that county under the formula set out in this paragraph, the amounts allocated to other counties shall be reduced proportionately.(5) Funds allocated under paragraphs (2) and (4) of this subsection shall be administered by the state board of administration created under Article IV, Section 4. The board shall remit the proceeds of the âsecond gas taxâ in each county account for use in said county as follows: eighty per cent to the state agency supervising the state road system and twenty per cent to the governing body of the county. The percentage allocated to the county may be increased by general law. The proceeds of the âsecond gas taxâ subject to allocation to the several counties under this paragraph (5) shall be used first, for the payment of obligations pledging revenues allocated pursuant to 4Article IX, Section 16, of the Constitution of 1885, as amended, and any refundings thereof; second, for the payment of debt service on bonds issued as provided by this paragraph (5) to finance the acquisition and construction of roads as defined by law; and third, for the acquisition and construction of roads and for road maintenance as authorized by law. When authorized by law, state bonds pledging the full faith and credit of the state may be issued without any election: (i) to refund obligations secured by any portion of the âsecond gas taxâ allocated to a county under 4Article IX, Section 16, of the Constitution of 1885, as amended; (ii) to finance the acquisition and construction of roads in a county when approved by the governing body of the county and the state agency supervising the state road system; and (iii) to refund obligations secured by any portion of the âsecond gas taxâ allocated under paragraph 9(c)(4). No such bonds shall be issued unless a state fiscal agency created by law has made a determination that in no state fiscal year will the debt service requirements of the bonds and all other bonds secured by the pledged portion of the âsecond gas taxâ allocated to the county exceed seventy-five per cent of the pledged portion of the âsecond gas taxâ allocated to that county for the preceding state fiscal year, of the pledged net tolls from existing facilities collected in the preceding state fiscal year, and of the annual average net tolls anticipated during the first five state fiscal years of operation of new projects to be financed, and of any other legally available pledged revenues collected in the preceding state fiscal year.

School bonds for capital outlay, issuance.â(a) Beginning January 1, 1965 and for thirty-five years thereafter, the first proceeds of the revenues derived from the licensing of motor vehicles to the extent necessary to comply with the provisions of this amendment, shall, as collected, be placed monthly in the county capital outlay and debt service school fund in the state treasury, and used only as provided in this amendment. Such revenue shall be distributed annually among the several counties in the ratio of the number of instruction units in each county in each year computed as provided herein. The amount of the first revenues derived from the licensing of motor vehicles to be so set aside in each year and distributed as provided herein shall be an amount equal in the aggregate to the product of four hundred dollars multiplied by the total number of instruction units in all the counties of Florida. The number of instruction units in each county in each year for the purposes of this amendment shall be the greater of (1) the number of instruction units in each county for the school fiscal year 1951-52 computed in the manner heretofore provided by general law, or (2) the number of instruction units in such county for the school fiscal year computed in the manner heretofore or hereafter provided by general law and approved by the state board of education (hereinafter called the state board), or (3) the number of instruction units in each county on behalf of which the state board of education has issued bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates under this amendment which will produce sufficient revenues under this amendment to equal one and one-third times the aggregate amount of principal of and interest on such bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates which will mature and become due in such year, computed in the manner heretofore or hereafter provided by general law and approved by the state board.Such funds so distributed shall be administered by the state board as now created and constituted by Section 3 of Article XII [now s. 2, Article IX] of the Constitution of Florida. For the purposes of this amendment, said state board, as now constituted, shall continue as a body corporate during the life of this amendment and shall have all the powers provided in this amendment in addition to all other constitutional and statutory powers related to the purposes of this amendment heretofore or hereafter conferred upon said board.(b) The state board shall, in addition to its other constitutional and statutory powers, have the management, control and supervision of the proceeds of the first part of the revenues derived from the licensing of motor vehicles provided for in subsection (a). The state board shall also have power, for the purpose of obtaining funds for the use of any county board of public instruction in acquiring, building, constructing, altering, improving, enlarging, furnishing, or equipping capital outlay projects for school purposes, to issue bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates, and also to issue such bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates to pay, fund or refund any bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates theretofore issued by said state board. All such bonds shall bear interest at not exceeding four and one-half per centum per annum and shall mature serially in annual installments commencing not more than three years from the date of issuance thereof and ending not later than thirty years from the date of issuance or January 1, 2000, A.D., whichever is earlier. All such motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates shall bear interest at not exceeding four and one-half per centum per annum and shall mature prior to January 1, 2000, A.D. The state board shall have power to determine all other details of said bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates and to sell at public sale after public advertisement, or exchange said bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates, upon such terms and conditions as the state board shall provide.The state board shall also have power to pledge for the payment of the principal of and interest on such bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates, including refunding bonds or refunding motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates, all or any part from the anticipated revenues to be derived from the licensing of motor vehicles provided for in this amendment and to enter into any covenants and other agreements with the holders of such bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates at the time of the issuance thereof concerning the security thereof and the rights of the holders thereof, all of which covenants and agreements shall constitute legally binding and irrevocable contracts with such holders and shall be fully enforceable by such holders in any court of competent jurisdiction.No such bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates shall ever be issued by the state board until after the adoption of a resolution requesting the issuance thereof by the county board of public instruction of the county on behalf of which such obligations are to be issued. The state board of education shall limit the amount of such bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates which can be issued on behalf of any county to seventy-five per cent of the amount which it determines can be serviced by the revenue accruing to the county under the provisions of this amendment, and such determination shall be conclusive. All such bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates shall be issued in the name of the state board of education but shall be issued for and on behalf of the county board of public instruction requesting the issuance thereof, and no election or approval of qualified electors or freeholders shall be required for the issuance thereof.(c) The State Board shall in each year use the funds distributable pursuant to this Amendment to the credit of each county only in the following manner and order of priority:(1) To pay all amounts of principal and interest maturing in such year on any bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates issued under the authority hereof, including refunding bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates, issued on behalf of the Board of Public Instruction of such county; subject, however, to any covenants or agreements made by the State Board concerning the rights between holders of different issues of such bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates, as herein authorized.(2) To establish and maintain a sinking fund or funds to meet future requirements for debt service, or reserves therefor, on bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates issued on behalf of the Board of Public Instruction of such county, under the authority hereof, whenever the State Board shall deem it necessary or advisable, and in such amounts and under such terms and conditions as the State Board shall in its discretion determine.(3) To distribute annually to the several Boards of Public Instruction of the counties for use in payment of debt service on bonds heretofore or hereafter issued by any such Board where the proceeds of the bonds were used, or are to be used, in the construction, acquisition, improvement, enlargement, furnishing, or equipping of capital outlay projects in such county, and which capital outlay projects have been approved by the Board of Public Instruction of the county, pursuant to a survey or surveys conducted subsequent to July 1, 1947 in the county, under regulations prescribed by the State Board to determine the capital outlay needs of the county.The State Board shall have power at the time of issuance of any bonds by any Board of Public Instruction to covenant and agree with such Board as to the rank and priority of payments to be made for different issues of bonds under this Subsection (3), and may further agree that any amounts to be distributed under this Subsection (3) may be pledged for the debt service on bonds issued by any Board of Public Instruction and for the rank and priority of such pledge. Any such covenants or agreements of the State Board may be enforced by any holders of such bonds in any court of competent jurisdiction.(4) To distribute annually to the several Boards of Public Instruction of the counties for the payment of the cost of the construction, acquisition, improvement, enlargement, furnishing, or equipping of capital outlay projects for school purposes in such county as shall be requested by resolution of the County Board of Public Instruction of such county.(5) When all major capital outlay needs of a county have been met as determined by the State Board, on the basis of a survey made pursuant to regulations of the State Board and approved by the State Board, all such funds remaining shall be distributed annually and used for such school purposes in such county as the Board of Public Instruction of the county shall determine, or as may be provided by general law.(d) Capital outlay projects of a county shall be eligible to participate in the funds accruing under this Amendment and derived from the proceeds of bonds and motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates and from the motor vehicle license taxes, only in the order of priority of needs, as shown by a survey or surveys conducted in the county under regulations prescribed by the State Board, to determine the capital outlay needs of the county and approved by the State Board; provided, that the priority of such projects may be changed from time to time upon the request of the Board of Public Instruction of the county and with the approval of the State Board; and provided further, that this Subsection (d) shall not in any manner affect any covenant, agreement, or pledge made by the State Board in the issuance by said State Board of any bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates, or in connection with the issuance of any bonds of any Board of Public Instruction of any county.(e) The State Board may invest any sinking fund or funds created pursuant to this Amendment in direct obligations of the United States of America or in the bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates, matured or to mature, issued by the State Board on behalf of the Board of Public Instruction of any county.(f) The State Board shall have power to make and enforce all rules and regulations necessary to the full exercise of the powers herein granted and no legislation shall be required to render this Amendment of full force and operating effect from and after January 1, 1953. The Legislature shall not reduce the levies of said motor vehicle license taxes during the life of this Amendment to any degree which will fail to provide the full amount necessary to comply with the provisions of this Amendment and pay the necessary expenses of administering the laws relating to the licensing of motor vehicles, and shall not enact any law having the effect of withdrawing the proceeds of such motor vehicle license taxes from the operation of this Amendment and shall not enact any law impairing or materially altering the rights of the holders of any bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates issued pursuant to this Amendment or impairing or altering any covenant or agreement of the State Board, as provided in such bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates.The State Board shall have power to appoint such persons and fix their compensation for the administration of the provisions of this Amendment as it shall deem necessary, and the expenses of the State Board in administering the provisions of this Amendment shall be prorated among the various counties and paid out of the proceeds of the bonds or motor vehicle tax anticipation certificates or from the funds distributable to each county on the same basis as such motor vehicle license taxes are distributable to the various counties under the provisions of this Amendment. Interest or profit on sinking fund investments shall accrue to the counties in proportion to their respective equities in the sinking fund or funds.History.âAdded, S.J.R. 106, 1951; adopted 1952; (a), (b) Am.

http://www.politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2016/oct/28/john-skvarla/top-north-carolina-economic-official-says-hb2-has-/	"Says HB2 ""hasnât moved the needle one iota"" on North Carolinaâs economy."	mostly false	['Corporations', 'Economy', 'Gays and Lesbians', 'State Finances', 'States']	http://www.charlotteobserver.com/	http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/business/article110775227.html	2016/10/28	North Carolina offered more than double the state incentives that real estate research firm CoStar Group ultimately accepted from the state of Virginia to open a major new facility in Richmond, according to documents obtained by the Observer Thursday. CoStar had zeroed in on a location in Charlotte, but its board decided against the move because of opposition to the stateâs controversial House Bill 2, which limits protections for LGBT individuals, sources have told the Observer. The project would have brought 732 high-paying jobs here over next three years. A Sept. 12 proposal for the project â code named âProject Tigerâ â shows CoStar had considered a $13 million investment in Charlotte for a new facility, which it was considering owning or leasing. The proposal shows that the state would have offered about $8.3 million in tax incentives paid out over 12 years for the project, plus about $1.1 million for customized job training. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe approved a $4 million grant for the project, among other incentives, according to a news release this week. Those other incentives included customized job training, without a dollar amount specified. Never miss a local story. Sign up today for a free 30 day free trial of unlimited digital access. The average annual salary of the jobs brought to Charlotte would have topped $56,000, according to a state form CoStar submitted. All of the jobs would have been new hires, with no relocations from other facilities, CoStar said. CoStar this week confirmed it had been considering Charlotte as a finalist for the expansion, along with Richmond, Atlanta and Kansas City, but declined to comment on why it picked Richmond. In its proposal, CoStar said it was seeking to open a new research center in a âmid-tierâ market with lower-than-average cost of living, such as Charlotte, in order to lower its costs. The Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina, which recruits businesses to the state, did not respond to a request for comment Thursday. But on Wednesday, Chris Chung, the partnershipâs executive director, acknowledged Charlotte was among the cities considered for the expansion. âCoStar is a well-known company with a great product that many of us in the economic development and real estate fields are familiar with or use regularly,â said Chung, who did not comment on discussions with the company. Gov. Pat McCroryâs office did not respond to a request for comment Thursday. The state documents list CoStarâs hiring plans by position, along with salaries. The company was planning to hire 200 tenant research associates at $48,400, 424 portfolio research associates at $55,000, 71 research managers at $82,500, 10 research directors at $126,00 and three vice presidents at $171,600, in addition to administrative personnel. A letter from July showed that the city would have offered $100,383 in incentives for the project, and Mecklenburg County would have offered $171,053. The September proposal did not include the city and county incentives figures. Sources familiar with the matter told the Observer this week that CoStar officials had earlier focused their search on a new office tower under construction at 615 S. College St. in uptown Charlotte, where it would have been an anchor tenant. Real estate brokers, especially those leasing new office towers, have been anxious about the potential fallout from HB2 for months. About 1.5 million square feet of new office space is set to open in Charlotte within the next year or so, most of it speculative â meaning itâs being built without tenants already signed up. Out-of-state business relocations are often key to filling new, speculative office space, because they donât just shuffle tenants around from existing buildings. McCrory signed HB2 into law in March to overturn a Charlotte nondiscrimination ordinance supported by Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts that would have allowed transgender individuals to use bathrooms that match their gender identity. Since HB2âs passage, Charlotte has lost major sporting events such as the 2017 NBA All-Star Game, concerts by major performers and business expansions such as a 400-job PayPal operations center.

WILLIAMS: Senator Clinton, we're here in Ohio. Senator Obama is here. This is the debate. You would agree the difference in tone over just those 48 hours was striking. SEN. CLINTON: Well, this is a contested campaign. And as I have said many times, I have a great deal of respect for Senator Obama, but we have differences. And in the last several days, some of those differences in tactics and the choices that Senator Obama's campaign has made regarding flyers and mailers and other information that has been put out about my health care plan and my position on NAFTA have been very disturbing to me. And therefore, I think it's important that you stand up for yourself and you point out these differences so that voters can have the information they need to make a decision. You know, for example, it's been unfortunate that Senator Obama has consistently said that I would force people to have health care whether they could afford it or not. You know, health care reform and achieving universal health care is a passion of mine. It is something I believe in with all my heart. And every day that I'm campaigning, and certainly here throughout Ohio, I've met so many families -- happened again this morning in Lorain -- who are just devastated because they don't get the health care they deserve to have. And unfortunately it's a debate we should have that is accurate and is based in facts about my plan and Senator Obama's plan, because my plan will cover everyone and it will be affordable. And on many occasions, independent experts have concluded exactly that. And Senator Obama's plan does not cover everyone. It would leave, give or take, 15 million people out. So we should have a good debate that uses accurate information, not false, misleading, and discredited information, especially on something as important as whether or not we will achieve quality, affordable health care for everyone. That's my goal. That's what I'm fighting for, and I'm going to stand up for that. MR. WILLIAMS: On the topic of accurate information, and to that end, one of the things that has happened over the past 36 hours -- a photo went out the website The Drudge Report, showing Senator Obama in the native garb of a nation he was visiting, as you have done in a host country on a trip overseas. Matt Drudge on his website said it came from a source inside the Clinton campaign. Can you say unequivocally here tonight it did not? SEN. CLINTON: Well, so far as I know, it did not. And I certainly know nothing about it and have made clear that that's not the kind of behavior that I condone or expect from the people working in my campaign. But we have no evidence where it came from. So I think that it's clear what I would do if it were someone in my campaign, as I have in the past: asking people to leave my campaign if they do things that I disagree with. MR. WILLIAMS: Senator Obama, your response. SEN. OBAMA: Well, first of all, I take Senator Clinton at her word that she knew nothing about the photo. So I think that's something that we can set aside. I do want to focus on the issue of health care because Senator Clinton has suggested that the flyer that we put out, the mailing that we put out, was inaccurate. Now, keep in mind that I have consistently said that Senator Clinton's got a good health care plan. I think I have a good health care plan. I think mine is better, but I have said that 95 percent of our health care plan is similar. I have endured over the course of this campaign repeatedly negative mailing from Senator Clinton in Iowa, in Nevada and other places suggesting that I want to leave 15 million people out. According to Senator Clinton, that is accurate. I dispute it, and I think it is inaccurate. On the other hand, I don't fault Senator Clinton for wanting to point out what she thinks is an advantage to her plan. The reason she thinks that there are more people covered under her plan than mine is because of a mandate. That is not a mandate for the government to provide coverage to everybody; it is a mandate that every individual purchase health care. And the mailing that we put out accurately indicates that the main difference between Senator Clinton's plan and mine is the fact that she would force in some fashion individuals to purchase health care. If it was not affordable, she would still presumably force them to have it, unless there is a hardship exemption as they've done in Massachusetts, which leaves 20 percent of the uninsured out. And if that's the case, then, in fact, her claim that she covers everybody is not accurate. Now, Senator Clinton has not indicated how she would enforce this mandate. She hasn't indicated what level of subsidy she would provide to assure that it was, in fact, affordable. And so it is entirely legitimate for us to point out these differences. But I think it's very important to understand the context of this, and that is that Senator Clinton has -- her campaign, at least -- has constantly sent out negative attacks on us, e-mail, robocalls, flyers, television ads, radio calls. And, you know, we haven't whined about it because I understand that's the nature of these campaigns, but to suggest somehow that our mailing is somehow different from the kinds of approaches that Senator Clinton has taken throughout this campaign I think is simply not accurate. SEN. CLINTON: But I have to -- I have to respond to that because this is not just any issue, and certainly we've had a vigorous back and forth on both sides of our campaign. But this is an issue that goes to the heart of whether or not this country will finally do what is right, and that is to provide quality affordable health care to every single person. Senator Obama has a mandate in his plan. It's a mandate on parents to provide health insurance for their children. That's about 150 million people who would be required to do that. The difference between Senator Obama and myself is that I know, from the work I've done on health care for many years, that if everyone's not in the system we will continue to let the insurance companies do what's called cherry picking -- pick those who get insurance and leave others out. We will continue to have a hidden tax, so that when someone goes to the emergency room without insurance -- 15 million or however many -- that amount of money that will be used to take care of that person will be then spread among all the rest of us. And most importantly, you know, the kind of attack on my health care plan, which the University of Pennsylvania and others have said is misleading -- that attack goes right to the heart of whether or not we will be able to achieve universal health care. That's a core Democratic Party value. It's something that ever since Harry Truman we have stood for. And what I find regrettable is that in Senator Obama's mailing that he has sent out across Ohio, it is almost as though the health insurance companies and the Republicans wrote it, because in my plan there is enough money, according to the independent experts who've evaluated it, to provide the kind of subsidies so that everyone would be able to afford it. It is not the same as a single state trying to do this, because the federal government has many more resources at its disposal. SEN. SEN. CLINTON: So I think it's imperative that we stand as Democrats for universal health care. I've staked out a claim for that. Senator Edwards did. Others have. But Senator Obama has not. MR. WILLIAMS: Senator Obama, a quick response. SEN. OBAMA: Well, look, I believe in universal health care, as does Senator Clinton. And this is -- this is, I think, the point of the debate, is that Senator Clinton repeatedly claims that I don't stand for universal health care. And, you know, for Senator Clinton to say that, I think, is simply not accurate. Every expert has said that anybody who wants health care under my plan will be able to obtain it. President Clinton's own secretary of Labor has said that my plan does more to reduce costs and as a consequence makes sure that the people who need health care right now all across Ohio, all across Texas, Rhode Island, Vermont, all across America, will be able to obtain it. And we do more to reduce costs than any other plan that's been out there. Now, I have no objection to Senator Clinton thinking that her approach is superior, but the fact of the matter is, is that if, as we've heard tonight, we still don't know how Senator Clinton intends to enforce a mandate, and if we don't know the level of subsidies that she's going to provide, then you can have a situation, which we are seeing right now in the state of Massachusetts, where people are being fined for not having purchased health care but choose to accept the fine because they still can't afford it, even with the subsidies. And they are then worse off. They then have no health care and are paying a fine above and beyond that. MR. WILLIAMS: Thank you. SEN. OBAMA: That is a genuine difference between myself and Senator Clinton. And the last point I would make is, the insurance companies actually are happy to have a mandate. The insurance companies don't mind making sure that everybody has to purchase their product. That's not something they're objecting to. The question is, are we going to make sure that it is affordable for everybody? And that's my goal when I'm president of the United States. SEN. CLINTON: You know, Brian -- Brian, wait a minute. I've got -- this is too important. You know, Senator Obama has a mandate. He would enforce the mandate by requiring parents to buy insurance for their children. SEN. OBAMA: This is true. SEN. CLINTON: That is the case. If you have a mandate, it has to be enforceable. So there's no difference here. SEN. OBAMA: No, there is a difference. SEN. CLINTON: It's just that I know that parents who get sick have terrible consequences for their children. So you can insure the children, and then you've got the bread-winner who can't afford health insurance or doesn't have it for him or herself. And in fact, it would be as though Franklin Roosevelt said let's make Social Security voluntary -- that's -- you know, that's -- let's let everybody get in it if they can afford it -- or if President Johnson said let's make Medicare voluntary. SEN. SEN. CLINTON: What we have said is that at the point of employment, at the point of contact with various government agencies, we would have people signed up. It's like when you get a 401(k), it's your employer. The employer automatically enrolls you. You would be enrolled. And under my plan, it is affordable because, number one, we have enough money in our plan. A comparison of the plans like the ones we're proposing found that actually I would cover nearly everybody at a much lower cost than Senator Obama's plan because we would not only provide these health care tax credits, but I would limit the amount of money that anyone ever has to pay for a premium to a low percentage of your income. So it will be affordable. Now, if you want to say that we shouldn't try to get everyone into health insurance, that's a big difference, because I believe if we don't have universal health care, we will never provide prevention. I have the most aggressive measures to reduce costs and improve quality. And time and time again, people who have compared our two approaches have concluded that. SEN. OBAMA: Brian, I'm sorry. SEN. CLINTON: So let's -- let's have a debate about the facts. SEN. OBAMA: I'm going to get filibuttered -- I'm getting filibustered a little bit here. MR. WILLIAMS: The last answer on this topic. SEN. OBAMA: I mean, it is just not accurate to say that Senator Clinton does more to control costs than mine. That is not the case. There are many experts who have concluded that she does not. I do provide a mandate for children, because, number one, we have created a number of programs in which we can have greater assurance that those children will be covered at an affordable price. On the -- on the point of many adults, we don't want to put in a situation in which, on the front end, we are mandating them, we are forcing them to purchase insurance, and if the subsidies are inadequate, the burden is on them, and they will be penalized. And that is what Senator Clinton's plan does. Now, I am -- I am happy to have a discussion with Senator Clinton about how we can both achieve the goal of universal health care. What I do not accept -- and which is what Senator Clinton has consistently done and in fact the same experts she cites basically say there's no real difference between our plans, that are -- that they are not substantial. But it has to do with how we are going to achieve universal health care. That is an area where I believe that if we make it affordable, people will purchase it. In fact, Medicare Part B is not mandated, it is voluntary. And yet people over 65 choose to purchase it, Hillary, and the reason they choose to purchase it is because it's a good deal. And if people in Cleveland or anywhere in Ohio end up seeing a plan that is affordable for them, I promise you they are snatching it up because they are desperate to get health care. And that's what I intend to provide as president of the United States. MR. WILLIAMS: Senator, I'm going to change the subject. SEN. CLINTON: About 20 percent of -- about 20 percent of the people who are uninsured have the means to buy insurance. SEN. SEN. OBAMA: Which is why I cover them. SEN. CLINTON: -- except when the illness or the accident strikes. And what Senator Obama has said, that then, once you get to the hospital, you'll be forced to buy insurance, I don't think that's a good idea. SEN. SEN. CLINTON: -- and we ought to make sure we cover everyone. That is the only way to get to universal health care coverage. SEN. SEN. SEN. SEN. CLINTON: -- and I believe that we can achieve it. But if we don't even have a plan to get there, and we start out by leaving people, you'll never ever control costs, improve quality, and cover everyone. SEN. Senator Clinton is talking about will, in fact, have coverage. MR. WILLIAMS: Well, a 16-minute discussion on health care is certainly a start. SEN. CLINTON: Well, there's hardly anything be more important? I think it would be good to talk about health care and how we're we going get to universal health care. MR. WILLIAMS: I -- well, here's another important topic, and that's NAFTA, especially where we're sitting here tonight. And this is a tough one depending on who you ask. The Houston Chronicle has called it a big win for Texas, but Ohio Democratic Senator Brown, your colleague in the Senate, has called it a job-killing trade agreement. Senator Clinton, you've campaigned in south Texas. You've campaigned here in Ohio. Who's right? SEN. CLINTON: Well, can I just point out that in the last several debates, I seem to get the first question all the time. And I don't mind. I -- you know, I'll be happy to field them, but I do find it curious, and if anybody saw ""Saturday Night Live,"" you know, maybe we should ask Barack if he's comfortable and needs another pillow. (Laughter, boos.) I just find it kind of curious that I keep getting the first question on all of these issues. But I'm happy to answer it. You know, I have been a critic of NAFTA from the very beginning. I didn't have a public position on it, because I was part of the administration, but when I started running for the Senate, I have been a critic. I've said it was flawed. I said that it worked in some parts of our country, and I've seen the results in Texas. I was in Laredo in the last couple of days. It's the largest inland port in America now. So clearly, some parts of our country have been benefited. But what I have seen, where I represent up-state New York, I've seen the factories closed and moved. I've talked to so many people whose children have left because they don't have a good shot. I've had to negotiate to try to keep factories open, sometimes successfully, sometimes not, because the companies got tax benefits to actually move to another country. So what I have said is that we need to have a plan to fix NAFTA. I would immediately have a trade timeout, and I would take that time to try to fix NAFTA by making it clear that we'll have core labor and environmental standards in the agreement. We will do everything we can to make it enforceable, which it is not now. We will stop the kind of constant sniping at our protections for our workers that can come from foreign companies because they have the authority to try to sue to overturn what we do to keep our workers safe. This is rightly a big issue in Ohio. And I have laid out my criticism, but in addition my plan, for actually fixing NAFTA. Again, I have received a lot of incoming criticism from Senator Obama. And the Cleveland Plain Dealer examined Senator Obama's attacks on me regarding NAFTA and said they were erroneous. So I would hope that, again, we can get to a debate about what the real issues are and where we stand because we do need to fix NAFTA. It is not working. It was, unfortunately, heavily disadvantaging many of our industries, particularly manufacturing. I have a record of standing up for that, of chairing the Manufacturing Caucus in the Senate, and I will take a tough position on these trade agreements. MR. WILLIAMS: Senator, thank you. Before we turn the questioning over to Tim Russert, Senator Obama. SEN. OBAMA: Well, I think that it is inaccurate for Senator Clinton to say that she's always opposed NAFTA. In her campaign for Senate, she said that NAFTA, on balance, had been good for New York and good for America. I disagree with that. I think that it did not have the labor standards and environmental standards that were required in order to not just be good for Wall Street but also be good for Main Street. And if you travel through Youngstown and you travel through communities in my home state of Illinois, you will see entire cities that have been devastated as a consequence of trade agreements that were not adequately structured to make sure that U.S. workers had a fair deal. Now, I think that Senator Clinton has shifted positions on this and believes that we should have strong environmental standards and labor standards, and I think that's a good thing. But you know, when I first moved to Chicago in the early '80s and I saw steelworkers who had been laid off of their plants -- black, white, and Hispanic -- and I worked on the streets of Chicago to try to help them find jobs, I saw then that the net costs of many of these trade agreements, if they're not properly structured, can be devastating. And as president of the United States, I intend to make certain that every agreement that we sign has the labor standards, the environmental standards and the safety standards that are going to protect not just workers, but also consumers. We can't have toys with lead paint in them that our children are playing with. We can't have medicines that are actually making people more sick instead of better because they're produced overseas. We have to stop providing tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States of America. And if we do those things, then I believe that we can actually get Ohio back on the path of growth and jobs and prosperity. If we don't, then we're going to continue to see the kind of deterioration that we've seen economically here in this state. MR. RUSSERT: I want to ask you both about NAFTA because the record, I think, is clear. And I want to -- Senator Clinton. Senator Obama said that you did say in 2004 that on balance NAFTA has been good for New York and America. You did say that. When President Clinton signed this bill -- and this was after he negotiated two new side agreements, for labor and environment -- President Clinton said it would be a force for economic growth and social progress. You said in '96 it was proving its worth as free and fair trade. You said that -- in 2000 -- it was a good idea that took political courage. So your record is pretty clear. Based on that, and which you're now expressing your discomfort with it, in the debate that Al Gore had with Ross Perot, Al Gore said the following: ""If you don't like NAFTA and what it's done, we can get out of it in six months. The president can say to Canada and Mexico, we are out. This has not been a good agreement."" Will U.S. president say we are out of NAFTA in six months? SEN. CLINTON: I have said that I will renegotiate NAFTA, so obviously, you'd have to say to Canada and Mexico that that's exactly what we're going to do. SEN. CLINTON: Yes, I am serious. MR. RUSSERT: You will get out. You will notify Mexico and Canada, NAFTA is gone in six months. SEN. CLINTON: No, I will say we will opt out of NAFTA unless we renegotiate it, and we renegotiate on terms that are favorable to all of America. But let's be fair here, Tim. There are lots of parts of New York that have benefitted, just like there are lots of parts of Texas that have benefitted. The problem is in places like upstate New York, places like Youngstown, Toledo, and others throughout Ohio that have not benefitted. And if you look at what I have been saying, it has been consistent. You know, Senator Obama told the farmers of Illinois a couple of years ago that he wanted more trade agreements. SEN. MR. RUSSERT: -- because this was something that you wrote about as a real success for your husband. You said it was good on balance for New York and America in 2004, and now you're in Ohio and your words are much different, Senator. The record is very clear. SEN. CLINTON: Well, I -- I -- you don't have all the record because you can go back and look at what I've said consistently. And I haven't just said things; I have actually voted to toughen trade agreements, to try to put more teeth into our enforcement mechanisms. And I will continue to do so. But you know, Tim, when you look at what the Cleveland Plain Dealer said when they examined the kind of criticism that Senator Obama was making of me -- it's not me saying it -- they said it was erroneous. And it was erroneous because it didn't look at the entire picture, both at what I've said and what I've done. But let's talk about what we're going to do. It is not enough just to criticize NAFTA, which I have, and for some years now. I have put forward a very specific plan about what I would do, and it does include telling Canada and Mexico that we will opt out unless we renegotiate the core labor and environmental standards -- not side agreements, but core agreements; that we will enhance the enforcement mechanism; and that we will have a very clear view of how we're going to review NAFTA going forward to make sure it works, and we're going to take out the ability of foreign companies to sue us because of what we do to protect our workers. I would also say that you can go back and look at from the very beginning -- I think David Gergen was on TV today remembering that I was very skeptical about it. It has worked in some parts of America. It has not worked in Ohio. It has not worked in upstate New York. And since I've been in the Senate -- neither of us voted on this. That wasn't something either of us got to cast an independent vote on. Since I have been in the Senate, I have worked to try to ameliorate the impact of these trade agreements. MR. RUSSERT: But let me button this up. Absent the change that you're suggesting, you are willing to opt out of NAFTA in six months? SEN. CLINTON: I'm confident that as president, when I say we will opt out unless we renegotiate, we will be able to renegotiate. MR. RUSSERT: Senator Obama, you did in 2004 talk to farmers and suggest that NAFTA had been helpful. The Associated Press today ran a story about NAFTA, saying that you have been consistently ambivalent towards the issue. Simple question: Will you, as president, say to Canada and Mexico, ""This has not worked for us; we are out""? SEN. OBAMA: I will make sure that we renegotiate, in the same way that Senator Clinton talked about. And I think actually Senator Clinton's answer on this one is right. I think we should use the hammer of a potential opt-out as leverage to ensure that we actually get labor and environmental standards that are enforced. And that is not what has been happening so far. That is something that I have been consistent about. I have to say, Tim, with respect to my position on this, when I ran for the United States Senate, the Chicago Tribune, which was adamantly pro-NAFTA, noted that, in their endorsement of me, they were endorsing me despite my strong opposition to NAFTA. And that conversation that I had with the Farm Bureau, I was not ambivalent at all. What I said was that NAFTA and other trade deals can be beneficial to the United States because I believe every U.S. worker is as productive as any worker around the world, and we can compete with anybody. And we can't shy away from globalization. We can't draw a moat around us. But what I did say, in that same quote, if you look at it, was that the problem is we've been negotiating just looking at corporate profits and what's good for multinationals, and we haven't been looking at what's good for communities here in Ohio, in my home state of Illinois, and across the country. And as president, what I want to be is an advocate on behalf of workers. Look, you know, when I go to these plants, I meet people who are proud of their jobs. They are proud of the products that they've created. They have built brands and profits for their companies. And when they see jobs shipped overseas and suddenly they are left not just without a job, but without health care, without a pension, and are having to look for seven-buck-an-hour jobs at the local fast-food joint, that is devastating on them, but it's also devastating on the community. That's not the way that we're going to prosper as we move forward. MR. RUSSERT: Senator, two journalists here in Ohio wrote a piece called ""Business as Usual,"" which is very well known, suggesting it wasn't trade or manufacturing jobs that were being lost because of it, but rather business as usual: lack of patents, lack of innovation, lack of investment, 70 percent of the Ph.D.s in biology, chemistry, engineering leaving the state. The fact is, exports now have the highest share of our national income ever. Ohio ranks fourth in terms of exports to Canada and Mexico. Are you sure this has not been better for Ohio than you're suggesting? SEN. OBAMA: I'm positive it hasn't been better for Ohio. But you are making a very legitimate point, which is, is that this trade (can/can't ?) be the only part of our economic agenda. But we've seen seven years in which we have a president who has been looking out for the well-heeled and people who are doing very well in the global economy, in the financial industries, in the telecommunications industries, and has not been looking out for ordinary workers. What do we have to do? We're going to have to invest in infrastructure to make sure that we're competitive. And I've got a plan to do that. We're going to have to invest in science and technology. We've got to vastly improve our education system. We have to look at energy and the potential for creating green jobs that can not just save on our energy costs but, more importantly, can create jobs in building windmills that will produce manufacturing jobs here in Ohio, can put rural communities back on their feet by working on alternative fuels, making buildings more energy efficient. We can hire young people who are out of work and put them to work in the trade. So there are all sorts of things that we're going to have to do to make the United States economy much more competitive, and those are plans that I have put forward in this campaign and I expect to pursue as president of the United States of America. MR. RUSSERT: Senator Clinton, on the issue of jobs, I watched you the other day with your economic blueprint in Wisconsin saying, this is my plan; hold me accountable. And I've had a chance to read it very carefully. It does say that you pledge to create 5 million new jobs over 10 years. And I was reminded of your campaign in 2000 in Buffalo, my hometown, just three hours down Route 90, where you pledged 200,000 new jobs for upstate New York. There's been a net loss of 30,000 jobs. And when you were asked about your pledge, your commitment, you told The Buffalo News, ""I might have been a little exuberant."" Tonight will you say that the pledge of 5 million jobs might be a little exuberant? SEN. CLINTON: No, Tim, because what happened in 2000 is that I thought Al Gore was going to be president. And when I made the pledge I was counting on having a Democratic White House, a Democratic president who shared my values about what we needed to do to make the economy work for everyone and to create shared prosperity. And as you know, despite the difficulties of the Bush administration and a Republican Congress for six years of my first term I have worked very hard to create jobs but obviously as president I will have a lot more tools at my disposal. And the reason why we can create at least 5 million new jobs -- I mean, this is not a big leap. Twenty-two point seven million new jobs were created during the eight years of the Clinton administration under my husband. We can create at least 5 million new jobs. I'm not just talking about it. I helped to pass legislation to begin a training program for green collar jobs. I want to see people throughout Ohio being trained to do the work that will put solar panels on roofs, install wind turbines, do geothermal, take advantage of biofuels, and I know that if we had put $5 billion into the stimulus package to really invest in the training and the tax incentives that would have created those jobs as the Democrats wanted, as I originally proposed, we would be on the way to creating those. You know, take a country like Germany. They made a big bet on solar power. They have a smaller economy and population than ours. They've created several hundred thousand new jobs, and these are jobs that can't be outsourced. These are jobs that have to be done in Youngstown, in Dayton, in Cincinnati. These are jobs that we can create here with the right combination of tax incentives, training, and a commitment to following through. So I do think that at least 5 million jobs are fully capable of being produced within the next 10 years. MR. WILLIAMS: Senator Obama, yesterday Senator Clinton gave a speech on foreign policy and I'm going to read you a quote from it. Quote, ""We've seen the tragic result of having a president who had neither the experience nor the wisdom to manage our foreign policy and safeguard our national security. We cannot let that happen again. America has already taken that chance one time too many."" Some of the comments in the speech were more pointed. The senator has compared your foreign policy expertise to that of George W. Bush at the same period. Provided you could be going into a general election against a Republican with vast foreign policy expertise and credibility on national security, how were her comments about you unfair? SEN. OBAMA: Well, Senator Clinton I think equates experience with longevity in Washington. I don't think the American people do and I don't think that if you look at the judgments that we've made over the last several years that that's the accurate measure. On the most important foreign policy decision that we face in a generation -- whether or not to go into Iraq -- I was very clear as to why we should not -- that it would fan the flames of anti-American sentiment -- that it would distract us from Afghanistan -- that it would cost us billions of dollars, thousands of lives, and would not make us more safe, and I do not believe it has made us more safe. Al Qaeda is stronger than anytime since 2001 according to our own intelligence estimates, and we are bogged down in a war that John McCain now suggests might go on for another 100 years, spending $12 billion a month that could be invested in the kinds of programs that both Senator Clinton and I are talking about. So on Pakistan, during the summer I suggested that not only do we have to take a new approach towards Musharraf but we have to get much more serious about hunting down terrorists that are currently in northwestern Pakistan. And many people said at the time well, you can't target those terrorists because Musharraf is our ally and we don't want to offend him. In fact, what we had was neither stability in Pakistan nor democracy in Pakistan, and had we pursued a policy that was looking at democratic reforms in Pakistan we would be much further along now than we are. So on the critical issues that actually matter I believe that my judgment has been sound and it has been judgment that I think has been superior to Senator Clinton's as well as Senator McCain's. MR. WILLIAMS: Well, Senator Clinton, in the last debate you seemed to take a pass on the question of whether or not Senator Obama was qualified to be commander in chief. Is your contention in this latest speech that America would somehow be taking a chance on Senator Obama as commander in chief? SEN. CLINTON: Well, I have put forth my extensive experience in foreign policy, you know, helping to support the peace process in Northern Ireland, negotiating to open borders so that refugees fleeing ethnic cleansing would be safe, going to Beijing and standing up for women's rights as human rights and so much else. And every time the question about qualifications and credentials for commander in chief are raised, Senator Obama rightly points to the speech he gave in 2002. He's to be commended for having given the speech. Many people gave speeches against the war then, and the fair comparison is he didn't have responsibility, he didn't have to vote; by 2004 he was saying that he basically agreed with the way George Bush was conducting the war. And when he came to the Senate, he and I have voted exactly the same. We have voted for the money to fund the war until relatively recently. So the fair comparison was when we both had responsibility, when it wasn't just a speech but it was actually action, where is the difference? Where is the comparison that would in some way give a real credibility to the speech that he gave against the war? And on a number of other issues, I just believe that, you know, as Senator Obama said, yes, last summer he basically threatened to bomb Pakistan, which I don't think was a particularly wise position to take. I have long advocated a much tougher approach to Musharraf and to Pakistan, and have pushed the White House to do that. And I disagree with his continuing to say that he would meet with some of the worst dictators in the world without preconditions and without the real, you know, understanding of what we would get from it. So I think you've got to look at, you know, what I have done over a number of years, traveling on behalf of our country to more than 80 countries, meeting and working out a lot of different issues that are important to our national security and our foreign policy and our values, serving on the Senate Armed Services Committee for now five years. And I think that, you know, standing on that stage with Senator McCain, if he is, as appears to be, the nominee, I will have a much better case to make on a range of the issues that really America must confront going forward, and will be able to hold my own and make the case for a change in policy that will be better for our country. MR. WILLIAMS: Senator Obama, a quick response. SEN. OBAMA: Let me just follow up. My objections to the war in Iraq were simply -- not simply a speech. I was in the midst of a U.S. Senate campaign. It was a high-stakes campaign. I was one of the most vocal opponents of the war, and I was very specific as to why. And so when I bring this up, it is not simply to say ""I told you so,"" but it is to give you an insight in terms of how I would make decisions. And the fact was, this was a big strategic blunder. It was not a matter of, well, here is the initial decision, but since then we've voted the same way. Once we had driven the bus into the ditch, there were only so many ways we could get out. The question is, who's making the decision initially to drive the bus into the ditch? And the fact is that Senator Clinton often says that she is ready on day one, but in fact she was ready to give in to George Bush on day one on this critical issue. So the same person that she criticizes for having terrible judgment, and we can't afford to have another one of those, in fact she facilitated and enabled this individual to make a decision that has been strategically damaging to the United States of America. With respect to Pakistan, I never said I would bomb Pakistan. What I said was that if we have actionable intelligence against bin Laden or other key al Qaeda officials, and we -- and Pakistan is unwilling or unable to strike against them, we should. And just several days ago, in fact, this administration did exactly that and took out the third-ranking al Qaeda official. That is the position that we should have taken in the first place. And President Musharraf is now indicating that he would generally be more cooperative in some of these efforts, we don't know how the new legislature in Pakistan will respond, but the fact is it was the right strategy. And so my claim is not simply based on a speech. It is based on the judgments that I've displayed during the course of my service on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, while I've been in the United States Senate, and as somebody who, during the course of this campaign, I think has put forward a plan that will provide a clean break against Bush and Cheney. And that is how we're going to be able to debate John McCain. Having a debate with John McCain where your positions were essentially similar until you started running for president, I think, does not put you in a strong position. SEN. MR. RUSSERT: Let me talk about the future -- let me talk the future about Iraq, because this is important, I think, to Democratic voters particularly. You both have pledged the withdrawal of troops from Iraq. You both have said you'd keep a residual force there to protect our embassy, to seek out al Qaeda, to neutralize Iran. If the Iraqi government said, President Clinton or President Obama, you're pulling out your troops this quickly? You're going to be gone in a year, but you're going to leave a residual force behind? No. Get out. Get out now. If you don't want to stay and protect us, we're a sovereign nation. Go home now."" Will you leave? SEN. OBAMA: Well, if the Iraqi government says that we should not be there, then we cannot be there. This is a sovereign government, as George Bush continually reminds us. Now, I think that we can be in a partnership with Iraq to ensure the stability and the safety of the region, to ensure the safety of Iraqis and to meet our national security interests. But in order to do that, we have to send a clear signal to the Iraqi government that we are not going to be there permanently, which is why I have said that as soon as I take office, I will call in the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we will initiate a phased withdrawal, we will be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in. We will give ample time for them to stand up, to negotiate the kinds of agreements that will arrive at the political accommodations that are needed. We will provide them continued support. But it is important for us not to be held hostage by the Iraqi government in a policy that has not made us more safe, that's distracting us from Afghanistan, and is costing us dearly, not only and most importantly in the lost lives of our troops, but also the amount of money that we are spending that is unsustainable and will prevent us from engaging in the kinds of investments in America that will make us more competitive and more safe. MR. RUSSERT: Senator Clinton, if the Iraqis said I'm sorry, we're not happy with this arrangement; if you're not going to stay in total and defend us, get out completely; they are a sovereign nation, you would listen? SEN. CLINTON: Absolutely. And I believe that there is no military solution that the Americans who have been valiant in doing everything they were asked to do can really achieve in the absence of full cooperation from the Iraqi government. MR. RUSSERT: Let me ask -- let me ask you this, Senator. SEN. CLINTON: And they need to take responsibility for themselves. MR. RUSSERT: I want to ask both of you this question, then. If we -- if this scenario plays out and the Americans get out in total and al Qaeda resurges and Iraq goes to hell, do you hold the right, in your mind as American president, to re-invade, to go back into Iraq to stabilize it? SEN. CLINTON: You know, Tim, you ask a lot of hypotheticals. MR. RUSSERT: But this is reality. SEN. CLINTON: No -- well, it isn't reality. You're -- you're -- you're making lots of different hypothetical assessments. I believe that it is in America's interests and in the interests of the Iraqis for us to have an orderly withdrawal. I've been saying for many months that the administration has to do more to plan, and I've been pushing them to actually do it. I've also said that I would begin to withdraw within 60 days based on a plan that I asked begun to be put together as soon as I became president. And I think we can take out one to two brigades a month. I've also been a leader in trying to prevent President Bush from getting us committed to staying in Iraq regardless for as long as Senator McCain and others have said it might be, 50 to a hundred years. So, when you talk about what we need to do in Iraq, we have to make judgments about what is in the best interest of America. And I believe this is in the best interest. But I also have heard Senator Obama refer continually to Afghanistan, and he references being on the Foreign Relations Committee. He chairs the Subcommittee on Europe. It has jurisdiction over NATO. NATO is critical to our mission in Afghanistan. He's held not one substantive hearing to do oversight, to figure out what we can do to actually have a stronger presence with NATO in Afghanistan. You have to look at the entire situation to try to figure out how we can stabilize Afghanistan and begin to put more in there to try to get some kind of success out of it, and you have to work with the Iraqi government so that they take responsibility for their own future. MR. RUSSERT: Senator Obama, I want you to respond to not holding oversight for your subcommittee. But also, do you reserve a right as American president to go back into Iraq, once you have withdrawn, with sizable troops in order to quell any kind of insurrection or civil war? SEN. OBAMA: Well, first of all, I became chairman of this committee at the beginning of this campaign, at the beginning of 2007. So it is true that we haven't had oversight hearings on Afghanistan.

You are already subscribed to this email. I have been very clear in talking to the American people about what I would do with respect to Afghanistan. I think we have to have more troops there to bolster the NATO effort. I think we have to show that we are not maintaining permanent bases in Iraq because Secretary Gates, our current Defense secretary, indicated that we are getting resistance from our allies to put more troops into Afghanistan because they continue to believe that we made a blunder in Iraq and I think even this administration acknowledges now that they are hampered now in doing what we need to do in Afghanistan in part because of what's happened in Iraq. Now, I always reserve the right for the president -- as commander in chief, I will always reserve the right to make sure that we are looking out for American interests. And if al Qaeda is forming a base in Iraq, then we will have to act in a way that secures the American homeland and our interests abroad. So that is true, I think, not just in Iraq, but that's true in other places. That's part of my argument with respect to Pakistan. I think we should always cooperate with our allies and sovereign nations in making sure that we are rooting out terrorist organizations, but if they are planning attacks on Americans, like what happened in 9/11, it is my job -- it will be my job as president to make sure that we are hunting them down. SEN. SEN. MR. WILLIAMS: I've got to get us to a break because television doesn't stop. SEN. CLINTON: -- because the question -- the question was about invading -- invading -- Iraq. MR. WILLIAMS: Can you hold that thought until we come back from a break? We have limited commercial interruptions tonight, and we have to get to one of them now. Despite the snowstorm swirling outside here in Cleveland, we're having a warm night in the arena. We'll return to it right after this. AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Off mike) -- for Hillary! MR. WILLIAMS: -- we are just now welcoming back both of our candidates to the stage and asking our cooperation of the audience. We're back live tonight in Cleveland, Ohio. Senator Obama, we started tonight talking about what could be construed as a little hyperbole. Happens from time to time on the campaign trail. You have recently been called out on some yourself. I urge you to look at your monitor and we'll take a look. SEN. CLINTON: (From videotape.) Now I could stand up here and say: Let's just get everybody together. Let's get unified. The sky will open -- (laughter) -- the light will come down -- (laughter) -- celestial choirs will be singing -- (laughter) -- and everyone will know we should do the right thing, and the world will be perfect! SEN. OBAMA: Sounds good! MR. WILLIAMS: Of all the charges -- (laughter, applause) -- of all the charges and countercharges made tonight, we can confirm that is not you, Senator Obama. SEN. MR. WILLIAMS: That was Senator Clinton. But since we played that tape, albeit in error, for this segment, how did you take that? SEN. MR. WILLIAMS: How did you take those remarks when you heard them? SEN. OBAMA: Well, I thought Senator Clinton showed some good humor there. I would give her points for delivery. SEN. SEN. OBAMA: Look, I understand the broader point that Senator Clinton's been trying to make over the last several weeks. You know, she characterizes it typically as speeches, not solutions, or talk versus action. And as I said in the last debate, I've spent 20 years devoted to working on behalf of families who are having a tough time and they're seeking out the American dream. That's how I started my career in public service, that's how I brought Democrats and Republicans together to provide health care to people who needed it, that's how I helped to reform a welfare system that wasn't working in Illinois, that's how I've provided tax breaks to people who really needed them as opposed to just the wealthy, and so I'm very proud of that track record. And if Senator Clinton thinks that it's all talk, you know, you got to tell that to the wounded warriors at Walter Reed who had to pay for their food and pay for their phone calls before I got to the Senate. And I changed that law. Or talk to those folks who I think have recognized that special interests are dominating Washington and pushing aside the agenda of ordinary families here in Ohio. And so when I pass an ethics reform bill that makes sure that lobbyists can't get gifts or meals or provide corporate jets to members of Congress and they have to disclose who they're getting money from and who they're bundling it for, that moves us in the direction of making sure that we have a government that is more responsive to families. Just one point I'll make, I was in Cincinnati, met with four women at a table like this one. And these were middle-aged women who, as one woman put it, had done everything right and never expected to find themselves in the situation where they don't have health care. One of them doesn't have a job. One of them is looking after an aging parent. Two of them were looking after disabled children. One of them was dipping into their retirement accounts because she had been put on disability on the job. And you hear these stories and what you realize is nobody has been listening to them. That is not who George Bush or Dick Cheney has been advocating for over the last seven years. And so I am not interested in talk. I am not interested in speeches. I would not be running if I wasn't absolutely convinced that I can put an economic agenda forward that is going to provide them with health care, is going to make college more affordable, and is going to get them the kinds of help that they need not to solve all their problems, but at least to be able to achieve the American dream. MR. WILLIAMS: Well, let me ask you, Senator Clinton: What did you mean by that piece of videotape we saw from the campaign? SEN. CLINTON: Well, I was having a little fun. You know, it's hard to find time to have fun on the campaign trail, but occasionally you can sneak that in. But the larger point is that I know trying to get health insurance for every American that's affordable will not be easy. It's not going to come about just because we hope it will or we tell everybody it's the right thing to do. You know, 15 years ago I tangled with the health insurance industry and the drug companies, and I know it takes a fighter. It takes somebody who will go toe-to-toe with the special interests. You know, I have put forth very specific ideas about how we can get back $55 billion from the special interests -- the giveaways to the oil companies, the credit card companies, the student loan companies, the health insurance companies. These have all been basically pushed on to these special interests not just because of what the White House did, but because members of Congress went along. And I want to get that money back and invest it in the American middle class -- health care, college affordability, the kinds of needs that people talk to me about throughout Ohio, because what I hear as I go from Toledo to Parma to Cleveland to, you know, Dayton is the same litany that people are working harder than ever, but they're not getting ahead. They feel like they're invisible to their government. So when it came time to vote on Dick Cheney's energy bill, I voted no, and Senator Obama voted yes. When it came time to try to cap interest rates for credit cards at 30 percent -- which I think is way too high, but it was the best we could present -- I voted yes and Senator Obama voted no. SEN. CLINTON: So part of what we have to do here is recognize that the special interests are not going to give up without a fight. And I believe that I am a fighter, and I will fight for the people of Ohio and the people of America. MR. WILLIAMS: What I was attempting to do here is to show something Senator Obama said about you, and I'm told it's ready. MR. RUSSERT: Let's try it. MR. WILLIAMS: Let's try it. Hang on. Watch your monitor. Let's try it. We're going to come back to you. SEN. OBAMA: But I'm going to have an opportunity to respond to this. SEN. OBAMA: (From videotape.) -- herself as co-president during the Clinton years. Every good thing that happened she says she was a part of. And so the notion that you can selectively pick what you take credit for and then run away from what isn't politically convenient, that doesn't make sense. MR. WILLIAMS: Now, Senator Obama, you can react to it and whatever you wanted to react to from earlier, but I've been wanting to ask you about this assertion that Senator Clinton has somehow cast herself as co-president. SEN. OBAMA: Well, I think what is absolutely true is, is that when Senator Clinton continually talks about her experience, she is including the eight years that she served as first lady, and you know, often says, you know, ""Here's what I did."" ""Here's what we did."" ""Here's what we accomplished"" -- which is fine. And I have not -- I have not in any way said that that experience is not relevant, and I don't begrudge her claiming that as experience. What I've said, and what I would continue to maintain, is you can't take credit for all the good things that happened but then, when it comes to issues like NAFTA, you say, well, I -- behind the scenes, I was disagreeing. That doesn't work. So you have to, I think, take both responsibility as well as credit. Now there are several points that I think Senator Clinton made that I -- we need to discuss here. First of all, she talked about me objecting to caps on credit cards. Keep in mind, I objected to the entire bill -- a bill that Senator Clinton, in its previous version, in 2001 had voted for. And in one of the debates with you guys said, well, I voted for it, but I hoped it wouldn't pass -- which, as a general rule, doesn't work. If you don't want it to pass, you vote against it. You know, she mentioned that she is a fighter on health care. And look -- I do not in any way doubt that Senator Clinton genuinely wants to provide health care to all Americans. What I have said is that the way she approached it back in '93, I think, was wrong in part because she had the view that what's required is simply to fight. And Senator Clinton ended up fighting not just the insurance companies and the drug companies, but also members of her own party. And as a consequence, there were a number of people, like Jim Cooper of Tennessee and Bill Bradley and Pat Moynihan, who were not included in the negotiations. And we had the potential of bringing people together to actually get something done. I am absolutely clear that hope is not enough. And it is not going to be easy to pass health care. If it was, it would have already gotten done. It's not going to be easy to have a sensible energy policy in this country. ExxonMobil made $11 billion last quarter. They are not going to give up those profits easily. But what I also believe is that the only way we are going to actually get this stuff done is, number one, we're going to have to mobilize and inspire the American people so that they're paying attention to what their government is doing. And that's what I've been doing in this campaign, and that's what I will do as president. And there's nothing romantic or silly about that. If the American people are activated, that's how change is going to happen. The second thing we've going to have to do is we're actually going to have to go after the special interests. Senator Clinton in one of these speeches -- it may have been the same speech where you showed the clip -- said you can't just wave a magic wand and expect special interests to go away. That is absolutely true, but it doesn't help if you're taking millions of dollars in contributions from those special interests. They are less likely to go away. So it is important for us to crack down on how these special interests are able to influence Congress. And yes, it is important for us to inspire and mobilize and motivate the American people to get involved and pay attention. MR. RUSSERT: Senator Obama, let me ask you about motivating, inspiring, keeping your word. Nothing more important. Last year you said if you were the nominee you would opt for public financing in the general election of the campaign; try to get some of the money out. You checked ""Yes"" on a questionnaire. And now Senator McCain has said, calling your bluff, let's do it. You seem to be waffling, saying, well, if we can work on an arrangement here. Why won't you keep your word in writing that you made to abide by public financing of the fall election? SEN. OBAMA: Tim, I am not yet the nominee. Now, what I've said is, is that when I am the nominee, if I am the nominee -- because we've still got a bunch of contests left and Senator Clinton's a pretty tough opponent. If I am the nominee, then I will sit down with John McCain and make sure that we have a system that is fair for both sides, because Tim, as you know, there are all sorts of ways of getting around these loopholes. Senator McCain is trying to explain some of the things that he has done so far where he accepted public financing money, but people aren't exactly clear whether all the T's were crossed and the I's were dotted. Now what I want to point out, though, more broadly is how we have approached this campaign. I said very early on I would not take PAC money. I would not take money from federal-registered lobbyists. That -- that was a multimillion-dollar decision but it was the right thing to do and the reason we were able to do that was because I had confidence that the American people, if they were motivated, would in fact finance the campaign. We have now raised 90 percent of our donations from small donors, $25, $50. We average -- our average donation is $109 so we have built the kind of organization that is funded by the American people that is exactly the goal and the aim of everybody who's interested in good government and politics supports. MR. RUSSERT: So you may opt out of public financing. You may break your word. SEN. OBAMA: What I -- what I have said is, at the point where I'm the nominee, at the point where it's appropriate, I will sit down with John McCain and make sure that we have a system that works for everybody. MR. RUSSERT: Senator Clinton, an issue of accountability and credibility. You have loaned your campaign $5 million. You and your husband file a joint return. You refuse to release that joint return, even though former President Clinton has had significant overseas business dealings. Your chief supporter here in Ohio, Governor Strickland, made releasing his opponent's tax return one of the primary issues of the campaign, saying repeatedly, ""Accountability, transparency."" If he's not releasing, his campaign said, his tax return, what is he hiding? We should question what's going on. Why won't you release your tax return, so the voters of Ohio, Texas, Vermont, Rhode Island know exactly where you and your husband got your money, who might be in part bankrolling your campaign? SEN. CLINTON: Well, the American people who support me are bankrolling my campaign. That's -- that's obvious. You can look and see the hundreds of thousands of contributions that I've gotten. And ever since I lent my campaign money, people have responded just so generously. I'm thrilled at so many people getting involved. And we're raising, on average, about a million dollars a day on the Internet. And if anybody's out there, wants to contribute, to be part of this campaign, just go to HillaryClinton.com, because that's who's funding my campaign. And I will release my tax returns. I have consistently said that. MR. RUSSERT: Why not now? SEN. CLINTON: Well, I will do it as others have done it: upon becoming the nominee, or even earlier, Tim, because I have been as open as I can be. MR. RUSSERT: So, before next Tuesday's primary? SEN. CLINTON: Well, I can't get it together by then, but I will certainly work to get it together. I'm a little busy right now; I hardly have time to sleep. But I will certainly work toward releasing, and we will get that done and in the public domain. MR. RUSSERT: One other issue. You talked about releasing documents. On January 30th, the National Archives released 10,000 pages of your public schedule as first lady. It's now in the custody of former President Clinton. Will you release that -- again, during this primary season that you claim that eight years of experience, let the public know what you did, who you met with those eight years? SEN. CLINTON: Absolutely. I've urged that the process be as quick as possible. It's a cumbersome process, set up by law. It doesn't just apply to us, it applies to everyone in our position. And I have urged that our end of it move as expeditiously as we can. Now, also, President Bush claims the right to look at anything that is released, and I would urge the Bush White House to move as quickly as possible. MR. RUSSERT: But you've had it for more than a month. Will you get to him -- will you get it to the White House immediately? SEN. CLINTON: As soon as we can, Tim. I've urged that, and I hope it will happen. MR. RUSSERT: Senator Obama, one of the things in a campaign is that you have to react to unexpected developments. On Sunday, the headline in your hometown paper, Chicago Tribune: ""Louis Farrakhan Backs Obama for President at Nation of Islam Convention in Chicago."" Do you accept the support of Louis Farrakhan? SEN. OBAMA: You know, I have been very clear in my denunciation of Minister Farrakhan's anti-Semitic comments. I think that they are unacceptable and reprehensible. I did not solicit this support. He expressed pride in an African-American who seems to be bringing the country together. I obviously can't censor him, but it is not support that I sought. And we're not doing anything, I assure you, formally or informally with Minister Farrakhan. MR. RUSSERT: Do you reject his support? SEN. OBAMA: Well, Tim, you know, I can't say to somebody that he can't say that he thinks I'm a good guy. (Laughter.) You know, I -- you know, I -- I have been very clear in my denunciations of him and his past statements, and I think that indicates to the American people what my stance is on those comments. MR. RUSSERT: The problem some voters may have is, as you know, Reverend Farrakhan called Judaism ""gutter religion."" OBAMA: Tim, I think -- I am very familiar with his record, as are the American people. That's why I have consistently denounced it. This is not something new. This is something that -- I live in Chicago. He lives in Chicago. I've been very clear, in terms of me believing that what he has said is reprehensible and inappropriate. And I have consistently distanced myself from him. RUSSERT: The title of one of your books, ""Audacity of Hope,"" you acknowledge you got from a sermon from Reverend Jeremiah Wright, the head of the Trinity United Church. He said that Louis Farrakhan ""epitomizes greatness."" He said that he went to Libya in 1984 with Louis Farrakhan to visit with Moammar Gadhafi and that, when your political opponents found out about that, quote, ""your Jewish support would dry up quicker than a snowball in Hell."" RUSSERT: What do you do to assure Jewish-Americans that, whether it's Farrakhan's support or the activities of Reverend Jeremiah Wright, your pastor, you are consistent with issues regarding Israel and not in any way suggesting that Farrakhan epitomizes greatness? OBAMA: Tim, I have some of the strongest support from the Jewish community in my hometown of Chicago and in this presidential campaign. And the reason is because I have been a stalwart friend of Israel's. I think they are one of our most important allies in the region, and I think that their security is sacrosanct, and that the United States is in a special relationship with them, as is true with my relationship with the Jewish community. And the reason that I have such strong support is because they know that not only would I not tolerate anti-Semitism in any form, but also because of the fact that what I want to do is rebuild what I consider to be a historic relationship between the African-American community and the Jewish community. You know, I would not be sitting here were it not for a whole host of Jewish Americans, who supported the civil rights movement and helped to ensure that justice was served in the South. And that coalition has frayed over time around a whole host of issues, and part of my task in this process is making sure that those lines of communication and understanding are reopened. But, you know, the reason that I have such strong support in the Jewish community and have historically -- it was true in my U.S. Senate campaign and it's true in this presidency -- is because the people who know me best know that I consistently have not only befriended the Jewish community, not only have I been strong on Israel, but, more importantly, I've been willing to speak out even when it is not comfortable. When I was -- just last point I would make -- when I was giving -- had the honor of giving a sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church in conjunction with Martin Luther King's birthday in front of a large African-American audience, I specifically spoke out against anti- Semitism within the African-American community. And that's what gives people confidence that I will continue to do that when I'm president of the United States. CLINTON: I just want to add something here, because I faced a similar situation when I ran for the Senate in 2000 in New York. And in New York, there are more than the two parties, Democratic and Republican. And one of the parties at that time, the Independence Party, was under the control of people who were anti-Semitic, anti- Israel. And I made it very clear that I did not want their support. I rejected it. I said that it would not be anything I would be comfortable with. And it looked as though I might pay a price for that. But I would not be associated with people who said such inflammatory and untrue charges against either Israel or Jewish people in our country. And, you know, I was willing to take that stand, and, you know, fortunately the people of New York supported me and I won. But at the time, I thought it was more important to stand on principle and to reject the kind of conditions that went with support like that. RUSSERT: Are you suggesting Senator Obama is not standing on principle? CLINTON: No. I'm just saying that you asked specifically if he would reject it. And there's a difference between denouncing and rejecting. And I think when it comes to this sort of, you know, inflammatory -- I have no doubt that everything that Barack just said is absolutely sincere. But I just think, we've got to be even stronger. We cannot let anyone in any way say these things because of the implications that they have, which can be so far reaching. OBAMA: Tim, I have to say I don't see a difference between denouncing and rejecting. There's no formal offer of help from Minister Farrakhan that would involve me rejecting it. But if the word ""reject"" Senator Clinton feels is stronger than the word ""denounce,"" then I'm happy to concede the point, and I would reject and denounce. CLINTON: Good. Good. Excellent. WILLIAMS: Rare audience outburst on the agreement over rejecting and renouncing. We're going to take advantage of this opportunity to take the second of our limited breaks. We'll be back live from Cleveland right after this. WILLIAMS: We are back from Cleveland State University. We continue with our debate. The question beginning this segment is for you, Senator Obama. The National Journal rates your voting record as more liberal than that of Ted Kennedy. In a general election, going up against a Republican Party, looking for converts, Republicans, independents, how can you run with a more liberal voting record than Ted Kennedy? OBAMA: Well, first of all, let's take a look at what the National Journal rated us on. It turned out that Senator Clinton and I had differences on two votes. The first was on an immigration issue, where the question was whether guest workers could come here, work for two years, go back for a year, and then come back and work for another two years, which meant essentially that you were going to have illegal immigrants for a year, because they wouldn't go back, and I thought it was bad policy. The second -- and this, I think, is telling in terms of how silly these ratings are -- I supported an office of public integrity, an independent office that would be able to monitor ethics investigations in the Senate, because I thought it was important for the public to know that if there were any ethical violations in the Senate, that they weren't being investigated by the Senators themselves, but there was somebody independent who would do it. This is something that I've tried to push as part of my ethics package. OBAMA: It was rejected. And according to the National Journal, that position is a liberal position. Now, I don't think that's a liberal position. I think there are a lot of Republicans and a lot of Independents who would like to make sure that ethic investigations are not conducted by the people who are potentially being investigated. So the categories don't make sense. And part of the reason I think a lot of people have been puzzled, why is it that Senator Obama's campaign, the supposed liberal, is attracting more Independent votes than any other candidate in the Democratic primary, and Republican votes as well, and then people are scratching their head? It's because people don't want to go back to those old categories of what's liberal and what's conservative. They want to see who is making sense, who's fighting for them, who's going to go after the special interests, who is going to champion the issues of health care and making college affordable, and making sure that we have a foreign policy that makes sense? That's what I've been doing, and that's why, you know, the proof is in the pudding. We've been attracting more Independent and Republican support than anybody else, and that's why every poll shows that right now I beat John McCain in a match-up in the general election. WILLIAMS: Let's go from domestic to foreign affairs and Tim Russert. RUSSERT: Before the primary on Tuesday, on Sunday, March 2, there's an election in Russia for the successor to President Putin. What can you tell me about the man who's going to be Mr. Putin's successor? CLINTON: Well, I can tell you that he's a hand-picked successor, that he is someone who is obviously being installed by Putin, who Putin can control, who has very little independence, the best we know. You know, there's a lot of information still to be acquired. That the so-called opposition was basically run out of the political opportunity to wage a campaign against Putin's hand-picked successor, and the so-called leading opposition figure spends most of his time praising Putin. So this is a clever but transparent way for Putin to hold on to power, and it raises serious issues about how we're going to deal with Russia going forward. I have been very critical of the Bush administration for what I believe to have been an incoherent policy toward Russia. And with the reassertion of Russia's role in Europe, with some of the mischief that they seem to be causing in supporting Iran's nuclear ambitions, for example, it's imperative that we begin to have a more realistic and effective strategy toward Russia. But I have no doubt, as president, even though technically the meetings may be with the man who is labeled as president, the decisions will be made by Putin. RUSSERT: Who will it be? Do you know his name? CLINTON: Medvedev -- whatever. RUSSERT: Senator Obama, do you know anything about him? OBAMA: Well, I think Senator Clinton speaks accurately about him. He is somebody who was hand-picked by Putin. Putin has been very clear that he will continue to have the strongest hand in Russia in terms of running the government. And, you know, it looks -- just think back to the beginning of President Bush's administration when he said -- you know, he met with Putin, looked into his eyes and saw his soul, and figured he could do business with him. He then proceeded to neglect our relationship with Russia at a time when Putin was strangling any opposition in the country when he was consolidating power, rattling sabers against his European neighbors, as well as satellites of the former Soviet Union. And so we did not send a signal to Mr. Putin that, in fact, we were going to be serious about issues like human rights, issues like international cooperation that were critical to us. That is something that we have to change. RUSSERT: He's 42 years old, he's a former law professor. He is Mr. Putin's campaign manager. He is going to be the new president of Russia. And if he says to the Russian troops, you know what, why don't you go help Serbia retake Kosovo, what does President Obama do? OBAMA: Well, I think that we work with the international community that has also recognized Kosovo, and state that that's unacceptable. But, fortunately, we have a strong international structure anchored in NATO to deal with this issue. We don't have to work in isolation. And this is an area where I think that the Clinton administration deserves a lot of credit, is, you know, the way in which they put together a coalition that has functioned. OBAMA: It has not been perfect, but it saved lives. And we created a situation in which not only Kosovo, but other parts of the former Yugoslavia at least have the potential to over time build democracies and enter into the broader European community. But, you know, be very clear: We have recognized the country of Kosovo as an independent, sovereign nation, as has Great Britain and many other countries in the region. And I think that that carries with it, then, certain obligations to ensure that they are not invaded. RUSSERT: Before you go, each of you have talked about your careers in public service. Looking back through them, is there any words or vote that you'd like to take back? CLINTON: Well, obviously, I've said many times that, although my vote on the 2002 authorization regarding Iraq was a sincere vote, I would not have voted that way again. I would certainly, as president, never have taken us to war in Iraq. And I regret deeply that President Bush waged a preemptive war, which I warned against and said I disagreed with. But I think that this election has to be about the future. It has to be about what we will do now, how we will deal with what we're going to inherit. You know, we've just been talking about Russia. We could have gone around the world. We could have gone to Latin America and talked about, you know, the retreat from democracy. We could have talked about Africa and the failure to end the genocide in Darfur. We could have gone on to talk about the challenge that China faces and the Middle East, which is deteriorating under the pressures of Hamas, Hezbollah, and the interference that is putting Israel's security at stake. We could have done an entire program, Tim, on what we will inherit from George Bush. And what I believe is that my experience and my unique qualifications on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue equip me to handle with the problems of today and tomorrow and to be prepared to make those tough decisions in dealing with Putin and others, because we have so much work to do, and we don't have much time to try to make up for our losses. RUSSERT: But to be clear, you'd like to have your vote back? CLINTON: Absolutely. I've said that many times. RUSSERT: Senator Obama, any statements or vote you'd like to take back? OBAMA: Well, you know, when I first arrived in the Senate that first year, we had a situation surrounding Terri Schiavo. And I remember how we adjourned with a unanimous agreement that eventually allowed Congress to interject itself into that decisionmaking process of the families. It wasn't something I was comfortable with, but it was not something that I stood on the floor and stopped. And I think that was a mistake, and I think the American people understood that that was a mistake. And as a constitutional law professor, I knew better. And so that's an example I think of where inaction... RUSSERT: This is the young woman with the feeding tube... OBAMA: That's exactly right. RUSSERT: ... and the family disagreed as to whether it should be removed or not. OBAMA: And I think that's an example of inaction, and sometimes that can be as costly as action. But let me say this, since we're wrapping up this debate. We have gone through 20 debates now. And, you know, there is still a lot of fight going on in this contest, and we've got four coming up, and maybe more after that. But the one thing I'm absolutely clear about is Senator Clinton has campaigned magnificently. She is an outstanding public servant. And I'm very proud to have been campaigning with her. And part of what I think both of us are interested in, regardless of who wins the nomination, is actually delivering for the American people. You know, there is a vanity aspect and ambition aspect to politics. But when you spend as much time as Senator Clinton and I have spent around the country, and you hear heartbreaking story after heartbreaking story, and you realize that people's expectations are so modest. You know, they're not looking for government to solve all of their problems. They just want a little bit of a hand-up to keep them in their homes if they're about to be foreclosed upon, or to make sure their kids can go to college to live out the American dream. You know, it is absolutely critical that we change how business is done in Washington and we remind ourselves of what government is supposed to be about. And, you know, I have a lot of confidence that whoever ends up being the nominee that the Democratic standard-bearer will try to restore that sense of public service to our government. That's why I think we're both running, and I'm very pleased that I've had this opportunity to run with Senator Clinton. RUSSERT: But the voters can only choose one, Brian. RUSSERT: And I think you have a question. WILLIAMS: Well, we don't have such thing in our format as a closing statement, but I am going to ask a closing and fundamental question of you both. And I'll ask it of you fist, Senator Obama. What is the fundamental question you believe Senator Clinton must answer along the way to the voters here in Ohio and in Texas, and for that matter across the country, in order to prove her worthiness as the nominee? And then we will ask the same question of Senator Clinton. OBAMA: I have to say, Brian, I think she is -- she would be worthy as a nominee. Now, I think I'd be better. Otherwise, I wouldn't be running. But there's no doubt that Senator Clinton is qualified and capable and would be a much better president than John McCain, who I respect and I honor his service to this country, but essentially has tethered himself to the failed policies of George Bush over the last seven years. On economics, he wants to continue tax cuts to the wealthy that we can't afford, and on foreign policy he wants to continue a war that not only can we not afford in terms of money, but we can't afford in terms of lives and is not making us more safe. We can't afford it in terms of strategy. So I don't think that Senator Clinton has to answer a question as to whether she's capable of being president or our standard bearer. I will say this, that the reason I think I'm better as the nominee is that I can bring this country together I think in a unique way, across divisions of race, religion, region. And that is what's going to be required in order for us to actually deliver on the issues that both Senator Clinton and I care so much about. And I also think I have a track record, starting from the days I moved to Chicago as a community organizer, when I was in my 20s, on through my work in state government, on through my work as a United States senator, I think I bring a unique bias in favor of opening up government, pushing back special interests, making government more accountable so that the American people can have confidence that their voice is being heard. Those are things -- those are qualities that I bring to this race, and I hope that the people of Ohio, Texas, Rhode Island and Vermont decide that those are qualities that they need in the next president of the United States. WILLIAMS: Senator Clinton, same question, and that is again -- is there a fundamental question Senator Obama must answer to the voters in this state and others as to his worthiness? CLINTON: Well, Brian, there isn't any doubt that, you know, both of us feel strongly about our country, that we bring enormous energy and commitment to this race and would bring that to the general election and to the White House. As I said last week, you know, it's been an honor to campaign. I still intend to do everything I can to win, but it has been an honor, because it has been a campaign that is history making. You know, obviously I am thrilled to be running, to be the first woman president, which I think would be a sea change in our country and around the world, and would give enormous... ... you know, enormous hope and, you know, a real challenge to the way things have been done, and who gets to do them, and what the rules are. So I feel that either one of us will make history. The question that I have been posing is, who can actually change the country? And I do believe that my experience over 35 years in the private sector as well as the public and the not-for-profit sector, gives me an understanding and an insight into how best to make the changes that we all know we have to see. You know, when I wasn't successful about getting universal health care, I didn't give up. I just got to work and helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program. And, you know, today in Ohio 140,000 kids have health insurance. And yet this morning in Lorain, a mother said that she spent with the insurance and everything over $3 million taking care of her daughter, who had a serious accident. And she just looked at me, as so many mothers and fathers have over so many years, and said, ""will you help us?"" That's what my public life has been about. I want to help the people of this country get the chances they deserve to have. And I will do whatever I can here in Ohio, in Texas, Rhode Island, in the states to come making that case. Because I think we do need a fighter back in the White House. You know, the wealthy and the well-connected have had a president. It's time we had a president for the middle class and working people, the people who get up every day and do the very best they can. And they deserve somebody who gets up in that White House and goes to bat for them. And that's what I will do. WILLIAMS: Senator, thank you."

http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2016/jan/10/nicholas-mattiello/ri-among-states-strongest-gun-control-laws/	"""Letâs start with the premise that Rhode Island already has one of the 10 strictest [gun laws] amongst all the states."" Â "	true	['Guns']	http://www.providencejournal.com/	http://www.providencejournal.com/article/20160102/NEWS/160109825	2016/01/10	"On tap for R.I.'s General Assembly in 2016: Tolls, gambling, gun controlSaturdayJanÂ 2,Â 2016Â atÂ 10:15Â PM JanÂ 2,Â 2016Â atÂ 10:38Â PMBy Katherine Gregg and Jennifer BogdanJournal State House BureauPROVIDENCE â When they return to Smith Hill on Tuesday, Rhode Island's part-time lawmakers will start where they left off in June, in mid-battle over Governor Raimondo's bid to raise upward of $60 million a year in new truck tolls to fix the state's dilapidated highway bridges.Â The two sides are already geared up for a run of big, loud confrontations that will fill the State House rotunda with campaign placards (""Jobs!""), slogans (""StopTollsRI!"") and rallying cries (""Fix our bridges!""). The first anti-toll rally is scheduled for 3 p.m. on opening day.Once the session gets rolling, you can also expect night after night of legislative hearings on:Gun control.Tweaks in the state's public-school funding formula.Sentencing changes aimed at reducing Rhode Island's third-highest-in-the-nation probation rate.Judicial nominees.And, of course, there will be the perennial drive to expand state-sponsored gambling in Rhode Island, this time by allowing a November 2016 public referendum on the bid by the owners of Twin River Casino, in Lincoln, to open a second full-fledged casino in Tiverton, just 400 feet from the Massachusetts border.With little organized gambling opposition left, and the looming threat from Massachusetts'Â evolving casino-and-slots industry to Rhode Island's third-largest source of revenue, the lawmakers' votes on the Tiverton referendum could mark one of their first significant votes of the year.Â The House and the Senate will both meet at 4 p.m. on Tuesday, for the first time since they closed up shop abruptly in late June with frayed nerves, bruised egos and a pile of unfinished business on their desks, including the infamous ""chicken-coop"" bill that brought the 2015 session to a screeching, squawking halt.Â The 75-member House has 11 Republicans, one independent and 63 Democrats; the 38-member Senate has four Republicans, one independent, 32 Democrats and an open seat (formerly held by a Republican) up for grabs. The election to fill the Senate District 11 seat that former Republican Sen. Christopher Ottiano resigned will take place the same day the 2016 session opens.But there is something just a bit different in the air this election year.Â Instead of talking, as they did last year, about tax cuts for the working poor, the elderly and the state's beleaguered business owners, the Democratic leaders of the state's overwhelmingly Democratic legislature are talking about spending more âÂ lots more, in fact âÂ on education and publicly funded construction.Â While looking back at the ""significant tax cuts"" that lawmakers approved during the 2015 legislative session, Senate President M. Teresa Paiva Weed said recently, ""I don't see that as a priority this year.""Â ""I don't think it is a time to tax-cut our way into a successful economy,"" she said. ""I think the focus this year should be on investment in education, [and in] our roads and bridges.""Â ""That's Democratic talk,"" counters House Minority Leader Brian Newberry, R-North Smithfield. ""What does it mean to 'invest?' That's a word that Democrats started using in the '90s, under Bill Clinton, when they didn't want to say 'spend.' They didn't want to be accused of tax-and-spend.""Â Paiva Weed is not alone, of course. With the possible exception of an additional estate-tax cut, House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello, D-Cranston, is also talking more about ""investment""Â than tax relief this year.Â On the subject of tolls, for example, to finance hundreds of millions of dollars in highway bridge work, an initially reluctant Mattiello now says,Â ""I expect that a final version of an infrastructure bill will most likely have a tolling provision."" His caveat: ""The administration has to do a lot of disclosing very, very quickly because until that is done, the House of Representatives will not take anything up.""Â But opponents are geared for battle, with a ""StopTollsRI"" petition campaign they hope will muster the same kind of public support that killed the short-lived Sakonnet River bridge toll. (Worth noting: the millions of dollars in motor-vehicle fee hikes and automatic gas tax increases that East Bay lawmakers devised as an alternative to the Sakonnet bridge toll have not, it would appear, produced the ""long-term solution"" lawmakers touted in 2014.)""The question is: Where does the money come from to 'invest'?' I would take it from other parts of the budget,"" Newberry says.On the surface, Democrats Mattiello and Paiva Weed appear aligned with Democrat Raimondo, who has already got both of them talking about how much âÂ not if âÂ the state should toll.Â But tensions have surfaced on this and many, presumably smaller issues.Mattiello says he and the governor have a ""good relationship."" But this was his response when asked recently about the new ""Health Policy Office"" that one of Raimondo's advisory commissions recommended creating: ""There are too many gubernatorial commissions.""In this particular case, ""I was frustrated ... a gubernatorial commission was put together and the only recommendation was to create a bigger bureaucracy when as far as I'm concerned it's too big right now ....""They're trying to create mini-legislatures. We are the constitutional body that is to address policy considerations. We're good at it. We have the systems in place. Every time you turn around there's another gubernatorial commission. There's too many.""Raimondo's response: ""That's the nature of the beast. That's the way our American government is set up. There's always going to be a natural tension to a certain degree between the executive branch and the legislative branch.""Â ""No one cares,"" she adds, except reporters, ""if two politicians [have a] spat.""Â For lawmakers up for reelection in 2016, Newberry believes the risks of blindly following the governor's lead are high.As he sees it: ""You have an ambitious governor who is not up for reelection and who is trying to push through some big proposals. You have a Democratic speaker who is trying to do what speakers of the House do, which is to look at the political consequences to the membership of doing those, so that tension â¦ [and] this is an election year ... is not even about Democrat-Republican.Â ""It's Assembly versus the governor's office in terms of risks, because they are both controlled by the same political party.""Â Financial reality may also play a role:Â The state currently has an $8.7-billion state and federally financed budget and a string of projected deficits. The numbers vary, depending on who is doing the estimating, but the state budget office anticipates a potential $79-million deficit in the year that begins July 1.And that does not include the additional $240 million in state dollars that state agency administrators are proposing to spend. Stay tuned. Under state law, the governor's budget proposals are due out Jan. 21.On a different financial front, the lawmakers will resume their probe into the state's failed $75-million investment, in 2010, in ex-Red Sox ace Curt Schilling's doomed video-game company, 38 Studios. A key player, former House Finance Chairman Steven Costantino, has promised a return visit to the State House to testify Jan. 14.Other high-profile issues:Gun controlThe latest run of mass shootings has led gun-control advocates to hope and believe they might finally win an assault-weapons ban in Rhode Island and a prohibition onÂ gun possession by people convicted of domestic violence and those subject to protective orders.Â ""I think really we have a problem in America with gun violence,"" Raimondo said recently, and not for the first time.Â ""I look forward to working with the legislature to see where can we find some agreement on some common-sense approaches.""Â But Mattiello says, ""Let's start with the premise that Rhode Island already has one of the 10 strictest [gun laws] amongst all the states â¦. An assault weapons ban? Tell me how that helps anybody.""Â His view: ""Most of the things that are ultimately proposed in a gun debate come from an ideological viewpoint. They come from the perspective of we just don't like guns. They are proposals that are not going to make people actually safer. They simply regulate law-abiding folks and have no impact on the illegal guns that are out there.""GamblingIn mid-November, the Tiverton Town Council voted 6 to 1 to ask the legislature to put the casino proposal by Twin River's owners on the local and statewide ballot in 2016.Â The backstory: Twin River's owners purchased the struggling Newport Grand slots parlor last year, with the intention of eventually closing it and moving its employees and gambling license to the new hotel-casino they propose in Tiverton, on a 45-acre parcel of land within sprinting distance of the Massachusetts line. The plan: 1,000 slot machines, 32 table games and an attached 84-room hotel.Â A companion piece of legislation would guarantee the towns of Lincoln and Tiverton at least $3 million each per year from the gambling revenue, even if that cuts into the state's share.Â ""We take very seriously the economic commitment to the town, and quite frankly, if the legislation to make this possible fails to pass the General Assembly this legislative session and we cannot substantially meet the economics of our proposal, we will withdraw the question from the local and statewide ballot,"" Twin River Chairman John E. Taylor Jr. told the townsfolk in November. Although Newport Grand's closing would cost her home city its projected $424,000 annual share of the gambling revenue, Paiva Weed â mindful that voters in her city have repeatedly said no to casino gambling â does not object.Legalizing marijuanaLawmakers say they don't want to dismiss out of hand the potential for new revenue, but Mattiello says, ""You have to look at the social cost .... I still remain somewhat skeptical, but it does seem to be gaining momentum and acceptance in the general population. So I have an open mind.""Paiva Weed says, ""I don't see it as a priority."" And Raimondo says, ""IÂ don't think it's something we should rush into. I will not lie. The revenue is appealing and we need it â the revenue â but it's a mixed bag of results in other states, so I think we ought to look at it a little more before we do it.""Charter-school fundingIn the battle over public school dollars, lawmakers await the recommendations of a commission studying potential remedies to the tug-of-war between the state's ""traditional"" public schools and non-traditionalÂ charter schools.Â Entry into one of the state's charter schools is determined by lottery. The perceived problem: Charter schools drain money from schools with more special needs and English-as-a-second-language students. The fear: reasonable questions about the current funding formula may kill the state's highly regarded charter-school movement, where freedom to experiment has produced some stellar results.Â To fix the inequity, Paiva Weed anticipates the need to funnel an additional $10 million into the traditional public schools.""I don't believe we're dedicating enough money to public education,"" Mattiello agrees, then goes further:Â ""I cannot justify in my mind having two competitive systems fighting for the same resources when we don't have the money to appropriately fund the buildings and the infrastructure of one of the systems.""""I haven't advocated to get rid of the charters â¦. That's disruptive ... I just would not grow the problem any bigger.""Driver's licenses forÂ undocumented immigrantsTo Raimondo, ""this is a public safety issue. It's better for everyone if everyone has a license and insurance ... so I'd like to find a practical solution and work with the legislature.""Â But she has been stymied, as her predecessor was, by the Real ID Act, initially passed byÂ Congress in 2005, in response to the 9/11 Commission's recommendation that the federal government ""set standards for the issuance of sources of identification, such as driver's licenses.""Â ""Real ID is an issue,"" Raimondo says. ""It's confusing and murky.""Criminal justiceOut of a study launched by the Raimondo administration came this finding:Â Rhode Island has the third-highest probation rate in the country, with 5 in 100 adult men in the state on probation. It is also racially imbalanced â 2 in 100 white males are in prison or probation, while 13 in 100 black males are.AfterÂ six months of public meetings and research, the staff to the group assembled by Raimondo laid out several potential remedies, including shortening the time people can be sentenced to probation, making it harder to send them back to prison, and hiring more probation officers.Never miss a storyChoose the plan that's right for you.Digital access or digital and print delivery."

http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2016/feb/22/cecile-richards/planned-parenthoods-ceo-says-half-ohios-abortion-c/	"""In Ohio, more than half the providers of safe and legal abortion have had to shut down"" since Gov. John Kasich took office in 2011."	half-true	['Abortion']	http://www.nytimes.com/	http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/10/us/with-new-abortion-restrictions-ohio-walks-fine-line.html?_r=0	2016/02/22	These laws have passed without the national drama provoked by far-reaching abortion bans that were approved, then overturned in court, in states like Arkansas and North Dakota. But taken together, they affect patients and clinics in myriad ways â in the view of the lawsâ proponents, rightly making women think twice before ending a pregnancy and ensuring clinic safety or, in the view of opponents, imposing heartless obstacles and guilt on women who are seeking a legal procedure. âIn Ohio, the last few years have been fantastic if you support the pro-life movement,â said Mike Gonidakis, the president of Ohio Right to Life. His group has even lobbied against a more sweeping ban on early-term abortions, incurring the wrath of more restless abortion foes. On Wednesday, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a challenge in state court to the heartbeat mandate and other new restrictions, asserting that they were adopted in violation of the Ohio Constitutionâs âsingle subjectâ rule because they were part of an unrelated budget bill. More broadly, abortion-rights advocates call the incremental strategy, which has been refined by several national groups and pursued in a number of states, an insidious way to limit access to abortion and shame women who in many cases already have to walk past shouting protesters to enter clinics. âIf you canât outlaw abortion outright, just make it harder and harder to get,â said Chrisse France, the executive director of Preterm, a large nonprofit abortion clinic on the East Side of Cleveland that performs about 4,900 abortions a year, mainly for low-income women. Conversations with patients at Preterm revealed diverse reactions to the mandated waiting period and counseling, but no sign that any women were changing course. Madelyn Puterbaugh, 23, said that her birth control had failed and that it was ânot the right timeâ for her to bear a child. She said she had turned down the chance to view the fetal heartbeat. âI didnât look,â she said. She went ahead with the abortion, but said she had not minded the required 24-hour wait between the counseling and the procedure. Ohio has long required abortion clinics to have a formal transfer agreement with a nearby hospital for emergency care, something physicians say is medically unnecessary because hospitals are required to treat emergency patients. Now, a new measure bars public hospitals from signing such agreements â a shift that could force two or three of the stateâs remaining 11 clinics to close because they cannot find willing partners. Other measures wrapped into the state budget bill this year, and signed by Governor Kasich, include a requirement that women seeking an abortion be told the probable odds that their pregnancy would go to full term if they changed their minds; a diversion of federal welfare money to so-called crisis pregnancy centers; new financing for rape-crisis centers on the condition that they provide no abortion referrals; and a tightening of parental consent requirements for minors.

To avoid passing money to Planned Parenthood, the state also ended competitive bidding for federal family planning grants, giving priority to public agencies. As a result, some nonprofit womenâs health centers that have no connection to Planned Parenthood or abortion also face drastic cuts. The newest rules follow a flurry of changes in 2011, when, among other things, the state banned abortions, except to save the motherâs life, once the fetus is viable. Fearing potential criminal charges, clinic doctors around the state have stopped performing abortions beyond the 22nd week of pregnancy, even in cases involving severe birth defects or serious medical conditions. Since a federal court allowed it here in 2011 after years of litigation, Ohio has been the only state to require what doctors call an outdated, less safe and less effective regimen for medication abortions. The law mandates adherence to the original Food and Drug Administration approval, which called for three times the drug dosage now standard and authorized the method only through seven weeks of pregnancy. As a result, while later studies showed them to be safe through nine weeks, medication abortions can no longer be offered in the eighth and ninth weeks of pregnancy. Similar restrictions on medication abortion were passed this year in Texas and are under court challenge; they have been voided as unconstitutional barriers in North Dakota and in Oklahoma, which is seeking a review by the Supreme Court. At Preterm, the annual number of nonsurgical abortions plummeted to 90 in 2012 from more than 600 in earlier years. But âthereâs no evidence that this cut down on abortion,â said Ms. France, the clinic director. In Ohio, as elsewhere, abortions have declined over all in recent years, although there was a slight uptick to 25,473 reported procedures in 2012, with black women accounting for a growing share. Whether the new laws have significantly reduced the numbers or simply made abortions more fraught is disputed. Mr. Gonidakis, of Ohio Right to Life, said he felt sure the measures had persuaded many women to change their minds and predicted that even more, when confronted with the fetal heartbeat and other information, would do so in the future. âThere are so many families waiting to adopt,â he added, offering an alternative that crisis pregnancy centers and others are increasingly promoting. In the coming months, Mr. Gonidakis said, his organization plans to focus its lobbying on the easing of state adoption rules and an increase in tax breaks for adoptive parents. But other anti-abortion groups and conservative legislators are pressing ahead with a proposal to ban abortion altogether once a fetal heartbeat is detectable, as early as six weeks into pregnancy. A version of this article appears in print on October 10, 2013, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: With New Abortion Restrictions, Ohio Walks a Narrow Legal Line.

(Zbigniew Bzdak / Chicago Tribune)Privacy PolicyDemocratic governor contender Chris Kennedy abruptly left a candidate forum Monday, criticizing Republican candidate Jeanne Ives for what he called âignorance and stupidityâ after she said Chicagoâs gun violence could be solved if more fathers stayed in the home.The controversy came when Ives, a three-term conservative lawmaker from Wheaton who is challenging Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner , responded to a question on curbing gun crimes.âThe problem is the gun violence in this city of Chicago, predominantly. And you know how youâre going to solve it? Fathers in the home,â she said.As the audience booed and shouted, she repeated, âFathers in the home.âKennedy later got his turn to respond.âWell, I wish I could agree with you. I didnât have a father in my life. Somebody shot him,â Kennedy, the son of the assassinated former U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, said to Ives before he left the forum amid applause and a standing ovation from hundreds of attendees.Ives was the lone Republican candidate attending the event, which featured the leading Democratic candidates for governor. It was held by the Community Renewal Society, a progressive and faith-based group, at Old St. Patrickâs Church in the West Loop Gate neighborhood.As expected, Ives was frequently at odds with the Democratic candidates, and she occasionally drew the scorn of the audience as she repeatedly suggested city and county residents share in the blame for such issues as crime, high taxes and a lack of quality public education because they re-elect Democrats.âThat is your problem. Your taxes are too high and opportunityâs not here,â she said. âWe need jobs and opportunity, and weâre not going to get that if you keep electing these same people as before.âBut it was her brief answer about Chicago gun crimes that prompted the biggest reaction â most notably from Kennedy, who had not yet turned 5 when his father was slain by an assassinâs bullet during the 1968 presidential campaign.âYou know, some stuff hits a raw nerve and, um, I think that should be a debate about great ideas, a clash, and not one of emotions,â Kennedy said as he exited about an hour into the 90-minute forum.âBut when I hear such ignorance and stupidity aired out by someone who knows so little about so much, I donât think thereâs an appropriate place for them to be on a podium on a dais with other people who have given these issues thought and have the emotional capacity to be empathetic at the same time,â he said.Kennedy also was scheduled to make an appearance an hour later at a Rev. Martin Luther King celebration at a church in the Grand Crossing neighborhood on the South Side.A Kennedy aide said later that the candidateâs quick departure was not to ensure making his next event on time. Indeed, Kennedy was late getting to the West Loop forum following an earlier event with Rainbow PUSH, and drew some audience reaction when he told them to blame his untimely arrival on â Jesse Jackson .âAsked afterward about Kennedyâs reaction to her comment, Ives defended her belief that absentee fathers are a significant factor in crime. She went so far as to speculate that the son of Kennedy running mate Ra Joy, who was killed near the University of Chicago in June, was killed by someone who lacked a fatherâs influence.âIâm sure Ra Joy, whoever the perpetrator was against his son, Iâm imagining that person also did not have a father figure in the home,â Ives said.As for Kennedy, Ives said, âheâs obviously very sensitive about (his fatherâs death) and I can understand why. Itâs horrible. Iâll be honest with you, it didnât even, I didnât connect the two because the two arenât connected.âAs a first-time presidential candidate, Barack Obama assailed the absence of black fathers as a contributing factor to problems plaguing the African-American community. During a 2008 speech in Chicago, Obama said âchildren who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime, nine times more likely to drop out of schools and 20 times more likely to end up in prison.âExperts have said absence of a father and the breakup of the traditional family is but one of several factors that contribute to someone turning to crime. Other factors include lack of job and educational opportunities for youths and parentsâ economic status and schooling.Kennedy has made gun violence a major tenet of his campaign for governor, citing the family history of his running mate and himself. Kennedyâs uncle, the late President John F. Kennedy, also was assassinated.A Democratic rival for the nomination, J.B. Pritzker, who lost his father to a heart attack at age 7, said of Kennedyâs response to Ives, âI think (there are) too many people unfortunately losing family members to gun violence. I donât know what was going through Chrisâ head other than I can only imagine the grief that he feels when he thinks of his fatherâs death.âAs for Ivesâ solution for gun crimes, Pritzker said, âItâs not just an issue about how many parents are in the home. Itâs about quality education. Itâs about health care. Itâs about jobs. If you want to avoid violence in a community, provide real economic opportunity. She doesnât understand any of that.â

""It is the absolutely number one objective of the Erie County Republican Committee to do everything we can. We thought it was very important to bring these candidates to you. so you could hear them.""Former Erie County and City of Buffalo elected official Joel Giambra, longtime State Senator John DeFrancisco and former Housing Commissioner for the Pataki Administration Joe Holland took turns criticizing Governor Cuomo's Buffalo Billion program, an energy policy that bans hydrofracking, the state's taxes and regulations, ethical troubles in Albany and education policies including the Excelsior program.The criticism began with the Buffalo Billion.From left to right, Republican gubernatorial candidates Joe Holland, John DeFrancisco and Joel Giambra hear a question by moderator Andrea Bozek during a debate hosted Saturday at Daemen College by the Erie County Republican Committee.Credit Michael Mroziak, WBFO""The Buffalo Billion, unfortunately, has been a tremendous public failure,"" said Giambra, a businessman who previously served as the Erie County Executive, Buffalo Comptroller and Buffalo Common Councilmember. ""What the governor attempted to do here was to gain political access, if you will, to Western New York because of the tremendous beating he took by (former gubernatorial candidate) Carl Paladino. This was his way of trying to find a way to ingratiate himself politically, using taxpayer dollars to fund a billion-dollar building that today sits, virtually, almost empty.""That building is the Tesla/Panasonic Gigafactory 2 factory in Buffalo's Riverbend neighborhood. Holland spoke of the factory while criticizing Cuomo for an energy policy that entirely eliminated hydrofracking as an option.""Unfortunately, this governor has been colonized by the environmental lobby,"" he said. ""All of these policies, solar panel factories, it's not based on grassroots and an economically driven approach in order to create the kind of development that's needed. It's dictated by policies of the far left and that's unfortunate because it won't work.""John DeFrancisco, who hails from Syracuse, has spent the past 25 years in the State Senate and is giving up his seat to run, and with it his influential role as Deputy Majority Leader. He, too, considers Buffalo's GigafactoryÂ 2 a Cuomo failure.""The governor does things based upon the political benefit he is going to get,"" DeFrancisco said. ""He had a great news conference, thousands of jobs. There was nothing behind it. There was no clawbacks. There was no security that the taxpayer had, once he did that. And so, not thousands of jobs. It's down to 200.""DeFrancisco went on to say that Buffalo is not alone.""Look at the Soraa project in Syracuse ,"" he continued. ""A $90 million building sitting there empty. And you know what he wants to do? No penalties for them walking away.""Like DeFrancisco and Giambra, Holland is an Upstate New York resident, hailing from Auburn. He explained during the debate that he holds ""upstate roots but also downtown credibility.""Â ""I'm the only statewide candidate for governor that can put together that winning coalition,"" Holland said. ""I can do that, not only because I will make history as the first African-American Republican candidate for governor, but I also have a track record of service, of making a difference in the New York City area. Out of that comes a network of supporters I can cultivate to vote for me and move the numbers in a positive direction.""DeFrancisco, like Holland, thinks even New York City voters have acquired a ""Cuomo fatigue"" that may work to the Republican Party's advantage. He suggested Cuomo and New York City mayor Bill De Blasio are not on speaking terms.Â ""Just look at the papers over the summer, the 'summer from hell' with the subway system,"" he said. ""How does the governor deal with it? He doesn't say 'it's my problem, I've made some mistakes, I'm going to correct it.' He blames De Blasio.""The Republican hopefuls also noted the current corruption trial of former Cuomo aide Joseph Percoco during the debate.Â The overall tone of the debate was cordial, with no candidate attacking any other. Giambra did say he was the only candidate among the three with a record of cutting taxes and, after the debate, offered a hint of how he may position himself against one of his opponents.""Mr. DeFranciscoÂ has been in the Senate for a long time. He's voted for all these budgets. It's going to be very hard for him, I think, to be able to ask the voters to send him back to Albany to fix the problems that he helped create,"" Giambra said.DeFrancisco, following the debate, was asked if being a longtime lawmaker in a Legislature where many other have been disgraced with scandal might work against him. He believes voters will quickly realize he's not ""part of the machine.""""If people watch what I have done over the years, as far as the advocacy against some of the things that have happened, I don't think they will take me in that light,"" he replied.Â The field of GOP contenders was reduced to three following Friday's surprise withdrawal from the race by Assembly Minority Leader Brian Kolb, who cited a desire to spend more time with family.""This is going to be a competitive race for the Republican nomination,"" Holland said. ""At this point there are three candidates, two who have served in elected office. One is an Albany insider. What I bring to the race is the difference that's needed for the Republicans to win back the State House.""Â In his opening remarks, New York State Republican Chairman Edward Cox said New York State is the least business-friendly of all states in the nation and 11 years of policies under Democratic governors has worsened conditions and killed jobs.""New York State is a blue state. But we are not Manhattan or West Side blue, we are blue collar blue. That's New York State,"" said Cox. ""New York State wants good jobs and Republican governors will bring good jobs to New York State."""

I want to thank George and Dany specifically, and Iâd also like to welcome members of the diplomatic corps and our representatives from embassies. I told you this at the State Department just last month: We really value your partnership. I want to thank Senator Perdue and Senator Shaheen. I am truly honored by your words but also by your partnership, which I think sends the important signal to all of us about what we can do.Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and David Perdue (R-GA) and USAID Administrator Gayle Smith deliver remarks on USAID'sâ¦www.c-span.orgI also see in this room a lot of faces whoâve worked for USAID for many, many years. Many legends, many people who built the foundation of the Agency Iâm proud to serve today. I just want to say âthank youâ to you, and I hope I can live up to your hard work and everything youâve done.I think the senators here today represent something that is critical to our success, and thatâs the incredible bipartisan â in fact, I think itâs almost nonpartisan â support that development now enjoys. Iâve had a lot of meetings with members of Congress since I was nominated, and I will tell you, in no single meeting did I need to make the case that development was important or that USAID is important. Thatâs a big change, and thatâs a big deal.And turns out, with bipartisanship in the mix, we can get a lot done. I remember when I first started in this administration, and there on day one were PEPFAR , the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the Presidentâs Malaria Initiative , all good ideas realized by President Bush. It never crossed President Obamaâs mind to do anything but build on the progress that PEPFAR, MCC and PMI had achieved.And today, PEPFAR is supporting life-saving treatment for 9.5 million people, and has provided 68 million people with testing and counseling. An AIDS-free generation is a real possibility for the first time.And thatâs because a Republican president had the vision and courage to invest billions to fight HIV/AIDS, and a Democratic president was smart enough to scale success when he saw it. Thatâs because two parties and two branches united around the simple idea that the United States could â and should â be the country to lead the fight against an epidemic threatening every country on earth.Next year, a new administration will pick up and run with the PEPFAR ball, and future leaders will keep going until we live in an AIDS-free world. And thatâs the way it should be.And PEPFAR is just one of many great examples. The senator mentioned Power Africa . Last week, I was able to co-host a reception to celebrate the Electrify Africa Act , which was passed by Congress and signed into law by the president last month. There, senators and representatives from both parties and members of President Obamaâs administration were united in a simple message: We can change peopleâs lives when we work together.Because of their efforts â and the efforts of partners from African governments, NGOs and the private sector â the work of Power Africa can continue from administration to administration until the lights are on at every home, business and school in sub-Saharan Africa. As the senators suggested, thatâs the way Washington should work.We have the opportunity now to go for a triple (thatâs a big thing for me, Iâm not good with sports metaphors) with the Global Food Security Act. If passed, when passed, the Act will solidify the incredible progress made by Feed the Future and position the U.S. for continued leadership in the global fight to end hunger and malnutrition. And it will mean that we and our partners can build on the hard-won development gains, ranging from a 33 percent drop in child stunting in Ghana to a poverty reduction of 16 percent in targeted areas of Bangladesh.So the fact is that when we work together, weâre a powerful force for change. Thatâs why Iâm very glad to have all of you by my side as we work to lock in what weâve accomplished and to meet the challenges that are ahead of us. And I am enormously proud to lead USAID, and very confident about what we can achieve together. So let me thank you again for all of you being here.Now USAID, as it should be, is an ever-evolving institution. I think for too long itâs been viewed as the U.S. Agency for Foreign Assistance. USAID has long since abandoned the notion that the solution to development is assistance alone.Trust me, assistance is important â I am cramming for my first ever budget hearings and I will make a very strong case â but weâve also learned that how many dollars we spend is neither the exclusive measure of our commitment nor the means by which we measure success.Part of that is because weâve adjusted to a new landscape. When USAID was founded more than 50 years ago, donor governments were responsible for nearly three quarters of all finance flowing to the developing world. Now we account for less than 10 percent.So USAID is acting on the fact that it takes multiple streams of capital to finance and sustain development, and that we can make much more of our assistance dollars, as the senator has said. Weâre making smarter investments with our assistance; leveraging private capital to scale our impact; and supporting governments, small businesses and entrepreneurs to mobilize domestic resources.And the results are nothing to scoff at â thank you, Senator, for your comments. USAID and the other agencies driving Power Africa have mobilized $43 billion, the bulk of which is private capital. In Latin America, weâve leveraged five dollars for every one dollar invested.Weâve helped entrepreneurs in Asia secure financing for clean energy projects, and partnered with major corporations like Coca-Cola to improve access to safe drinking water and distribute critical medical supplies.Our challenges going forward, I think, are scale and sustainability. We need to help economies become less dependent on aid by driving steady flows of domestic and private capital. And we need to craft what I would call âsystemicâ public-private partnerships that achieve impact across supply chains, delivering results for development and changing business models for the better.The USAID that I lead is also acting on the fact that development is not just an aspiration, but itâs also a discipline. Iâm very proud to see that since adopting a new evaluation policy in 2011, USAID has averaged 200 external evaluations a year, and staff and partners are using these to adjust projects and inform future design.Weâre doing more to measure impact, even in areas like democracy, rights and governance where impact is harder to measure than, for example, in maternal-child health. The Agency is now creating the feedback loop needed to ensure that what we learn is built into everything we do.Our challenge going forward is to institutionalize this practice, including by strengthening our Bureau for Policy, Planning and Learning , to ensure that we can drive with evidence, make mid-course corrections, scale what works and, importantly, be fully transparent and accountable.USAID is also acting on the fact that local ownership matters. Since 2010, USAID has doubled the percentage of our funding obligated through local governments, civil society partners and local businesses.Our gains in ending preventable child and maternal deaths, improving reading skills, and building stronger democratic institutions have derived in no small part from the leadership of communities and countries.The success of Feed the Future has much to do with the fact that African leaders acted on their own to call for an increase in spending on agriculture and that every country should have its own food security plan.USAID is acting on the fact that we can achieve more when we join forces with others, including many of you in this room. Thatâs why we partner across the U.S government with agencies from the Department of Agriculture to the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to NASA. Thatâs why weâve revitalized relationships with great institutions of higher learning, here in the U.S. and abroad.Weâve strengthened relationships with communities of faith, and engagement with the private sector is now fully embedded in the way we do business. Our challenge going forward is to marshal these partnerships not just for good but also for the scale needed to keep pace with demand.Weâre acting on the fact that development solutions are manifold. I think many of you know that for decades this field has been characterized by the flavor of the month phenomenon â and depending on who you ask, and Iâve been at this for a long time, so Iâve been through all of these â the one really critical key to development has at different times been rural agriculture, good governance, infrastructure, human capital, the enabling environment, democratic systems, gender equity or innovation.The fact of the matter is that development requires all of these and more. So our challenge is not only to integrate these but we also have the opportunity to integrate our newest force multiplier, the Global Development Lab , so that it can spur and integrate innovation across and beyond the Agency.Finally, and this is a new and I think extraordinarily positive development, USAID is acting on the fact that our role as a development agency is also to bring analysis, solutions and expertise to the mix when it comes to seizing the opportunities and tackling the challenges that confront our government every day and in every corner of the world.That means using our early warning systems to enable the U.S. to respond early to crises, sharing our analyses of state fragility and long experience with transitions to help shape effective policies, and garnering decades of experience in individual countries to help inform our next steps. Our challenge now is to build the systems to ensure USAIDâs extraordinary foundation of knowledge is brought to the policy table with rigor and with regularity.Even as I work with the men and women of USAID, and I want to say itâs an absolute privilege to do so, Iâve also got an eye to the challenges we face as a broader community. Iâve been in this field for over 35 years now, which means that Senator Perdue actually canât be my father because heâs really not that old, but I honestly canât remember a moment as pivotal as the one that we face now.I think everyone in the room knows that this is a moment of extraordinary progress. Over the last 30 years, extreme poverty has been cut in half. Boys and girls are enrolling in primary school at nearly equal rates, and there are half as many children out of school today as there were 15 years ago.The number of children who die from preventable deaths has been cut in half since 1990. Every continent has seen substantial gains, with individual incomes growing by more than a third in every region of the developing world.And itâs also a moment of global consensus. In the last 12 months, the world has agreed to the new Sustainable Development Goals ; a policy framework for financing development with assistance, private capital and domestic resources; and a plan to curb climate change.But flowing against all of this positive momentum are what President Obama has called the âdangerous currents [that] risk pulling us back into a darker, more disordered world.â You can see these currents at work around the world.In the volatility of world commodity prices and shifts that knock economies off balance and plunge families back into poverty. In the sharp-edged conflicts that tear regions apart and are spawning record waves of refugees and displacement. In the willful abuse of human rights, denial of humanitarian access, and closing of space for civil society. In the rise and expansion of predatory terrorist networks across vast regions. In the ravages of the weather or the tiny mosquito bite that becomes a global health emergency almost overnight.Thatâs what weâre up against. As a global community, we have to answer volatility with stability, injustice with rights, despair with opportunity and conflict with peace. Even with all the gains weâve seen, thatâs no easy task. And when you step back to see the full picture, itâs almost as if the good and the bad, the signs of progress and the dangerous trends, are in a dead heat, with one balanced against the other.Now our work at this moment is made easier because thereâs a global and national consensus that development matters. You just heard it from our Senate leaders. Six years ago when he signed the first-ever Presidential Policy Directive on Global Development , President Obama committed us to âmaking sure that the United States will be a global leader in international development in the 21st Century.âThe steps weâre taking at USAID are helping our nation live up to the presidentâs pledge. And going forward, as the latest National Security Strategy affirms, the United States will continue to lead with all the instruments of American power: defense, diplomacy and development.But even with a commitment to strong U.S. leadership, there are some challenges we canât tackle alone. To conquer the dangerous currents, there are questions we have to answer with one voice, the global community committing together to a better world. And Iâd like to pose three.The first is: Whether we respond to the urgency of now, are we bold enough to invest now to manage a future of rapid and often tumultuous change?This is a time when the humanitarian need across the globe is as great as I can remember. And every time a disaster hits, the world is there to respond â with food, with medicine, even with the tools to rebuild. Weâre good at it, and nobody is better at it than the United States.But over the last seven years, USAID has deployed 23 disaster assistance response, or DART, teams and responded to an average of 60 emergencies per year. No matter the crisis â Syria or the Sahel, earthquakes or Ebola â USAID is there to save lives and meet peopleâs needs on the ground.But many of these crises are chronic, complex and severe. They require more time, more money and more people to respond. This yearâs El NiÃ±o, for example, is unfolding on a global scale and threatening the livelihoods of people from Latin America to Africa.And in too many cases, like in South Sudan, governments make an effective response even harder because those charged to lead have turned their backs on the people who need them most.We are today feeding more than 1 million people in South Sudan each month and responding to El NiÃ±o on four continents, just as we will continue to respond wherever there is need. The American people expect it, and respond themselves with generosity.But even as we respond, we need to make sure that the urgent does not crowd out the important. We need to make long-term, steady investments to prevent the crises that shatter the lives of millions and cost the taxpayers billions.Investing now means staying the course for years to come on the Global Health Security Agenda â thankfully propelled in this initial phase by Congressional approval of our emergency Ebola request last year â so that every country in the world has the capacity to prevent, detect and respond to diseases like MERS, Ebola and now Zika.It means scaling dramatically some of the most effective but perhaps least visible work USAID is doing to foster resilience â or the capacity of people, communities and countries to withstand external shocks.It means building the institutions needed to sustain democracy and governance by taking a page from what the world has done to strengthen global public health, and marshaling the resources and political buy-in that can generate scale, build the body of evidence, and model success.We must also maintain a steady drumbeat to uphold the basic norms without which we cannot succeed â against the corruption that undermines progress and saps citizensâ faith in their governments; for the rights of all citizens and civil society; and for the obligations of governments to prevent discrimination â against women, against people of faith, against minorities, against the LGBT community, and against the disabled or any other person.The second question we have to answer is whether we have the strategic patience to support the transitions before us until they succeed?USAID and our partners work in some of the toughest environments you can imagine, as do many of you. Brand new countries working to build institutions of governance from nothing. Countries reeling from decades of civil war. Countries consumed by insecurity and instability.Our men and women risk everything â sometimes paying the ultimate sacrifice â as they and our partners strive to plant the seeds of dignity and opportunity. That would be incredibly difficult under any circumstance. But try it with limited funding, too few donors, security constraints and ever-growing expectations, and most people would simply give up.But our people donât, and we owe them our thanks and a commitment to pursue change that lasts at least as long as these transitions take. Progress cannot be measured in four- or eight-year increments. Thatâs not how development works.Itâs not how transitions work, either. The World Bank found in a recent study that even the fastest transformers took 20 years to achieve functioning government systems, and another seven to bring corruption under control. And these are countries with a solid head start â they began with conditions that helped expedite the process, like a history of working government or a relatively literate populace.Given all of the enormous difficulties, there are some who would say the hard work isnât worth it. But tell that to President Santos of Colombia, which 15 years ago was on the brink of being declared a failed state.But today, he says the Colombian people âsee the future with hope.â And thatâs because Colombia, with our robust and steady support, did the hard work to tackle the structural conditions allowing drug cartels to run rampant, climb out of a recession, and to end a decades-long war. We were with them every step of the way. And weâll be with them when the next phase of the transition can begin.Because we know that sustained effort pays off. Ask the Kosovar woman who worked as a USAID Foreign Service National for more than 15 years, serving her country and ours by helping Kosovo write a constitution and build institutions where there were none less than a decade ago. Today, she sits as a judge on her countryâs highest constitutional court.Now consider what it will take, when the time comes, in Syria.Change takes time and hard work. It also takes strategic patience and managing expectations, of administrations, of the Congress and of the media. But itâs worth it â and if we know anything, itâs that the costs of impatience are far too great.The last question I think we all have to answer is this: Are we willing to adapt our systems and our institutions to the world we face?If thereâs one thing we know we need, itâs agility. Even as we persist through long transitions and pursue a patient path to lasting progress, we must move swiftly to seize opportunities when they arise, whether to support elections in Sri Lanka and Burma or to set up non-formal education centers for Nigerian families displaced by Boko Haram. That means we need to adapt our systems and institutions for a rapidly changing world.This year, we have at least two opportunities to do just that. First, in May, the United States will participate in the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul. As we work together to meet the needs of millions, we also have the opportunity to strike a new grand bargain that leverages more efficient donor action to spur parallel changes in UN agencies so that collectively we are more strategic, more effective, more efficient, and more nimble.We will also have the opportunity and the obligation to grapple head on with the sharp decline in adherence to basic humanitarian doctrine, and the fact that the greatest impediment to reaching people in need in chronic conflicts today is the willful denial of humanitarian access by all parties.Second, in September, President Obama will host a summit on refugees on the margins of the UN General Assembly. Thereâs no question that the global refugee crisis is putting our systems and host countries to the test. It is also putting people to the test.Most refugees face futures without education, or jobs, or the hope of normalcy â often for a generation. Unfortunately, the debate the global refugee crisis has sparked has been more about rhetoric, some of it hateful, than about solutions.The presidentâs summit provides an opportunity to change that by challenging the world to commit to solutions â to sustained humanitarian funding, to resettlement and other legal channels, and to enabling refugees to secure the protection, education and livelihoods they need for their families.Finally, let me come back to USAID. I am proud of where the Agency is today, and I know that what the United States needs, regardless of administration or party, is an effective, agile, and impactful USAID, one thatâs ready to handle whatever the future brings.So I end where I began and leave you with the hope â perhaps more easily offered by an administrator near the beginning but also the end of her term â that we can strike our own grand bargain.We have shown that development is an endeavor backed by bipartisan commitment; we have shown that USAID can deliver. I have told members of Congress with whom I have met that I will be transparent and accountable â a pledge made easier by the hard work and rigor that the men and women of USAID bring to work every day. I have also said that I will not be shy about coming to Congress to ask for what we need.Last month, I met with the former USAID administrators, who span four administrations and both political parties, and each of whom maintains the same fierce love for and commitment to the Agency they held while in office.Iâm looking at one of them as I say I know they would agree when I say that all of us â across party lines and from one administration to the next â must pledge to keep building a stronger USAID, one that delivers accountability and impact and earns flexibility in exchange. An Agency with the agility and support it needs. The Agency we need and the world deserves.If we meet these three challenges, if we make the choice to invest in the future and not just the right now, we can usher in a new era of progress.If we persist through the inevitable setbacks and shocks of a countryâs transformation, in years to come we will have capable and responsible partners. If we come together as a global community to say we can do this better and do it, weâll have systems worthy of our complex and changing world.The men and women of USAID, with whom Iâm proud to serve, are ready to lead. And we need all of you by our side. Thank you very much.

['Fake news']	http://politicono.com/	http://politicono.com/palin-calls-boycott-mall-america-santa-always-white-bible/	2016/12/21	Written by Lea Vat Kens December 3rd 2016The announcement that Mall of America was welcoming its first black Santa Claus was greeted in many quarters as a good thing but, as might be expected in a country that has become increasingly more comfortable saying any racist thing that comes to mind, many were highly offended. Three years after Foxâs Megyn Kelly definitively explained to America that both Jesus Christ and Santa Claus were white men, Mall of America dismissed her advice and hired Larry Jefferson, a retired U.S. Army veteran from Irving, Texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors.Among many who were offended by this move was former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. The sharp-tongued Republican wasted no time in condemning the companyâs actions, going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and ârunning Mall of America into the ground,â on the basis of Santa âalways having been white in the Bible.â âNo, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong,â Palin told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.She also argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was âthe last strawâ in corporate Americaâs twisting of traditional, conservative Christian values, âbecause they realized they couldnât make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques theyâve been using so far.â She added, âThatâs why they had to come up with something new and out of the box, at least something that appeared that way in their minds. But, this proves that they have no morals and that they wonât shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional Christian values, just so they could make more money. I understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life, but I donât understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that.ââThatâs why Americans, especially white ones, need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground, so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again,â Palin added. âThe Holy Book always said Santa Claus was white and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a sin. And we need to make an example out of Mall of America. If we donât, if we let them get away with it, whatâs next? Others will follow their example and the next thing we know, weâre going to be having Arab Santa Clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make IEDs out of Christmas lights. I mean, just look at the number of white youngsters infatuated with rap and hip-hop music; you think thatâs happening by accident?ââNope, our children are systematically being indoctrinated into other cultures and interests that have nothing to do with traditional, white Christianity. The numbers of converts to Islam have also spiked, just as much as interracial marriages between white women and members of other ethnic groups. We are being bred out, people, and as innocent as it may seem, a black Santa is just the beginning,â she concluded.Most Popular >>

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN ANCHOR: Well, who says America can't cut back on oil? This summer, the U.S. government plans to stop buying 76,000 barrels a day. Economic reality hits the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: And politics collides with foreign policy, and Barack Obama says it's appalling. The Democratic presidential front-runner takes offense at President Bush's ""appeasement"" remarks in Israel.Hello, everyone. I'm Don Lemon, live here at the CNN World Headquarters in Atlanta.KEILAR: And I'm Brianna Keilar.You are in the CNN NEWSROOM.This is our developing news today in the CNN NEWSROOM. The U.S. Energy Department is suspending oil shipments to the government's strategic reserves beginning in July.And our Senior Business Correspondent Ali Velshi is here to explain why and to -- Ali, when we first saw you in the 1:00 hour, this was just breaking. And we have some more pertinent information.ALI VELSHI, CNN SR. BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Let me give you some context on this.President Bush is in Saudi Arabia. He asked the Saudis to increase their output of oil in order to bring it down form the record prices that we are seeing today. Oil passing $127 for the first time in history.The Saudis said they're not interested in doing that right now. Shortly thereafter, the Department of Energy announced that it is halting these shipments, 76,000 barrels of oil a day which are purchased in the market and then deposited into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which are four reserves in Texas and Louisiana, holding -- which can hold about 700 million barrels of oil for emergency use. It's the government's oil, which they will give to -- during Katrina, for instance, they gave it to refineries to keep on producing gasoline.Well, what happened is, just a few days ago, Congress passed a bill asking the president -- or instructing the president -- to stop shipments of oil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, saying that those 76,000 barrels would be better served in the market, bringing the price of oil down. The president said he did not agree with that idea. However, the Department of Energy has to agree to six-month contracts to get that reserve filled up.It's 96 percent full now. The Department of Energy's contract ends in June, and they have announced they will not renew it for July. So, pending what the president says about this bill, they are honoring Congress' wishes and not filling up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.I should tell you, Don, there's been no particular response in the oil market. Like a lot of critics have said, this won't -- there's so little oil involved in this that, while it may be useful not to put it into these big vats, these storage vats, the bottom line is it's not enough to actually shake the price of oil, and that's -- for now that's what we're seeing.LEMON: Oh boy. OK.Our senior business correspondent, Ali Velshi. And Ali talked about how it's affecting the markets, and we're going to check in with Susan Lisovicz in just a little bit.Thanks, Ali.VELSHI: OK.KEILAR: Barack Obama is taking on President Bush and presumptive Republican nominee John McCain. Minutes ago in a speech that you may have seen here on CNN, Obama's blasted Mr. Bush for using the word ""appeasers"" in yesterday's speech to the Israeli parliament.He also ripped into McCain for, in Obama's words, ""... suggesting that I wasn't fit to protect this nation that I love."" The president used the word ""appeasers"" to describe leaders who would be willing to meet with leaders of countries such as Iran.It was widely interpreted to be an attack on Obama. And today Obama said the president's comments delivered in a foreign capital were out of line.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BARACK OBAMA (D-IL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: On a day when we were supposed to be celebrating the anniversary of Israel's independence, he accused me and other Democrats of wanting to negotiate with terrorists and said we were appeasers no different from people who appeased Adolf Hitler. That's what George Bush said in front of the Israeli parliament.Now, that's exactly the kind of appalling attack that's divided our country and that alienates us from the world.(END VIDEO CLIP)KEILAR: Let's bring in CNN's Dan Lothian now. He's in Frankfort, Kentucky, with the CNN Election Express.Let's talk, Dan, about what effect this is having out there on the campaign trail. Fuel, obviously, for Barack Obama.DAN LOTHIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It certainly is fuel for Barack Obama, and it gives him a chance to show that he can be strong on national security. Those are some of the things that I think he was able to do in that speech today, because he's been criticized not only by those others, but certainly his opponent, Senator Clinton, who says she is the best candidate in terms of national security. She's the one who can best protect this country.And Obama sort of challenged President Bush and also John McCain for their remarks, and saying that he can best protect this country. And he says he can win it -- if he had a debate, he could win that debate.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: They're trying to fool you and trying to scare you. And they're not telling the truth. And the reason is because they can't win a foreign policy debate on the merits. But it's not going to work. And it's not going to work this time. And it's not going to work this year.(END VIDEO CLIP)LOTHIAN: Now, as Senator McCain has been critical of Obama, he came under fire as well for remarks that he supposedly made two years ago about having negotiations with Hamas. This came in an opinion piece in ""The Washington Post"" today. Jamie Rubin, who is a supporter of Senator Clinton, also was in former President Clinton's administration as well, and he accused McCain of flip-flopping. But the McCain campaign says that's simply not true.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He has always said that there are three specific conditions. One, that they must renounce violence. Two, that they must abandon their goal of eradicating Israel. And three, that they must accept a two-state solution.So we have been incredibly clear. And he has given -- almost unfettered access to the media. So this is ridiculous.(END VIDEO CLIP)LOTHIAN: And Brianna, I should point out, while we're focusing on this controversy, there is a primary that's coming up next week here in the state of Kentucky. Senator Clinton is leading in the polls here, but one Democratic official told me that he believes that Senator Obama can do much better than we're seeing in the polls right now because of that endorsement from John Edwards, because Edwards did appeal to those working-class voters.And those working class voters here in the state of Kentucky are very concerned about the economy. They're concerned about the high gas prices. They're concerned about job losses. And so they could potentially come out and vote for Barack Obama. He's not saying that he could win here, but he thinks that he can do much better than the polls indicate.KEILAR: All right. We will certainly be watching on Tuesday.Dan Lothian for us in Frankfort, Kentucky.Thanks.LEMON: All right. Let's talk more politics now and what Dan and Brianna were talking about in today's Political Ticker.Barack Obama's Democratic rival comes to his defense. Hillary Clinton is criticizing President Bush's comments about appeasers in the fight against terrorism.Clinton says any comparison of Democrats to Nazi appeasers is offensive and outrageous. In a speech in Israel, Mr. Bush didn't mention names, but his remarks have been seen as an attack on Obama's stated willingness to hold talks with Iran.KEILAR: Changes today in the Democratic delegate race. Eight delegates pledged to John Edwards have now switched to Barack Obama. This follows, of course, Edwards' endorsement of Obama. That happened Wednesday night.And now by CNN's count, Obama has 1,899 delegates. Hillary Clinton, 1,719. Obama is 127 short of the total needed to win the nomination -- 189 pledged delegates and 232 superdelegates, they are still up for grabs.LEMON: Well, John Edwards says he was happy to endorse Barack Obama this week, but there's no way he wants to make another run for vice president. Did I hear that right?He said he doesn't want to make another run for vice president. Edwards tells NBC he's not interested in joining the ticket with Obama. Edwards, of course, was John Kerry's running mate in 2004.All the latest campaign news is at your fingertips. Just go to CNNPolitics.com.

You can see rescue crews here. They're pulling apart piles of rubble. They're doing it literally brick by brick.And what they do is shout, and then they listen for any response that may come from someone who is trapped in the rubble. Amazingly, they have found some survivors. But as expected, they're certainly finding more bodies.The government's death toll rose again today to 22,000. That is expected to more than double.LEMON: Yes. Unbelievable pictures, but disturbing to some. We want to warn you. And CNN's John Vause is in the heart of the quake zone, where rescuers face a double challenge -- mountains of rubble and a ticking clock.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)JOHN VAUSE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, this rescue operation here has really picked up the pace in the past 24 hours. There's as many as 10,000 soldiers and volunteers and search and rescue teams operating in this one county alone.This is the collapsed middle school. This was once a five-story building. Beneath this rubble and concrete are students.Now, they're moving the rubble piece by piece. At times with their bare hands. They're using picks and shovels.There is also heavy earth-moving equipment. Now, that's needed, because they're also trying to move these huge pieces of twisted concrete. This is all part of this building which came crashing down when this earthquake rolled through here on Monday.(END VIDEOTAPE)KEILAR: Well, you have seen the faces of the -- you've seen the faces of the victims. You know the odds that they're facing, the rescuers, and now you may be looking for ways to help. You can do that by going to CNN.com/impact, where you can find links to aid groups. These are reputable aid groups. This is a chance for you to impact your world.LEMON: All right. Saving gas, burning calories.

Getting no satisfaction from the courts, she takes her case to YouTube.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)LEMON: All right. Barack Obama, Watertown, South Dakota, of course responding to President Bush's comments earlier today about appeasers. Now he's taking questions.Let's listen in.(JOINED IN PROGRESS)OBAMA: Our military power and dealing with problems in the region is wrong. And for Senator McCain, then, to compound it by somehow suggesting that I couldn't protect the safety of the United States when it is George Bush's policies, supported by John McCain, that have empowered Iran -- and that's undisputed. There's not an observer of Middle East politics that would not say that the single biggest contributor to Iran's expanding power in the Middle East is George Bush's policies and our invasion of Iraq. And for them to somehow suggest that they are the ones who have been keeping Iran at bay is ridiculous.One last point.You know, Senator McCain has really enjoyed over the last several weeks repeating this comment about, oh, you know, Hamas supports Obama, implying or suggesting that I would talk to Hamas, despite the fact that I've been crystal clear time and time again that until Hamas renounced violence, recognized Israel, and abided by previous agreements, we should not deal with Hamas. Then we find out on the very same day that he's making the sorts of statements he made yesterday, that in a previous interview he suggested, well, maybe we're going to have to deal with Hamas.So not only was he not truthful about my policies, but it turns out that he is much -- is on record suggesting a much more friendly policy towards Hamas than I have. And that's the kind of, I think, distortions that people are tired of. And they certainly contradict the kind of civility that John McCain suggested in the morning that he wanted to pursue.QUESTION: The McCain campaign said that you were just trying to distance yourself from the comment that you made last year about meeting with the leaders of rogue nations without preconditions.OBAMA: I haven't distanced myself at all. I say that in every town hall meeting that we have, and every rally. What I've said is that I will meet with not just our allies and our friends, but I will initiate tough diplomacy with our enemies. And that includes Syria, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela.I would meet with them. And I would meet with them without preconditions, although with preparation. And I would present to them very clearly what my expectations would be in terms of them changing their behavior.If it was in the case of Iran, stop threatening Israel. Stand down on nuclear weapons development. Stop funding Hamas and Hezbollah. And stop stirring up problems inside of Iraq.If they are willing to change behavior, then we would offer inducements and benefits diplomatically. And if they don't, then we will continue to ratchet sanctions and isolation on Iran.That's been a consistent policy that I've presented throughout. There's no contradictions whatsoever. So I have no idea where it is that they're suggesting that somehow there's been a change in policy.As I said, the real shift in policy is John McCain, who has been attacking me for -- and implying that somehow I wanted to negotiate with Hamas when it turns out that he's quoted saying we have to deal with them. Somebody who up until yesterday was insisting that you couldn't lay out a timetable for starting to bring down our troops and then suddenly apparently had a vision in which he now believes that all our troops are going to be out by 2013, although can't spell out any concrete steps in terms of how we're going to achieve it.It strikes me he's the one who's been s inconsistent.Yes?QUESTION: (OFF-MIC) what would change? How would...OBAMA: I would engage in direct talks. They haven't been said. That is not true.We have not had -- we have not had direct talks with Iran. This administration has been very specific about rebuffing direct talks with Iran. And that is a different, it's a different philosophy.The approach that I'm suggesting, the tough, but engaged diplomacy that I'm suggesting, is the kind that was carried out by John Kennedy, it was carried out by Richard Nixon, it was carried out by Ronald Reagan. There is a strong bipartisan tradition of engaging in that kind of diplomacy.You mirror military strength with aggressive, effective, tough diplomacy. That's what's been lacking.And ironically, the one area where the administration started making some progress in dealing with rogue nations was when it figured out that not talking to North Korea had resulted in them developing numerous nuclear weapons that they had tested and realizing, maybe we actually should be involved in talks. And those six-party talks, although imperfect, have at least yielded some progress and some commitment from North Korea to stand down.So we have an example of where they've tried something and it didn't work, and changed positions in the direction that I'm suggesting our foreign policy should go, where we've actually seen some progress. But that's not what this is about.The speech yesterday wasn't about an actual policy argument, it was about politics. It was about trying to scare the American people.And that's what will not work in this election, because the American people can look back at the track record of George Bush, supported by John McCain, and say to themselves, let's see, we were told that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. There were none.We were told we would be there relatively briefly. We've been there for over five years.We were told that this would cost maybe $50 billion, $60 billion? We're now on $600 billion.We were told that this would make us safer and that this would be a model of democracy in the Middle East. It hasn't turned out this way.We were told this would not serve as a distraction to Afghanistan, and you've got bin Laden sending out videotapes today. And our own intelligence estimates say that al Qaeda is stronger now in Afghanistan and the foothills of Pakistan than anytime since 2001. And Iran is stronger now than before we invaded.So the American people are going to look at the evidence and they're going to say to themselves, you know, we don't get a sense that this has been a wise foreign policy or a tough foreign policy or a smart foreign policy. This has been a policy that oftentimes has been -- revolved around a lot of bluster and big talk, but very little performance. And what the American people want right now is some performance.Yes?QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE) yesterday and even today continues to suggest that the comments yesterday were not (INAUDIBLE).OBAMA: I'm not even taking them -- I'm not even taking them personally. But for them to suggest that somehow they weren't aimed -- who is this some that they were talking about? Was this some amorphous some? Was this just a straw man that they were setting up? And if so, the -- what was the purpose of the remarks?Now, that's being disingenuous. I mean, I'm less concerned about whether the remarks were directed against me personally, because frankly, there is no evidence out there that I've ever suggested we should engage terrorists. So obviously it didn't apply to me.But the implication -- and this White House is very media savvy and knows what it's doing. The implication was that if you object to George Bush's policies of non-engagement, then, you know, you are being soft.And as I said, the White House may be making those claims. I think it'd be hard for John McCain to make those claims since he was on a bus and definitely talking about me.QUESTION: It sounds as if this stance you're taking, you've decided that in 2008 it's better to have this position of risking -- the bid that Republicans already have argued that you're inexperienced, that you're naive. You seem to believe that those arguments will no longer work with the public as they did in 2004 against Kerry, saying that he is too soft, that he's an anti-war candidate and the public broke in Bush's favor?(CROSSTALK)OBAMA: OK. You know, I guess -- you know, look, I don't know how the politics of this plays out. But I know that what we've done over the last eight years does not work. And as a candidate for president, my job is to present my vision about what I think will work to make the American people safe, to put us in a position where our strategic interests in the Middle East and around the world are properly served.I've presented my vision. I am happy to have a debate with John McCain and George Bush about foreign policy. If John McCain wants to meet me anywhere, anytime to have a debate about our respective policies in Iraq, Iran, the Middle East or around the world, that is a conversation I'm happy to have, because I believe that there is no separation between John McCain and George Bush when it comes to our Middle East policy, and I think their policy has failed.And I will make that case as strongly as I can to the American people. And I trust the American people to trust their own eyes and to see what the results have been. Again, it is -- it is hard for me to fathom how John McCain can suggest that I'm being soft on Iran when he supported the very policies that every objective observer says has strengthened Iran over the last eight years.Iraq used to be a counterweight to Iran. We eliminated that. That's why they have influence in Iraq, is because of our invasion.I wasn't the one who suggested that we have elections in the Palestinian territories, even though this administration was warned by the Israelis that Hamas would do well. The administration pushed them forward, and apparently were surprised when Hamas did well.That's what strengthened their hand in Gaza. That's what strengthened their hand in the Palestinian territories. Those were this administration's policies, supported by John McCain. And so it boggles the mind for them to somehow suggest that critics of their policies are what are strengthening Iran.Yes?QUESTION: Senator, I'd like to get a little more clarification on the notion of direct presidential diplomacy as it flows out of the YouTube debate remarks that you made.When you say that you -- that you would be involved, ""I,"" do you mean from the get-go, the president of the United States, or do you mean an Obama administration administration, through the National Security Council...(CROSSTALK)OBAMA: The latter. I mean, understand what the question was. The question was a very specific question -- would you meet without preconditions?Preconditions, as applies to a country like Iran, for example, was a term of art, because this administration has been very clear that it will not have direct negotiations with Iran until Iran has met preconditions that are essentially what Iran views and many other observers would view as the subject of the negotiations. For example, their nuclear program.The point is, is that I would not refuse to meet until they agreed to every position that we want, but that doesn't mean that we would not have preparation. And the preparation would involve starting with lower-level diplomatic contacts, having our diplomat core work through with Iranian counterparts an agenda.But what I have said is that at some point I would be willing to meet. And that is a position -- I mean, what's puzzling is that we view this as in any way controversial when this has been the history of U.S. diplomacy until very recently.This whole notion of not talking to people, it didn't hold in the '60s, it didn't hold in the '70s, it didn't hold in the '80s, it didn't hold in the '90s against much more powerful adversaries, much more dangerous adversaries. I mean, when Kennedy met with Khrushchev, we were on the brink of nuclear war. When Nixon met with Mao, that was with the knowledge that Mao had exterminated millions of people.And yet we understood that we could advance our national security interests by at least opening up lines of communication. And this was bipartisan. And it's a signal of how badly our foreign policy has drifted over the last eight years, how much it has been skewed by the rhetoric of the Bush administration, that this should even be a controversial proposition.Yes?QUESTION: (OFF-MIC)Are you saying that's been a bad thing for the Palestinians?OBAMA: What I am saying is that this administration has not operated in a consistent, thoughtful manner when it comes to a whole host of problems around the region. And when it came to elections in the Palestinian Authority, this administration was warned repeatedly that given the problems with Fatah, given the corruption, given the lack of grassroots support, that initiating elections could end up resulting in big wins for Hamas.And this administration went ahead because this administration's policy has been a combination of extraordinary naivete, the notion that we'll be greeted as liberators, flowers will be thrown at us in Iraq, we'll be creating a Jeffersonian democracy, that it's a model, that same rhetoric carried over when it came to elections in the Palestinian territories. And yet, when you end up seeing Hamas winning, you've got rhetoric coming out of the administration saying, of course we'd never deal with them.That tells me they didn't think through their policies. And that, I think, is what has weakened us.It's not the notion for democracy per se, or elections per se, it's the lack of understanding that in this regional world and in regions all across -- or in the Middle East and in areas all across the world that democracy is not just going to the ballot box, it's how are we strengthening our civil institutions? What are we doing with the press? What are we doing with the judiciary? Are there economic structures in place that are helping to build the middle class? Is there rule of law? A host of issues that this administration typically neglected in the runup to some of these elections.OK.QUESTION: If you can talk about the (INAUDIBLE) the faith initiative, what you're trying to accomplish with that, and are you worried at all that the strong religious imagery we've seen in Kentucky, South Carolina and some other states might offend some voters moving into the general electino?OBAMA: This isn't actually new. I guess it was written up as new in --QUESTION: We printed it today.QUESTION: Jeremiah Wright?QUESTION: I'm sorry -- Joshua -- your --OBAMA: I didn't know he was my faith director.QUESTION: Josh -- your --OBAMA: Josh Busby.QUESTION: Yes.OBAMA: Yes. This is -- I guess my point is what we've been building, we've had a faith outreach program since the beginning of this campaign. And I don't think it should offend anybody. I've been a long-time believer that there are people of faith in the evangelical community, in the Catholic Church in a whole host of areas that Democrats haven't reached out to and as a consequence we haven't been able to make our case about why many of our ideas are consistent with those in the faith community. And so my theory is you show up, you go to an AIDS forum hosted by Rick Warren, you go to various church events.Now, whenever we do this outreach, we make sure that it's consistent with the concepts of separation of church and state. And I'm very clear and unequivocal about the belief that that separation strengthens our religious life and church, as well as ensuring that the state doesn't become captives to a particular set of religious beliefs. But I think the idea that people of faith should be involved in the public square in the debate is something that I've talked about for a long time.I gave a speech two years ago in Washington on this precise topic. There's a whole chapter in my book, ""The Audacity of Hope,"" about it and it's something that we're trying to apply in this campaign.So all right, last one, Bonnie (ph).QUESTION: I heard that you agreed (INAUDIBLE) that there would be a town hall (INAUDIBLE) to the Second Amendment. I heard there's an NRA commission going on right now. Mitch McConnell referenced your ""bitter"" remarks. Karl Rove said that you do not recognize (ph) the Second Amendment, but your record shows otherwise. John McCain is about to start talking (INAUDIBLE) about the Second Amendment (INAUDIBLE).Are you worried that they're going to -- the Republicans are going to (INAUDIBLE) and if so, how do you plan on getting around the issue?OBAMA: What do you think, Bonnie?Of course they're going to -- they'll try, of course. They've had the same playbook every election. And guns is going to be one of those issues. And I -- I understand that it's been effective for them in the past. All I can do is describe to the voters what I believe and what I think.And what I believe is that there is a Second Amendment right. I think it is an individual right. I think people have the right to lawfully bear arms. I do believe that there's nothing inconsistent with also saying that we can institute some common sense gun laws so that we don't have kids being shot on the streets of cities like Chicago, that we can institute strong background checks, that we can trace guns back to -- potential unscrupulous gun dealers who have peddled them to people who shouldn't be getting them.Those are laws that I think the majority of Americans believe in. And, now, the NRA has a different position. Their basic view is any law related to gun ownership is a potential camel's nose under the tent and that if we allow even the smallest concession that somehow guns are going to be taken away from everybody. If you subscribe to that view, then you're, you know, then you're not going to agree with me.If, on the other hand, you're a gun owner here in South Dakota who uses your gun to hunt or to protect your family, and does so in a lawful way, then you have nothing to worry about from me. And they can try to stir up as much fear as they want. But I ask the voters, listen to what I'm saying. And there's nothing in my record that would contradict those positions.All right. Thank you, guys.LEMON: All right. Senator and presidential hopeful Barack Obama in South Dakota -- Watertown, South Dakota. Clearly politics and foreign policy colliding here. We're going to discuss this a little bit more, exactly what he said. So I don't want to break it down for you, because I have a political panel waiting for you on the other side of the break, who is going to talk about exactly what this means for Barack Obama, this moment, how he's turned it around, and used it to talk about foreign policy.Also, I want to tell you that Mitt Romney and John Edwards both will be on ""THE SITUATION ROOM,"" 4:00 p.m. Eastern, right here on CNN. Our political panel, who will analyze this for us, after the break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) LEMON: OK. All right. Well, President Bush set off a political storm with a speech to the Israeli parliament. The White House says he wasn't talking about Barack Obama specifically, but targeted various Democrats, including Barack Obama.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Some seem to believe that we should negotiate with the terrorists and radicals as if some ingenious argument will persuade them they have been wrong all along. We've heard this foolish delusion before. We have the obligation to call this what it is, the false comfort of appeasement, which has been repeatedly discredited by history.(END VIDEO CLIP)LEMON: OK. With me now to talk about this is Charlie Mahtesian from politico.com.Thank you, Charlie, for joining us.And Chris Cillizza of the washingtonpost.com. Both join us.You heard the president there. Should the president have anticipated this response, and maybe should he have not said that, Chris? I'll start with you.CHRIS CILLIZZA, WASHINGTONPOST.COM: Well, you know, Don, I think the president in his eighth year in office now is well aware of the megaphone that he still carries. I think one interesting part of this story is a reminder that, we all talk about the lame duck presidency, but look, the president of the United States still, if he wants to make news, can make it.So, my guess is this was a purposeful use of phrase and decision for the president to address this. Yes, he wasn't talking directly about Barack Obama, but look, the president and his advisers are smart people. They understand that the -- the insinuation certainly would be about Barack Obama. It's clearly a place where Republicans believe they have the advantage when we talk about it politically coming up on November.LEMON: OK. Charlie, and it appears -- not it appears, he has -- Barack Obama's campaign has taken this and made it an opportunity. He's garnered much of the press attention today. He's been on all the national news networks. I looked up, and he was on every single channel. He is talking about this and using it as a way to tout his experience and knowledge on foreign policy.CHARLIE MAHTESIAN, POLITICO.COM: Right. The president's remarks were not some kind of gaffe. This was a premeditated, aggressive foray into the presidential arena, and the Democrats understand that Democrats, like Senator Obama and senior Democrats on Capitol Hill, they understand that they have to come back equally as aggressively and that is what explains the strong reaction you're hearing from the Obama campaign, from congressional leaders, even from Hillary Clinton. LEMON: OK.Barack Obama says that we should have known from this -- at least that we should open up the lines of communication. That's what history has shown us, that we should open up the line of communication and we should not be an alienated nation here.I'm wondering what the folks on the other side are saying about that. Because Barack Obama is saying in his speech, as you heard and in his questioning here, that we should not do that. We should be hope and we should talk about it.Smart foreign policy decision, Charlie? Not a smart foreign policy decision?MAHTESIAN: Well, it depends on who the audience is and who you expect to consume that message. I think it's very important for Democrats to project that notion of strength. It's very important for Barack Obama to be able to refute the accusations that are going to come at him from the right about being inexperienced in a dangerous world. And he really can't afford to take many chances.He's in this unique place where, almost for the first time in the 9/11 era, the Republicans no longer have the commanding heights on national security issues. So he has a little more leeway than say John Kerry or maybe some other Democrats might have had in other election cycles. But the bottom line is, it's a very delicate balance that he needs to maintain.LEMON: All right.Chris, let's talk about John McCain here, because Barack Obama also used this to sort of lump John McCain in with the president. And as he's been saying, this is going to be four more years of Bush if John McCain is elected.Did you notice in this that he called for, he said, I will debate John McCain about foreign policy and strategic policy anywhere. He's calling him out, asking him to debate it.CILLIZZA: You know, Don, I though that was a really important point. I think that there is some, privately, some concern among Democratic strategists, all of whom basically believe Barack Obama is going to be the nominee, whether or not he can win an election that is fought on foreign policy/national security grounds.Obviously, they feel pretty comfortable with him on the economy, health care, those sorts of domestic concerns. But he is experienced enough, can he stand up to the long resume John McCain has? What we saw today was Barack Obama saying, essentially, I hate to use these words, but I will use them, bring it on. Saying, look, I'm more than comfortable debating the last eight years of Republican foreign policy against my vision.LEMON: OK. This whole notion of talking to people, he said -- and I don't have time to play the whole sound bite -- this whole notion of talking to people didn't work, we saw that in the '70s, the '80s, and '90s. He brought up Khruschev, he brought up Chairman Mao, all of those things.But let's get this back now to John McCain. I want you to listen to this 2006, an interview with Jamie Rubin.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAMIE RUBIN, ""THE HUFFINGTON POST"": Do you think American diplomats should be operating the way they have in the past in working with the Palestinian government if Hamas is now in charge?SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R-AZ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: They're the government and sooner or later we're going to have to deal with them in one way or another. And I understand why this administration and previous administrations had such antipathy towards Hamas, just because of their dedication to violence and the things they not only espouse, but practice. So -- but it's a new reality in the Middle East.(END VIDEO CLIP)LEMON: Now, he has said that he thinks Barack Obama is naive in thinking that he can negotiate with places like Iran and what have you, and Hamas. And then this -- 2006, some people are calling it a flip-flop and I need you to answer very quickly. Both of you will get a chance.Chris, I'll start with you.CILLIZZA: I think the context is always important. McCain was speaking at a point in time in which he thought that was the right thing. Positions change, the way in which the world works changes. I think we should be more open to giving politicians, Democrats and Republicans, more of a chance to adapt their positions.LEMON: OK. All right.Real quick, Charlie.MAHTESIAN: Well, certainly it's a problem if it fits into a pattern of situations that appear to be like hypocrisy. As a single day, single news cycle event, it probably doesn't affect the race very much at all.LEMON: All right.Charlie Mahtesian and Chris Cillizza, thank you very much for joining us today.MAHTESIAN: Thank you.LEMON: And the news keeps coming. We'll keep bringing it to you right here in the CNN NEWSROOM.We want to remind you as well -- (COMMERCIAL BREAK)KEILAR: A very pregnant Angelina Jolie -- happened overnight, right? Well, it seems like it did.She met with reporters at the Cannes Film Festival in France. But Cannes isn't just about films and stars. It's also about the dollars.CNN entertainment correspondent, Brooke Anderson, has the latest.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BROOKE ANDERSON, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): Here at the Cannes Film Festival, Angelina Jolie is, at this point, the center of attention. She revealed here that she is considering delivering her twins here in France.Now we watched Angelina and Brad ease up the red carpet last night for premiere of ""Kung Fu Panda,"" the animated comedy in which she stars with Jack Black. And she assured everybody earlier in the day that she is feeling fine and that her pregnancy is going smoothly.Now the Cannes Film Festival is known not only for glitz and glamour, but also the film market. The frenzied buying and selling could benefit both Hollywood and a shaky U.S. economy.Take a look.SHANNON BANAL, SENIOR V.P., BLEIBERG ENT.: This is Roman (ph), he's our V.P. of sales and right now he's in the middle of a meeting selling our films.ANDERSON (voice-over): The team from Los Angeles based Bleiberg Entertainment is on a mission in Cannes, to sell its films to the world market.BANAL: When you're always makes deals, a lot of the deals will be made on the beach. It's just the way it goes.ANDERSON: They are among the Hollywood wheelers and dealers at the Marche Du Film, the largest and most prestigious film market in the world, which runs parallel to, but separate from, the Cannes Film Festival.PAUL DERGARABEDIAN, PRESIDENT, MEDIA BY NUMBERS: You think of the New York Stock Exchange and the bidding wars over commodities and that kind of thing, that's what it is sort of like. And certainly there's a lot of money at stake.ANDERSON (on-camera): Transactions here at the Marche Du Film in France can translate into dollars and cents. Not just for Hollywood, but the struggling U.S. economy -- in the form of jobs.DAN GLICKMAN, CEO, MOTION PICTURE ASSN. OF AMERICA: The film industry adds jobs, a big chunk of jobs, as well as economic power to the American economy. I think the latest number was 1.3 million jobs directly and indirectly in the American film and related industries.ANDERSON (voice-over): The American movie business is one of a shrinking number of U.S. industries that enjoys a trade surplus, with other countries. Its success abroad is putting a dent in the U.S. trade deficit which topped $700 billion last year.GLICKMAN: We obviously export way more movies to the world than we import. We bring in $9.5 billion, $10 billion from our balance (ph) of payments surplus. That's a big boost, particularly at a time when the economy in this country is in murky times.ANDERSON: Worldwide exposure is crucial to Hollywood. The top ten American movies overseas last year earned more than $4 billion at the international box office, far exceeding their take in the U.S. alone.DERGARABEDIAN: American films in particular earn over 50 percent of their box office from the foreign marketplace. There are often films that would not make money, but for the fact of the overseas grosses.ANDERSON: The horror flick ""Dance of the Dead"" is among the films Bleiberg is trying to sell.BANAL: It's integral for your film to be here, it's integral so that it will sell here. There's nothing like Cannes.ANDERSON (on-camera): The American films here at the market could potentially benefit from the weak dollar because now those movies are more affordable for international distributors.Reporting from the 61st Cannes Film Festival, Brooke Anderson, CNN, Cannes.(END VIDEOTAPE)LEMON: OK.

http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2011/apr/05/newt-gingrich/gingrich-states-should-consider-alternatives-priso/	"	Says ""some [states] with the largest reductions in crime have also lowered their prison population."""	true	['Crime', 'Criminal Justice', 'State Budget']	http://www.washingtonpost.com/	http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/06/AR2011010604386.html	2011/04/05	By Newt Gingrich and Pat NolanFriday, January 7, 2011With nearly all 50 states facing budget deficits, it's time to end business as usual in state capitols and for legislators to think and act with courage and creativity.We urge conservative legislators to lead the way in addressing an issue often considered off-limits to reform: prisons. Several states have recently shown that they can save on costs without compromising public safety by intelligently reducing their prison populations.We joined with other conservative leaders last month to announce the Right on Crime Campaign , a national movement urging states to make sensible and proven reforms to our criminal justice system - policies that will cut prison costs while keeping the public safe. Among the prominent signatories are Reagan administration attorney general Ed Meese, former drug czar Asa Hutchinson, David Keene of the American Conservative Union, John Dilulio of the University of Pennsylvania, Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform and Richard Viguerie of ConservativeHQ.com. We all agree that we can keep the public safe while spending fewer tax dollars if we spend them more effectively.The Right on Crime Campaign represents a seismic shift in the legislative landscape. And it opens the way for a common-sense left-right agreement on an issue that has kept the parties apart for decades.There is an urgent need to address the astronomical growth in the prison population, with its huge costs in dollars and lost human potential. We spent $68 billion in 2010 on corrections - 300 percent more than 25 years ago. The prison population is growing 13 times faster than the general population. These facts should trouble every American.Our prisons might be worth the current cost if the recidivism rate were not so high, but, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics , half of the prisoners released this year are expected to be back in prison within three years. If our prison policies are failing half of the time, and we know that there are more humane, effective alternatives, it is time to fundamentally rethink how we treat and rehabilitate our prisoners.We can no longer afford business as usual with prisons. The criminal justice system is broken, and conservatives must lead the way in fixing it.Several states have shown that it is possible to cut costs while keeping the public safe. Consider events in Texas , which is known to be tough on crime. Conservative Republicans joined with Democrats in adopting incentive-based funding to strengthen the state's probation system in 2005. Then in 2007, they decided against building more prisons and instead opted to enhance proven community corrections approaches such as drug courts. The reforms are forecast to save $2 billion in prison costs over five years.The Lone Star State has already redirected much of the money saved into community treatment for the mentally ill and low-level drug addicts. Not only have these reforms reduced Texas's prison population - helping to close the state budget gap - but for the first time there is no waiting list for drug treatment in the state. And crime has dropped 10 percent from 2004, the year before the reforms, through 2009, according to the latest figures available , reaching its lowest annual rate since 1973.Last year we both endorsed corrections reforms in South Carolina that will reserve costly prison beds for dangerous criminals while punishing low-risk offenders through lower-cost community supervision. The legislation was a bipartisan effort with strong support from liberals, conservatives, law enforcement, the judges and reform advocates. The state is expected to save $175 million in prison construction this year and $60 million in operating costs over the next several years.Some people attribute the nation's recent drop in crime to more people being locked up. But the facts show otherwise. While crime fell in nearly every state over the past seven years , some of those with the largest reductions in crime have also lowered their prison population. Compare Florida and New York. Over the past seven years, Florida's incarceration rate has increased 16 percent, while New York's decreased 16 percent. Yet the crime rate in New York has fallen twice as much as Florida's. Put another way, although New York spent less on its prisons, it delivered better public safety.Americans need to know that we can reform our prison systems to cost less and keep the public safe. We hope conservative leaders across the country will join with us in getting it right on crime.Newt Gingrich was speaker of the House from 1995 to 1999 and is the founder of American Solutions. Pat Nolan was Republican leader of the California State Assembly from 1984 to 1988 and is a vice president of Prison Fellowship, a Christian ministry to prisoners, ex-prisoners and their families that also works on justice reform.Â©Â 2011Â The Washington Post Company

Obama personally made the case for his legislative record at a time when his approval ratings are among the lowest of his presidency and as even some of his most ardent supporters are questioning the results of his congressional strategy.""Overall, if you had a checklist of promises made, a lot of those promises have been kept,"" Obama said. ""When those things are complete, and I think they will be, we will have achieved a fundamental shift in health care, energy, education and our financial regulatory system that will put this economy on a firmer footing to grow over the long term.""As the Senate prepares to pass its version of health-care reform legislation, Obama's advisers have portrayed a highly successful year pushing important bills through Congress, comparing his record to those of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson. Presidential scholars offer a more cautious appraisal, even as they note that Obama is operating in a more partisan time in Washington than those Democratic predecessors had.Obama's legislative record includes the $787 billion stimulus bill passed in February, a mix of tax cuts, infrastructure spending and aid to state and local governments that was the largest of its kind. It also includes a variety of bills addressing issues of particular interest to his political base that had been languishing for years.His top domestic priorityAlthough Obama noted in the interview that ""the most important thing we did this year was to ensure that the financial system did not collapse,"" health-care reform dominated his agenda and will stand as at least one pillar of the legacy he leaves behind. He has come under sharp criticism for the size and shape of the legislation, including from former Democratic Party chairman Howard Dean , who has said he would prefer that the Senate defeat the bill rather than pass what he considers weak legislation.In the interview, Obama vigorously defended the legislation, saying he is ""not just grudgingly supporting the bill. I am very enthusiastic about what we have achieved.""""Nowhere has there been a bigger gap between the perceptions of compromise and the realities of compromise than in the health-care bill,"" Obama said. ""Every single criteria for reform I put forward is in this bill.""In listing those priorities, he cited the 30 million uninsured Americans projected to receive coverage, estimated savings of more than $1 trillion over the next two decades, a ""patients' bill of rights on steroids,"" and tax breaks to help small businesses pay for employee coverage.Those elements are in the House and Senate versions of the legislation; their competing proposals will have to be reconciled in conference committee next year. The House bill includes a government-run insurance plan favored by progressive Democrats; the Senate version does not. ""I didn't campaign on the public option,"" Obama said in the interview.Throughout the health-care debate, the president has declined to weigh in with specific preferences. The tactic has exasperated his supporters, but his advisers have deemed it key in keeping the bill moving through a balky Congress. Obama called the public option his preferred choice to ensure broad coverage and provide cost-cutting competition to the private insurers. But he has never demanded that it be part of a final bill.CONTINUED 1 "

Here now co-anchor Martha Raddatz .(END VIDEOTAPE)MARTHA RADDATZ, ABC HOST: Good morning and thanks for joining us this holiday weekend. I hope you all had a great Thanksgiving. It was a busy week for president-elect Donald Trump who spent his holiday at Mar-a-Lago filling in his cabinet, detailing some surprising shifts on key campaign promises. And while he is yet to hold a press conference as reflect, he released another taped message to the American people.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: It's time to restore the bonds of trust between citizens. Let us give thanks for all that we have and let us boldly face the exciting new frontiers that lie ahead.(END VIDEO CLIP)RADDATZ: The once divisive candidate now calling for unity. We'll get to all that in a moment with former Trump rival Senator Ted Cruz in his first Sunday interview since dropping out of the race, Trump's senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, and Senator Bernie Sanders.But first, the world reacting to Fidel Castro's death at 90. President Obama , who restored diplomatic relations with Cuba offering his condolences saying the Cuban people must know that they have a friend and partner in the United States of America.But will that friendship continue under Donald Trump? For more on that let's bring in Jim Avila in Havana and Tom Llamas outside Trump Tower in New York.And Jim, let's start with you. We know Cuba will observe nine days of official mourning. What will that look like? What is the mood like there on the ground?JIM AVILA, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, the Sunday it's a normal quiet Sunday morning, maybe quieter than normal. People have been told to mourn here, and that's what they're doing. And the state does have tremendous power to rally the faithful. 90 percent of the people employed here work for the government. Youth organizations are funded by the Communist Party. So, when they want to gather a crowd, like tomorrow, it won't be difficult to rally the faithful here and that they'll be out in force and they'll be out in force looking to celebrate Fidel Castro's life and his revolution.RADDATZ: And Jim, Castro did hold power longer than any national leader except for Queen Elizabeth. And while in power, as he controlled almost aspect of Cuban life. Will his death now change people's day to day life there?AVILA: You know, Martha, not right away. He is really stepped back in the last ten years since he was sick and just kind of tried to be the conscience of the Communist Party. His brother Raul has been running things hands-on with a tacit approval of Fidel Castro, and things will continue along the same path I believe until Raul Castro steps down as he promises to do by 2018.You'll have to wait for the younger generation of politicians here if there's going to be any change at all or some kind of popular revolt among the people.RADDATZ: And Tom Llamas, you were there in front of Trump Tower. You have covered the president-elect's route his entire campaign, over the weekend both President Obama and President-elect Trump released statements. They were extremely contradictory in tone. President Obama's statement talking about Castro's figure with enormous impact and Donald Trump saying today the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades. Fidel Castro's legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights .On the campaign trail, Trump promised he would reverse President Obama's opening to Cuba. Do you think that will happen or might Castro's death change all that?TOM LLAMAS, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: You know, Martha, I think President-elect Trump has sent two very clear signals. First, that statement, it was almost as if it was drafted from a coffee stand in Little Havana. I can't tell you how many Cuban-American friends and relatives called me, some who voted for Trump, some who didn't, praising Trump's language on Castro's brutal legacy. They loved the very blunt terms.Now the other thing he's done is that he's appointed one of the biggest supporters of the Cuban embargo to his transition team at the Treasury Department. Martha, that is no accident. And of course, Donald Trump sort of changed his policy on Cuba during his campaign. In the primaries he said he was open to dialogue with Cuba, but he wanted a better deal, then later during the general election campaign he said he would reverse President Obama's executive order on Cuba if the Castro regime did not, quote, meet our demands.Now, it's unclear where this will play. Donald Trump still has to appoint a secretary of state and our top diplomat. Where does Cuba play on that person's list of important things when it comes to foreign policy. But I think right now Donald Trump has sent two very clear signals that he's going to be very tough with Cuba in the future, Martha.RADDATZ: And, Tom, this story is so personal for you. Your grandparents and your parents in fact fled Cuba as political exiles. You have talked very powerfully and emotionally this weekend about your Cuban heritage. How has your family reacted to the news? And you?LLAMAS: You know, I think -- as far as my family is concerned, there's a lot of joy. You see it on the streets of South Florida with those celebrations in Little Havana. And it's not joy that an old frail man is dead. That's not why they're celebrating, they're celebrating because a very dark chapter in their life has ended.We were constantly reminded of Castro's legacy and his brutal regime living in Miami just 90 miles from Havana and we were reminded when we had to send family medicines and food to Cuba every single week, sending money every month when fishermen would find empty rafts floating in the Florida straits and our relatives would make it out of Cuba and would reach the United States legally.And I'll never forget, Martha, one time meeting some cousins I had never seen before and they showed up to a hotel right on Biscayne Bay, right off of Biscayne Bay, and I remember telling my dad how thin they were -- my cousins, the parents and the children were so thin. And I'll never forget, Martha, the children, they were much older than toddlers. They were walking and running around, yet they were still being breastfed. Why? Because there was not enough milk to go around in Cuba, Martha.RADDATZ: Thanks so much, Tom, for sharing that with us. And thanks to you, Jim, as well.And for more now, let's turn to Republican Senator and former presidential candidate Ted Cruz of Texas.Senator Cruz, you heard Tom talk about his family. You have Cuban heritage as well from your dad's side of the family. What was his reaction?SEN. TED CRUZ (R), TEXAS: Well, look, this is a powerful moment for people all across the country and especially for Cuban Americans. I was with my dad when he found out the news that Fidel Castro was dead and he simply said praise god.You know, for so many of us whose families had been imprisoned, had been tortured, had seen the destruction of Cuba that Fidel Castro carried out, my dad as a teenager was imprisoned and tortured by Batista. He was beaten in a prison cell, had his teeth kicked out of his mouth. My aunt, my Tia Sonia (ph) whom I adore, she fought in the counter revolution against Castro, and she and her two best friends in high school were thrown in prison and tortured as teenage girls. And what they did to girls in Cuban prisons was unspeakable.And you know, I first heard that Castro had passed to final judgment with a text from my cousin BB (ph) who is my Tia Sonia's (ph) daughter who just said that she got to call her mom and tell her mom Fidel is dead.And for a man who was tortured and murdered and oppressed for so many, it is thankful he is no longer with us.RADDATZ: So many powerful stories like that.You know, you put out a statement paying tribute to Castro's victims. Those who had fought against him. Do you think his death will open a new chapter with increasing liberty for Cubans? What happens next?CRUZ: Well, look, that is certainly my hope and my prayer.Unfortunately, the policies of the Obama administration have made that less likely. What the Obama administration has done is strengthen Raul Castro. Raul is the dictator now.You know, I asked my dad at dinner last night what do you think happens now that Fidel is dead? And he shrugged and said Raul has been in power for years. The system has gotten stronger. And what Obama has done is funneled billions of dollars to Raul Castro, which is being used to oppress dissidents. You know, in 2015 roughly 10,000 political arrests occurred in Cuba, that is five times as many as occurred in 2010 when there were only about 2,000.This tyrannical regime has gotten stronger because of a weak president, weak foreign policy. And it is very much my hope and belief that with a new president coming into office in January, President Trump, a new administration, that U.S. foreign policy -- not just to Cuba, but towards our enemies, whether they are Iran or North Korea -- will no longer be a policy of weakness and appeasement, but instead using U.S. strength to force and press for change.But I look for the day -- you know, Iâve never been to Cuba. Iâve never been to the land where my father was born, where he grew up. I look forward to coming Cuba, but seeing a free Cuba where people can live, where itâs pulled out of (INAUDIBLE)...RADDATZ: So do you think the embargo was working?CRUZ: -- land that time forgot.RADDATZ: Do you think the embargo was working?Do you want to double down on that?CRUZ: You know, what I will say is the economic pressure was having real effect. Cuba was a client state of the Soviet Union for many, many years. When the Soviets collapsed, it put enormous economic pressure on Cuba.But then Venezuela stepped in and provided petrol dollars in exchange for -- for troops. When Venezuelaâs economy was cratering, President Obama stepped in with billions and is propping up the administration.This ought to be a moment where Cubans are dancing in the street because theyâre being liberated, but instead -- listen, if you dance in the street, youâre going to be thrown in jail.Cuba is not a free society. You know, in 2015, some 2,000 churches in Cuba were declared illegal?A hundred were destroyed by the government. You donât have the freedom to worship God, to speak. And it is my hope that we will see U.S. strength prompting real change and real freedom in Cuba.RADDATZ: Letâs -- let's turn to -- to President-elect Trump. You met with him last week...CRUZ: Yes.RADDATZ: -- in Trump Tower. You said you want to work with the new president in whatever capacity you can have the greatest impact.What capacity might that be?CRUZ: Well, listen, weâve got a lot of work to do. This election was a mandate for change. It astonished everyone. It astonished the pundits, it astonished the pollsters. And it was an overwhelming mandate. It was over 300 electoral votes. It was winning all across the Midwest, states that had gone Democratic for years after years after years, states like Pennsylvania and Michigan and Iowa and Wisconsin.We have a mandate for change. And Republicans have been given the opportunity -- weâve been given control of the White House, of every executive branch, and both houses of Congress. We canât blow it. We have got to deliver.And so Iâm excited about working with President-elect Trump, working with the new administration to actually deliver on the promises weâve made -- to repeal Obamacare, to lift the burdens on small businesses, to unleash energy, to...RADDATZ: Well, on that -- on that point, Senator Cruz...CRUZ: -- confirm strong principled conservatives to Supreme Court justices.RADDATZ: Since his election, Mr. Trump has changed his tune on some of those issues. He said he wants to keep certain provisions of Obamacare instead of repealing and replacing the whole law, that mankind may be causing climate change and heâs open to abiding by the Paris Accord, and that same-sex marriage is settled law that he would not try to have the Supreme Court overturn.Do those changes in his tone concern you?CRUZ: Listen, what Iâm going to work to do every day is to try to work closely with the new president, with the new administration, and with my colleagues in Congress to deliver on what we promised. I've got to say, if we donât, if weâre given the White House and both houses of Congress and we donât deliver, I think there will be pitchforks and torches in the streets. And I think quite rightly. I think people are so fed up with Washington.This election was a mandate with change. And the most catastrophic thing Republicans could do is go back to business as usual.And Iâll tell you there are a lot of reasons to be encouraged...RADDATZ: So do you have real concerns about what heâs...CRUZ: The new team Trump...RADDATZ: -- (INAUDIBLE) in?CRUZ: -- is bringing together.Listen, the new team that Trump is bringing together is an impressive, serious team. Jeff Sessions as attorney general -- I know Jeff. Iâve worked closely with Jeff in the Senate. Jeff is a small, principled, serious conservative. I think heâs going to make an excellent attorney general.You look at the national security team thatâs coming around the Trump administration, it is a strong, serious national security team.So Iâm encouraged by the team that is coming together, by where there focus is. Iâm encouraged by their plan for the first 100 days to act aggressively, lifting the burdens on small businesses and job creators. Thatâs what the president should be doing.And from my end, I want to do everything I can to help President Trump have an incredibly successful administration, because if we deliver on the promises, thatâs how we actually turn the country around, bring back jobs and raise wages for people that are hurting.RADDATZ: I also want to just go back a little bit, back to the campaign, which, at times, was very bitter.You had some very strong words about then-Candidate Trump. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CRUZ: This man is a pathological liar. He doesnât know the difference between truth and lies. He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth. The man is utterly amoral. You know, morality does not exist for him.(END VIDEO CLIP)RADDATZ: Do you regret any of those words?CRUZ: Well, listen, it was a hard-fought campaign. It was hard-fought on all sides. And it was vigorous till the end. But at the end of the day, the people have spoken. He won the election. He won the nomination. And he won the general election in a convincing manner.And my focus is on the country. My focus is we have a new president. We have a mandate. We ought to deliver on that mandate. We ought to deliver -- this election was about jobs. It was about the fact that, for the last eight years, working men and women in this country have seen their lives -- theyâve seen wages stagnating. Theyâve seen factories closing. We need an administration that fights every day for the working men and women of this country.Thatâs my number one priority in the Senate, fighting for 27 million Texans, for jobs, for economic growth, to raise wages.RADDATZ: I just want to go back to those words -- he lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth.Do you still think Donald Trump is a liar?CRUZ: You know, Iâm not going to re-litigate the past. Iâm going to focus on the future. Iâm going to focus on whatâs in front of us and on fixing the problems we have.I will say one thing, Martha, itâs going to be an interesting test just in the next few days. I very much hope that we donât see any U.S. government officials going to Fidel Castroâs funeral. I hope we donât see Barack Obama and Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton and Democrats lining up to lionize a murderous tyrant and thug.If you wouldnât go to Pol Potâs funeral or Stalinâs funeral or Maoâs funeral because they were murdering Communist dictators, then you shouldnât be doing what Barack Obama and Justin Trudeau are doing, which is celebrating Fidel Castro, a murderous communist dictator.RADDATZ: Thanks so much for joining us, Senator Cruz.Great to see you.CRUZ: Thank you, Martha. God bless.RADDATZ: And now let's bring in Donald Trump's senior adviser and former campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway.Kellyanne, President-elect Trump said in his statement about Fidel Castro's that his administration will do all it can to ensure the Cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty.But he's also promised to reverse President Obama's opening to Cuba.How will ending diplomatic relations and pulling American businesses out help achieve prosperity and liberty?CONWAY: Martha, first, thanks for having me.So what President-elect Trump was saying yesterday is that the first priority that he has is to make sure those political prisoners under Fidel Castro areAnd that the people of Cuba finally, after 60 years of oppression, know economic and political and religious freedom.He is open to researching and, in fact, resetting relations with Cuba.But his criticism of what has happened in the last couple of years is very simple, it's that we got nothing in return, that by reopening diplomatic relations with Cuba, allowing commercial aircraft and the rest, that we really got nothing in return. And we didn't get those political prisonersWe did not get assurances that Cubans who still live on the island would, in fact, be religiously, and politically and economically free.We also respect the thousands and hundreds of thousands of Cubans who live here who fled that oppression, fled that poverty, fled who they believed to be a dictator. And as Ted Cruz said -- is saying on your program, has 60 years of blood on his hands.And we just can't romanticize Fidel Castro now that he's gone. We have to take a look at the way he ran his country in direct opposition to the freedom and the democracy that we have here in the United States.So it's much like Donald Trump on trade -- you don't just give up everything and get nothing in return. I think that's very clear in the president-elect's message across any number of issues.RADDATZ: But he has to get all of that in return or he reverses the opening?CONWAY: He hasn't said that. And he's open -- again, I've discussed this with him directly. He's open to any number of possibilities. But we remain very firm that when you open up diplomatic relations, as President Obama has, with Cuba and Fidel Castro in the last several years, that to get nothing in return, including political prisoners and assurances that people on the island of Cuba will be free politically and economically -- I mean, I've personally met, and I'm sure you have, victims of Fidel Castro's oppression and his torture and his imprisonment.I, many years ago, was very touched as a young girl, meeting Armando Valladares, who then went on to write a book against all hope in a movie, made on the book. And that's just one example of many. We all have friends, I'm sure, who have those stories of Cubans, coming in the dead of night with $20 in their pocket, and children strapped into a boat, trying to come to the free land 60 miles away.And they indeed have done that. So to the extent that -- to the extent that President Trump can open up new conversations with Cuba it would have to be a very different Cuba.And again, he is all about America first -- American workers, American interests, Americans, American allies and certainly Americans.And in that regard, he wants to make sure that when the United States of America, when he's president, engages in any type of diplomatic relations or trade agreements, for that matter, and the like, that we as America are being protected and we as America are getting something in return.RADDATZ: Kellyanne, I want to -- I want to turn to the personnel this week. You waded into the Cabinet selection process with some tweets this week concerning Governor Mitt Romney, saying, you're receiving a deluge of social media and private communications about Romney.Some Trump loyalists warn against him as secretary of state, adding later that being loyal was an important quality for the job.Why did you weigh in on Governor Romney?CONWAY: I weigh in privately. First of all, let me make very clear, Martha, that there's one person who will select his Cabinet and it's President-Elect Donald Trump. Whatever he decides will have my full support and respect. And he knows that, as does Vice President-Elect Pence.I think that there was the Never Trump movement and then there was Governor Mitt Romney. He went out of his way to hurt Donald Trump. He gave two speeches that I can recall in this calendar year and they were both about Donald Trump.As McMullin ran in the state of Utah for president, we don't know who Mitt Romney voted for.But apart from that, look, I'm glad they're talking. I've been very -- I've been critical of Mitt Romney in the past and I also, last week, on your network and other places, talked about how I was very pleased that the president-elect and Mitt Romney -- Governor Romney had met out at Bedminster.I was there when they met. I'm glad that two job creators, who also have the very rare privilege of having represented their Republican Party as its presidential nominee --(CROSSTALK)RADDATZ: But I -- don't understand why you took to Twitter on this, why you, Kellyanne Conway, took to Twitter on this.Why not go to Mr. Trump?Did he want you to tweet that?Or is that just you talking?CONWAY: I won't discuss that.But I will tell you that I've already weighed in privately because I've been asked to.First of all, it's Donald Trump who's going to form his Cabinet. But I did want to say something else. You know, this is Trump's party now. And he won states that Mitt Romney lost. He's the one with the political instincts, the brilliance. This is his Cabinet to form. I mean, he won Michigan. Mitt Romney lost it by 10.We won Pennsylvania. Mitt Romney lost Iowa by, I don't know, 5 points or so. We won it by 9. We won Ohio. And so I just think that the political instincts -- and it wasn't just -- I only wish Governor Romney had been as critical of Hillary Clinton and her policy positions.I'm all for party unity. I'm a big party unity person. And look what Donald Trump's done. He's got Nikki Haley in the Cabinet, a U.N. ambassador, daughter of Indian immigrants.He's met with Ted Cruz. He's taken calls from Mitt Romney, from Jeb Bush, from John Kasich, from Carly Fiorina. I think party (ph) -- he's working with Speaker Ryan. Reince Priebus, the RNC chairman, is now his chief of staff, going into this new White House.So we're all for party unity. I don't think a cost of admission for party unity has to be the secretary of state position.RADDATZ: I want to turn to Hillary Clinton.And when Mr. Trump says that he does not want to pursue investigations of Hillary Clinton, what does he mean by that?Is he asking the FBI or the Justice Department to just stand down?CONWAY: No, he's not. He respects the integrity of those institutions. And the next leaders of those institutions, when he's president, will do their jobs without the interference of the executive branch and the President of the United States.At the same time, President -- President-Elect Trump is being very magnanimous. What he said to ""The New York Times"" in the on-the-record interview was that he's just not focused on that right now. He's not focused on Hillary Clinton and prosecuting --(CROSSTALK)RADDATZ: Well, did he overstep his role by making those public comments?Should he have been making public comments about that?CONWAY: He's welcome to. He's the president-elect. He's about to be the leader of the free world. And -- but he is not undercutting anybody's authority in any of those branches -- any of those positions.Martha, as you and I can know and respect, different people will have the authority and the autonomy to make those decisions, based on the evidence presented to them.But this is how the president-elect feels at this moment about Hillary Clinton. I would say, in response that, I guess her attitude towards that is to have her counsel, Mark Elias, go and join this ridiculously fantastical recount that Jill Stein is engaging in in Wisconsin and perhaps elsewhere.So you've got the President-Elect, Donald Trump, being quite magnanimous to Hillary Clinton and you've got her responding with joining into this recount which Jill Stein has --(CROSSTALK)RADDATZ: And he's tweeted about half a dozen times, I think.Why is he tweeting so much about that recount?CONWAY: Well, he's able to weigh in. He has probably 30 million followers on Facebook and Twitter, fought for him, weighing in on issues like that, on that platform. Perhaps many of his followers would never hear the full information.But I guess the real question is, why in the world can't the Democrats, quote, ""accept"" the election results?All they did was ask people like me and Mr. Trump himself six ways to Sundays (sic), a million times plus, Martha, will you accept the election results?Why, at the last debate in Las Vegas, did Mr. Trump say that he'll keep us in suspense, to let us know, he'll accept the election result if he wins?And now you've got Hillary Clinton who, on election night, Martha, called Donald Trump to both congratulate him and to concede the election to him?I was standing right there. Mr. Trump was on my phone with her. I didn't hear him say, well, Secretary Clinton just conceded but she said, unless, of course, 2.5 weeks from now Jill Stein, who got less than 1 percent of the vote nationwide, decides that she should issue a recount, raise 7 million bucks and go have a recount in Wisconsin?Jill Stein got 33,000 votes in Wisconsin. Mr. Trump got 1.4 million; 33,000 votes is like the number of people who tailgate at a Packers game. It is not a serious effort to change the election results.So the question for the Democrats is, why are you doing this?And by the way, what does President Obama think of this recount charade?He has eight weeks left to finish his -- to finish out his term. And I think it's quite small of Jill Stein and Hillary Clinton's counsel -- and perhaps her -- to interfere with the last eight weeks of President Obama's legacy.President Obama and President-Elect Trump speak regularly. They spoke yesterday at length. They're trying to move on and form a government. It's high time that Hillary and her supporters do the same.RADDATZ: OK. We're going to have to leave it there. Thanks very much, Kellyanne Conway.CONWAY: Thank you, Martha.RADDATZ: And coming up, as the battle to be Trump's secretary of state heats up, I'll talk to the former chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff about Trump's foreign policy team.And, first, a recount is underway in Wisconsin. Two more states can follow.Does the Clinton camp have a shot?Or is it just false hope for Democrats?I'll ask Senator Bernie Sanders -- back in just two minutes.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT: In 1961, they invaded Cuba and everybody was totally convinced that Castro was the worst guy in the world, all the Cuban people were going to rise up in rebellion against Fidel Castro.They forgot that he educated the kids, gave them health care, totally transformed the society, you know, not to say that Fidel Castro or Cuba are perfect. They are certainly not.But just because Ronald Reagan dislikes these people does not mean to say the people in their own nations feel the same way.(END VIDEO CLIP)RADDATZ: Senator Bernie Sanders offering some praise back in 1985 for the Cuban leader who died Friday.And let's get straight to Senator Sanders, the former Democratic presidential candidate and author of the new book, ""Our Revolution.""Good morning, Senator Sanders.You said back in 1985 that Castro transformed Cuban society and gave them health care and education. But this was a brutal dictatorship despite the romanticized version that some Americans have of Cuba -- he rationed food, impaired dissidents.SANDERS: Well...RADDATZ: You heard all today, Senator Cruz talk about that.So have you changed your view of Castro since 1985?SANDERS: Look, what I said there -- I'm not quite sure...RADDATZ: How would you now describe his leadership (INAUDIBLE)?SANDERS: -- I'm not quite sure, Martha, this is the issue that is on the minds of the American people right now, who basically want to make sure that Donald Trump keeps the promises that he made when he said he was not going to cut Social Security and Medicare...RADDATZ: I -- I know. But I want to go back to your comments...SANDERS: -- and Medicaid.We'll get to Donald Trump...SANDERS: The answer is the Castro...RADDATZ: -- in a moment.SANDERS: -- that and -- and -- no, of course, their economy is terrible. You're right, it is a dictatorship. They did have a good health -- do have a decent health care system and a decent educational system. A lot of people have left Cuba for better dreams, to fulfill their aspirations.So, no, the Cuban economy is a disaster. No, I do not praise Fidel Castro.RADDATZ: OK, let's move on to the Trump administration.SANDERS: But it is interesting...RADDATZ: You -- you've...SANDERS: -- you know, it is interesting that we start a program off by talking about what happened -- what I said 30 years ago. Right now, where the American people are concerned is, in fact, an economy right now in which we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality. Mr. Trump made some promises to the American people...RADDATZ: Well, let me ask you about that...SANDERS: -- he said that he will not cut...RADDATZ: -- Senator Sanders, please let me ask...SANDERS: -- Social Security, Medicare...SANDERS: -- and Medicaid.Yes?RADDATZ: Let me -- let me ask some questions about that. And I -- and I will also say...SANDERS: Yes.RADDATZ: -- that people are concerned about Fidel Castro and what happens next.But you've said you'll try to work with President Trump on issues where you agree -- infrastructure, entitlements, the minimum wage, given his cabinet picks and things he has said this week, do you think you can work with him?SANDERS: Well, we'll see. I am not impressed by the cabinet picks so far that he has made. Mr. Trump said that he will take on the drug companies. Right now, we pay, as you know, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Many Americans cannot afford the medicine that they desperately need.He said that he would support Medicare negotiating prescription drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry and allow for re-importation. Right now, I am 50 miles away from Canada. They pay half of the cost of the price that we pay for prescription drugs. Trump said that he will do something about it. Let's see if he does.Trump said, when he was running for president, you heard him say this, I am the only Republican candidate who will not cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.Well, you've got some people in the Republican Party right now who want to voucherize Medicare, make massive cuts in Medicaid.Will he keep his word?Mr. Trump said that he was against the disastrous trade policies that this country currently has. Well, we look forward to working with him to save the jobs in Indiana, for the Carrier workers, to make sure that corporations don't throw American workers out on the street as they go to China and they go to Mexico at very low wages.So if he is serious about protecting working families, yes, we'll work with him.We will not work with him if he talks about xenophobia, if he talks about racism, sexism. That is not acceptable.And the other area where we will not work with him, we do not believe -- I do not believe that climate change is a hoax. I believe the scientific evidence is overwhelming that it is one of the great threats to humanity and we have got to transform our energy system.RADDATZ: Well, Mr. Trump said that mankind may be causing climate change this week and is open to abiding by the Paris Accords.So is that a new and improved Donald Trump to you?SANDERS: Well, that is something. But we have got to go further than that. The scientific community is saying that if we do not transform our energy system yesterday, we're going to be looking at more drought, more floods, more extreme weather disturbances.So he has got to listen to the scientific community, not the fossil fuel industry.RADDATZ: I want to talk about this recount that's going to go on.You said right after the election that it's over, Mr. Trump will be the next president and Democrats must focus on the realities of where we are.So are they wrong to do this recent and question the election's results?SANDERS: The Democrats, Martha, are not doing the recount. I trust that you know that was initiated by the Green Party, who has every right in the world to do it...RADDATZ: I'm aware of that, but Hillary Clinton has joined in.SANDERS: Well, of course they joined in. It's taking a (INAUDIBLE). We will see what happens. It's a legal right. It's not a big deal. I don't think anybody, Secretary Clinton or anybody else, thinks that there's going to be profound changes. And we will see what happens.But the focus right now has got to be doing everything that we can to address the real issues facing the working families of this country.Mr. Trump talked about dissolving, doing away with The Affordable Care Act, throwing 20 million Americans off of health insurance.What happens to those people?He talked about the need to make college more affordable.Is he serious about doing that?RADDATZ: What has Trump's...SANDERS: So these are the real issues...RADDATZ: -- victory meant to the Democratic Party?SANDERS: -- that we've got to start focusing on.RADDATZ: What -- what will transform it?What will change in the Democratic Party?And is it time for Hillary Clinton and the Clintons to just move on?SANDERS: You know, we don't have to make this personal. Secretary Clinton has served this country for 25 years. She got two million more votes than Donald Trump did in the general election. She has a role to play.But the real issue facing, I think, the Democratic Party, is to assess where they are and they're not in a good place. And it's not just the White House, it's the Senate, it's the House, it's two thirds of the governor's chairs.What we need to do and what I am trying to do is revitalize the Democratic Party, bring in the young people, bring in the working people, become less dependent on big money.A lot of campaign contributors, big money people have done a very good job. They've tried to help.But they can't be the dominant force in the Democratic Party. We've got to open the doors. We have got to go to 50 states in this country, not just, you know, the blue states or -- or battleground state. There is no reason why we cannot win in states all over this country, because we have a message and it says at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, when the rich get richer and most other people are getting poorer, we're going to stand with working families.That is the message that will win if we take it to 50 states.RADDATZ: OK, thanks very much for joining us this morning, Senator Sanders.SANDERS: Thank you.RADDATZ: Coming up, Donald Trump's foreign policy team is coming together, but they'll have to hit the ground running against an array of threats. I'll talk to the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff about what worries him most.Plus, the Powerhouse Roundtable on Trump's latest cabinet picks and what they mean for the American economy and your bottom line.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I know more about ISIS than the generals do, believe me.I think under the leadership of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton the generals have been reduced to rubble.(END VIDEO CLIP)RADDATZ: Donald Trump had some harsh words for U.S. officers throughout his campaign but he's now turning to lots of retired top brass for advice. What will that mean for U.S. foreign policy?I'm joined now by Admiral Mike Mullen, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the highest ranking military officer in the U.S. and the president's principle military adviser.Good to see you, Admiral Mullen.ADM. MIKE MULLEN, FMR. CHAIRMAN, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF: Martha, good to be with you.RADDATZ: And I want to start with that transition. You were there for the transition between President Bush and President Obama. What's that like?MULLEN: Well, I think more than anything else it is to look at the leaving campaign rhetoric behind and the reality of governing, which just hits you square in the face.And so focusing on, finding out and focusing on the real issues that are facing the current administration and then developing policies and strategies if you will to meet those challenges.RADDATZ: And what will Donald Trump inherit? We know the ISIS problem. But there's also North Korea, which he rightly so seems very concerned about.You were on this panel, right, this panel -- the U.S. policy towards North Korea and you wrote that North Korea poses grave and expanding threat and it is likely that the next president will face a North Korea that has gained the capability to strike the United States with nuclear weapons. That would make anybody nervous.MULLEN: I think North Korea, that peninsula is more likely than anybody place else in the world to potentially create an explosive outcome particularly tied to the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The realize that he has nuclear weapons and the inability to far to contain him in that regard. And that's a place where four of the five top economies in the world are centered. Stability there is critical, and at least North Korea historically has generated a surprise if you will for new leaders in this country. And I would...RADDATZ: And nothing stopped them.MULLEN: No.RADDATZ: Not the Bush policy, not the Obama policy.MULLEN: No. I think actually this has to go through Beijing. And Beijing has pushed back on that time after time. But if Beijing doesn't leave this, we're going to get to the point where he's going to be able to put a nuclear weapon on top of an intercontinental ballistic missile that could hit the United States and that's unacceptable.RADDATZ: I want to -- Donald Trump does not have real foreign policy experience, but he's turning to a lot of people who do. Does it matter that he doesn't really have much foreign policy experience? Other presidents haven't either.MULLEN: And I think that is true. I'm encouraged actually by the fact that he is turning to people who have that experience. And that will really make a difference. The world is very unforgiving. And he has said, rightfully so, that he wants to focus here in the United States.But I've always found certainly in my time that challenges that exist international, whether it's North Korea or China or Russia or the Middle East will certainly be on his desk on day one.RADDATZ: And I mentioned in the beginning he's really turning to an unprecedented number of general officers. In his cabinet for advice. Jim Mattis's name is out there for defense secretary. How do you square that with he said during the campaign about the generals?MULLEN: Well, I would put that a category of rhetoric on one side and reality on the other. Jim Mattis is someone I've known extremely well. He's an incredibly capable individual, strategically focused internationally focused. He has good relationships on the international side and I think someone who is born to serve and could make a difference, really significant difference as well.RADDTAZ: And Mike Flynn was your intelligence officer called the J2. You've said great things about him as an intelligence officer, different job as national security adviser.MULLEN: Completely different. He was a terrific intelligence officer for me. But now he's at the hub of the national security apparatus and he's got to be an honest broker. He's got to present all opinions. He has to actually -- he and his deputy have to make the trains run on time in the White House. The number of issues are extraordinary and he has got to be able to do that to give the president and the cabinet, but really the president all the options in a way where the president can make the best decision for the security of the country.RADDATZ: Thanks very much for joining us, Admiral Mullen. We would love to have you back to talk about this more. Great to see you.We'll be right back with the powerhouse roundtable in just 30 seconds.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)RADDATZ: Let's bring in our roundtable now. Republican pollster and ABC News contributor Kristen Soltis Anderson, host of the Young Turks Cenk Uygur, Wall Street Journal White House correspondent Carol Lee, and Washington Post chief correspondent Dan Balz.Thanks for coming in, everybody.I want to start with you, Kristen. Trump's cabinet thus far and the names on the list, what have you learned about the direction of the country?KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, REPUBLICAN POLLSTER: Thus far, not a lot of his picks have been terribly surprising, many of them have been pretty predictable, right in line with a lot of the stuff that he talked about on the campaign trail.You have got, for instance, his pick for Secretary of Education who somebody that a lot of conservatives have looked at as saying, OK, this means he's actually going to pursue a right of center agenda. This makes us excited.These picks have been so important because Donald Trump ran his campaign I think based a lot on sort of personality, a strong message, but there was a lot of questions about filling in the n gaps on some of these policy areas. So that's why there's been so much I think excitement on the right about some of these picks where he's filling in the gaps in a very conservative way.RADDATZ: And, Dan, your analysis of the Trump victory cast him as the first truly independent candidate.Are you still feeling that way after you've seen some of these picks and the people he's talking to?BALZ: Martha, I don't think we know enough yet. I mean, if you think of what he hasn't done yet, we don't have a sense of what his national security team is actually going to look like. We don't have a sense of what his economic team is going to look like, in the sense that --(CROSSTALK)RADDATZ: We know Mike Flynn; we know KT McFarland, who he announced this week.DAN BALZ, WASHINGTON POST: But we don't know secretary of Defense. We don't know secretary of state --RADDATZ: What do you think about what Kellyanne Conway said about Mitt Romney?BALZ: Well, she's channeling something. And Iâm not quite sure what. But she's trying to do everything she possibly can to deny Mitt Romney getting secretary of state. And it seems as though there may be other names in the mix, as we learned late in the week.So I think, until we get a full picture of it, it's hard to determine, at this point, whether he's going to be as independent as some of his policies. The things he talked about in that video that he put out just before Thanksgiving, his 100-day things, he talked about getting out of TPP.I mean, that's something that the rest of the party is not necessarily in favor of. So there's a lot that's still up in the air.RADDATZ: And it sounds like that he's listening to a lot of different people.Carol, I want to turn to the potential of conflicts of interest, something we haven't really talked about. You reported that Obama liquidated most of his assets in 2008 to avoid concerns about whether a decision he made might be even inadvertently benefit him.Trump on Wednesday told ""The New York Times"" that, under the law, the president can't have a conflict of interest.Who is right?CAROL LEE, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Well, I mean, it remains to be seen exactly what Donald Trump does here. I think typically you would see a president-elect try to get out in front of this. He hasn't shown any interest so far in doing that.I think when you hear stories, like the fact that he was speaking to a very high-level British politician about not having windmills off the coast of Scotland, where one of his properties is, those are things that really raise concerns with people.And I do think that if he doesn't get out in front of this soon and have some kind of a strategy for dealing with this, you're going to see a drip, drip, drip of all of these stories coming out. And this will be a narrative that really dogs his presidency at a time when he's trying to do a number of different things on the economy, on national security. And this will be a big distraction.RADDATZ: And Cenk, conflicts aside, we have seen his approval rating rise since the election.CENK UYGUR, THE YOUNG TURKS: Yes.RADDATZ: So what is that all about?And what do you think he needs to do going forward?Just listening to him the past couple of weeks.UYGUR: Yes, so I can understand why his numbers go up because the American people are very optimistic. And I have now talked to a great number of Hillary Clinton voters, who said, hey, let's give the guy a chance.And so if you're progressive and he kills TPP, you're happy about that. And he talks about spending $1 trillion in infrastructure, great. President Obama should have spent $1 trillion in infrastructure.So he's out-populisting the Democrats. That's why he won in the first place. Now those are all the good news. There's a lot of bad news out there, too. I mean, he said he would drain the swamp.So far his cabinet is the swamp. Betsy DeVos is a proud member of the donor class. She says she expects a return on investment. And the conflict of interest is out of control to -- he brags about it. He has his kids in the meetings with the leaders of foreign countries, Japan, Argentina, et cetera, and brings in --(CROSSTALK)RADDATZ: Which I'm sure -- I think he'll just say, look, my daughter was just in that meeting.UYGUR: Yes.RADDATZ: You're not buying that?UYGUR: She runs my business.No. He said it right after the election. He said, hey, I told the American people I have property all over the world and they elected me anyway. Oh, he didn't have 10 billion going in. He'll have 10 billion going out.ANDERSON: My hope is Donald Trump picks the most qualified people for these positions and that he bucks the way that he's been portrayed in the media.You know, he's been portrayed as someone who likes to reward his friends, who takes slights very personally. You'll notice in Kellyanne Conway's criticism of Mitt Romney that it wasn't about his qualifications for the job.And as we've discussed on this show earlier, there's been -- the world is a very dangerous place now. We're going to need a secretary of state who can renegotiate an Iran deal. We're going to need a secretary of state who can step up and be a strong voice if China gets adventurous in the South China Sea.We need somebody who, as secretary of state, is the most qualified person for the job. I think Donald Trump can surprise a lot of people. But defying the media's portrayal of him, putting truly qualified people in positions, not just --RADDATZ: Do you see that happening, Carol?LEE: Well, I agree with Dan. I donât think that we don't know yet. I think whoever wins out in this fight between -- over Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani will tell us a lot about the direction that this administration is going to go.But I think it's too soon to tell. We don't have the big ticket Cabinet secretaries filled in. We don't -- he has not named that much staff so far.I covered President Obama's transition and, at this point, things were much further along; you had a much clearer vision. And the rollout was clear in that you understood where the president-elect wanted to go in terms of policies and the vision that he had for his presidency. And we just have not seen that yet.RADDATZ: And Dan, I want to talk about relations with the press, which have been a little testy sometimes.What will it be like to cover Donald Trump at the White House?BALZ: I think it will be a huge challenge, a bigger challenge than we have ever had, certainly in my lifetime, in dealing with somebody who has, over the course of the campaign, been very hostile toward the press; has talked about, you know, changing the First Amendment or changing the libel laws, which would require changing the -- you know.He was more generous when he went to ""The New York Times"" last week and said you're a jewel. He had previously threatened to sue them over a tax story they did.I think his instincts are, as we have seen, to fight back whenever he feels aggrieved. And if the press does its role, it's going to be very tough. It's tough on every president. No president likes the press. And we'll see whether Donald Trump acts differently as president than he did as a candidate.RADDATZ: OK. And just quickly, Cenk, last thing, there was so much outrage when Candidate Trump refused to say he would definitely accept the results of the election.Now some on the Left don't seem to be accepting those results. You heard us talk about that today.Is that hypocritical?UYGUR: Not at all. So if -- a recount is a perfectly normal part of the process. So if you decide to go outside of the process, then I would be with you.Hey, wait, wait, wait. We were on Trump for doing that. I totally agree it would be hypocritical.But if you're within a percent -- and there are rules in every state on this -- perfectly right to call for a recount.I don't know, you know, I saw the interview obviously earlier in the show. I don't know why they're so nervous. They're just so jittery about -- no recount, no recount. Whatever we do, don't do a recount.Just calm down. If you think you won, the recount will show the same thing.RADDATZ: OK.Thanks for all of you for joining us this morning. Great to have you here on a holiday weekend. We'll be right back after this from our ABC stations.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)RADDATZ: Before we go, we have a very big welcome to our newest viewer, Riaz Delawala, born yesterday -- born Wednesday night just minutes before Thanksgiving to long-time THIS WEEK producer, Imtiyaz Delawala and his wife, Risak (ph).Congratulations to the whole family.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. The year in review -- looking back at some of the biggest stories of 2014 and what we should expect in the year ahead. WALLACE:Â From the midterm elections and that GOP wave set to sweep over Washington. SEN.-ELECT CORY GARDNER , R-COLO.:Â Tonight, we shook up the Senate. You shook up the Senate. SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, R-KY., INCOMING MAJORITY LEADER:Â I would welcome the president moving to the middle. First indications have not been very hopeful. WALLACE:Â To the growing fight against ISIS. GEN. MARTIN DEMPSEY, CJCS:Â This is an organization that has an apocalyptic end-of-days strategic vision, which will eventually have to be defeated. WALLACE:Â And old wounds of racial discrimination reopen. Our Sunday group journalists Jason Riley, Susan Page, Steve Hayes, and Bob Woodward on this year's biggest headlines. Then, looking ahead to 2015. We'll get our panelists' predictions on politics, the economy, entertainment, and sports. And a rare interview with author Laura Hillenbrand, whose bestseller ""Unbroken"" is now a major motion picture. LAURA HILLENBRAND, AUTHOR:Â I think Louis has an inspiration for a generation of people. He is a man who survived the seemingly unsurvivable. WALLACE:Â And hello again from FOX News in Washington. First, some breaking news. Search-and-rescue operations are under way after an AirAsia flight carrying 162 people went missing over the Java Sea. The plane headed from Indonesia to Singapore lost contact with air traffic control about an hour before it was due to land. The pilots had asked to change course to avoid bad weather. It's been a remarkable year in the news with shocking developments from the bitter debate over race and justice, to the rise of a new terror threat in the Middle East. Today, we want to drill down to get some perspective on this year's biggest stories. And we begin with the year in politics that saw voters turn over Congress to Republicans while President Obama pushed the limits of executive action. Here to help us understand where we are and where we're headed, let's bring in our Sunday group. Jason Riley of ""The Wall Street Journal"", Susan Page, Washington bureau chief of ""USA Today"", ""The Weekly Standard's"" Steve Hayes, and Bob Woodward from ""The Washington Post"". The big story in politics this year, of course, was the Republican wave on Election Day. The GOP picked up nine seats in the Senate and will now have a 54 to 46 majority. In the House, the GOP picked up 13 seat, the new balance of power 247 Republicans, 188 Democrats. The question for President Obama and new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is how will they handle the new reality? BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:Â I intend to continue to do what I've been doing, which is where I see a big problem and the opportunity to help the American people and it is within my lawful authority to provide that help, I'm going to do it. MCCONNELL:Â The American people have spoken. They've given us divided government. The question for both the president and for the speaker and myself and our members is, what are you going to do with it? WALLACE:Â Jason, what do you expect in 2015? Do you expect the president to continue to act on his own or do you expect some real bipartisan compromise with a Republican Congress? JASON RILEY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:Â Probably a little more of the latter. I'm optimistic, Chris. I think Republicans are going to try and use the majority to show voters that they can govern. They want to put legislation in front of the president, whether it's immigration reform, tax reform, maybe even health care reform. Whether the president signs it is another matter. But gone are the days when Harry Reid can stop the president from having even to consider difficult legislation. WALLACE:Â When you look back at the president' actions, executive actions this year, it's a pretty remarkable list. Let's put it up on screen. An order, raising the minimum wage for federal workers, climate deal with China on carbon emissions, shielding 5 million illegal immigrants from deportation, resuming diplomatic relations with Cuba. Susan, how far do you expect the president to go on this wave of executive action? And at some point, will either Congress or the Supreme Court say enough? SUSAN PAGE, USA TODAY:Â Well, you know, it's interesting those four things you list, three have happened in the past eight weeks since the midterm elections, which were undeniably a rebuke of President Obama by voters. But since then, he's demonstrated how powerful a lame-duck president can be. And if the Republicans, I think we'll see some pushback by Republicans in Congress, you know, another effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act and so on. But they're in box it seems to me because actions that they take that are at odds with President Obama he's likely just to veto. So -- and it seems to me, it's hard for them son some of these fronts to do much to curtail the powers that he's showing by executive order. Steve, do you buy that, as the new Republican majority in a box? STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD:Â Yes. I think it's difficult for them to practically do much to stop the president. Although I disagree strongly with Jason, I'm not optimistic at all that either Republicans or the president are going to try to work together in any kind of a concerted way. I think you're going to have basically a year of the two parties and the two major ends of Pennsylvania Avenue talking past one another. The president is going to push forward with executive orders, do everything he possibly can, push the limits, maybe go beyond the limits as I think has in a couple cases already, and Republicans are going to do everything they can to set forth an alternative agenda that they're not going to be much. But I agree they would like to make the president be the obstructionist. They would like the president to be, you know, the party of no, the Democrats to be the party of no. Will it be covered that way? I'm not very optimistic. WALLACE:Â Let me, before I get to you, Bob, let me ask you, Steve, about one potential flashpoint that I know that you've been covering and that's Guantanamo, because this president seems very determined to do everything he can to close the prison at Guantanamo. It now holds 132 detainees, that's the fewest since President Bush opened the facility. Steve, how explosive if President Obama continues to go down this path? HAYES:Â Very, I think. And you'll see Republicans almost unanimous in their opposition to what the president does. But the group I'll be watching is Democrats. Democrats in Congress, whatever moderate Democrats are left in Congress, do they support the president as he goes about emptying Guantanamo? I mean, there are reports that he wants to release or transfer another three, four dozen of the detainees who remain there of the 150-some-odd detainees who remain there to this day. Detainees who are there to this day are there for a reason. These are the worst of the worst that we've been hearing about. WALLACE:Â Well, wait. Of the 132, I think about 68 have been cleared for release. One could argue whether they should be. But you're right, 64 of them have not been cleared for release and those certainly are the worst of the worst. HAYES:Â Well, of those who have been cleared for release, it's important to understand what happened. There was the original Guantanamo Joint Task Force, the intel that made these assessments high risk, medium risk, low risk, in terms of transfers. Then, the president empanelled a separate board, which reviewed what the work of the intelligence professionals and re-categorized a lot of these. And the president's board, which was made up a lot of human rights lawyer, folks who are more sympathetic to emptying Guantanamo, not surprisingly came to different conclusions than the intelligence specialists. WALLACE:Â But you're saying all of these are high risks. HAYES:Â Cleared for release does not mean innocent or somebody who is not a risk. WALLACE:Â Bob, and I have to sort of count this up -- you've been covering Washington for more than 40 years now. BOB WOODWARD, THE WASHINGTON POST:Â Yes. People ask, what did I think of Grover Cleveland? WALLACE:Â I get those questions too. WALLACE:Â With the exception of Richard Nixon, who you did cover, we all know, have you ever seen a president act on his own, go off on his own to the degree that this president has? WOODWARD:Â Well, I don't think -- I agree with Jason in terms of what's going on here and what might happen, and I would be optimistic. I think the issue this year that was hidden in plain sight and kind of snuck by was the deal on a trillion dollars of spending, a deal between Obama and the Congress. And it worked. They didn't go to the brink. They didn't shut down government. And I think both Obama and the Republicans see value in achieving some things. And, of course, when you achieve something, you have to give up something in divided government, and I think people are willing. So, I think there will be steps here. On your question -- you know, because Obama's declared I'm doing all of these thing, if you go back and look at all other presidents, they, without declaring them, just doing them, did lots of things through executive action. I don't think it's changed the dynamic. It is inevitably big news. But, I -- you know, one of the little secrets that has not been much discussed is that Mitch McConnell is a deal maker. Now, he's majority leader, and I think he can work with Obama if not at least with Joe Biden. WALLACE:Â That's right. Uncle Joe. I want to switch political subjects because it won't be long into 2015 before we start seeing candidates, and we've already started to see Jeb Bush talk about running for president in 2016. I want to put up the latest Real Clear Politics polls. This is the average of recent polls. Hillary Clinton continues on the Democratic side to swamp a possible Democratic field, including, yes, Senator Elizabeth Warren. Among Republicans, Jeb Bush has a small lead over Paul Ryan and Chris Christie, in a field of 12 potential candidates. I want to play clips for you of Bush on what it will take for a Republican to win the White House and Clinton on whether it's important to have a woman president. HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE:Â It matters because we have half the population that has given so much to building this country, to making it work, and of course I want to see a woman in the White House. JEB BUSH, R, FORMER FLORIDA GOVERNOR:Â It has to be much more uplifting, much more positive, much more willing to, you know, be practical now in Washington where lose the primary to win the general without violating your principles. WALLACE:Â Susan, you are already on the campaign trail. How strong do you think Clinton and Jeb Bush are in their respective primary contests at this absurdly early day? SUSAN PAGE, USA TODAY:Â I think that Hillary Clinton is in a situation where she can cost herself the Democratic nomination and no one else can cost it for her. It would take a decision on her part or a big error on her part for her not to be nominated by the Democrats. I don't think Jeb Bush is in nearly that same position on the Republican side. There's going to be a big field on the Republican side. There's going to be a big debate about where the Republican Party stands going forward. I mean, he's got a strong position. His name is well-known. Some antipathy towards the Bush name has faded over the past eight years, past six years. He'll be able to raise a lot of money. But so will some of these other contenders. And you'll see I think a powerful demonstration by Rand Paul, who's been maybe the most interesting new figure on the Republican scene, by Scott Walker. I think he has the potential to be formidable. So, I would see a big fight on the Republican side, but on the Democratic side, it's all up to Hillary. WALLACE:Â Thirty seconds left, Jason, in the political panel. How solid is Hillary Clinton at this point? Is she still just cruising to this nomination? JASON RILEY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:Â I think that the Democratic side of this could look a lot different in six months. I think you could see names like Jerry Brown, the governor of California, into the mix. I'm not sure Hillary is sure she's going to run yet. So, I don't know if it she's -- if it's baked in the cake for Hillary. I really don't think she's made up her mind at this point. And I know there are others chomping at the bit, not just Elizabeth Warren. WALLACE:Â Well, as the host of the Sunday talk show, all we hope for is a good race in both sides. We need to step aside far moment, but when we come back, racial tensions in America reach a breaking point. PROTESTERS:Â Hands up, don't shot! Hands up, don't shot! WALLACE:Â Protests continue in cities across the country as a slain New York police officer is laid to rest. JOSEPH BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:Â When an assassin's bullet targeted two officers, it targeted this city. WALLACE:Â The deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in Staten Island, were the catalysts, reopening old wounds separating blacks from whites. But where does the debate over race and justice go from here? Our year in review panel tackles race in America, next. BIDEN:Â I believe that the state police force in this incredibly diverse city can and will show the nation how to bridge any divide. WALLACE:Â Vice President Biden speaking yesterday at the funeral of New York City Police Officer Rafael Ramos, one of two policemen executed by a man who said he was avenging the killing of unarmed black men by police. More than 20,000 law enforcement officers gathered for the ceremony. Jason, how do you explain it? With an African-American president in a country that some people said was post-racial, how do you explain the fact that we're having this debate over race and the criminal justice system and it's still so raw? RILEY:Â Well, part of it is the left has no interest in being post-racial. I think they pretend to want to be post-racial, but they practice identity politics, which is divvying us up by race and gender and sexual orientation, and making specific appeals based on those characteristics. So, I think the whole notion that the left wants to be post-racial is false. And this is I think demonstrates that. What we see with this false narrative being pushed in the wake of the Garner and the Ferguson incidents. The problem is not police shooting black men. That is not what is driving the homicide rate in this country. It is non-police shootings of black men that is driving the homicide rate, yet we have protesters all over this country pushing a false narrative and everyone from the president on down refusing to simply correct the record here. WALLACE:Â But it's not just Ferguson, and it's not just New York City. Let me put these numbers on the screen. In a recent poll, whites are more than twice as likely as blacks to think that both races are treated equally by police. You see only 22 percent of blacks think they face equal treatment by police. Bob, this is a continuing problem. BOB WOODWARD, THE WASHINGTON POST:Â Well, of course it is. It's real. But I thought at that funeral, Bill Bratton, who's the police commissioner, gave a very good talk, and he said, quote, ""When we see each other, we'll heal."" And I think that's exactly -- this is about exposure. This is about talking. It is a serious problem, one obviously Obama hasn't solved, and it's going to continue. WALLACE:Â When he says when we see each other, it's 2014, we do have an African-American president. When are we going to see each other if we don't see each other now? WOODWARD:Â Well, it takes work and takes lessons -- I mean, awful, tragic lesson like this that push the issue in people's faces. And, you know, the police department's going to be strong and will go on and do its job, and so will New York City and all of these places. But no one has found a formula to bring about that healing, including Obama. WALLACE:Â Well, you talk about New York City and we've seen an awful, a terrible case study in New York over the last month or so, after the grand jury voted not to indict the police officer in the Eric Garner choking, the mayor talked about teaching his biracial son to protect himself not only from criminals but also from the police. Then, at the funeral yesterday, the mayor continued to try to reach out to the force. MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D), NEW YORK CITY MAYOR:Â For so many of our young people, there's a fear, and for so many of our families, there's a fear. So I've had to worry over the years. Chirlane had to worry, was Dante safe each night. Police officers are called peace officers because that's what they do, they keep the peace. WALLACE:Â But outside the church, hundreds of police officers turned their back on the screen outside the church showing the words of Mayor de Blasio. Steve, de Blasio has unleashed quite a backlash in New York, hasn't he? STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD:Â He has. And I think looking forward this is of most concern. You have Mayor de Blasio who ran for office in effect running against tougher policing. He basically said, yes, it's true we have peace and security in New York City, but that's not necessarily the result of the policies followed by Mayor Giuliani, Mayor Bloomberg, et cetera, so he came in to change it. He frontally took on the unions, the police force, and aligned himself purposefully with the protesters. It's no surprise now that the police force, that the police unions in particular are saying you're not our guy, and we don't buy the words that you're saying now in the aftermath of the tragic killing of these two officers, when you weren't with us before. So, I think Mayor de Blasio has a lot of work to do, and I'm not sure he's going to be able to solve that rift, to bridge that gap between the things he said, the way he ran and the way the police look at him now. WALLACE:Â We asked you for questions for the panel and we got this on Facebook, from Tammy Korol, who wrote, ""Why is it all we ever get told is that the police community must be retrained to learn how to deal with black communities but no one has ever introduced the concept of the black community to be trained to be law abiding, productive, respectful citizens?"" Susan, that's pretty tough talk, but to get back -- and I'm sure some people will be offended by it -- but it is the view of a lot of people, and to get back to what Jason said, the biggest threat to young black men doesn't come from the cops. It comes from other young black men. SUSAN PAGE, USA TODAY:Â Yes. Well, that's undeniably true, and shouldn't be .ignored. But, surely, it's possible to criticize police tactics that target African-American men inappropriately, as I think you have to say that Eric Garner cell phone video showed without criticizing the police force as a whole, honoring the police force for what they do, and the great danger that they undergo, but there are cases in which the behavior of the police has been inappropriate and ought to be addressed. JASON RILEY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:Â But the problem is when we take exception and pretend they're the norm. Clearly, there is excess force used by police in some cases. But that's not producing the high black body count in the country. Tension between the black community and the police department stems from black criminality in this country, high black crime rates. Blacks are about 13 percent of the population but commit half of all murders in this country. Blacks are arrested at two to three times their number in the population for all manner of violent crime, all the manner of property crime. Until that ends, you are going to have tensions between the police and the black community. You are going to have young black men viewed suspiciously. If we want to address perceptions, negative perceptions of young black men, we have to address the behavior that is driving those perceptions, and that is not a conversation President Obama or Eric Holder or Al Sharpton or all the rest want to have because they have a vested interest in pushing a false narrative, which is that racism is an all-purpose explanation of what drives what's wrong in Black America. BOB WOODWARD, THE WASHINGTON POST:Â OK. But the mayor of New York now has a big leadership challenge, and he can't distance himself from the police force. It's his police force. It's like when the president criticized the CIA and all of a sudden, it's their CIA, they look very differently on it if -- and they have to reach out. And he's got to reach out to the police force, and that's where there has to be some reconciliation. And, you know, that's not hard for a good leader. STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD:Â At the very least, he needs to stop I would say demonizing the police force despite the fact that -- I mean, the Eric Garner video was horrendous, it's one of the things that has caused people to react in this sort of gut level way. And I think it's a mistake to lump the Ferguson verdict and the Ferguson outcome where I think you can have people with very different views come to different conclusions. I mean, reasonable people can disagree with what happened there if you read the grand jury testimony. The Eric Garner case is very different. When you look at the video, it seems inconceivable that that was a proportionate response to whatever it was that he had done. It may be the case as Jason suggested, I think it is the case, that that's not representative of sort of day to day policing in the United States. But it's -- the perception in this case is the reality and is driving this debate. WALLACE:Â That gets us to another issue, that is the grand jury and what we saw one could argue rightly or wrongly in Ferguson but I think much more troublesome in the case of Staten Island is that you get a grand jury with a prosecutor who deals with the police force every day and he goes and talks to the grand jury and somehow in the Garner case, best example, not only isn't the cop convicted, he's not even passed to stand trial, you know, a reasonable cause. I mean, the question there was not reasonable cause that he had caused the death, maybe not murder but manslaughter, whatever, of Eric Garner certainly is troublesome, isn't it? PAGE:Â Well, and there are two things that could address this problem. One is to remove prosecution from local prosecutors. PAGE:Â In cop cases where police officers are accused of inappropriate death of a suspect or an individual. And the other is body cameras. I mean, it seems to me that the power of the cell phone video in the garner case was like that could have also exonerated the police if it had shown a different scene. So, the move toward body cameras for police seems to be an important step that could address some of the deficiencies you see in perceptions. WALLACE:Â Jason, do you agree to any of these reforms or do you think we're just going the wrong turn? RILEY:Â I mean, the -- we had a camera in the Garner case. But that's not all the in evidence that case. Only the grand jury has seen all of the evidence in that case, and I'm reluctant to second guess a group of people that has seen all of the evidence, where we just seen the snippet. So, I'd be hesitant. Both the prosecutors in New York and St. Louis have successfully prosecuted other cops in the past. So the idea that they can't do this properly again is something I'm not going to assume. WALLACE:Â All right. Panel, let's take another break. Up next, new challenges to the U.S. overseas from Russia and from ISIS. WALLACE:Â As the terror threat grew, President Obama's policy to combat it kept changing. BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:Â As commander in chief, I will not allow the United States to be dragged into fighting another war in Iraq. I don't want to put the cart before the horse. We don't have a strategy. There's going to be no reasoning, no negotiation with this brand of evil. The only language understood by killers like this is the language of force. WALLACE:Â Brutal executions and the seizure of broad chunks of territory finally pushed the White House to respond with U.S.-led air strikes. But where do we stand now in the fight against Islamic extremists? As âFox News Sundayâsâ year in review continues. BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:Â But the world is better, it's safer, it's more peaceful, it's more prosperous, and our homeland is protected because of you and because of the sacrifices you make each and every day. WALLACE:Â President Obama telling troops on Hawaii on Christmas day things are getting better, headed into the New Year. Steve, give us an overview. Is the world safer? Is it more peaceful? HAYES:Â No, absolutely not. And the president there is not only contradicting, I think, the reality, the way that the American people look at the world, he's contradicting the views of his top intelligence officials. You've heard from Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mike Rogers, the Republican chair of the House Intelligence Committee, the president's own top intelligence advisers that ISIS is growing stronger. James Clapper in testimony that he gave earlier this fall said he's never seen the world as crazy as it is right now. So the president's living in an alternate universe, and I think part of the reason that we're at that point is because he's been living that way for the past six years. He's choosing to govern in a world as he wants to see it rather than the world as it is. So you are seeing while the president has in effect ended the war on terror, not won the war on terror, ended the war on terror, you've seen ISIS grow, you've seen al Qaeda gather territory, amass territory throughout the region. You've seen them grow in Africa, you've seen them grow across the region, you've seen Russia taking over territory in ways that we would have thought would be inconceivable just a few years ago. And the United States is not exercising its strength or influence. WALLACE:Â You know, Bob, one of the things that struck me preparing for this show is a year ago Crimea was still part of Ukraine. A year ago maybe Steve, because he's very up on these issues, but I'd never heard of ISIS, which, again, overview, is the world safer than it was a year ago? WOODWARD:Â Well, it clearly is not, and Obama has contradicted himself on that because he's declared war on ISIS and said not just are we going to contain it, but we are going to destroy it. So there's lots of danger out there. But at the same time, if I may say this, there was some excellent reporting in my own paper, ""The Washington Post,"" by Liz Sly about ISIS and said they have lots of trouble putting this government together. Electricity is not sufficient. Water is not sufficient. WALLACE:Â They're talking about creating an Islamic state, not just having ... WOODWARD:Â Yeah. They don't have a capital or they've created a capital. They don't get Baghdad. They don't get Damascus. They have no currency as they've promised. There are lots of governing problems that are very real that are staring them down. Now, does that mean they're going to go away? Absolutely not. I thought in your paper, Jason, there was an excellent interview with General Allen, who's the envoy to the region for President Obama. And essentially what Allen said is we're going to move along slowly on this. It is a giant problem. And there's almost a disconnect with Obama where he said we're going to destroy him and Allen says we're going to contain them. WALLACE:Â Well, let's talk about that, because after a very shaky start when he said we don't even have this strategy in the middle of the summer, President Obama finally in the fall declared war on ISIS. Here he is. OBAMA:Â We will degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL through a comprehensive and sustained counterterrorism strategy. WALLACE:Â So, Jason, how are we doing? RILEY:Â Things are getting better. I think we'll make some incremental progress. Though I don't - mostly in Iraq, though. I don't know that we're going to go into Syria, and which is where the heart of the problem is. But so long as we have a president that doesn't appreciate the importance of U.S. global leadership, the world will be less safe, than it ought to be, and that's what we have in Obama. And to get back to Steve's point about Obama governing in a way that he wants the world to look instead of governing the way it actually is, it ties back into our discussion of Gitmo and trying to close Gitmo. We don't send people to Gitmo anymore. And something like a third of the people we've released have rejoined the battlefield. That ties indirectly with this ISIS thing sneaking up on us. We don't send people to Gitmo anymore, and interrogate them anymore and find out about the intelligence. We don't have that operation anymore because this president is more interested in obtaining a political goal of shutting down Gitmo regardless of whether it helps us fight these real-world problems. WALLACE:Â You know, I was talking about things that we weren't aware of a year ago or hadn't happened a year ago. One thing we were talking about a year ago was the effort by the U.S. and our allies to restrict Iran's nuclear program and we were about to begin talks with Iran. Well, it's a year later, the talks have been extended twice, they've missed two deadlines. Here is Secretary of State John Kerry on the continuing effort. JOHN KERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE:Â We would be fools to walk away from a situation where the breakout time has already been expended rather than narrowed. And where the world is safer because this program is in place. WALLACE:Â Susan, do we finally get a deal in 2015? We certainly didn't this year. And if not, what does President Obama do about Iran? PAGE:Â You know, I think it's entirely possible we get a deal, and it's not only because of the negotiations that have gone on and on and on. It's also because of what's happened with oil prices, which has put enormous pressures on the Iranian economy beyond what our own sanctions have - have caused them to do. I think that leads us to the possibility of getting a deal, and that would be despite the problems with ISIS, which I agree you can hardly overestimate the threat from ISIS now. That would be very good news and a huge achievement by this administration. WALLACE:Â You know, it's interesting because that is certainly something we didn't even see on the horizon a year ago. And some could argue it could end up being the biggest foreign policy story in 2015, and that is that just the collapse of oil prices around the world. Talk about the deal with Iran and talk about the impact that these cratering oil prices, Steve, could have not only on the mullahs in Iran, but also on Vladimir Putin and Russia. HAYES:Â Well, I think it does, I think Susan is right. I think it does put additional pressure on the mullahs in Iran to want to find a way to get to a deal. But I don't think that that's a difficult place for them to be, because I don't think the administration has driven a very hard bargain. The administration sees the deal itself as the accomplishment. It almost doesn't even matter what the details of the deal are at this point. They want a deal for the sake of having a deal, largely because people will say this is an achievement, having gotten the deal. WOODWARD:Â I think that's really unfair. I mean, they haven't been negotiating all this time just because they want a deal. They've been negotiating about the particulars. HAYES:Â There's no question they've been negotiating about the particulars. WOODWARD:Â There are certain things they want to get. And I can share your cynicism about some of this, but I think John Kerry's really worked hard on this and there is a potential to ... HAYES:Â I don't even suggest that they are not negotiating anything. I mean to suggest that they know that they want to get a deal because they'll be praised for ending up with a deal. And as we've seen in other deals that the administration has struck, that it doesn't matter what the details of the deal are. They want the deal for the sake of having the deal. The diplomacy is the end -- do you think they're going to have a deal? WOODWARD:Â Well, who knows? I mean some of it we know, some of it we don't. One reality here, which you know well, is the intelligence community in the United States is looking over their shoulder, and it's quite likely they'll blow the whistle on some sort of deal that doesn't give them the sort of verification that they want ... HAYES:Â I don't know. We basically caught - we've caught Iran cheating on the interim deal and rather than saying look, we're done, you've proven that you're not an effective partner that we can't trust you, that the very occasion (ph) measures that we have may have worked, and this is - this is why we can't trust them eventually. And the administration doesn't say that. They say we'll give you more time because we're going to get to a deal. RILEY:Â I just want to bring in how this could affect Russia. The Russian ruble hit a low against the dollar recently. Inflation is accelerating there. Capital is blamed (ph). These are body blows to the Putin regime. It will be interesting ... WALLACE:Â But the question is ... WALLACE:Â does that make him less aggressive on the world stage or does he -- and some say that's what he did in 2014, hold up the shiny object of some new adventure, to try to rally the Russian people around him? RILEY:Â I think potentially it makes him more dangerous. How will the Kremlin respond? Will they lash out at their neighbors, will they cut off gas supplies, as they've done in the past, in the middle of winter? I think they need to be watched. WALLACE:Â All right. We have to take another break. But when we come back, the real fund against - is our Sunday group gives us their predictions for 2015. GEORGE WILL:Â I want to first look for areas that we can agree on. And there probably are some. TED CRUZ:Â The era of Obamalawlessness is over. WALLACE:Â Entertainment and sports. All to come on Fox News Sunday's ""Year in Review."" WALLACE:Â We have a year-end tradition around here to have the panel make some predictions for the New Year on a range of topics. And under the heading often an error but never in doubt, let's get to it. All right, Jason. Start us off on politics. RILEY:Â Barack Obama, our twice-elected black president, will use his State of the Union address to lecture America on the persistence of racism. WALLACE:Â And will he also talks about the issues, the responsibility in the black community? PAGE:Â Jason, you started out by talking about how Mitch McConnell is a deal maker. Maybe that was you, Chris, who said that. I think we'll see the Republican-controlled Senate move within the first six weeks to confirm the nominations of Loretta Lynch to be attorney general and Ashton Carter to be Secretary of Dense in a demonstration they can get some things done. And I think after that they may confirm no one else. WALLACE:Â And does Ted Cruz throw a wrench into the gears? PAGE:Â Ted Cruz has the ability to throw a wrench into the gears, but Mitch McConnell is a guy who knows how to work the Senate rules and he's really eager to demonstrate his skill at that. HAYES:Â So, earlier in the show you showed polls showing that Jeb Bush was the Republican front-runner and Hillary Clinton is the Democratic front-runner. I think sitting here a year from now, as we are heading into Iowa, Jeb Bush will no longer be the Republican front-runner and Hillary Clinton will look surprisingly vulnerable as we get ready for voters to actually turn out. WALLACE:Â And who will be the frontrunner on the Republican side? HAYES:Â Going into Iowa maybe Scott Walker, maybe Rand Paul ... HAYES:Â Maybe Ted Cruz. Hey, she said Scott Walker first ... WALLACE:Â And Hillary will look vulnerable just because she's been bad or because somebody else will have risen? HAYES:Â I think there's so little enthusiasm for Hillary among the Democratic base as evidenced by her book launch, as evidenced by the responses to her, when she gives speeches. Somebody is going to come and some other candidate will have a moment, the question is that other candidate be viable. WALLACE:Â And who will that be? HAYES:Â So, there are limits to those prediction. Bob, your prediction on politics. WOODWARD:Â Wolf, first of all, there's a theory of the case here, and that is that the Republicans are going to nominate somebody who's not a shouter, somebody who's soft, somebody who can govern. I think particularly on your poll it showed Governor Kasich of Ohio at 2.5 percent. My god, he won by 18 points in Ohio. Blue state, red state. So I think it's either Paul Ryan or Rand Paul who interestingly enough is not a shouter. I saw him in San Francisco at a tech conference a couple of months ago, and he charmed absolutely everyone. And so, you know, it's going to come from the Midwest. Finally going to have its moment in Republican politics. WALLACE:Â And we should point out you're a Midwest guy, right? PAGE:Â Yeah, me too. And you. WALLACE:Â All right. Economy. Let's move on to there. In fact, that we have to say, Jason, the economy ending the year is strong. RILEY:Â I'm very bullish, Chris. Yes, five percent growth in the third quarter, consumer spending is up. I could see GDP around three percent in 2015. Unemployment could get as low as five percent. And I think the Dow could reach as high as 19,000. PAGE:Â I would say we should curb the shed and (INAUDIBLE) we are feeling about Russia's economic problems because the decline of the Russian economy, which is incredibly serious, is going to be a big problem for European economy, and that's going to have an effect on our growth next year as well. WALLACE:Â So, you're saying that Jason's wrong. PAGE:Â I'm saying I hope Jason is right, but I'm saying that this is a - while the economic news is generally good for the United States and we're doing well compared to the rest of the world, there is a cloud on the horizon. HAYES:Â Yeah, I'm much more embarrassed than Jason. I think if we see continued growth, but I expect we'll see continued growth, but if we see that growth, it will come in fits and starts. It won't be a national - certainly, we are not going to be growing from five percent. Three percent sounds reasonable. I wouldn't be surprised if we come in below that. Unemployment may tick down. But I don't think this is likely to be a very good year for the economy. WOODWARD:Â I forgot what I said. I mean, who knows? WALLACE:Â What you said - you should have a note here. You said that Obama and Congress ... WOODWARD:Â Yeah, I think tax reform is the giant issue and if there's ever any movement on that and you want to make sense out of our economy, fix the taxing system, which is all screwed up. And there is a moment for both Obama and the Republicans to do something. WALLACE:Â OK. That was very interesting. I don't think I've ever had a prediction where the person forgets -- just write them down on a piece of paper. WOODWARD:Â Well, you asked for our predictions two weeks ago. WALLACE:Â Anyway, that hasn't changed. Sports. RILEY:Â Johnny Manziel, the Cleveland Browns quarterback, will continue to disappoint his fans, even when we comes back from his injury, and continue to prove his skeptics correct. I think he's headed for a career closer to a Tim Tebow than Eli Manning. WALLACE:Â Oh my gosh. And I must say this thing of, you know, show me the money ... WALLACE:Â that every time they sack him, they just - the defensemen do that right in his face. Susan? PAGE:Â Let's go Nats. I mean the Nats had a kind of a disappointing season this year. WALLACE:Â To point out, that's a Washington baseball. PAGE:Â The Washington Nationals. But they will make it to the World Series next year, first time since 1933. They will win the World Series, first time since 1924. WALLACE:Â Finally, a bold prediction. I have to say also the Washington Wizards, our basketball team, very strong. And John Wall, a potential MVP. WALLACE:Â That's right. It's our year. And America is not going to be particularly happy about that. Steve. HAYES:Â I'm not a Washington sports fan in general, but the Washington Capitals have been on a tear and I think are well positioned to make a run in the Stanley cup playoffs. That's not my prediction. My prediction is that -- the Wisconsin Badgers will win the NCAA men's basketball tournament. Why are you laughing? Because this is a serious prediction. WALLACE:Â Have you mentioned the fact that you come from Wisconsin? HAYES:Â I come from Wisconsin, look, I didn't pick the Packers to win the Super Bowl. HAYES:Â But Badgers - I think I ranked sixth as of right now. WALLACE:Â Does that show a lack of confidence in the Packers? HAYES:Â They've had a rough couple of games against Buffalo and Tampa over the past couple of weeks. No, I think the Packers will do well and could make a super bowl run. I'm just very confident in the Badgers. WALLACE:Â And I'm handing Bob - there's your prediction. WOODWARD:Â No, this was, I remember, because I did some reporting and I actually put some thought into it, and that is Danny Snyder, the owner of the Redskins, who's had past success in business, will realize he's part of the problem and he's going to sell it. He's going to sell the Redskins and the bidding war is going to be between Apple and Google. They are the ones that have the money. They're the only ones who could afford it. I mean think of it, the Washington Apples? WALLACE:Â Well, let me say, I think - there was absolutely no chance of that happening. I know Mr. Snyder a little bit. He ain't selling. All right. We've got less than two minutes left. Entertainment. Let's go, guys. RILEY:Â Fewer and fewer people will go to the movies and it will have nothing to do with hackers threatening to blow up theaters. That's my prediction. The future's home entertainment systems, streaming systems like Amazon.com and Netflix, and I think Hollywood needs to change its distribution model. PAGE:Â I was bold on sports and I will be bold on entertainment and say a Kardashian will post something outrageous on the Internet. WALLACE:Â You really think that's a prediction? That's like saying the sun is going to come up in the east. PAGE:Â I bet it turns out to be true. HAYES:Â Some Hollywood starlet or movie star will overdose this year, and that will be tragic. That's not. I was just trying to be as bold as Susan. WALLACE:Â That's really a buzz kill right here. HAYES:Â My real prediction, the new ""Star Wars"" movie will break all sorts of box office records and it will happen regardless of whether the movie is good or bad. WALLACE:Â And what's your prediction, will it be good or bad? HAYES:Â I think the ""Star Wars"" junkies won't like it, and the rest of the movie consuming public will. WALLACE:Â Are you a ""Star Wars"" junkie? WALLACE:Â Have you seen any of them? WALLACE:Â OK. There have been six. HAYES:Â My kids are ready to get into ""Star Wars."" WALLACE:Â And with 30 seconds left, Bob, your prediction. WOODWARD:Â Something that happened this year, the hack on - are you going to show me my list -- on Sony, is that is a giant problem. Steve knows, you talk to people in the intelligence world, there's no privacy. I think next year is going to be the year of the hack, and there will be many, many more. WALLACE:Â And interestingly enough, Hollywood already engaging in some self-censorship. They've already killed another North Korea movie or a movie about North Korea. Thank you, panel. We're going to keep this tape in a safe place and see how you all did with your predictions. There's a threat, not a promise. We'll be right back with a rare interview with Laura Hillenbrand, the writer who brought us the true-life stories of ""Unbroken"" and ""Seabiscuit,"" while battling her own serious illness. WALLACE:Â The movie ""Unbroken"" opened Christmas day. It's the story of World War II hero Louis Zamperini, who survived 47 days on a raft, and then two years in a Japanese prison camp, but who never gave up. The woman who introduced most of us to Louis in a best-selling book has faced her own heroic struggle. James Rosen tells her story. LAURA HILLENBRAND, AUTHOR, ""UNBROKEN"":Â I think Louis has become an inspiration for a generation of people. He is a man who survived the seemingly unsurvivable. JAMES ROSEN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:Â Laura Hillenbrand is the author of the best-selling true life stories, ""Seabiscuit"" and ""Unbroken."" HILLENBRAND:Â And I think all of us can look at his life, can look at the things he got through, and then look back at our own troubles and think, you know, if he got through that, why can't I get through this? ROSEN:Â But Hillenbrand has her own amazing story of courage and resilience. HILLENBRAND:Â It used to be called chronic fatigue syndrome. It is a disease that is characterized by profound exhaustion, and a lot of other symptoms, difficulty concentrating, trouble with balance, trouble with most of the systems of the body. ROSEN:Â Such an affliction would prevent many people from even attempting the arduous task of writing a book. But Hillenbrand's condition, if anything, strengthened her bond with her subject, Zamperini. HILLENBRAND:Â Somebody gave him a copy of an article I wrote for ""The New Yorker"" called ""The Sudden Illness,"" which was about my journey through illness, and he realized upon reading that, I think, that I understood what it was like to suffer profoundly. One day I got a little package from him in the mail. I didn't know it was coming. I opened it up. It was his Purple Heart, and he had written next to it, ""after reading your story, A Sudden Illness, I think you deserve this more than I do."" ROSEN:Â Zamperini was moved after discovering how debilitating the disease can be. HILLENBRAND:Â There was a period of time actually while I was working on ""Unbroken"" when I didn't leave my house for two years, because I was simply too weak to walk to the car. It's that serious. ROSEN:Â So serious that she could scarcely make it out of bed and had to conduct her 75 interviews with Zamperini by telephone. In fact, author and subject never met until after ""Unbroken"" became a runaway bestseller. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:Â Let it just sink in. ROSEN:Â -- opened this Christmas weekend. Sadly, Louis Zamperini passed away in July at the age of 97. Zamperini is gone, but Hillenbrand has ensured that his legacy of perseverance through adversity will endure. HILLENBRAND:Â People read his story. People listen to him speak. And they feel the breath of inspiration coming into them. They feel like they can get through their troubles. ROSEN:Â It's a lesson of a spirit unbroken embedded in Laura Hillenbrand's own story as well. Chris? Finally, we want to thank you for watching us each week throughout this busy news year. As we say good-bye to 2014 and look ahead to 2015, here are the names of all the people who work so hard every week to put this program on the air.

In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the Board may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. Except as in this article otherwise provided, the Board may provide, by resolution or by such trust indenture, that after the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds and the revenues of the project or projects into the state treasury the Board will immediately transfer or pay same over to such officer, board or depository as it may determine for the custody thereof and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repairs of the project or projects affected by such indenture.2.

I'm Christiane Amanpour. And at the top of the news this week, the Gang of 20. At the big summit in Seoul, U.S. economic policies come under fire from China and Germany. Are America's woes putting its global leadership in question?OBAMA: A whole host of other countries are doing very well. Naturally, they are going to be more assertive.AMANPOUR: Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham debate America's role in the world.Then, American austerity.BOWLES: The path we're on today is not sustainable. We are headed for disaster.AMANPOUR: Two members of the president's deficit commission, Democratic Senator Kent Conrad and Honeywell International Chairman and CEO David Cote share some sobering views on tough economic choices the United States faces.And the coming showdown over tax cuts.BOEHNER: Making these permanent will be the most important thing we could do to help create jobs in the country.AMANPOUR: That and all the week's politics on our roundtable with George Will, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post, and Robert Kagan of the Brookings Institution.And the Sunday funnies.FALLON: China is expected to overtake the U.S. as the world's biggest economy in the next two years. Americans couldn't believe it. They were like, ""That hasn't happened already?""(LAUGHTER)ANNOUNCER: From all across our world to the heart of our nation's capital, ABC ""This Week"" with Christiane Amanpour starts now.(END VIDEO CLIP)AMANPOUR: And hello again.By the time Air Force One lands in Washington this evening, it will have flown around the world, a world that is fast changing, as the president found out during his 10-day trip to Asia. ABC's senior White House correspondent Jake Tapper has been with the president and brings us this report.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)TAPPER (voice-over): Rebuked by American voters and reminded to focus more on the economy, President Obama began his Asian trip talking it up as a sort of international stimulus to open markets to American goods and bolster American jobs.OBAMA: We're actually doing some business while we're here. With every $1 billion we sell in exports, 5,000 jobs are supported at home. For America, this is a job strategy.TAPPER: In Mumbai, India, flanked by American CEOs, the president announced deals between U.S. and Indian companies totaling nearly $10 billion in U.S. exports and maintaining more than 50,000 American jobs.A cause for celebration, as he and the first lady joined in on the festivities marking the Hindu holiday of Diwali.(on-screen): By the end of the week here in South Korea, there was no cause for dancing. Some of the world's fastest-growing economies refused President Obama's entreaties to alter their economic policies, policies the president needs changed to fully implement his export strategy, his job strategy.OBAMA: Instead of hitting home runs, sometimes we're going to hit singles.TAPPER (voice-over): And sometimes he struck out, failing to convince South Korea to open their markets to American beef and cars. At stake: $10 billion in exports and 70,000 American jobs.Failing to convince Chinese President Hu Jintao to stop artificially building up the dollar and holding down Chinese currency.And failing to convince his fellow G-20 leaders to use stronger language in the joint declaration on China's currency manipulation.OBAMA: That is an irritant not just to the United States, but is an irritant to a lot of China's trading partners and those who are competing with China to sell goods around the world.TAPPER: The president was even forced to push back on attacks that the U.S. was engaging in its own currency manipulation, defending a move by the independent Federal Reserve to inject $600 billion into the U.S. economy.OBAMA: From everything I can see, this decision was not one designed to have an impact on the currency, on the dollar. It was designed to grow the economy.TAPPER: Criticisms from G-20 leaders who questioned President Obama's spending habits were made all the more relevant when the co-chairs of the president's own debt commission put forth controversial proposals to reduce the deficit.BOWLES: This debt is like a cancer that will truly destroy this country from within.TAPPER: Ones attacked by liberals and conservative, showing how difficult reducing the deficit will be. Modesty was forced upon the president in this trip full of complications.For ""This Week,"" Jake Tapper, ABC News, traveling with the president.(END VIDEOTAPE)AMANPOUR: And to discuss all of this, we're joined now by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. He's just come back from a trip to Iraq and Afghanistan.Thank you both for joining us. And let me ask you first, Secretary Albright, because you have been to many of these summits, isn't it extraordinary that the president, that U.S. leadership is being questioned so openly, not just by China, but by Germany, who called the Fed's action, for instance, ""clueless""?ALBRIGHT: Actually not. I mean, I think -- I've been to lots of meetings, and they are discussions. And I think the thing that people have to remember is that the G-20 was not set up to solve the world's economic problems. It was, it fact, set up as a way to bring the developing countries in to show what the various disagreements can be and to come to various consensus agreements.And it takes a while. I think as the president said, it's an incremental thing.And I don't know. Christiane, I was asked by the Obama administration during the transition to meet with the G-20 when they were here, and I met with everybody individually, and you could see the fact that they all have their own interests. And it is a matter of listening to the various ideas. I think that it is a process, and I think it's very clear that America continues to be central to the process.AMANPOUR: Let me ask Senator Graham. Certainly China and Germany, as you heard, did question America's global leadership. Do you think that is, if not actually, at least symbolically and psychologically damaging for the United States?GRAHAM: Well, I don't want to overreact here. The currency issue was disappointing to me. Clearly, China does manipulate the value of the yuan to get an advantage in exports. They already have enough advantages. I was disappointed with the other nations who would not get behind President Obama to push the Chinese to change their currency policy.But, yeah, you know, at the end of the day, we're getting criticism. Does that mean we're losing influence? Not necessarily so.But on the currency front and trade front, this was a disappointing meetings. We need a trade agreement with Korea. We need to fight back against China currency manipulation. And I think you're going to see the Congress get more involved on the currency front after this trip.AMANPOUR: Well, certainly the U.S. also being accused of trying to push down and weaken its own currency. You know, you say that this is perhaps just a sort of temporary statement by these countries, but doesn't -- doesn't America have to get its economic house in order, in order to be able to lead on a whole number of other issues, Senator?GRAHAM: Yes, I think Secretary Clinton -- I think Secretary Clinton got it right that our looming deficit is a national security problem for us, and the only way you can get America's financial house in order is do a bipartisan agreement on entitlement reform.Earmark's important. That's just on the margins. But if you really want to get America back in business, we've got to come to grips with Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, and find bipartisan agreements to reform entitlements before it's too late.We're an aging population. A lot of baby boomers are going to retire. We've got fewer workers, and we need to do that sooner rather than later.AMANPOUR: Well, we're going to discuss this later on, but do you think there will be compromise?GRAHAM: There must be. Look what happened with health care when you tried to jam it through on a party-line vote. We need to get Social Security stabilized before it goes into permanent bankruptcy. We're going to have to increase the age. We're going to have to manipulate benefits for upper-income Americans. We've got to put everything on the table, including stable revenues. And I'd like to see this commission help lead the Congress to get some results that have been kicked down the road for far too long.AMANPOUR: OK. Let me bring up now some of the key foreign policy issues that go to the heart of American prestige and for the president's prestige, the START Treaty, the New START Treaty. Do you think that it will be ratified coming in this lame-duck session?ALBRIGHT: I think it's very important that it be ratified. The president has said it's a priority issue during the lame-duck session. He just finished a meeting with President Medvedev when they were in Japan, and the president restated that it was a priority issue.And the reason it is, is that it's -- first of all, it's a good treaty. But part of the problem is we remember President Reagan said trust, but verify. And what has happened is that the verification procedures have now not been in place for almost a year, so we need that treaty for that.Plus, I think that we really do -- the relationship with the Russians is very important. They've been very helpful on Iran. And I think -- I hope very, very much that the lame-duck session recognizes the importance of the treaty.AMANPOUR: And, Senator Graham, Senator Kerry has already said that he believes it can happen in December. President Obama said it must happen in the lame-duck session. Do you believe that it will be voted on and ratified in the lame-duck session?GRAHAM: I don't know. I'm very open-minded about the treaty. As Secretary Albright indicated, it's an important relationship between the United States and Russia. I think Russia could do more, but they have been more helpful.You've got two impediments. Modernization. Not only do we need a START Treaty; we need to modernize our nuclear force, the weapons that are left, to make sure they continue to be a deterrent. And we need to make sure that we can employ -- deploy missile defense systems that are apart from START.So you've got two stumbling blocks, the modernization program and how missile defense works apart from the treaty.AMANPOUR: Will you vote for it?GRAHAM: Jon Kyl is -- in its current condition, no, but Jon Kyl is working with the administration to get better modernization to make sure that missile defense is not connected to START. If you could get those two things together, I would vote for the treaty.I'd rather have a treaty than not have a treaty, but modernization and missile defense have to be better dealt with before we get there.AMANPOUR: Let me ask you about some news today. You've just come back from Afghanistan and Iraq with a congressional delegation. And there's a story in the Washington Post about how President Karzai seems to be at odds fundamentally with U.S. policy there. Did that come up at all in your conversations with him?GRAHAM: You know, Christiane, I'm just stunned. We had a great meeting. We had dinner with Senator McCain, Lieberman, myself, Petraeus, Ambassador Eikenberry with President Karzai. The focus of the article is the night raids.We were briefed by our military commanders that the night raids are -- we own the night (ph) militarily, are making huge impact on the Taliban, the insurgency as a whole, and we're having Afghan partners. This didn't come up at all.We talked about, quite frankly, looking long term with Afghanistan about having two air bases in a permanent fashion in Afghanistan to provide stability, so at the end of the day, there was no discussion about a difference between Petraeus and Karzai, in terms of strategy.And I would just add this: If we cannot use night raids with our Afghan partners, then that's a big loss in terms of gaining security.The Petraeus plan, the Petraeus strategy must be allowed to go forward for us to be successful. The security gains are -- are obvious. We're not there yet, but we're moving in the right direction, and to take the night raids off the table would be a disaster.AMANPOUR: Well, let me ask you quickly and briefly on this issue of Afghanistan, also. Was President Karzai -- or, rather, do you believe that the U.S. troops will stay in significant numbers post the summer 2011 deadline?GRAHAM: Yes, I do. I think in summer of 2011, we can bring some troops home, but we're going to need a substantial number of troops in Afghanistan past that.2014 is the right date to talk about. That's when Karzai suggests that Afghans will be in the lead, and I'm very pleased to hear President Obama talk about 2014.What I want to talk about is winning, having the ability to stabilize Afghanistan and be a good partner with the United States forever. That means we're going to need military force for quite a while. Post-2014, when the Afghans hopefully get in the lead, it will be great to have a couple of air bases there in perpetuity to help the Afghans to send the right signal to the regions, but none of this is possible unless you have a reliable partner in the Afghan government, so they need to do more quickly on corruption.AMANPOUR: Do you think, Secretary Albright, that the president is going to move beyond this deadline? I know it's always condition-based, but the acceptance now is it is going to be significant troops for much longer than next summer.ALBRIGHT: Well, they are definitely doing a review, as we -- they've begun it as we speak, and they are going to do a review again, a larger one in December.I think that the president has said that we're not just going to abandon, that we're in a transition strategy, not an exit strategy, and that it's going to be very important for there to be training of the Afghan police forces and the military forces.And part of the issue, in reading what President Karzai said, is that he keeps saying he wants to take over, but part of the business here is they have to be trained properly and the NATO -- there's going to be a NATO summit, and one of the things they're going to be talking about is how to do this transition policy. And President Obama and Secretary Gates and Secretary Clinton have said that this is going to be conditions-based.AMANPOUR: Let me ask you a broader question, Secretary Albright, on American engagement. Now that you've got the Republicans in control of Congress, you've got the Tea Party influence, do you think America will keep engaging and keep its leadership roles in so many of these areas? Or will there be a period of turning inwards, whether it's protectionism or in any other foreign policy?ALBRIGHT: Well, I certainly hope not. And President Obama spoke about the problem of protectionism and the fact that we do have to be engaged internationally.Every single problem that we are looking at -- whether it's fighting terrorism or dealing with a broken nuclear nonproliferation system or the climate change and energy issues or the gap between the rich and the poor -- requires American leadership, but it also requires being engaged in partners.And so I hope very much -- we don't know what the Tea Party's foreign policy is. And I think that Senator Graham has stated very clearly what the role of the Republicans is in looking at it.AMANPOUR: Do you think -- because you've been quoted, Senator Graham, just recently -- that there are two wings now of the Republican Party when it comes to foreign policy, that you will look inwards or outwards. And I also want to ask you about your trip to Iraq.GRAHAM: Well, let me tell you, I think -- I'm in the wing that wants to look outward and have effective engagements throughout the world, so that's why I'm glad to see that President Obama is backing off this idea we're going to leave in 2011 and talk about 2014 and make everything conditions-based.You know, I worry that we're going to fumble the ball in Iraq. President -- Mr. Allawi, the biggest vote-getter in the recent elections, who is a Shia who married up with Sunnis to give a different vision for -- for Iraq, has said that this the new government is a joke. If he feels that, that's disappointing.It's very important we get a government formed in Iraq that's inclusive, that represents the results of the Iraqi election, and that is a reliable partner with the United States and the region.So I've got concerns about this new government. But we need to stay involved -- effectively involved. And I'm in the camp of the Republican Party that wants to work with President Obama to end it well in Iraq, to get it right in Afghanistan, contain Iran through effective sanctions.And to my friends in the Republican Party who want to withdraw, you do so at your own peril, but the administration has to do their part. They're not being as effective as I think they can be in Iraq and Afghanistan. And when it comes to Iran, our sanctions efforts are not working as well as I would like, so I'd ask them to step up their game, as well.AMANPOUR: And, Secretary Albright, do you think Iraq is -- I mean, you just heard Senator Graham saying he's worried that it's not inclusive and it's not reliable, this -- this new government.ALBRIGHT: Well, it's a work in progress. I mean, there's no question about that. And every day brings a somewhat different story.I -- I do think that the American government is very involved. Vice President Biden has been talking to them, as have our ambassadors, in a variety of places, so I do think that it is a difficult process. We do need Iraq...AMANPOUR: The Sunnis just walked out.ALBRIGHT: Well, no, they came back.AMANPOUR: Right, but...ALBRIGHT: But I think that we are going to be watching this, but they understand that we will be there, and I agree that we need to make sure that the place works.I think that the administration is committed to that, and it is committed, also, to making Afghanistan work. I think the issue is -- as Senator Graham said, winning, I don't know what that means at the moment, but I do think that we need to have stability in both those countries, and I see the administration as looking outward. We are the strongest country in the world, and we do need partners, and that is what diplomacy's about.AMANPOUR: Discussion to be continued. Secretary Albright, thank you very much for joining us.And, Senator Graham, thank you very much, indeed, for joining us this morning.AMANPOUR: And as we've heard, America's growing debt is having an impact on the international stage. The draft recommendations released by the co-chairs of the president's deficit commission add up to nearly $4 trillion in deficit reduction through 2020.But the proposed spending cuts -- Social Security and Medicare cuts -- and tax increases are getting a chilly reception from Democrats and Republicans, a sure sign of the difficult task ahead, while deep spending cuts in Europe are bringing people to the streets in protest.Two members of the commission appointed by President Obama are with us this morning: David Cote, chairman and CEO of Honeywell and Democratic Senator Kent Conrad.Thank you both for coming. Welcome to both of you. You were just on President Obama's trip abroad. How does this deficit and the big troubles and problems ahead with this play in trying to gin up business abroad, jobs?COTE: Well, I think everything ends up being interconnected. You certainly, in my view, want increased trade. Trade, I'm -- you might expect I believe is a good thing, and it benefits both sides, and you want to have countries arguing about commercial issues, not geographic issues. I think it makes a lot of sense.AMANPOUR: You know, Americans are worried that their jobs are going overseas. You've said that it can't be seen as a zero-sum game.COTE: Well, that's one of my issues. And, quite honestly, I think the media helps to perpetuate this, is that economics is viewed as a zero-sum game, my loss is your gain, my gain is your loss.And the only reason you do things economically is because both sides win. When you go to the store and you buy something, the store's happy, you're happy. You both benefit. And that seems to get lost when we start talking about economics on a grander scale.AMANPOUR: Senator Conrad, there has been so much talk now about the recommendations by the co-chairs of the -- of the -- of the deficit commission, the fiscal commission. Is there any area you think that there's going to be any compromise on this? I mean, they're attacking and talking about really sacrosanct parts of the American political sphere here.CONRAD: You know, a certain amount of this is shock therapy. You know, there are different options. And, of course, what everybody has fashioned -- fastened on are the most extreme of the options.But, look, the important thing for people to know is we are borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend. That's utterly unsustainable; it can't continue much longer, so it's got to be dealt with.If you look at our spending, it's the highest it's been as a share of our economy in 60 years, revenue is the lowest it's been as a share of our economy in 60 years, so we're going to have to work both sides of the equation.It's critically important we do or we will become a second-rate economic power. That is the hard reality.AMANPOUR: But in terms of things like mortgage interest and all those things that the panel is recommending, these are things that Americans have really relied on forever, just about, and so many of them. Is that even a starter?CONRAD: Well, there is -- as I referenced earlier, there is one proposal that eliminates all the tax preferences, all the tax deductions, all the tax exclusions, and uses 90 percent of the revenue to reduce rates, only 10 percent to reduce the deficit. I don't favor that approach.I think we need something that represents a continuation of the mortgage deduction, although reformed, to apply only to primary residences, for example, but we need to continue the child credit, we need to continue the earned income tax credit.But fundamentally, if we're going to raise revenue, I don't think the way to do it is to raise rates. I think the way to do it is to eliminate some of the loopholes that exist in the system. We have a tax system now that is just loaded -- chockablock full of preferences, loopholes. We're allowing $100 billion a year to be lost to offshore tax havens, another $50 billion to abuse of tax shelters. That can't be allowed to continue.AMANPOUR: And on another -- well, on the same issue, but Paul Krugman, the economist, Nobel Prize-winner, who's going to be on our roundtable, has written this week that it really is basically tax breaks again for the rich and more onus on the -- on the middle class dressed up as something new.COTE: Well, in my view, democracy seems to be uniquely suited to putting a traffic light up after the fourth accident. Now, we can't wait for the fourth accident here.And that's why I applaud Senator Conrad, for Senator Graham, when -- his comments, trying to get out in front of something, because it's too easy for the demagogues and the polemicists to respond to something, just kind of go into their neutral corner and screaming, as opposed to saying there's a time to pull together.This is one of those times. There are times when we should pull apart and pluralism and all that good stuff where people argue their point of view, but there are times when we have to pull together, and this is one of those times.And it scares me that as a financially conversant CEO, I didn't know how bad this was going to get in the next 10 years. I could see where it was today, but I couldn't see what was going to happen in the next 10 years, because people want to point to stuff like Obamacare, stimulus, Bush tax cuts. And the thing that everybody misses is it's my generation, the baby boomers, who are going to flow through Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. It's going to crush the system.And I think the American public is ready for this discussion, but I don't see anybody having that discussion with them, and that needs to happen.AMANPOUR: Well, are the Democrats going to allow these cuts that have been suggested in Social Security, Medicare?CONRAD: Well, I'm a Democrat...AMANPOUR: Well?CONRAD: ... and I'm saying to my colleagues...AMANPOUR: And the liberal wing of the party?CONRAD: ... it is absolutely imperative that we take this on for the country's sake. And are we going to have to make some changes to Social Security? Certainly we are. Social Security is going to go cash negative in five years. It's going to go broke in 2037.Medicare, we've just extended the life of it by the health care reform package, which has gotten almost no attention, but still it's prepared to go permanently cash negative in just 10 years. So, obviously, those things have to be reformed; there have to be some changes.AMANPOUR: Let me talk about the international implications of the currency wars that we were just talking about that came up during the Seoul trip. Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Fed, has said that America's pursuing a policy of weakening its currency, and this is what the current treasury secretary, Tim Geithner, said in response to that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GEITHNER: I have enormous respect for Alan Greenspan, of course, had the privilege of working with him for a long period of years, but that's not an accurate description of either the Federal Reserve's policies or our policy. We will never seek to weaken our currency as a tool to gaining competitive advantage or to grow our economy. It's not an effective strategy for any country, certainly not for the United States.(END VIDEO CLIP)AMANPOUR: I mean, how do you assess, first, what the QE2 is, which is what he's talking about, quantitative easing? And isn't that viewed as -- certainly overseas -- as an attempt to weaken the currency, just as they're accusing China of doing?COTE: Well, I would say managing currency is beyond my pay grade, so I don't normally get into that one. But I would say, in my view...AMANPOUR: But the affects thereof in business is your pay grade.COTE: But I would say -- well, I was one of the guys -- I've been in favor of everything. So when they were talking about stimulus, home modification, the Federal Reserve is doing what they needed to, I don't think the country realized how close we were to a depression.And I've said to the senator several times: I don't think any politician ever gets credit for the problem they avoid. They get a lot of credit if they're in the middle of the crisis and start screaming and yelling, but avoiding a problem doesn't get a lot of merit. This deficit is one of those situations.AMANPOUR: Were you -- were you shocked that -- that the president could not close a trade deal with Seoul, a major ally? The United States has propped up South Korea, troops there. I mean, how is this possible?CONRAD: No, I'm not at all shocked. In fact, I think the president -- what he did is a show of strength, rather than weakness.AMANPOUR: How?CONRAD: Because he refused to take a bad deal. Look, I've been deeply involved with negotiating with our Korean friends, and they have used every stratagem to avoid previous commitments they have made. And the president called them on it and said, look, you said you would open our market, your market, and you've got an obligation to do it, and I'm not going to accept just any deal in order to have a deal.Thank goodness we've got a president now who is standing up, even to some of our allies, and saying we're insisting on fair treatment.AMANPOUR: And what did you think when some of our allies called American policy clueless, economic policy?CONRAD: Well, this was separate...AMANPOUR: That doesn't show a huge amount of respect.CONRAD: Yeah, this was separate from...AMANPOUR: Right.CONRAD: ... separate from the Korean deal. This -- this involved the question of what the Federal Reserve was doing, which is not the president.AMANPOUR: RightCONRAD: This is the Federal Reserve policy to inject liquidity into the economy, given the fact 1 in every 6 people in this country is either underemployed or unemployed, so certainly additional steps need to be taken. I think it's very clear on the fiscal side we've about run the course. There's not going to be another stimulus package.So if there's going to be more liquidity, it's going to have to come on the monetary side from the Federal Reserve. And to say that they're clueless, I think, frankly, demeans those who make the charge.Look, we have -- I would be quick to remind them -- we have saved their bacon over and over and over all across Europe. They need to remember who's been there for them when they needed help.AMANPOUR: On that note, Senator, Mr. Cote, thank you very much, indeed, for joining us.And coming up next, analysis on our roundtable, with George Will, Paul Krugman of the New York Times, Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post, and foreign policy analyst Robert Kagan of the Brookings Institution.Thank you very much.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BUSH: And it's too bad they call them the Bush tax cuts. They might have a better chance of being extended if they were the Lauer tax cuts.BOEHNER: I think extending all of the current tax rates and making them permanent will reduce the uncertainty in America.OBAMA: I continue to believe that extending permanently the upper-income tax cuts would be a mistake and that we can't afford it.(END VIDEO CLIP)AMANPOUR: The back-and-forth on whether to extend the Bush tax cuts, one of the topics for our roundtable with George Will, Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman of the New York Times, Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus, and Robert Kagan, foreign policy analyst and author from the Brookings Institution.Thank you all for joining us. Thank you for being here.The deficit commission, we had two members just -- just -- just earlier. You've written very, very strongly about a lot of the proposals, among other things, saying this proposal clearly represents a major transfer of income upward from the middle class to a small minority of wealthy Americans.KRUGMAN: Yes. I think the most important thing to understand is that the commission did not do its job. It has a bunch of ideas for reducing the deficit, some good, some really bad, some of them not ideas about reducing the deficit at all.But, you know, anybody, it's easy to come up with ideas. I can come up with ideas for reducing the deficit while padding my tummy and rubbing my head, you know?AMANPOUR: What should they have done?KRUGMAN: What they -- what they were supposed to do was produce something that was good enough to have an up-and-down vote, something that a lot of people could sign on to, and they did not do that.In particular, now, leaving aside the distributional stuff -- which is awful -- the core of the deficit problem, everybody who's serious knows the core is health care costs, and you have to reduce health care costs, not reduce them, but reduce the rate of growth. The way you have to do that is by deciding what you're going to be willing to pay for.They completely wimped out on that. They simply assumed they were going to reduce the rate of health care cost growth. And they said, how are we going to do that? By monitoring and taking additional measures as necessary.So the report was completely empty on the only thing that really matters and then had a whole bunch of things which involved large tax cuts for the top bracket. What on Earth is that doing in there?AMANPOUR: What on Earth, George?WILL: Well, Paul is speaking about the commission in the past tense, as though it has just reported. If fact, 2 of 18 members have now given their ideas; the other 16 have yet to be heard from.The most interesting thing they did propose, interesting, A, because it's somewhat radical and, B, because it's opaque as to what it means is a 21 percent limit on revenues, not on spending, but on revenues. And I don't know what a cap means.One Congress can't bind the other, and I don't know how institutionally how that would work, but certainly raising the early retirement age to 64 is overdue. Raising the retirement age under Social Security to 69 by 2075 is dilatory, should be done next Thursday.AMANPOUR: A goer at all? I mean, certainly, the liberals are screaming bloody murder over this.MARCUS: Actually, both sides are screaming bloody murder. And like most people screaming bloody murder, I think they're behaving incredibly childishly...AMANPOUR: Well, you've told the president to be professorial about this, didn't you?MARCUS: Professorial and the grown-up...AMANPOUR: Written about it, anyway.MARCUS: ... and the grown-up in the room. I agree with what Senator Conrad said. The non-report, the recommendations from the co-chairs were a useful dose of shock therapy just to educate people about the incredible gulf that we have between the government that any reasonable person wants.You could have a discussion about what size it should be and the revenue that we have to fund it going forward, and you need to understand the scope of the problem before you can agree on solutions.Right now, 75 percent of people believe you could balance the budget without touching Medicare or Social Security; 75 percent of people believe that you can balance the budget without raising taxes. Well, you could, but it would be extraordinarily painful.People need to get a little bit of reality therapy. There's going to be another dose coming on Wednesday when another group is going to submit their recommendations, very concrete recommendations about how to do it. That's the conversation we need to have before we start picking apart solutions.KRUGMAN: If they were going to do reality therapy, they should have said, OK, look, Medicare is going to have to decide what it's going to pay for. And at least for starters, it's going to have to decide which medical procedures are not effective at all and should not be paid for at all. In other words, it should have endorsed the panel that was part of the health care reform.If it's not even -- if the commission isn't even brave enough to take on the death panels people, then it's doing no good at all. It's not educating the public. It's not telling people about the kinds of choices that need to be made.MARCUS: But they did talk about -- just -- just as a fact, they did talk about strengthening that commission, the famous IPAB...KRUGMAN: Yes.MARCUS: ... and giving it more power to go after more aspects of the health care system, which -- because it's now rather constrained.KRUGMAN: They made no headlines with that. And some friends of mine are calling this the commission -- the commission to put caps on lots of stuff. It's a lot of numerical caps without any explanation of how they're going to happen.AMANPOUR: What about the tax fight which is going to come up? I mean, does that even register with -- in terms of -- in terms of the Brookings Institution, in terms of what you're looking at?KAGAN: It certainly registers with one-half of the Brookings Institution. It doesn't happen to be the half that I'm in, but, I mean, I think that clearly the whole bundle of issues are going to have to be dealt with together, including, by the way, issues like the national security budget and defense budget, which I think a lot of people think, oh, there's a good pot of money we can go into, but if you look at the foreign policy of this administration, I don't see where they're going to be able to find those kinds of savings.AMANPOUR: Well, we had Rand Paul on last week and he said, for instance, he is willing to talk about cuts in military spending. He thought that that was one area where perhaps a wing of Republicans could start talking about in return for a wing of Democrats who could talk about real cuts in Social Security and Medicare.(CROSSTALK)WILL: ... Secretary Gates is talking about that.AMANPOUR: Precisely.WILL: Secretary Gates doesn't want to buy any more C-17s. He wants to put a lid on F-22. There are lots of ways of...(CROSSTALK)KRUGMAN: Can I just get into magnitudes here, though? The cost of permanently extending just the upper-end Bush tax cuts, as opposed to only extending the middle-class tax cuts, the 75-year cost of that is just about identical to the 75-year accounting shortfall in Social Security. So we've got people who are saying, oh, Social Security, got to do something about it, but let's extend those tax cuts for rich people. This is showing how the priorities are all skewed (ph).AMANPOUR: But what is going to happen? I mean, are you clear on where a compromise is going to be? It's got to be discussed before the end of the year, no?KRUGMAN: No. Some years down the pike, we're going to get the real solution, which is going to be a combination of death panels and sales taxes. It's going to be that we're actually going to take Medicare under control, and we're going to have to get some additional revenue, probably from a VAT. But it's not going to happen now.(CROSSTALK)AMANPOUR: ... on the tax thing, for the Bush -- yes, the specific...MARCUS: I think we know where this is coming out. It's not where it should come out, but I think because everybody agrees that we're going to extend the tax cuts for 98 percent of the people, and because the president doesn't have the votes to not extend the rest, what we're going to do is have some kind of extension for a few years, perhaps, and Senator Warner from Virginia has suggested this. Perhaps we could tweak those cuts to actually make them more attractive to business, more stimulative, more intelligent.This is not my preference. I think that the conversation right now is deranged. We have in one room the deficit commission folks saying, ""Look at this huge hole. Look at the tax increases and serious spending cuts that we need to do to fill it."" And then outside the room, we're having a debate about whether we should add $4 trillion to the deficit long term or a mere $3.3 trillion. This is crazy.WILL: All the tax cuts are going to be extended. They will not be decoupled. We'll have this argument two, maybe three years from now.Notice what Paul referred to, the value-added tax. Some while ago, it was thought that this was kind of big bomb that the deficit commission would come in with, an entire new source of revenues. They did not notice that last April the Senate voted 83-13 on a resolution condemning the value-added tax. It will not happen.AMANPOUR: Let's take it overseas. I mean, there is obviously in Britain a value-added tax. There's this debate going on right now in England, in France, Ireland, all over the place, and they're doing serious austerity. And people are asking, can their economies handle that?What do you think is going to be the picture in -- in Britain over the next few years?KAGAN: Well, it's going to be some very extreme austerity...AMANPOUR: People are already on the streets.KAGAN: Right. I mean, we'll see how -- I think that probably Cameron has enough of a -- of a -- of a majority in parliament to hang on, if he's tough. I mean, Sarkozy is fighting this battle right now in France. I think that they can probably hang on.But there is a price to be paid. And, again, sorry to return to world affairs. I mean, Britain has taken itself out as a major player in the international system, at least for a while, with the kind of cuts that they've made in their national security budget.The problem is, the United States doesn't have the luxury of doing that. I mean, Britain can become a free-rider in the international system, but that is the price that they've paid.AMANPOUR: And does this -- do these recommendations from the commission, do they amount to any kind of austerity?KRUGMAN: Oh, no. It's very, very different. Yes, it's austerity long run, although they're very vague about what form that takes. Again, it's caps without real explanation of how they're going to happen.But there's a huge difference. There's two kinds of austerity. There's doing things to bring down your long-run costs, which is what Sarkozy is doing in France -- he's trying to change their retirement age -- and slashing right now, when you're in the middle of a deeply depressed economy, which is what Cameron is doing.The first I'm all in favor of, if you do it right. The second is basically crazy, but that's...(CROSSTALK)AMANPOUR: So where do you see the British economy going?KRUGMAN: And we're going to have -- we're going to have Cameron-type austerity in this country, not as a deliberate policy, but because the state and local governments are going to be slashing their spending. There's going to be no further aid coming from -- from Washington.And so, if you look at the global government budget -- global in the sense of all levels of government in the United States -- we're heading -- we're in Herbert Hoover territory in the United States for sure.AMANPOUR: I just want to switch a little bit to -- to what you heard Senator Lindsey Graham saying about Iraq and Afghanistan. Iraq, he's not happy at all with the -- with the current government and doesn't think the U.S. administration has done a good job. What do you think about that?WILL: I don't think it's the administration's job to pick Iraq's government, which it's powerless to do. Look, every four years, we flood this little state of New Hampshire with politicians, journalists, poll-takers, political scientists, candidates, consultants, and at the end of the day, we're surprised by what they do in New Hampshire. Why should we be surprised that we're surprised at what the Iraqis are doing?KAGAN: Well, we don't have -- we don't have, you know, almost 100,000 troops or 50,000 in this case, 50,000 troops in New Hampshire, which might have a greater impact on what voters did. And the truth is, we have been an occupying power in Iraq. We can't pretend that we're not.It matters greatly to us what kind of government Iraq has. And I really think the administration -- especially during Chris Hill's ambassadorship -- just took a hands-off attitude. It matters. And it matters before there has to be a feeling among all the different ethic sectarian groups in Iraq that they have some purchase in this government. And right now it feels to them like a Shia government, which is not necessarily...AMANPOUR: Well, talk about the hands-off, because, obviously, during General Petraeus and Ryan Crocker, when he was the ambassador, there was a real hands-on, a real sense of guiding and shaping. Which is better?KAGAN: Well, when you're the occupying force, you have to have some guiding and shaping. I mean, when we finally leave Iraq, we'll have to leave it to whatever -- you know, the tender mercies of its own political system, which will be -- have its own dysfunctionalities. That's fine.But right now, we're looking to pull out. We need to have a government that is capable of satisfying these needs so we don't see the return of Al Qaida in force or you don't see the return of terrorism, which -- which is going to make it harder for us to leave.AMANPOUR: In Afghanistan, they're trying to do the same thing in Afghanistan, and you've just seen the Washington Post article saying that Karzai does not like the night raids. You heard what Lindsey Graham is saying, that's very disappointing, it's that -- that's the backbone of their strategy right now, and that he heard nothing about that from Karzai.Where is Karzai's head right now, do you think, on this?KAGAN: Well, I'm not sure I know where Karzai's head is, but I do think we have to recognize he's in a difficult position. I don't -- by the way, I'm not totally sympathetic to him, but I am a little bit sympathetic.He's the head of a country that's an occupied country that's at war where there are civilian casualties, and -- and he's a politician. And so as a politician, he's reacting to this. But do I think that he wants the United States to pull out of Afghanistan? No. Does he have to say things which look like he's unhappy about some of the things we're doing? Yes.AMANPOUR: So I want to put up this latest commercial about ""don't ask/don't tell."" I want to show you what Cindy McCain has been saying, talking about war policy and the military.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PINSKY: LGBT teens are six to nine times more likely to attempt suicide than their straight peers.C. MCCAIN: Our political and religious leaders tell LGBT youth that they have no future.NAVARRO: They can't get married.C. MCCAIN: They can't serve our country openly.BERGERON: What's worse, these laws that legislate discrimination...PROBST: ... teach bullies that what they're doing is acceptable.C. MCCAIN: Our government treats the LGBT community like second-class citizens. Why shouldn't they?(END VIDEO CLIP)AMANPOUR: Well, that's one issue of the gay situation right now, but particularly gays in the military. Do you think in a lame-duck session that they're going to vote on this, on ""don't ask/don't tell""?WILL: A, I don't think they will. And, B, if they don't do it, it won't happen for at least two more years.KRUGMAN: No real opinion on that.MARCUS: I don't think they'll get it done in the lame-duck. The fascinating thing about Cindy McCain is she's put out a statement saying, well, actually she also agrees with her husband's position, wait, wait, wait, don't do it right now on ""don't ask/don't tell.""KAGAN: Exactly.AMANPOUR: And what's extraordinary, though, is that so many former military chiefs, so many of the former defense secretaries actually back repealing ""don't ask/don't tell,"" and it looks, again -- thanks to the Washington Post -- it looks like the Pentagon review shows that the military in general say that it will have no effect.What I don't understand is how, in this day and age, when you need as many people as you can fighting these wars, when you have our allies who have open gays serving in the military, how it's still this issue here and why you don't think it's going to be taken up in the lame-duck session?WILL: Well, you referred to a lot of former military people.AMANPOUR: Well, right, but they have experience.WILL: Well, check with the...AMANPOUR: They've been there.WILL: Check with the commandant of the Marine Corps, which is a small service...AMANPOUR: Well, I know the commandant of the Marine Corps, but...WILL: ... a small service that's specialty is small-unit combat, and that's where they think the issue matters most (ph).(CROSSTALK)AMANPOUR: But the review is meant to suggest that the military thinks that it won't have any impact.WILL: Then the -- then the review is not representing a consensus of the military.MARCUS: It's irrational. It's incoherent. It's going to end, but slowly.AMANPOUR: Well, we're going to talk about this -- hopefully, you'll talk about more of this in the roundtable, because it is really fascinating. And if it won't come up for another two years, that's a long time down the road.So -- and the roundtable does continue in the green room at abcnews.com/thisweek, where you can also find our fact-checks in conjunction with PolitiFact.Still to come, ""In Memoriam,"" the Sunday funnies, and the story of a politician who won an election and then had it taken away from him. You won't believe why.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)AMANPOUR: The midterm election here in the United States was the most expensive and also one of the most negative campaigns in recent history. Many candidates simply misrepresented their opponent's positions with little consequence, but not so in Britain, where as ABC's Jim Sciutto reports, one politician learned a hard lesson in truth in advertising.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)SCIUTTO (voice-over): For a country that's raised campaign mud-slinging to high art...(UNKNOWN): Reid actually voted to use taxpayer dollars to pay for Viagra for convicted child molesters.(UNKNOWN): Taliban Dan Webster.SCIUTTO: ... British politics can sound pretty tame.(UNKNOWN): The right honorable gentleman...SCIUTTO: And they may just have gotten tamer. Philip Woolas, parliament member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth, was hustled out of office, his May election victory overturned for allegedly lying about his opponent.STEWART: So, wait, in Britain, politicians can lose their seat for making false statements about their opponents? Wow, that's how our people get elected.SCIUTTO: This was the offending flier, which accused his opponent of wooing Islamic extremists.WOOLAS: I was devastated by the process.SCIUTTO: The now-former M.P. spoke to ABC News exclusively.(on-screen): It's an enormous price to pay. You won an election, and you've had that seat taken away from you.WOOLAS: The case hinged around in the end three lines in a leaflet. I took responsibility for that leaflet, but my election team actually wrote it, because he's not a criminal. This is an election matter. It's about who said what to who when. To my mind, it's the stuff of politics.SCIUTTO (voice-over): The stuff of dirty politics, two British judges ruled, dirty enough to nullify an election for the first time here in 99 years. Not surprisingly, Woolas' opponent, the target of those fliers and loser of the election, welcomed the ruling.WATKINS: If you lie to the electorate, you have no place in politics.SCIUTTO: The decision has sparked a firestorm, his own party abandoning him, but others warning of a chilling effect on free speech.(on-screen): Like in the U.S., there are many here who aren't sorry to see a politician pay a price for lying, but critics of the decision say there is already a way to punish them, the parliamentary elections themselves. Let the voters, not a judge, decide.(voice-over): The judges in Woolas' case may have changed the very way elections are run here, perhaps, some say, with a wary look across the Atlantic.(on-screen): Is there any sense that British people, British voters in general, look to America and say, ""We just don't want to go that far. We see how bad it can get""?FREEDLAND: There's definitely a recoil, a cringe almost in British politics about being told they're going down the American politics route.SCIUTTO (voice-over): Pending Woolas' appeal, British politicians will now face a rule almost unheard of in American politics: think before they sling.For ""This Week,"" Jim Sciutto, ABC News, London.(END VIDEOTAPE)AMANPOUR: And finally this morning, from Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, a rare image of freedom. Pro-democracy leader and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Aung San Suu Kyi was released from house arrest yesterday, where she's been held for 15 of the past 21 years. Despite their best efforts, the military junta has never succeeded in crushing her supporters' hope for freedom.That's our program for today.

So we expanded parts of this report to explain our reasoning in more detail. The rating remains the same.Last week President Barack Obama told immigration reform activists he would look into reducing deportations of illegal immigrants.This follows criticism that Obama is falling short of his promises on comprehensive immigration legislation. Not only that, but over the last few years, some have gone as far as to call him ""deporter-in-chief.""On Univisionâs talk show Al Punto, a Spanish-language political talk show, host Jorge Ramos interviewed a political activist on March 9, 2014, about her choice to use that nickname in a recent speech.""The truth is weâre at the point of reaching 2 million deportations,"" said Janet MurguÃ­a, National Council of La Raza president, in an interview PolitiFact translated from Spanish. ""For us, this is a historic level, more than any other president of the United States. Our community is in crisis, and this isnât acceptable.""PolitiFact has looked into deportation statistics under the Obama administration, but not since heâs started his second term. Letâs see how deportations under Obama compare to those under previous presidents.Laura Vazquez, a senior immigration legislative analyst at La Raza, told us that MurguÃ­a was referring to deportation numbers from the Department of Homeland Securityâs Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).ICE publishes yearly immigration statistics. However, ICE numbers lump together two separate statistics: removals and returns. Removals are formal orders to leave the country issued by a judge. A return is a more desirable option for Mexican nationals that allows them to leave the country without a restriction on when they can re-enter with a visa. There arenât formal consequences attached with returns, and returns technically donât count as "" deportations ,""according to Homeland Security themselves.Media outlets routinely cite ICE numbers. Here, we chose not to. Those numbers arenât an accurate count of deportations, because they include returns. Also, ICE numbers donât include deportations conducted by Border Patrol officers. So when we hear the word ""deportations,"" the publicâs definition doesnât line up with how ICE defines the action.Instead, we elected to reference the other common source for deportation numbers, Homeland Securityâs Yearbook of Immigration Statistics. Here, we can count all the removals by fiscal year. This isnât a perfect assessment, because presidentsâ terms donât start on the same day new fiscal years do. We only have access to this data through fiscal year 2012, so we canât track Obamaâs most recent deportations.The more comprehensive Homeland Security data dates back to 1892. Here, weâll take a closer look at deportations under Obama and other recent presidents. Deportations ramped up starting during the Clinton years.President"

In that same period, the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs."""	mostly true	['Job Accomplishments', 'Jobs']	http://www.politifact.com/	http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2013/may/09/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-accounted-33-percent-nations/	2015/01/22	"""Over the last 10 years, Texas created 33 percent of the net new jobs nationwide.""â Rick Perry on Thursday, May 9th, 2013 in an advertisementRick Perry says Texas accounted for 33 percent of nation's net job gains over the past decadeBy W. Gardner Selby on Thursday, May 9th, 2013 at 6:38 p.m.Gov. Rick Perry ran this advertisement in the Austin American-Statesman on May 9, 2013, to welcome President Barack Obama to town.In a May 9, 2013, advertisement, Gov. Rick Perry offered President Barack Obama a ""handy checklist"" about job creation to take back to Washington, D.C.The ad, which Perryâs campaign placed in the Austin American-Statesman the day Obama came to Austin to stress economic issues, said the checklist includes low taxes, lawsuit abuse reform, predictable and effective regulations, balanced budgets and accountable schools and a competitive workforce.And an indicator that the ""Texas model"" works, the ad said, is that while the U.S. lost 2.5 million net new jobs over the past five years, Texas created 530,000 net new jobs. Also, the ad said: ""Over the last 10 years, Texas created 33 percent of the net new jobs nationwide.""Texas has had a healthy economy compared with most other states. Still, we were curious if one in three of the nationâs net new jobs over the past 10 years was gained in Texas.By email, Perry spokesman Josh Havens referred to information attributed to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicating that Texas reaped more than 1.75 million net new jobs from March 2003 to March 2013, a period in which the United States as a whole accounted for 5.3 million net new jobs, Havens said.To our inquiry, a regional economist for the bureau, Cheryl Abbot, confirmed the net job gain figures provided by Havens. According to a spreadsheet she emailed our way, Texas topped 42 states with net job gains in the period, considerably outdistancing the No. 2 jobs-gainer, New York, which had a net gain of 458,000 jobs. States with net losses were Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio and Rhode Island.Among the states, Texas had the third-greatest percentage gain in jobs over the decade, 19 percent, trailing North Dakota (33 percent increase) and Utah (21 percent), the spreadsheet indicates.By email and in a telephone interview, though, Abbot said the bureau steers clear of using its employment estimates to declare how much of any national job gains are attributable to net job gains in individual states. That judgment has to do with technical difficulties comparing the results of surveys undertaken state by state to research intended to have national sweep, she said.Regardless, she said, ""Texas has been a very powerful job creator; during the period, the state created 1.75 million net jobs â and that was equal to one-third of the net jobs created nationwide,"" which is slightly different from saying the state accounted for 33 percent of national net jobs gained.We sent Perryâs office the bureauâs standing cautionary note about using its figures to reach conclusions about how much each state contributes to national job gains. Havens replied: ""The bottom line is, this is the most accurate way available to compare any single stateâs job growth to the nation as a whole.""We also tried a different way of gauging the degree that Texas job gains fit the national picture by adding up each stateâs net job gains as estimated by the bureau. This delivered a slightly higher total for national jobs gained, 5.5 million. Dividing the 1.75 million net jobs gained in Texas into the higher total leaves Texas accounting for 32 percent of the nationâs net jobs gained.We also asked Jason Abrevaya, who chairs the University of Texas Department of Economics, to review the bureau figures. He said by email that they seem to hold up. If Texas had been performing at the average nationwide from 2003 to 2013, he added, one ""would expect the state to account for roughly 8 percent,"" rather than 33 percent, of the net job changes, since Texas accounts for about 8 percent of the nationâs jobs.Our rulingPerry said: ""Over the last 10 years, Texas created 33 percent of the net new jobs nationwide."" That conclusion is supported by comparing state-by-state job gain estimates and a separate calculation of net job gains nationally, both by the federal government. This might be an imperfect way to explore this facet, but there also don't appear to be better approaches.We rate the claim as True.Advertisement"

Every time a military grunt got a haircut,every time a military wife Got a manicure or hair styling, with everyburger or slice of pizza or chicken dinner sold, a portion of theprofits went to this much needed Program.Alas, as with all things Obama, every time he does something toplease his socialist friends, someone suffers. In this case it will beour military.While this will be a serious loss for our stateside troops, thetroops who will be most hurt by this are our troops deployed to remoteareas of the world where our military folks had little to look forwardto but a Burger King Whopper and fries at a small concession thatmight bring them a little bit of home to their lives.This should not surprise me at all but it does. It should havebeen prepared for this when Obama eliminated hot meals for our troopsin Afghanistan even as He and Joe Biden were booking $500,000 pernight hotel suites in Paris and London....or Obama's total disregardfor costs as he and Michelle have run up Over $600 million dollars invacation costs during his tenure. Oh well, I understand themilitary's food research facility up in Illinois is Working on ""Pizzain a Pouch"" for the new cold ration packs. ""Screw the Grunts"" seems tobe Obama's philosophy...even as he and Michelle host Jay Z And Beyonceat one of those fancy White House dinners.AdvertisementHow to contact usWe want to hear your suggestions and comments.

Ford Jr. , conducted by Michael Barbaro, a political reporter for The New York Times, at New York Universityâs campus in Manhattan:Q. Why are you thinking about jumping into this race? What is your rationale for possibly being a candidate for United States Senate from New York?A. I ran for office 14 years ago in Tennessee, for Congress. And my appetite for public policy and changing it, and not only being a part of the conversation, but affecting it in a positive way, never diminished after 10 years in Congress. Iâve stayed active and engaged in the national conversation, in a far more limited way than I was when I was in elected office, through my role as chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council, and even my role as a pundit, initially at Fox News â I was there for a year and then switched to MSNBC about a year after. I stayed engaged and involved in the conversation. So that never diminished in any way.The race for office in New York is not something that was first mentioned last week. Upon really moving here, and spending time here, I have had a number of people inquire whether New York would be a place that I would consider pursuing a political career. Some of the names that we have talked about, across the board, up and down the board, to cabdrivers I have seen, who ask if I have given some thought to running for office in New York. Itâs been a cross-section of people.In the last year, as I have watched the health-care debate, as I have watched the last 6 to 12 months, the reaction to the jobs numbers, and most recently the increased attention around national security issues, which donât come and go, but just become more apparent and urgent, combined with President Obamaâs election, my appetite to be part of the process in a more meaningful and tangible way increased, combined with the talk from many from across the city, for that matter. Most of it has been concentrated in the New York City area. People have been encouraging, asking me if I would consider a run from here.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAnd, candidly, as you know, I have maintained my Tennessee residence for the first year I was here. I taught in Vanderbilt University. I spent my time at Merrill Lynch here. I had an office in Nashville. One of the articles noted, I continued to vote in Tennessee. I even gave some thought to pursuing the governorâs race in Tennessee. The race was I think this year. I decided against that in â08, that I would not do that.Continue reading the main storyQ: Why?A: I was living here with my wife â we were not married yet. But shortly after the race in November, I moved here. This is the woman I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. We had got engaged. We dated. I wanted to be with her. And so I moved here. And moved is such a legal term. I was not a resident here yet until just last year, because I did not spend the requisite number of days here â being that the majority of time I still spent commuting between here and Nashville, and spending time in Tennessee.This race has become even more interesting, because as I learn and become more integrated into the city, and appreciate the kind of elected representation that New York and New York State has enjoyed, the kind of independent-minded senators and, for that matter, mayor, and governor and other positions over the years that you have had here â I should say the kinds of people who have held office here.So I thought more and more about the issues and become more and more integrated into the city, into philanthropic life â not in a big way, but some of the organizations I have contributed to and are now a part of â be it the Prep for Prep program, the Council on Foreign Relations.My wife â she lived here for five years. New York has, in many ways, become home.And, again, you combine the central issues confronting the country, which confront New York in a more meaningful and tangible way, arguably, than other cities and locals around the country.I often have said to people that there are really two cities in the country where the outlook is always forward-looking â there is never really a backward-looking tendency. My banking work has taken me out to Palo Alto, what is commonly called Silicon Valley. And you sense out there is always a forward-looking outlook. And New York City. There is a desire to allow people to become a part of something that is so great and so big.Q. You spoke about independence. You are running against somebody. Itâs not an open seat âA. The seat was â the person who held it was appointed. As a matter of fact, I contributed to her shortly after she was appointed.Q. Why did you do that?A. Well, I was asked by a good friend of mine. I have known Kirsten.Q. Who was the friend?AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyA. A donor, a friend of hers. I donât want to introduce him into it.... I was asked by a friend to make a contribution. Kirsten was a Blue Dog member of the House. We never served together. And I like Kirsten. I have nothing personally against her, even as this process unfolds. I have no personal ill will toward the senator or her family.Q. But a donation suggests you approve of the way sheâs led, no?A. She had only been a senator for two days, when I made my contribution.Q. Thatâs precise.A. One of the things you will find as we talk is that I have a decent-size memory for dates and people. One of the reasons I remember this. It was at the St. Regis Hotel. I had been on âMorning Joeâ that morning. And our mutual friend asked if I would attend the fund-raiser. I said, absolutely.Q. What are her challenges?A. There are some differences that I have with the senator on a few fronts â as it relates to the city and as it relates to the state, and to national issues. One, I am a firm believer on the economy and national security.As it relates to the economy, you have to be far more aggressive than the senator, or the Congress, has been, around job creation. I think tax cuts for employers, particularly small businesses, is critically important right now.As it relates to big issues: I think there ought to be a huge-tax cut bill for business people, not only in New York but across the country.Health care: I donât know how you add the kind of burdens you add in the Medicaid program to cities like this, to states like this, who send far more money to Washington than they sent back. That conversation has been lost. And the leadership in Washington from some representing New York has been lacking. This is not a personal affront at Kirsten; itâs just the reality.The other reality is that Kirsten was appointed to the seat. She is not the incumbent. New Yorkers have never had a chance to vote for her. She has never stood on the ballot before.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySo if we look at some of these questions, itâs important to acknowledge that fact. Second, as it relates to health care, I am for the bill, as I stated. But I wouldnât support the bill with the Stupak amendment if it came to the House floor. I wouldnât vote for a bill that would add additional debt and burden to my home state, which would be New York.If I were the senator of the state, there is no way I could support a bill that would add the kind of burdens that have been projected to add what it does to New York City and New York State. We should not do it to any state.Q. You would oppose the health-care overhaul as it now stands?A. I couldnât support a health-care bill that places the kind of burdens on New York State that this one does. I am for health-care reform, and I think there is a way to correct this, and understand, Michael, I have a relationship with MSNBC, and I have talked about the increased taxes on business and increased burdens placed on states. At a time when projections show states like New York face the kinds of projected deficits, it does not seem smart to place that kind of extra burden on them at this moment.Q. You raised the issue of independence. It sounds like you are saying Kirsten Gillibrand is not independent enough from leaders in Washington and Albany. Can you explain what you mean?A. One thing is clear: If I am elected senator from New York, Harry Reid will not instruct me how to vote. He may try, and would be my leader and I would work with him. But I would be beholden to voters in New York. And you can count, for certain, that I was sure of what I voted for before I voted for it. I think I read some comments where at least exchanges between some elected officials in the city and Kirsten Gillibrand, she didnât quite understand what was in the health-care bill. And if you are going to cast a vote in favor of a massive reform bill, you ought to know what is in it.I want health-care reform to pass. The president has invested a great amount of political energy and political capital. Democrats and some Republicans, a few, have invested as well. It would be very hard to vote for the bill that had the kind of anti-abortion language that came out of the House.Q. Has Kirsten been a good senator? Can you grade her for me?A. Obviously, I am thinking of running against her. It would certainly be hard to give a grade that would be a glowing one. If the grade were a glowing one, I would not be having this conversation with you.Q. Can you grad her?A: I am giving thought to running. You can interpret what the grade would be.Q. If you had to rank â and sorry for these academic exercises â but if you had to rank your seriousness about running for Senate, on a 1-to-10 scale?AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyA. Again, I wouldnât be having the conversation with you if there were not a level of seriousness about this. This all happened â the seriousness and the rapidity and, for that matter, the speed in which this happened â I mean, we are talking one week. This was eight days ago that this really picked up momentum and a kind of seriousness.I laid out a timetable in your first article of 45 days.After the article appeared in your newspaper, that you wrote, the response I have gotten is overwhelming, from different categories, the spectrum of political leaders, people involved in politics, people representing different social and income classes in the city, be it the cabdriver on the way down here, who had positive things to say, and wanted to take a picture with me before I got out of the taxi, to people who are business leaders and leaders in the entertainment industry and media industry based here.I am very seriously considering this. I havenât made a decision. But I wouldnât be sitting here unless I were. You all have reported some of the people I have met with, the conversations.Q. Has Harry Reid called you?A. No.Q. Can you tell me about your conversation with Senator Schumer?A. I am not going to get into that. I think that the characterizations in the press have been what they are and I have not objected to them.Q. I am not here to quiz you or try to embarrass you, but I do want to ask you about your life and travels in New York. So here goes. Have you traveled all five boroughs?A. I will tell you what I did. I was able to do it. Kelly had a â Chief Kelly, Commissioner Kelly â invited, I guess, business people in the city, including Sir. Harold Evans, in my group. We spent the afternoon with the special operations force, and so I had the chance to helicopter to various areas in the boroughs. The only place I have not spent considerable time is Staten Island.Q. Have you been to Staten Island?A. I landed there in the helicopter, so I can say yes.Q. I asked you about your travel within New York State. What is the most northern place you have been in the state?A. I will tell you where I have been. To Buffalo. I have been to Syracuse. I am scheduled to go to Rochester at the end of the month, to speak at the University of Rochester. Itâs on the schedule now. Things may change over the next few weeks. I am scheduled to be in Albany to be at the Coalition of Black and Latino Elected Officials.AdvertisementQ. So I have heard.A. That is also â one is Feb. 7, one is Feb. 14.Q. What subways do you use in the city?A. Near my house, I take the 6, if I am uptown â I come down â I take the 6, 5 or the 4.Q. Do you commute by subway or car?A. Normally I commute, itâs easier, in the morning, because I spend time at MSNBC, generally â I donât really take the subway very often unless itâs wintertime and I canât get a taxi on Fifth, because I stumble out. I normally take a take a taxi now on Fifth. My office is at 42nd and Fifth. I walk a lot. In the morning, I am going to the office, it takes me four or five minutes. I am on at 6 a.m. NBC will sometimes, if not all the time, send a car, and I shoot right up Sixth Avenue. The two corridors are easy to get back and forth to.Q. Jets or Giants?A. I had breakfast about every morning when I am in town, or I should say, several mornings, at the Regency. I see my friends the Tisches. Steve Tisch is my close personal friend. I have been to more Giants games. I spent the holidays, I had lunch over the holidays with Woody Johnson. We met for the first time. I am happy for his team.Q. Baseball?A. I am a Yankees fan. I should say â have been to more Yankees games than Mets games. I have not been to the new Citi Field yet. I was at the old stadium for the Mets. I made several playoff games for the Yankees. This coming season, with classmates from Penn, who already have a group I am buying into.Q. You have a car in the city?A. Yes, I do. I have a driving license from my old state. I have a Ford Escape. Itâs an â08.Q. I want to talk about executive compensation . Youâve spent the last few years in finance in New York. Should executive compensation be capped?A. Should it be capped? I am not a believer that it should be capped. What I do believe is that shareholders should have greater say. I am not in opposition to some of the measures that have come before Congress â and there ought to be some nonbinding votes that ought to take place. I think there ought to be more transparency around a lot of these issues for shareholders to understand what people are being paid. You can look back â I have been on âMorning Joeâ talking about this, so there is a record here and I am not running away from it.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyQ. In 2008 and 2009, a lot of the large Wall Street firms, including Merrill Lynch and Bank of America, got federal TARP money and a lot of them lost money that year. But most of the major banks still gave their employers bonuses. Should they have?A. Well, letâs make a distinction. There was a lot of talk about A.I.G. TARP was not a bailout. It was essentially a loan. The bank I worked for paid their money back, along with some of the others, recently, B of A paid theirs back. There are a bunch of factors that got these companies into the situation they were in. Candidly, I joined the firm in â07, but my role in terms of helping develop those kinds of products was not that extensive. I want to make sure we are clear on that front.Newsletter Sign UpPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

I mean, No. 1, if you are going to represent New York state, in New York City, one of your largest industries, how it is that financial services â how can you be against insuring that the lifeblood of your city and of your state survive, not just the bonuses that may have gone to the largest executives, the people who clean the building, sell food in the building, the companies that provide transportation to those who work in the industry, not to mention the restaurants in the city, and not to mention, the schools, the libraries the firehouses â I live next door to a firehouse, the police stations.TARP has worked â it is working. We are going to get our money back as taxpayers.Q. Understood, but my question was about bonuses. Should they have been given out in these two years?A. The pay czar worked out a reasonable arrangement. And where those arrangements are now worked out, you have other actions that took place, including by the attorney general of this great state. There are some institutions where the government took an ownership stake. Should the government be allowed to dictate to private institutions, you shouldnât be allowed to pay this person X, this person Y, this person Z? I actually donât like that. I actually think I am not too far from where the president is. I donât think the government should dictate what they pay. That said, shareholders ought to be able to see what financial institution, or any public institution, is paying their top executives. It ought to be in line with performance. These institutions were able to show that the work these people did measured up to the amount they were getting â absolutely. But ultimately, they have to answer to shareholders.Q. Did you do any lobbying for the bank?A. No.Q. During the financial crisis , did you work with people on the Hill to help Merrill or Bank of America navigate the situation?A: No, that would be lobbying. See, as a former member of Congress, what trips up lobbying is different than what you or David were to do. [He is referring to David Goldin, a spokesman for Mr. Ford.] I cannot interface with lawmakers. There are certain things that would trip it up right away. I was not a registered lobbyist and never lobbied.Q. Letâs talk about gay marriage. You know your record very well, but to quickly remind you, you voted to ban same sex marriage, with the Federal Marriage Amendment, twice.A. I can say up until 2003, most organizations and national organization that had an office in Washington dedicated to fighting for equality for Americans, I enjoyed broad support and big support from them. The marriage votes drove my ratings down considerably, and arguably rightly so. I have been a supporter of civil unions. My opponent raised the issue on the campaign trail in Tennessee.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAs the presidential race unfolded, one of the things I recognized during the campaign: My position on same-sex marriage resembles President Obamaâs over the years. Frankly, up until maybe a year ago, that of the senior senator in the state, Senator Schumer, who was opposed to same-sex marriage.Q. Where are you now?A. I am for gay marriage. Or same-sex marriage. I donât want to say it the wrong way. I think people are sensitive to it. I have been painted as being this right-wing zealot on choice. Nothing could be further from the truth. I think there are legitimate questions around my support for âQ. Letâs focus on your two votes to ban same-sex marriage. Can you explain that? Walk me through that.A. The last three years, think about what has transpired. How many states have either courts and or legislatures that have declared same-sex marriage is acceptable in their states? There has been a robust debate.I donât think itâs a great leap to go from civil unions to gay marriage â I may be in the minority in believing that. But I donât think there is. Long before I arrived in New York, my commitment to issues of fairness and equality are clear and obvious and unmistakable. And in light of that, and consistent with that, according the same rights that a couple were married, versus the rights provided by civil unions, I donât believe the difference is that great. I understand that in certain communities itâs not viewed on equal footing. But my change, or my maturation to that point....Q. What changed for you?A. Understand, I did not start at zero and get to 10. I started at 8. This is my point: I think some of the press accounts of my record have been distorted or just been wrong. People make it sound as if â letâs go back to the votes in the Congress.Q. Do you regret those votes, then?A: I have been in politics for 14 years. I was elected back in 1996 ... over the 14 years, have I learned and have I listened? Absolutely. Understand, Michael, I did not go from zero to 10. I was for civil unions and believed strongly that the flow of benefits and protections that would be provided in a civil union for same-sex couples, the decisions that have to be made, when health hardships are faced, when economic hardships are faced, I wanted all of those protections. I never strayed from them. It was just the issue of marriage, that particularly over the last three years, I have come to understand differently.Q. Letâs talk about abortion.A. I want more jobs in New York.....Q. And we are going to get to that. But first, we know you describe yourself as âpro-life.âAdvertisementA. No, no. Letâs be clear.Q. O.K., walk me through this.A. I was not going to cede the language of life to the National Right to Life Committee. When asked questions when I was on the ballot, I have often opened answers, especially in areas outside of urban areas, outside of Memphis, outside of Nashville, Chattanooga and Knoxville, making clear, that if the Republicans are so pro-life, which I am, why is it we are denying benefits to veterans? Why is it we are denying equal pay treatment to National Guardsmen. Why is it we are denying special tax treatments to employees who take 9- and 12-month absences to serve their country but they canât count on their paychecks? ... If we are so pro-life, why arenât we doing these things? So it was put in that frame. No. 2, the National Right to Life Committee â I may be off by one or two points, I donât think I ever received higher than a 25 percent voting record. No. 3, they never gave me a penny. No. 4, my voting record in the 10 years in the Congress, was three or four years, was 100 percent. [He refers to his record from NARAL Pro-Choice America.]I know somebody somewhat cynically suggested that perhaps there were not votes on abortion those years. But if that were true, the entire Congress would have gotten 100 percent. That did not happen. You can go and check.My recollection: Every time I was on the ballot in Tennessee, I received a contribution from organizations that would certainly be in line with being pro-choice or supporting a womanâs right to choice.I accept the criticism coming from some in the city who are supporters of Senator Gillibrand who are aligned with NARAL. They have every right not to support me, and I hope to have an audience with them, to introduce myself.To say that I am pro life is just wrong. I am personally pro-choice and legislatively pro-choice.Q. O.K. Letâs discuss a few votes. You voted to ban partial-birth abortion and require consent for minors who want an abortion. Do you stand by those votes?A. I do. I hope the Lord blesses my wife and I with a daughter some day. And if my daughter â if a situation befalls her where she has to make that choice, I would love to know and I stand by that vote.Q. You would love to know what?A. If my daughter, my 15-year-old daughter, is taken to the hospital, to get an abortion, I would hope as a minor, I would know it. If she canât get into a movie to see an R or NC-17 movie, at 15, I would hope that I would know if she was going to the doctor to have this kind of procedure performed. Not to give you my answer. But if I said yea or nay. I support my family. But I would want to know that. So that is why I voted in favor of parental consent.Q. Partial-birth abortion. You have objections to it?A. I do.A. And I still want more jobs for New York City.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyQ. O.K., letâs talk about jobs. How do you create jobs in New York State?A. A couple of things. One, you have to be mindful of not undermining the opportunity for growth and initiatives you have in the city and the state. The financial services industry is an important part of the economic engine for the state. I think some of the reforms that have been proposed in Washington, especially the ones committed to transparency and calling for capital reserves on the part of some of the financial institutes, will provide some of protection we are looking for as well as increased say-so on the part of shareholders.Two, I think immediately, we need to lower the corporate tax rate from 35 to 25 percent. We need to make clear that dividends and capital-gains taxes not go up â we do not want to see decisions made that are rash. We should have a broad payroll-tax cut. A three month payroll-tax holiday for businesses and workers. Finally, I am for the extension of unemployment benefits. And I am for the increased infrastructure spending that some of my colleagues in Washington want to engage in. I believe we have to set up an official way to it, through a national infrastructure bank, so money flows to projects that make the most sense and produce the most jobs.Q. What else should I know about your vision for the state economy?A. The clash for clunkers program that worked. I am a huge supporter for cash for caulkers â which allows people to make improvement for energy efficient in their homes. We should do the same for Americans purchasing appliances and computers and for that matter, new air-conditioner and heating units. I would provide an even greater break for those who buy U.S.-made products. Look at China â there was a greater tilt toward home-grown products, which helps their economy.Q. Has Senator Gillibrand proposed economic stimulus plans that you oppose?A. I havenât heard her talk about it at all. Maybe you have evidence of it; I donât. If I were the U.S. Senator, I would talk about it.Q. Can I briefly talk about immigration ? I want to talk about illegal immigrants, a topic of enormous importance to Mayor Bloomberg. You voted for legislation that would allow local enforcement agencies to investigate and arrest illegal immigrants. I am sure you are familiar with the debate around that bill, how it changes the relationship between cops and the people they are supposed to protect. People fear they will be reported as illegal, and get deported. The secure fence act of 2006, which sealed the border. Can you explain these positions, and do you stand by them?A. No. 1, put this in perspective: In the campaign in â06, I argued for what was then, the McCain-Kennedy legislation, which really worked to provide a path to citizenship, which you could probably go back and find the language. I supported that, and was criticized for it.No. 2, I know that Mayor Bloomberg and I differed back then. We donât differ now. I have come to better understand the issue. At the time, empowering local enforcement to do what federal law enforcement was not doing seemed to make sense in my state. Mayors and sheriffs and police chiefs across the state complained bitterly about it and there was no effort at the federal effort, or very little, to address the problem. It had been in some ways negligent to not think about this. In the long term, Michael, the answer is a broad immigration reform. If I am elected to the Senate, we will work towards that. Before 2003-2004, my votes in the Congress, at least the grading by anti-immigrant advocacy groups, they gave me â one of them, the group FAIR â gave me a zero percent rating. In 2003-2004, Americans for Better Immigration, which is a great name for a group that wants to restrict immigration, rated me at 8 percent. So in â05 and â06, as this issue became more urgent, and the concerns expressed across the jurisdiction I was running to represent, it was obvious that we needed some other measures in place. Those votes were never meant, in my mind, to be the long-term answer to this challenge. The long-term answer is to deal with, to rally around a broad immigration reform bill that provides a safe understandable and legal way to citizenship.Q. Where you talk about an evolution, closer to mayor Bloombergâs position, that is on the law enforcement issue.AdvertisementA. Yeah, the law enforcement issue.Q. What about the secure fence on the border?A: Even if we had a fence now, we are not going to stop it. In a lot of ways, itâs a stopgap, to say, we have to do more. I donât depart from what I said at the start. We need a broad comprehensive immigration reform bill.Q. Guns. Letâs talk about this issue.A: I never got an A rating, like my opponent â would-be opponent â has enjoyed. I donât own them. I do shoot them, and I shoot them at things that canât shoot back. And will continue to do that. And by that, I want to be clear, I donât mean children. I have done a little bird hunting in my day.Q. Are you a frequent hunter?A. I would say, occasional, recreational hunter.Q. Where do you hunt?A. I have done it in Arkansas, and in Florida.Q. D.C. and New York have done a lot to restrict gun laws, and they are among the toughest in the country. You opposed D.C.âs effort to put restrictions on guns â one of the measures you opposed would require a gun at home to be unloaded and disassembled. Why do that?A. I donât think I did oppose that part. That was part of a broader bill... well, I take your word for it. I am a supporter of the Second Amendment and think that people ought to have the right to own weapons, guns and firearms, with certain responsibilities attached to them.One of the reasons I never scored above a B with the N.R.A. â my intent was never to â it speaks to my independent-minded approach â I am a member of the N.R.A. But I donât send money or contribute to those efforts that I think are bad, and when I disagree with them, I push back.Q. Should a city like New York have the right to restrict guns?A. The answer is yes. All of Mayor Bloomberg and Mayor Bookerâs efforts in the region, I support wholeheartedly. [He is referring to Mayor Cory A. Booker of Newark.]Q: So what about D.C., where that was put to the test?A. It ... My understanding of that, I donât recall it, we vote for 1,000 pieces of legislation â read me the bill again.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyQ. It was a restriction on guns, that would require federal approval, because D.C. is a ward of Congress, that made firearms at homes be unloaded, disassembled and so on.A. People have the right to own a gun, and you meet all of the qualifications, why would I then require that the gun be disassembled? I didnât support that. Thatâs different from what, I believe, Mayor Bloomberg and Booker are doing. The number of handguns on the street here and back where I represented in Congress, the proliferation of gun violence in the 90s and the early 2000s, it certainly precipitated action on the part of the Congress. ... my opponent in this race, has been endorsed by the N.R.A. and enjoyed A ratings. That is not the reason I am giving consideration to running. Her A rating from the N.R.A. I supported background checks, waiting 72 hours.We have fundamental difference on independence. We have a difference on the level, the kind and the stature of advocacy New Yorkers deserve. And we have some honest differences on some issues.Q. Is Senator Gillibrandâs fund-raising a concern to you, the $5 million or so she has on hand, and $7 million raised?A. Itâs a number I donât have. But it doesnât make me flinch.Q. You ran for Senate in â06. You talked about running in â99 for Senate against Frist. You flirted with running for governor of Tennessee. You ran against Pelosi for minority leader in the House. Now are you thinking of running for Senate from New York. My question is, and itâs provocative, I admit: Are you a little impetuous when it comes to politics, and running for office? Is that fair?A. Itâs totally unfair. I donât know of anyone in any state in the country, whoâs been elected to any office, that at some point, when offices open up that are higher than the one they hold, that people donât speculate whether that person will run or not. In 1999, in Tennessee, when Bill Frist â remember, he won in â94 â the party was looking for the most formidable opponent. I was approached by leaders of my party, members of Congress, to think about it and ultimately, I decided not to. I donât think that is any different from Chuck Schumer, who gave thought to running for governor here, maybe once or twice or before. I donât think itâs any different than any member of Congress in this district. Carolyn Maloney has given thought to running for Senate. ... I donât think itâs a label that impetuous seems a little bizarre. Do I have an appetite for public policy? Yes. Do I have an appetite for having my record distorted? No. I donât know who welcomes that kind of scrutiny.

At every turn, Trump and Pence have consistently sided with the powerful interests they promised to fight against, all while throwing working Americans â including their own voters â under the bus.Trump and his party spent the better part of the year trying to take away health care from tens of millions of Americans to pay for a tax cut for the rich, and when that failed, they passed a tax bill that gave 80% of its benefits to the top 1%. These are more than just broken promises â they are outright betrayals.At the same time, Trump, Pence and their cabinet waged war against working families through quieter efforts like proposing massive cuts to job training programs, gutting protections for student borrowers and consumers, and making it harder for Americans to save for their retirement â just to name a few. These are more than just broken promises â they are outright betrayals.Time and again, Trump and his Republican enablers have lied to the American people to cover up the gulf between his rhetoric and his policies. When Trump was confronted with questions about the undeniable fact that his tax plan would save him hundreds of millions, he said it wouldnât. When Republicans didnât want to admit that their health care plan cut hundreds of millions from Medicaid, they said it didnât.These lies are the real âfake newsâ of the Trump presidency â but the impact on America is very real. Just ask employees of the Carrier plant in Indianapolis. A year ago, Trump and Pence promised to save their jobs and announced a deal to much fanfare. Yet hundreds of job layoffs later, we now know these were empty promises. The company is getting millions in tax incentives while those workers are still getting pink slips. This is the story of Trumpâs first year in office.The threat Trump poses to our prosperity as a nation also extends beyond these economic policies and to the reckless behavior and hateful, divisive rhetoric that has defined his politics for years. The president who launched his campaign with a racially charged attack on Mexican immigrants closed out his first year in office broadening that assault and denigrating numerous countries. Democrats know Americaâs diversity is not just part of the heart and soul of our nation, but is also a competitive advantage. We are a place where ideas, innovation, and dreams flourish and together we all rise. Instead of recognizing this as a strength, Trump has attacked it relentlessly.While Trump and the GOP continue their campaign to reward the wealthy at the expense of the middle class, Democrats will keep fighting to create an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, to create more jobs with higher wages, and to ensure every American has the opportunity get ahead and stay ahead.Trump Hasnât Delivered On His Economic Promises:On the campaign trail Trump made big promises to grow the economy, bring back jobs, raise wages and protect American workers, all of which have gone unfulfilled.In Trumpâs first year as president:Â· Job growth slowed to the lowest level in seven years .Â· Offshoring of manufacturing jobs increased .Â· Our trade deficit with China grew .Â· Wage growth was stagnant .Trump frequently tweets about gains in the stock market. But:Â· The stock market grew at a slower rate than it did during this same period of Obamaâs presidency.Â· Gains in the stock market primarily benefit the richest Americans. The top 1% of Americans own more than 40% of our countryâs stock, while less than 14% of households hold direct stock in any company and fewer than half own any stock at all.Trump Is Not For American Workers:Trumpâs betrayal of Carrier workers sums up his first year in office:Â· A year ago Pence and Trump promised to save the jobs of Carrier workers, but since then more than 550 workers have lost their jobs, while the company has received millions in tax incentivesTrump and Pence have remained silent.Trumpâs policies donât raise wages and donât create jobs:Â· The Trump tax may actually encourage companies to move jobs overseas .Â· Companies that Trump touted for giving bonuses to employees have been simultaneously laying off their workers.Â· Trumpâs tax cuts for the wealthiest corporations will not go to workers â companies are already revealing they will use tax cuts from the Trump Tax to benefit their wealthy investors . (Meanwhile, Democratic-led efforts increased wages for 4.5 million workers in 18 states in 2018.)Trump repeatedly sided with the wealthiest corporations over workers:Â· Trump proposed cutting job training programs by 40% .Â· Trump overturned a rule that would have made it easier for workers to collectively bargain with big corporations.Â· Trump reversed a rule that would have helped millions get paid for overtime.Â· Trump made it harder for Americans to save for retirement.Â· Trump proposed scrapping a requirement that companies disclose the pay ratio between chief executives and employees.Â· Trump rescinded a rule meant to protect workers from being cheated out of their wages, and one that prevented employers from stealing workersâ tips .Â· Trump rolled back worker safety regulations aimed at reducing the number of workplace injuries and deaths.Â· Trump proposed eliminating funding for training grants for workers in dangerous jobs.Trump Is Not For Middle-Class Families:Trumpâs only legislative achievement of 2017, the Trump Tax, will do damage to the middle class:Â· It gave a permanent tax cut to corporations while increasing taxes on the middle class.Â· The top 1% will get 83% of its benefits, while middle class taxes increase.Â· By 2027, taxes will rise for everyone earning under $75,000. Thatâs about half of all U.S. tax filers.Trump sabotaged health insurance markets and tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act, hurting millions of families across the country:Â· 13 million will lose their insurance and premiums will increase by double digits, all because of Trumpâs repeal of the ACAâs individual mandate.Â· Trumpâs decision to stop paying cost-sharing reduction payments will lead to new premium increases for Americans.Â· Trump cut the 2018 open enrollment period in half .Â· Trump slashed millions of dollars from outreach programs and advertising aimed at enrolling people in Obamacare plans.Â· Trump limited and even abandoned state and community partnerships that have played a key role in enrolling harder-to-reach demographics.Â· Trump spent taxpayer resources to produce anti-ACA videos and scrubbed its website of useful consumer guidance on the ACA.Trump has done virtually nothing to combat the opioid epidemic that impacts the lives of families across the country:Â· Despite declaring the opioid epidemic a national emergency, Trump has not proposed any new resources or spending.Â· Trumpâs health care repeal would make the opioid epidemic even worse.Â· Trump has supported hundreds of billions in cuts to Medicaid, despite his repeated promises not to cut the program.Â· Trump ended an important tool to help the public get substance abuse treatment.Trump and his administration have repeatedly sided against students and their families, making it more difficult for them to find careers and pay down their debt:Â· Trump dismantled policies that protected students from the predatory for-profit education industry.Â· Trump withdrew guidance intended to protect student loan borrowers.Â· Trump weakened the gainful employment rule, making it easier for career training programs to cheat students.Â· Trump eliminated a federal task force that cracked down on abuse at for-profit schools.Trump Is Not For Women:Trump, who admitted on tape to sexually assaulting women, has unsurprisingly continued to hurt women through the first year of his presidency:Â· Trumpâs efforts to repeal and sabotage the ACA disproportionally hurts women.Â· Trump made it harder access to birth control.Â· Trump signed legislation to block Planned Parenthood funding.Â· Trump cancelled workplace protections for women concerning sexual harassment and paycheck fairness.Â· Trump reversed on-campus sexual assault guidelines.Â· Trump made it harder to close the gender pay gap.Trumpâs Priority is Enriching His Business and Himself:Though the majority of Americans were left worse off, Trump managed to look out for his own bottom line:Â· Trump and his family will save hundreds of millions because of the Trump Tax. The real estate industry also won big, receiving special tax breaks.Â· Trump reversed a rule that gave federal protection to rivers, streams and wetlands, a big win for golf course owners like himself.Â· Trump continues to profit off the presidency.Â· Trump and his family continued to hire foreign workers at his properties and outsource the manufacturing of their products .Â· Trump spent nearly one-third of his presidency at a Trump-branded property.Â· Trump wasted at least $30 million of taxpayers dollars on vacations to his Mar-a-Lago club.

This liberal billionaire has used his massive wealth and resources to essentially control the Democratic Party. Which is why if Hillary Clinton had won the presidential election, she would have been listening to Soros.AdvertisementWhen youâre done imaging that nightmare scenario, itâs important to realize that the fight isnât over yet. Hillary might have lost the election, but Soros is still out there, mobilizing and planning more moves that seek to dismantle the Donald Trump presidency.Thatâs why Trump finally had enough and is going to charge Soros as a âthreat to national securityâ in the United States . Considering that this is the same man that has mobilized and paid protesters to create a tremendous amount of damage, itâs been a long time coming for this order.AdvertisementTrump had placed a call to Russia to ask about âany and allâ files that are related to Soros. He was able to do this thanks to the 2014 Executive Order that was signed by President Obama, entitled âBlocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine.ââI, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find that the actions and policies of persons that undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.âObamaâs Executive Order In 2014 Paved The Way For This To HappenNearly a month after this order was signed US diplomatic cables show that Soros did âundermine the processes and institutions in Ukraine.â Due to Sorosâs illegal intervention into a peaceful transition of power, mass conflict erupted and an estimated 9,600 men, women, and children lost their lives.AdvertisementClearly that is interfering in the process. So why didnât President Obama charge Soros as a threat to the United States national security? Itâs because Soros flooded Obama and Hillaryâs Democratic Party with about $100 million in donations. You really think that Obama is going to charge someone that has donated that much to their party?Soros began his takeover back in 2004, as he declared âit is the central focus of my lifeâ and âa matter of life and deathâ to push his influence on the American people and our democracy.Â While 2004 failed, Soros had turned to 2016 and had become Hillaryâs highest donor. We know that Hillary listens to people that donate to her, so she would have been listening to Soros the entire time.Now that the Democratic Party has been completely defeated, Soros is doing what he can to go against President Trump, saying âdemocracy is now in crisis.â Soros has been active in his fight against Trump, as he was discovered to have been the mastermind behind paying protesters to cause as much damage and destruction as possible.During the election season, there were several Black Lives Matter protests that quickly turned violent. These protesters started riots, went up against the police force, and generally made life difficult for law-abiding citizens. Then came a report that Soros was paying these protesters around $15 an hour to protest, and they would have their expenses paid for.AdvertisementSoros Paid Protesters To Riot And Cause DamageAdvertisementIt didnât just stop at the Black Lives Matter protests either. There were several protests against Trump during the election season that turned violent. Again, another report circulated that protesters were getting paid to cause as much destruction as possible.Considering that one of these protests actually shut down a speech that Trump had planned to make, itâs safe to say that they were effective at the time. Not to mention that these people were endangering other people around them and creating a lot of problems for the police forces that were assigned to them.Itâs about time that Trump did something against Soros. This man has been responsible for funding protests that have turned violent in the United States. He has been responsible for attempting to control the Democrats through his donations to the Party. This man is a menace to society, and Trump is finally labeling Soros like he should be: a âNational Security Threat.âOther nations are starting to do something against Soros as well. Hungary became the first nation to come forward and do what they could to bring down Soros . Hungary said that they will use âall the tools at its disposalâ to âsweep outâ various NGOs that are tied to Soros. In other words, his wealth wonât be able to influence government positions anymore.Again, Soros has done what he could to help finance and protest against Trumpâs inauguration. A report came out that showed he was directly tied to over 50 groups that were set to protest the inauguration of Trump . If he is tied to that many groups, then that is a lot of money invested in people just to protest something.Share this article to show that Trump is finally going to label Soros for what he is, and that is a threat to the security of the United States. Trump was able to do this thanks to Obamaâs Executive Order back in 2014. Considering all the damage that Soros has done to the United States through his funding of protests, this was a long time coming.

We will be posting the transcript and our annotations through the night. Follow us on Medium and check back regularly to see our commentary.RADDATZ: Ladies and gentlemen the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump, and the Democratic nominee for president, Hillary Clinton.COOPER: Thank you very much for being here. Weâre going to begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall. Each of you will have two minutes to respond to this question. Secretary Clinton, you won the coin toss, so youâll go first. Our first question comes from Patrice Brock. Patrice?QUESTION: Thank you, and good evening. The last debate could have been rated as MA, mature audiences, per TV parental guidelines. Knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as studentsâ homework, do you feel youâre modeling appropriate and positive behavior for todayâs youth?CLINTON: Well, thank you. Are you a teacher? Yes, I think that thatâs a very good question, because Iâve heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because weâre good. And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up. We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them into working on behalf of our country.I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together. Thatâs why the slogan of my campaign is âStronger Together,â because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals â and Iâve set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else.If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, thereâs nothing in my opinion that America canât do. So thatâs why I hope that we will come together in this campaign. Obviously, Iâm hoping to earn your vote, Iâm hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion. I want us to heal our country and bring it together because thatâs, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.TRUMP: Well, I actually agree with that. I agree with everything she said. I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country. This is a great country. This is a great land. Iâve gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that Iâve been doing this as a politician. I cannot believe Iâm saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.TRUMP: And my whole concept was to make America great again. When I watch the deals being made, when I watch whatâs happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, itâs a one-sided transaction where weâre giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, weâve made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether itâs in business and trade, where weâre doing so badly. Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit. In other words, trading with other countries. We had an $800 billion deficit. Itâs hard to believe. Inconceivable.You say whoâs making these deals? Weâre going the make great deals. Weâre going to have a strong border. Weâre going to bring back law and order. Just today, policemen was shot, two killed. And this is happening on a weekly basis. We have to bring back respect to law enforcement. At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides. We need justice.But I want to do things that havenât been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it. Itâs called make America great again.COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump. The question from Patrice was about are you both modeling positive and appropriate behavior for todayâs youth? We received a lot of questions online, Mr. Trump, about the tape that was released on Friday, as you can imagine. You called what you said locker room banter. You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals. That is sexual assault. You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that?TRUMP: No, I didnât say that at all. I donât think you understood what was â this was locker room talk. Iâm not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people. Certainly Iâm not proud of it. But this is locker room talk.You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have â and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times. We havenât seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world.And they look and they see. Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS? And they look at our country and they see whatâs going on.Yes, Iâm very embarrassed by it. I hate it. But itâs locker room talk, and itâs one of those things. I will knock the hell out of ISIS. Weâre going to defeat ISIS. ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment. And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.COOPER: So, Mr. Trumpâ¦TRUMP: And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.COOPER: Just for the record, though, are you saying that what you said on that bus 11 years ago that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent?TRUMP: I have great respect for women. Nobody has more respect for women than I do.COOPER: So, for the record, youâre saying you never did that?TRUMP: Iâve said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said. And I was embarrassed by it. But I have tremendous respect for women.COOPER: Have you ever done those things?TRUMP: And women have respect for me. And I will tell you: No, I have not. And I will tell you that Iâm going to make our country safe. Weâre going to have borders in our country, which we donât have now. People are pouring into our country, and theyâre coming in from the Middle East and other places.Weâre going to make America safe again. Weâre going to make America great again, but weâre going to make America safe again. And weâre going to make America wealthy again, because if you donât do that, it just â it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and theyâre taking our wealth.COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: And thatâs what I want to talk about.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?CLINTON: Well, like everyone else, Iâve spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw. You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.Donald Trump is different. I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief. And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing. What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women. And he has said that the video doesnât represent who he is.But I think itâs clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is. Because weâve seen this throughout the campaign. We have seen him insult women. Weâve seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten. Weâve seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter. We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is. But itâs not only women, and itâs not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.So this is who Donald Trump is. And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are. Thatâs why â to go back to your question â I want to send a message â we all should â to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.CLINTON: These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love. And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if Iâm so fortunate enough to become your president.RADDATZ: And we want to get to some questions from onlineâ¦TRUMP: Am I allowed to respond to that? I assume I am.RADDATZ: Yes, you can respond to that.TRUMP: Itâs just words, folks. Itâs just words. Those words, Iâve been hearing them for many years. I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.Iâve heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible. Iâm going to help the African-Americans. Iâm going to help the Latinos, Hispanics. I am going to help the inner cities.Sheâs done a terrible job for the African-Americans. She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later. We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator. She campaigned where the primary part of her campaignâ¦RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump â I want to get to audience questions and online questions.TRUMP: So, sheâs allowed to do that, but Iâm not allowed to respond?RADDATZ: Youâre going to have â youâre going to get to respond right now.TRUMP: Sounds fair.RADDATZ: This tape is generating intense interest. In just 48 hours, itâs become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on Facebook, with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network. As we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media, and our first stays on this topic. Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook, âTrump says the campaign has changed him. When did that happen?â So, Mr. Trump, let me add to that. When you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently? And you have two minutes for this.TRUMP: It was locker room talk, as I told you. That was locker room talk. Iâm not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country. And certainly, Iâm not proud of it. But that was something that happened.If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words, and his was action. His was what heâs done to women. Thereâs never been anybody in the history politics in this nation thatâs been so abusive to women. So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight. One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12. Her client she represented got him off, and sheâs seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.So donât tell me about words. I am absolutely â I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women. Paula Jones, whoâs also here tonight.And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think itâs disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Can we please hold the applause? Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.CLINTON: Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what heâs just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses. He gets to decide what he wants to talk about. Instead of answering peopleâs questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, thatâs his choice.When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high.(APPLAUSE) And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what heâs saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes for anything to anyone.CLINTON: He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq. And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldnât be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, âMexican.âHe never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching. And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America. He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.TRUMP: Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal â heâs another real winner that you have â and heâs the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that. So you really owe him an apology. Youâre the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb. That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.Number two, Michelle Obama. Iâve gotten to see the commercials that they did on you. And Iâve gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials Iâve ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.So, you talk about friend? Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion. And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance. And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.And Iâll tell you what. I didnât think Iâd say this, but Iâm going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it, and weâre going to have a special prosecutor.When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where e-mails â and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.So weâre going to get a special prosecutor, and weâre going to look into it, because you know what? People have been â their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what youâve done. And itâs a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, I want to follow up on that.(CROSSTALK)RADDATZ: Iâm going to let you talk about e-mails.CLINTON:Â â¦ because everything he just said is absolutely false, but Iâm not surprised.TRUMP: Oh, really?CLINTON: In the first debateâ¦(LAUGHTER)RADDATZ: And really, the audience needs to calm down here.CLINTON:Â â¦ I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time. Iâd never get to talk about anything I want to do and how weâre going to really make lives better for people.So, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com. We have literally Trump â you can fact check him in real time. Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect weâll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is â itâs just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.TRUMP: Because youâd be in jail.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Secretary Clintonâ¦COOPER: We want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud. Please do not applaud. Youâre just wasting time.RADDATZ: And, Secretary Clinton, I do want to follow up on e- mails. Youâve said your handing of your e-mails was a mistake. You disagreed with FBI Director James Comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, âextremely careless.â The FBI said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails. You donât call that extremely careless? CLINTON: Well, Martha, first, let me say â and Iâve said before, but Iâll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it â that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account. Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not. Iâm not making any excuses. It was a mistake. And I am very sorry about that.But I think itâs also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others. After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all â anyone who says otherwise has no basis â that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands.I take classified materials very seriously and always have. When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material. Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after bin Laden. So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously. And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands.RADDATZ: OK, weâre going to move on.TRUMP: And yet she didnât know the word â the letter C on a document. Right? She didnât even know what that word â what that letter meant.You know, itâs amazing. Iâm watching Hillary go over facts. And sheâs going after fact after fact, and sheâs lying again, because she said she â you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine. You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails? I donât think so.She said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughterâs wedding, number one, and a yoga class. Well, maybe weâll give three or three or four or five or something. 33,000 e-mails deleted, and now sheâs saying there wasnât anything wrong.And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena. That wasnât before. That was after. She got it from the United States Congress. And Iâll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.Our Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case. But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself. What you did â and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.COOPER: We have to move on.TRUMP: You did that. Wait a minute. One second.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, you can respond, and then we got to move on.RADDATZ: We want to give the audience a chance.TRUMP: If you did that in the private sector, youâd be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, you can respond. Then we have to move on to an audience question.CLINTON: Look, itâs just not true. And so please, go toâ¦TRUMP: Oh, you didnât delete them?COOPER: Allow her to respond, please.CLINTON: It was personal e-mails, not official.TRUMP: Oh, 33,000? Yeah.CLINTON: Not â well, we turned over 35,000, soâ¦TRUMP: Oh, yeah. What about the other 15,000?COOPER: Please allow her to respond. She didnât talk while you talked.CLINTON: Yes, thatâs true, I didnât.TRUMP: Because you have nothing to say.CLINTON: I didnât in the first debate, and Iâm going to try not to in this debate, because Iâd like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.TRUMP: Get off this question.CLINTON: OK, Donald. I know youâre into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way itâs exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you. But letâs at least focusâ¦TRUMP: Letâs see what happensâ¦(CROSSTALK)COOPER: Allow her to respond.CLINTON:Â â¦ on some of the issues that people care about tonight. Letâs get to their questions.COOPER: We have a question here from Ken Karpowicz. He has a question about health care. Ken?TRUMP: Iâd like to know, Anderson, why arenât you bringing up the e-mails? Iâd like to know. Why arenât you bringingâ¦COOPER: We brought up the e-mails.TRUMP: No, it hasnât. It hasnât. And it hasnât been finished at all.COOPER: Ken Karpowicz has a question.TRUMP: Itâs nice to â one on three.QUESTION: Thank you. Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, it is not affordable. Premiums have gone up. Deductibles have gone up. Copays have gone up. Prescriptions have gone up. And the coverage has gone down. What will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better?COOPER: That first one goes to Secretary Clinton, because you started out the last one to the audience.CLINTON: If he wants to start, he can start. No, go ahead, Donald.TRUMP: No, Iâm a gentlemen, Hillary. Go ahead.(LAUGHTER)COOPER: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I think Donald was about to say heâs going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. And Iâm going to fix it, because I agree with you. Premiums have gotten too high. Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and Iâve laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.But hereâs what I donât want people to forget when weâre talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasnât just that 20 million got insurance who didnât have it before. But that in and of itself was a good thing. I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits. Number one, insurance companies canât deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.Number three, women canât be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act. Number four, if youâre under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didnât happen before.So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act. But weâve got to get costs down. Weâve got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance. But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange. And then we would have to start all over again.Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage. Thatâs the highest weâve ever been in our country. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, your time is up.CLINTON: So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.COOPER: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.TRUMP: It is such a great question and itâs maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense. Obamacare is a disaster. You know it. We all know it. Itâs going up at numbers that nobodyâs ever seen worldwide. Nobodyâs ever seen numbers like this for health care.Itâs only getting worse. In â17, it implodes by itself. Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money. We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.Obamacare will never work. Itâs very bad, very bad health insurance. Far too expensive. And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country. Itâs going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored. We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want â and President Obama and whoever was working on it â they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies. We want competition.You will have the finest health care plan there is. She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada. And if you havenât noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow. Itâs catastrophic in certain ways.But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything. Hillary Clinton has been after this for years. Obamacare was the first step. Obamacare is a total disaster. And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobodyâs ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, youâre never going to be able to use it.COOPER: Mr. Trump, your timeâ¦TRUMP: It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, let me follow up with you. Your husband called Obamacare, quote, âthe craziest thing in the world,â saying that small-business owners are getting killed as premiums double, coverage is cut in half. Was he mistaken or was the mistake simply telling the truth?CLINTON: No, I mean, he clarified what he meant. And itâs very clear. Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system. But we have an employer-based system. Thatâs where the vast majority of people get their health care.And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldnât put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid. Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didnât have the money to afford insurance and didnât have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take. And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance. So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donaldâs not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companiesâ¦COOPER: Secretary Clintonâ¦CLINTON:Â â¦ get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, Iâm sorry, youâve got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthmaâ¦COOPER: Your time is up.CLINTON:Â â¦ you may not be able to have insurance because you canât afford it. So letâs fix whatâs broken about it, but letâs not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies. Thatâs not going to work.COOPER: Mr. Trump, let me follow up on this. TRUMP: Well, I just want â just one thing. First of all, Hillary, everythingâs broken about it. Everything. Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment. This is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster.COOPER: Youâve said you want to end Obamacareâ¦TRUMP: By the wayâ¦COOPER: Youâve said you want to end Obamacare. Youâve also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre-existing conditions. How do you force insurance companies to do that if youâre no longer mandating that every American get insurance?TRUMP: Weâre going to be able to. Youâre going to have plansâ¦COOPER: What does that mean?TRUMP: Well, Iâll tell you what it means. Youâre going to have plans that are so good, because weâre going to have so much competition in the insurance industry. Once we break out â once we break out the lines and allow the competition to comeâ¦COOPER: Are you going â are you going to have a mandate that Americans have to have health insurance?TRUMP: President Obama â Anderson, excuse me. President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud. You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said â he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie. President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan. The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesnât work.But when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, weâll also be able to help people that canât get â donât have money because we are going to have people protected.And Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way. Weâre going to block grant into the states. Weâre going to block grant into Medicaid into the statesâ¦COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.TRUMP:Â â¦ so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.RADDATZ: We now go to Gorbah Hamed with a question for both candidates.QUESTION: Hi. There are 3.3 million Muslims in the United States, and Iâm one of them. Youâve mentioned working with Muslim nations, but with Islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over?RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, youâre first.TRUMP: Well, youâre right about Islamophobia, and thatâs a shame. But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that â because there is a problem. I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem. And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on. When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people. Horribly wounded. Theyâll never be the same. Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.And, you know, thereâs always a reason for everything. If they donât do that, itâs a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center. Go outside. Look at Paris. Look at that horrible â these are radical Islamic terrorists.And she wonât even mention the word and nor will President Obama. He wonât use the term âradical Islamic terrorism.â Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name. She wonât say the name and President Obama wonât say the name. But the name is there. Itâs radical Islamic terror. And before you solve it, you have to say the name.RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well, thank you for asking your question. And Iâve heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, thereâs been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims. And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.I want to say just a couple of things. First, weâve had Muslims in America since George Washington. And weâve had many successful Muslims. We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali.CLINTON: My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if youâre willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community. Thatâs what America is. Thatâs what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.Itâs also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims. We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines. Iâve worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America. Iâve met with a lot of them, and Iâve heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and thatâs what I want to see.Itâs also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations. Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans? And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists.We are not at war with Islam. And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are. So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.RADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton.Mr. Trump, in December, you said this. âDonald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our countryâs representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. We have no choice. We have no choice.â Your running mate said this week that the Muslim ban is no longer your position. Is that correct? And if it is, was it a mistake to have a religious test?TRUMP: First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq. Iraq was disaster. So he would have been alive today.The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world. Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands â excuse me. Excuse me..RADDATZ: And why did it morph into that? No, did you â no, answer the question. Do you still believeâ¦ TRUMP: Why donât you interrupt her? You interrupt me all the time.RADDATZ: I do.TRUMP: Why donât you interrupt her?RADDATZ: Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?TRUMP: Itâs called extreme vetting. We are going to areas like Syria where theyâre coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama. People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more. This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.We have enough problems in this country. I believe in building safe zones. I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people. But I donât want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them. We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country.RADDATZ: And, Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about that, because you have asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000 Syrian refugees. We know you want tougher vetting. Thatâs not a perfect system. So why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country?CLINTON: Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us. But there are a lot of refugees, women and children â think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because heâd been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces.There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression. And we need to do our part. We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are. But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, weâre going to ban people based on a religion. How do you do that? We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty. How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county? Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country? And how do we expect to be able to implement those?So I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous. And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.And the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that heâs denied being for the war in Iraq. We have it on tape. The entire press corps has looked at it. Itâs been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.TRUMP: Thatâs not been debunked.CLINTON: So, pleaseâ¦TRUMP: That has not been debunked.CLINTON:Â â¦ go to HillaryClinton.com and you can see it.TRUMP: I was against â I was against the war in Iraq. Has not been debunked. And you voted for it. And you shouldnât have. Well, I just want to sayâ¦RADDATZ: Thereâs been lots of fact-checking on that. Iâd like to move on to an online questionâ¦TRUMP: Excuse me. She just went about 25 seconds over her time.RADDATZ: She did not.TRUMP: Could I just respond to this, please?RADDATZ: Very quickly, please.TRUMP: Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens. When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we donât want them. In some cases, theyâre murderers, drug lords, drug problems. And they donât want them.And Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said thatâs OK, we canât force it into their country. Let me tell you, Iâm going to force them right back into their country. Theyâre murderers and some very bad people.And I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like youâve never seen. Weâre also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip. At a record clip. And it shouldnât be allowed to happen.ICE just endorsed me. Theyâve never endorsed a presidential candidate. The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border. She doesnât. She wants amnesty for everybody. Come right in. Come right over. Itâs a horrible thing sheâs doing. Sheâs got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States. That I can tell you.RADDATZ: Thank you, Mr. Trump. I want to move on. This next question from the public through the Bipartisan Open Debate Coalitionâs online forum, where Americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes. This question involves WikiLeaks release of purported excerpts of Secretary Clintonâs paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, Secretary Clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues. So, two, from Virginia asks, is it OK for politicians to be two-faced? Is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues? Secretary Clinton, your two minutes.CLINTON: Well, right. As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called âLincoln.â It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment. It was principled, and it was strategic.And I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it. And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments. That was a great â I thought a great display of presidential leadership.But, you know, letâs talk about whatâs really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election. And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we donât even know if itâs accurate information, and then they put it out.We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election. And believe me, theyâre not doing it to get me elected. Theyâre doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.RADDATZ: Thank you, Mr. Trump. I want to move on. This next question from the public through the Bipartisan Open Debate Coalitionâs online forum, where Americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes. This question involves WikiLeaks release of purported excerpts of Secretary Clintonâs paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, Secretary Clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues. So, Tu (ph), from Virginia asks, is it OK for politicians to be two-faced? Is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues? Secretary Clinton, your two minutes.CLINTON: Well, right. As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called âLincoln.â It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment. It was principled, and it was strategic.And I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it. And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments. That was a great â I thought a great display of presidential leadership.But, you know, letâs talk about whatâs really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election. And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we donât even know if itâs accurate information, and then they put it out.We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election. And believe me, theyâre not doing it to get me elected. Theyâre doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.CLINTON: Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I donât know the reasons. But we deserve answers. And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he hasâ¦RADDATZ: Weâre going to get to that later. Secretary Clinton, youâre out of time.CLINTON:Â â¦ with the Russians and other foreign powers.RADDATZ: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: Well, I think I should respond, because â so ridiculous. Look, now sheâs blaming â she got caught in a total lie. Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things â WikiLeaks that just came out. And she lied. Now sheâs blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln. Thatâs one that I havenâtâ¦(LAUGHTER)OK, Honest Abe, Honest Abe never lied. Thatâs the good thing. Thatâs the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you. Thatâs a big, big difference. Weâre talking about some difference.But as far as other elements of what she was saying, I donât know Putin. I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example. But I donât know Putin.But I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are â she doesnât know if itâs the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think theyâre trying to tarnish me with Russia. I know nothing about Russia. I know â I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia. I donât deal there. I have no businesses there. I have no loans from Russia.I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office. One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet. But I have no loans with Russia. You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have.Now, the taxes are a very simple thing. As soon as I have â first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. Many of her friends took bigger deductions. Warren Buffett took a massive deduction. Soros, whoâs a friend of hers, took a massive deduction. Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her â took massive deductions.I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. But â but as soon as my routine audit is finished, Iâll release my returns. Iâll be very proud to. Theyâre actually quite great.RADDATZ: Thank you, Mr. Trump.COOPER: We want to turn, actually, to the topic of taxes. We have a question from Spencer Maass. Spencer?QUESTION: Good evening. My question is, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes?COOPER: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.TRUMP: Well, one thing Iâd do is get rid of carried interest. One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code. And she could have done this years ago, by the way. Sheâs a United States â she was a United States senator.She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code. Well, why didnât she change it? Why didnât you change it when you were a senator? The reason you didnât is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do. And I do. You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change. But you wouldnât change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.But â and I say that about a lot of things. You know, Iâve heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years. âI wish you would have done this.â But sheâs been there for 30 years sheâs been doing this stuff. She never changed. And she never will change. She never will change.Weâre getting rid of carried interest provisions. Iâm lowering taxes actually, because I think itâs so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving â massive corporations and little ones, little ones canât form. Weâre getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes.But weâre bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent. Weâre cutting taxes for the middle class. And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class.And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks. You can look at me. Sheâs raising your taxes really high. And what thatâs going to do is a disaster for the country. But she is raising your taxes and Iâm lowering your taxes. That in itself is a big difference. We are going to be thriving again. We have no growth in this country. Thereâs no growth. If China has a GDP of 7 percent, itâs like a national catastrophe. Weâre down at 1 percent. And thatâs, like, no growth. And weâre going lower, in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world. And Iâm bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think itâs so important â one of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybodyâs taxes massively.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes. The question was, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes?CLINTON: Well, everything youâve heard just now from Donald is not true. Iâm sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality. And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasnât paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what heâs going to do.But Iâll tell you what heâs going to do. His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts theyâve ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two. Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift. And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families.Now, hereâs what I want to do. I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year â and thatâs the vast majority of Americans as you know â will have their taxes raised, because I think weâve got to go where the money is. And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes. I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes.I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars. Itâs called the Buffett rule. Yes, Warren Buffett is the one whoâs gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary. I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you. I want to invest in hard-working families. And I think itâs been unfortunate, but itâs happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top. And we need to reverse that.People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.COOPER: Thank you, Secretary.CLINTON: And weâre going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country.COOPER: Thank you. I want to give you â Mr. Trump, I want to give you the chance to respond. I just wanted to tell our viewers what sheâs referring to. In the last month, taxes were the number-one issue on Facebook for the first time in the campaign. The New York Times published three pages of your 1995 tax returns. They show you claimed a $916 million loss, which means you could have avoided paying personal federal income taxes for years. Youâve said you pay state taxes, employee taxes, real estate taxes, property taxes. You have not answered, though, a simple question. Did you use that $916 million loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for years?TRUMP: Of course I do. Of course I do. And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors. I know many of her donors. Her donors took massive tax write-offs.COOPER: So have you (inaudible) personal federal income tax?TRUMP: A lot of my â excuse me, Anderson â a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed. And sheâll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it. Thatâs why.See, I understand the tax code better than anybody thatâs ever run for president. Hillary Clinton â and itâs extremely complex â Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people. But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillaryâs leaving. Very interesting why sheâs leaving carried interest.But I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes. I absolutely used it. And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from. Now, I wonât mention their names, because theyâre rich, but theyâre not famous. So we wonât make them famous.COOPER: So can you â can you say how many years you have avoided paying personal federal income taxes?TRUMP: No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too. But I have a write-off, a lot of itâs depreciation, which is a wonderful charge. I love depreciation. You know, sheâs given it to us.Hey, if she had a problem â for 30 years sheâs been doing this, Anderson. I say it all the time. She talks about health care. Why didnât she do something about it? She talks about taxes. Why didnât she do something about it? She doesnât do anything about anything other than talk. With her, itâs all talk and no action.COOPER: In the pastâ¦TRUMP: And, again, Bernie Sanders, itâs really bad judgment. She has made bad judgment not only on taxes. Sheâs made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq. I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum theyâve left, thatâs why ISIS formed in the first place. They started from that little area, and now theyâre in 32 different nations, Hillary. Congratulations. Great job.COOPER: Secretary â I want you to be able to respond, Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well, here we go again. Iâve been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York. But thatâs not the point here.TRUMP: Why didnât you do it? Why didnât you do it?COOPER: Allow her to respond.CLINTON: Because I was a senator with a Republican president.TRUMP: Oh, really?CLINTON: I will be the president and we will get it done. Thatâs exactly right.TRUMP: You could have done it, if you were an effective â if you were an effective senator, you could have done it. If you were an effective senator, you could have done it. But you were not an effective senator.COOPER: Please allow her to respond. She didnât interrupt you.CLINTON: You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power. Look, he has now said repeatedly, â30 years this and 30 years that.â So let me talk about my 30 years in public service. Iâm very glad to do so.Eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Childrenâs Health Insurance Program. Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system. After 9/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it. Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.When I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for womenâs rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons. Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time. And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.COOPER: Thank you, secretary.CLINTON: Iâve proven that I can, and for 30 years, Iâve produced results for people.COOPER: Thank you, secretary.RADDATZ: Weâre going to move on to Syria. Both of you have mentioned that.TRUMP: She said a lot of things that were false. I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybeâ¦RADDATZ: No, we can â no, Mr. Trump, weâre going to go on. This is about the audience.TRUMP: Excuse me. Because she has been a disaster as a senator. A disaster.RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, weâre going to move on. The heart-breaking video of a 5-year-old Syrian boy named Omran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an air strike in Aleppo focused the worldâs attention on the horrors of the war in Syria, with 136 million views on Facebook alone.But there are much worse images coming out of Aleppo every day now, where in the past few weeks alone, 400 people have been killed, at least 100 of them children. Just days ago, the State Department called for a war crimes investigation of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its ally, Russia, for their bombardment of Aleppo.So this next question comes through social media through Facebook. Diane from Pennsylvania asks, if you were president, what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo? Isnât it a lot like the Holocaust when the U.S. waited too long before we helped? Secretary Clinton, we will begin with your two minutes.CLINTON: Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic. And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left. And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.Russia hasnât paid any attention to ISIS. Theyâre interested in keeping Assad in power. So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones. We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them. And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia. Russia has decided that itâs all in, in Syria. And theyâve also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and itâs not me. Iâve stood up to Russia. Iâve taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, thatâs fine. And I did as secretary of state. Thatâs how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons. Itâs how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot. So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now. But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.RADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Mr. Trump?TRUMP: First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, whichâ¦CLINTON: No, I wasnât. I was gone. I hate to interrupt you, but at some pointâ¦TRUMP: OK. But you were in contact â excuse me. You wereâ¦CLINTON: At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here.TRUMP: You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you. I donât think he would be listening to you very much anymore.Obama draws the line in the sand. It was laughed at all over the world what happened.Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia. But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and theyâve gone wild with their nuclear program. Not good. Our government shouldnât have allowed that to happen. Russia is new in terms of nuclear. We are old. Weâre tired. Weâre exhausted in terms of nuclear. A very bad thing.Now, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad. She talks in favor of the rebels. She doesnât even know who the rebels are. You know, every time we take rebels, whether itâs in Iraq or anywhere else, weâre arming people. And you know what happens? They end up being worse than the people.Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi. Gadhafiâs out. Itâs a mess. And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil. Iâm sure you probably have heard that. It was a disaster. Because the fact is, almost everything sheâs done in foreign policy has been a mistake and itâs been a disaster.But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasnât there, but possibly sheâs consulted. We sign a peace treaty. Everyoneâs all excited. Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps Iâve ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.But look at that deal. Iran now and Russia are now against us. So she wants to fight. She wants to fight for rebels. Thereâs only one problem. You donât even know who the rebels are. So whatâs the purpose?RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, your two minutes is up.TRUMP: And one thing I have to say.RADDATZ: Your two minutes is up.TRUMP: I donât like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS. Russia is killing ISIS. And Iran is killing ISIS. And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy.RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, let me repeat the question. If you were presidentâ¦(LAUGHTER)â¦ what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo? And I want to remind you what your running mate said. He said provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength and that if Russia continues to be involved in air strikes along with the Syrian government forces of Assad, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime.TRUMP: OK. He and I havenât spoken, and I disagree. I disagree.RADDATZ: You disagree with your running mate?TRUMP: I think you have to knock out ISIS. Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS. We have people that want to fight both at the same time. But Syria is no longer Syria. Syria is Russia and itâs Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly.I believe we have to get ISIS. We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved. She had a chance to do something with Syria. They had a chance. And that was the line. And she didnât.RADDATZ: What do you think will happen if Aleppo falls?TRUMP: I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise.RADDATZ: What do you think will happen if it falls?TRUMP: I think that it basically has fallen. OK? It basically has fallen. Let me tell you something. You take a look at Mosul. The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul. They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul. So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.Well, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul. Why canât they do it quietly? Why canât they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that weâve knocked out the leaders, weâve had a tremendous success? People leave. Why do they have to say weâre going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what theyâre saying? How stupid is our country?RADDATZ: There are sometimes reasons the military does that. Psychological warfare.TRUMP: I canât think of any. I canât think of any. And Iâm pretty good at it.RADDATZ: It might be to help get civilians out.TRUMP: And we have General Flynn. And we have â look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me. I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me. We talk about it all the time. They understand, why canât they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership? How â why would these people stay there? Iâve been reading nowâ¦RADDATZ: Tell me what your strategy is.TRUMP:Â â¦ for weeks â Iâve been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that itâs the harbor of where â you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are. Why would they be saying â theyâre not staying there anymore. Theyâre gone. Because everybodyâs talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul.Now, with these 200 admirals and generals, they canât believe it. All I say is this. General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what weâre doing in the Middle East.RADDATZ: Iâm going to go to Secretary Clinton. Secretary Clinton, you want Assad to go. You advocated arming rebels, but it looks like that may be too late for Aleppo. You talk about diplomatic efforts. Those have failed. Cease-fires have failed. Would you introduce the threat of U.S. military force beyond a no-fly zone against the Assad regime to back up diplomacy?CLINTON: I would not use American ground forces in Syria. I think that would be a very serious mistake. I donât think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force. I donât think that is a smart strategy.I do think the use of special forces, which weâre using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me justâ¦RADDATZ: But what would you do differently than President Obama is doing?CLINTON: Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I â if Iâm fortunateâ¦TRUMP: Everything.CLINTON: I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq. I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul. And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals. No, he doesnât.There are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this. And that takes a lot of planning and preparation.I would go after Baghdadi. I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders â and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones â made a difference. So I think that could help.I would also consider arming the Kurds. The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq. And I know thereâs a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.RADDATZ: Thank you very much. Weâre going to move onâ¦TRUMP: You know whatâs funny? She went over a minute over, and you donât stop her. When I go one second over, itâs like a big deal.RADDATZ: You had many answers.TRUMP: Itâs really â itâs really very interesting.COOPER: Weâve got a question over here from James Carter. Mr. Carter?QUESTION: My question is, do you believe you can be a devoted president to all the people in the United States?COOPER: That question begins for Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Absolutely. I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable. I will be a president for all of our people. And Iâll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back.Because NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world. Not in this country. It stripped us of manufacturing jobs. We lost our jobs. We lost our money. We lost our plants. It is a disaster. And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now sheâs for it. She called it the gold standard. And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didnât say it. They actually said that she lied. OK? And she lied. But sheâs lied about a lot of things.TRUMP: I would be a president for all of the people, African- Americans, the inner cities. Devastating whatâs happening to our inner cities. Sheâs been talking about it for years. As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens. She doesnât get it done.Same with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans. The same exact thing. They talk, they donât get it done. You go into the inner cities and â you see itâs 45 percent poverty. African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities. The education is a disaster. Jobs are essentially nonexistent.I mean, itâs â you know, and Iâve been saying at big speeches where I have 20,000 and 30,000 people, what do you have to lose? It canât get any worse. And sheâs been talking about the inner cities for 25 years. Nothingâs going to ever happen.Let me tell you, if sheâs president of the United States, nothingâs going to happen. Itâs just going to be talk. And all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and I would just get it by osmosis. Sheâs not doing any me favors. But by doing all the othersâ favors, sheâs doing me favors.COOPER: Mr. Trump, thank you.TRUMP: But I will tell you, sheâs all talk. It doesnât get done. All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run. Take a look at upstate New York.COOPER: Your two minutes is up. Secretary Clinton, two minutes?TRUMP: It turned out to be a disaster.COOPER: You have two minutes, Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that.Mr. Carter, I have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families. You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Childrenâs Defense Fund. And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years Iâve been in public service. Iâm proud of that. You know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system. I worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that I care very much about. I have worked with Latinos â one of my first jobs in politics was down in south Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote. So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every American feels like he or she has a place in our country.And I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldnât have a place in Donald Trumpâs America. They write me, and one woman wrote me about her son, Felix. She adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler. Heâs 10 years old now. This is the only one country heâs ever known. And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected?You know, children listen to what is being said. To go back to the very, very first question. And thereâs a lot of fear â in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect. Bullying is up. A lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy. A lot of kids are expressing their concerns.So, first and foremost, I will do everything I can to reach out to everybody.COOPER: Your time, Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country. If you donât vote for me, I still want to be your president.COOPER: Your two minutes is up.CLINTON: I want to be the best president I can be for every American.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, your two minutes is up. I want to follow up on something that Donald Trump actually said to you, a comment you made last month. You said that half of Donald Trumpâs supporters are, quote, âdeplorables, racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic.â You later said you regretted saying half. You didnât express regret for using the term âdeplorables.â To Mr. Carterâs question, how can you unite a country if youâve written off tens of millions of Americans?CLINTON: Well, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters. Itâs with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans.And what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, heâs never apologized for. And so I do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said â Iâm proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults. And he is supporting me 100 percent.COOPER: Thank you.CLINTON: Because we talked about what we wanted to do. We might have had some differences, and we had a lot of debatesâ¦COOPER: Thank you, Secretary.TRUMP:Â â¦ but we believed that we could make the country better. And I was proud of that.COOPER: I want to give you a minute to respond.TRUMP: We have a divided nation. We have a very divided nation. You look at Charlotte. You look at Baltimore. You look at the violence thatâs taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C.We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years. We have a divided nation, because people like her â and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart. And when she said deplorables, she meant it. And when she said irredeemable, theyâre irredeemable, you didnât mention that, but when she said theyâre irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse.COOPER: She said some of them are irredeemable.TRUMP: Sheâs got tremendous â sheâs got tremendous hatred. And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and thatâs what youâre getting with her.COOPER: Mr. Trump, let me follow up with you. In 2008, you wrote in one of your books that the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline. You said, if a leader doesnât have it, quote, âhe or she wonât be one for very long.â In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape. Is that the discipline of a good leader?TRUMP: No, there wasnât check out a sex tape. It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.COOPER: You mentioned sex tape.TRUMP: By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 oâclock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi. She said who is going to answer the call at 3 oâclock in the morning? Guess what? She didnât answer it, because when Ambassador Stevensâ¦COOPER: The question is, is that the discipline of a good leader?TRUMP:Â â¦ 600 â wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times. Well, she said she was awake at 3 oâclock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 oâclock in the morning, but I wonât even mention that. But she said sheâll be awake. Whoâs going â the famous thing, weâre going to answer our call at 3 oâclock in the morning. Guess what happened? Ambassador Stevens â Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help. And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, whoâs her friend and not a good guy, by the way. So, you know, she shouldnât be talking about that.Now, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication. I mean, you can like it or not like it. I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people. Itâs a very effective way of communication. So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication. Iâm not un-proud of it, to be honest with you.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, does Mr. Trump have the discipline to be a good leader?CLINTON: No.TRUMP: Iâm shocked to hear that.(LAUGHTER)CLINTON: Well, itâs not only my opinion. Itâs the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress. But itâs in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and itâs not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody. Everybody. African-American incomes went up 33 percent.And itâs not just because I worked with George W. Bush after 9/11, and I was very proud that when I told him what the city needed, what we needed to recover, he said youâve got it, and he never wavered. He stuck with me.And I have worked and I admire President Obama. He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. That was a terrible time for our country.COOPER: We have to move along.CLINTON: Nine million people lost their jobs.RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we have toâ¦CLINTON: Five million homes were lost.RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, weâre moving.CLINTON: And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out. We are back on the right track. He would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of Americans.RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we are moving to an audience question. Weâre almost out of time. We have anotherâ¦ TRUMP: We have the slowest growth since 1929.RADDATZ: Weâre moving to an audience question.TRUMP: It is â our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster.RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton, we want to get to the audience. Thank you very much both of you.(LAUGHTER)We have another audience question. Beth Miller has a question for both candidates.QUESTION: Good evening. Perhaps the most important aspect of this election is the Supreme Court justice. What would you prioritize as the most important aspect of selecting a Supreme Court justice?RADDATZ: We begin with your two minutes, Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Thank you. Well, youâre right. This is one of the most important issues in this election. I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction. And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics. Donald doesnât agree with that.I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we donât always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise. I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a womanâs right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider. And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality. I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.I want a Supreme Court that doesnât always side with corporate interests. I want a Supreme Court that understands because youâre wealthy and you can give more money to something doesnât mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court. And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, theyâve not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices. I think that was a dereliction of duty.I hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people.RADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Thank you. Youâre out of time. Mr. Trump?TRUMP: Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently. And we have a vacancy. I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia. Iâm looking for judges â and Iâve actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.But people that will respect the Constitution of the United States. And I think that this is so important. Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton. Theyâll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents. So important to me.Now, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand. So I will have in my race more than $100 million put in â of my money, meaning Iâm not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like sheâs doing. What I ask is this.So Iâm putting in more than â by the time itâs finished, Iâll have more than $100 million invested. Pretty much self-funding money. Weâre raising money for the Republican Party, and weâre doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so.I ask Hillary, why doesnât â she made $250 million by being in office. She used the power of her office to make a lot of money. Why isnât she funding, not for $100 million, but why donât you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?Itâs $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public. Why arenât you putting some money in? You have a lot of it. Youâve made a lot of it because of the fact that youâve been in office. Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually. So why arenât you putting money into your own campaign? Iâm just curious.CLINTON: Wellâ¦(CROSSTALK)RADDATZ: Thank you very much. Weâre going to get on to one more question.CLINTON: The question was about the Supreme Court. And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment. But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole. COOPER: Thank you.RADDATZ: We have â we have one more question, Mrs. Clinton.CLINTON: We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.COOPER: We have one more question from Ken Bone about energy policy. Ken?QUESTION: What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?COOPER: Mr. Trump, two minutes?TRUMP: Absolutely. I think itâs such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration. Under absolutely siege. The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies. And foreign companies are now coming in buying our â buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil.We are killing â absolutely killing our energy business in this country. Now, Iâm all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera. But we need much more than wind and solar.And you look at our miners. Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business. There is a thing called clean coal. Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country. Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology. We have unbelievable â we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet. So good. Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt.I will bring our energy companies back. Theyâll be able to compete. Theyâll make money. Theyâll pay off our national debt. Theyâll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous. But we are putting our energy companies out of business. We have to bring back our workers.You take a look at whatâs happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies. We have to guard our energy companies. We have to make it possible.The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business. And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what theyâre doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business. Itâs a disgrace.COOPER: Your time is up. Thank you.TRUMP: Itâs an absolute disgrace. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, two minutes.CLINTON: And actually â well, that was very interesting. First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business. Thatâs something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we donât get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.You know, because it sounds like youâre in the business or youâre aware of people in the business â you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent. We are not dependent upon the Middle East. But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices. So the price of oil has been way down. And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right? We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels. And I think thatâs an important transition.Weâve got to remain energy-independent. It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East. We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem. And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.But I also want to be sure that we donât leave people behind. Thatâs why Iâm the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out. A lot of them lost their lives. They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories. I donât want to walk away from them. So weâve got to do something for them.COOPER: Secretary Clintonâ¦CLINTON: But the price of coal is down worldwide. So we have to look at this comprehensively.COOPER: Your time is up.CLINTON: And thatâs exactly what I have proposed. I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.COOPER: Time is up. We have time for one moreâ¦RADDATZ: We haveâ¦COOPER: One more audience question.RADDATZ: Weâve sneaked in one more question, and it comes from Karl Becker.QUESTION: Good evening. My question to both of you is, regardless of the current rhetoric, would either of you name one positive thing that you respect in one another?(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, would you like to go first?CLINTON: Well, I certainly will, because I think thatâs a very fair and important question. Look, I respect his children. His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald. I donât agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that. And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.So I believe that this election has become in part so â so conflict-oriented, so intense because thereâs a lot at stake. This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election. We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake. Itâs one of the most consequential elections that weâve had.And thatâs why Iâve tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president. And thatâs why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, Iâve spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families. And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.RADDATZ: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment. I donât know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great â Iâm very proud of my children. And theyâve done a wonderful job, and theyâve been wonderful, wonderful kids. So I consider that a compliment.I will say this about Hillary. She doesnât quit. She doesnât give up. I respect that. I tell it like it is. Sheâs a fighter. I disagree with much of what sheâs fighting for. I do disagree with her judgment in many cases. But she does fight hard, and she doesnât quit, and she doesnât give up. And I consider that to be a very good trait.RADDATZ: Thanks to both of you.COOPER: We want to thank both the candidates. We want to thank the university here. This concludes the town hall meeting. Our thanks to the candidates, the commission, Washington University, and to everybody who watched.RADDATZ: Please tune in on October 19th for the final presidential debate that will take place at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Good night, everyone.
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/17/gary-johnson/gary-johnson-correct-most-americans-support-legali/	"""Most Americans support"" the legalization of marijuana."	true	['Drugs', 'Marijuana', 'Polls and Public Opinion']	https://medium.com/	https://medium.com/@GovGaryJohnson/theres-another-choice-5d1f14b742d5#.gsyzpehxp	2016/08/17	Two-term Governor of New Mexico and 2016 Libertarian candidate for PresidentAug 5, 2016Thereâs anotherÂ choiceWhen it comes to electing their next president, Americans want a candidate to vote for â not just someone to vote against.American voters want the perspective of an outsider who can bring an entrepreneurial perspective to the White House. They arenât opposed to experience in governing â so long as it doesnât bring with it an addiction to crony capitalism and the fruits thereof.And they want a candidate who looks after American interests and doesnât use war to destabilize already volatile regions of the world like the Middle East.Iâm running for President to offer that alternative. I am a successful businessman, and grew my construction business to employ more than 1,000 workers.I was the Republican governor of the heavily Democratic state of New Mexico. I focused on good government and I got it done â just like my running mate, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld. The people of New Mexico reelected me by a comfortable margin. Ditto for Weld.Think of it this way: Iâm someone you would trust to run your household and to keep it safe while you went away on a trip or a vacation. I could even fix a few things around the house. After all, the construction company I founded began as a one-man handy-man operation. Can you say the same for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?Iâve balanced budgets and cut taxes. Iâve also spoken my mind about where the country needed to go on personal freedoms and marriage equality. In 1999, I became the only sitting governor to publicly advocate the legalization of marijuana. Senator Bernie Sanders came to that viewpoint â a position that most Americans support â 16 years later.Iâm also a strong believer in our Constitutional rights to civil liberties and privacy. Our government should not be spying on the electronic communications of American citizens. Nor should our iPhones or Android devices be subject to unreasonable searches and seizures.And I understand that, as a nation and as a society, we have unfinished business to right the wrongs of injustice suffered by minorities. Blacks are 30 percent more likely that white to be apprehended by the police; they are three times more likely to be searched; they are arrested twice as often as whites; and they are 75 percent more likely to be charged with offenses carrying mandatory minimum sentences.It is not surprising that there is tangible mistrust, tension and frustration between the police and African-Americans, particularly black males. We need to speak honestly about these issues in order to address them. Letâs be honest. We have healing to do.One of the biggest concerns that many voters have with both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, but particularly with Ms. Clinton, is the sense that she uses government power to advance her personal and political interests.She is the very status quo. Americans want that changed. She talks about progressivism, but lines her bank accounts with speaking fees from banks and special interests. Thatâs what crony capitalism is all about. Americans recognize pay-to-play when they see it, and they are really, really weary of it.Having been governor of New Mexico, I know that legislation gets passed to benefit those who have money and influence. Then they buy more money and influence. Thatâs one reason why, as governor, I vetoed more than 750 bills and thousands of line items.I did it to keep crony capitalism away from government.Another big difference between Hillary Clinton and myself is that Iâm for our national tradition of peace, commerce and honest friendship with all nations â while being extremely skeptical of committing ourselves and our armed forces to foreign conflicts.As a Senator, she endorsed ill-advised foreign interventions. As Secretary of State, she was the architect of tragic and counter-productive policies in Libya, in Egypt and in Syria. These should not be Americaâs wars, and we ought not be prompting regime changes that serve only to replace bad actors with even worse actors and instability that makes us less safe.Instead, our nation need the confidence that its president will be predictable, yes, but also skeptical of engaging in international shenanigans all around the world.Americans can find sanity and principle by voting Johnson/Weld in 2016.Originally published at thehill.com on August 5, 2016.

They are so scared, that they are proposing changes to legislative maps which heavily favor Republicans over the people of Wisconsin. Working families voices will be silenced under the proposed maps. They are rigged so that when the people of Wisconsin reclaim their democracy in the August recall elections Republicans will be able to sneak back into office in 2012 via GOP favored districts. Just take a look. These maps are so ludicrous that Nancy Nusbaum (D) and Fred Clark (D) wont even be in their districts anymore if the changes go through. They cut off Nancys house from her district by half a block! They are so scared of Sandy Pasch (D) that they went out of their way to add more Republican voters to her seat. They know they can't beat Bob Wirch (D) so they removed him entirely from his district.Stop the power grab. Raise your voice. Sign the petition for fair and balanced redistricting map that gives a voice to all Wisconsinites. Tell Legislators they need to get back to the real issues creating good jobs and a fair economy for Wisconsin.Union-busting Legislators are proving they will stop at nothing to consolidate their power and silence the voice of the taxpaying middle class. Instead of doing their job and listening to their constituents, Scott Walkers GOP lemmings are changing the game and rigging the rules so they cant be held accountable for their own actions. Despicably, this major policy change is being rushed through in an extraordinary session before recalls can take place. Extraordinary sessions are rarely used, until now. The rules are different. Debate is limited and democracy is circumvented. This is an unprecedented power grab and the time to speak out is now. Redistricting happens once every ten years. The next time the lines are redrawn will be after the 2020 Census. This issue is the heart of who represents you in Madison and in Washington for a decade to come.Stand up and be heard. Sign the petition for a non-partisan district map. Wisconsin needs to focus on good jobs and a better economy,not partisan redistricting.

Tonight, eight contenders will be on this stage to try to convince voters he or she is the best choice to hold the highest office in the country. And joining them inside this hall, Tea Party activists from Florida and across the nation. I'm Wolf Blitzer. I'd like to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world, including U.S. troops and their families watching overseas. Tonight's debate is airing on CNN, CNN International, CNN en Espanol, and the American Forces Network seen on U.S. military bases in 175 countries and aboard Navy ships at sea around the globe. We also want to welcome our co-sponsors, the Tea Party Express, and more than 100 state and local Tea Party groups from across the United States. Members of the Tea Party movement will play an active role in this debate. We'll take questions from here in Florida, one of the most critical battleground states in the nation. We'll also take questions from Tea Party activists in three other key states. Watch parties are under way right now in Portsmouth, Virginia, an historic Navy port and a 2012 election battleground. In Phoenix, Arizona, the western states shaping the national debate over immigration. And in Cincinnati, Ohio, the Midwestern swing state that has been decisive in so many elections. BLITZER: It's time now to meet the 2012 Republican presidential contenders. (APPLAUSE) Joining us now on stage, the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, Rick Santorum. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: The former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Texas Congressman Ron Paul. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Texas Governor Rick Perry. (APPLAUSE) Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. (APPLAUSE) ROMNEY: Hey, guys. Hi. BLITZER: Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann. (APPLAUSE) The former president and CEO of Godfather's Pizza, Herman Cain. (APPLAUSE) And the former governor of Utah, Jon Huntsman. (APPLAUSE) Ladies and gentlemen, the Republican candidates for president of the United States. (APPLAUSE) Ladies and gentlemen, please rise now and join recording artist Diana Nagy as she leads us in the national anthem. DIANA NAGY, RECORDING ARTIST: (SINGS ""STAR-SPANGLED BANNER"" BLITZER: Diana Nagy, thanks very, very much. Candidates, please take your podiums. And while you do, I want to tell all of our viewers, everyone here a little bit more about how this debate will work. I, obviously, will be the moderator. I'll ask questions and follow-ups, and I'll work to try my best to make sure that each candidate is getting his or her fair share of the questions and the answer time. And as I mentioned, the tea party activists will be asking questions here in the hall, as well as from our remote sites. And, viewers, you, too, can participate. We're accepting questions for the candidates on Twitter -- make sure to include #cnnteaparty -- on Facebook and, of course, on cnnpolitics.com. Each candidate will have about one minute to answer questions and 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals. I'll make sure that each candidate gets the time to respond if they are singled out for specific criticism. It's important that the American public knows where the candidates agree on the substantive issues and where they disagree. We want everyone watching to emerge from this debate more informed about these eight people, who each want to become the president of the United States. Now that the candidates are all in place, it's time for the candidates to introduce themselves to our audience. I'm asking them all to keep it very, very short. Here's an example of what I have in mind. I'm Wolf Blitzer, and I'm usually in ""The Situation Room,"" but tonight I'm thrilled to be at the Tea Party Republican presidential debate. (APPLAUSE) Governor Huntsman, we'll begin with you. FORMER GOV. JON HUNTSMAN JR., (R-UT.), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Wolf, delighted to be here. Yesterday, we were reminded how extraordinary this country is when we pull together during a time of need. Today, ladies and gentlemen, we are deeply divided. I believe I have the experience and the leadership necessary to move this country forward. HERMAN CAIN, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm Herman Cain. I am the only non-politician on this stage tonight, and I believe that America has become a nation of crises. That's why I want to be president of the United States of America. BACHMANN: My name is Michele Bachmann. I know we can do so much better in this country. That's why I'm the chief author of the bill to repeal Dodd-Frank, the bill to repeal Obamacare. And that's why I brought the voice of the Tea Party to the United States Congress as the founder of the Tea Party Caucus. (APPLAUSE) ROMNEY: My name is Mitt Romney. And like you, I recognize that America's economy is in crisis. Got a lot of people without work, and a lot of people wonder whether the future is going to be brighter for their kids. I spent my life in the private sector. I understand how jobs come to America and why they go. And I want to use that experience to get America growing again, adding jobs, and assuring every citizen that they know that their kid and their grandkid will have a brighter future. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) PERRY: I'm Governor Rick Perry. And I'm proud to be here today with the Tea Party Express. And I simply want to get America working again and make Washington, D.C., as inconsequential in your life as I can. (APPLAUSE) REP. RON PAUL, (R-TX.), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm Congressman Ron Paul, a congressman from Texas. I've been in the Congress for 20 years. My goal has always been to promote the cause of liberty and to obey the Constitution. I plan to do that as president, as well. FORMER REP. NEWT GINGRICH, (R-GA.), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm Newt Gingrich. I think it is totally appropriate that we're having this particular debate on 9/12. And in the spirit of 9/12, I hope to work with you to fundamentally, profoundly change Washington in what will be a long and difficult struggle against the forces of reaction and special interests. (APPLAUSE) FORMER SEN. RICK SANTORUM, (R-PA.), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm Rick Santorum. I'm a former two-term senator from a state that has over a million more registered Democrats than Republicans, and I won two elections there without having to change my policies or my party to win. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Ladies and gentlemen, the eight Republican presidential candidates. (APPLAUSE) All right. Let's -- let's start off here in Tampa. We have a Tea Party activist. Please identify yourself and ask your question. QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) Tea Party, Jacksonville, Florida. My question: How will you convince senior citizens that Social Security and Medicare need to be changed and get their vote? BLITZER: Good question. Let me begin with Michele Bachmann. Congresswoman, how do you do that? How do you go ahead and change, reform Social Security, Medicare, while at the same time getting votes? BACHMANN: Well, one thing that we need to let senior citizens know is, for those who are currently on the Social Security system, the United States government made a promise to senior citizens, and we have to keep that promise to them. But we also need to know that for those who are not yet on the system, the system simply has to be reformed in order for it to work. The same goes with Medicare. We know that President Obama stole over $500 billion out of Medicare to switch it over to Obamacare. We also know that Medicare hospital trust fund will be bankrupt within nine years. These are programs that need to be saved to serve people, and in their current form, they can't. So we need to have someone who understands these programs, who -- who understands the solutions to these programs. I'm a person that's had feet in the private sector and a foot in the federal government. I've been there long enough to know the problems, but not long enough to become a part of the system. I know what to do, and I have the core of conviction to be able to make the changes that senior citizens can count on. BLITZER: Governor Perry, speaking of Social Security, you've said in the past it's a Ponzi scheme, an absolute failure, unconstitutional, but today you wrote an article in USA Today saying it must be saved and reformed, very different tone. Why? PERRY: Well, first off, the people who are on Social Security today need to understand something. Slam-dunk guaranteed, that program is going to be there in place for those. Those individuals that are moving towards being on Social Security, that program's going to be there for them when they arrive there. But the idea that we have not had the courage to stand up and look Americans in the face, young mid-career professionals or kids that are my children's age and look them in the eye and said, listen, this is a broken system. It has been called a ponzi scheme by many people long before me. But no one's had the courage to stand up and say, here is how we're going to reform it. We're going to transform it for those in those mid-career ages, but we're going to fix it so that our young Americans that are going out into the workforce today will know without a doubt that there were some people who came along that didn't lie to them, that didn't try to go around the edges and told them the truth. BLITZER: Governor Romney, you said that Governor Perry's position on Social Security is, quote, unacceptable and could even obliterate the Republican Party. Are you saying he could not, as Republican nominee, beat Barack Obama? ROMNEY: No, what I'm saying is that what he just said, I think most people agree with, although the term ponzi scheme I think is over the top and unnecessary and frightful to many people. But the real issue is in writing his book, Governor Perry pointed out that in his view that Social Security is unconstitutional, that this is not something the federal government ought to be involved in, that instead it should be given back to the states. And I think that view, and the view that somehow Social Security has been forced on us over the past 70 years that by any measure, again quoting book, by any measure Social Security has been a failure, this is after 70 years of tens of millions of people relying on Social Security, that's a very different matter. So the financing of Social Security, we've all talked about at great length. In the last campaign four years around, John McCain said it was bankrupt. I put in my book a series of proposals on how to get it on sound financial footing so that our kids can count on it not just our current seniors. But the real question is does Governor Perry continue to believe that Social Security should not be a federal program, that it's unconstitutional and it should be returned to the states or is he going to retreat from that view? BLITZER: Let's let Governor Perry respond. You have 30 seconds. PERRY: If what you're trying to say is that back in the '30s and the '40s that the federal government made all the right decision, I disagree with you. And it's time for us to get back to the constitution and a program that's been there 70 or 80 years, obviously we're not going to take that program away. But for people to stand up and support what they did in the '30s or what they're doing in the 2010s is not appropriate for America. ROMNEY: But the question is, do you still believe that Social Security should be ended as a federal program as you did six months ago when your book came out and returned to the states or do you want to retreat from taht? PERRY: I think we ought to have a conversation. ROMNEY: We're having that right now, governor. We're running for president. PERRY: And I'll finish this conversation. But the issue is, are there ways to move the states into Social Security for state employees or for retirees? We did in the state of Texas back in the 1980s. I think those types of thoughtful conversations with America, rather than trying to scare seniors like you're doing and other people, it's time to have a legitimate conversation in this country about how to fix that program where it's not bankrupt and our children actually know that there's going to be a retirement program there for them. ROMNEY: Governor, the term ponzi scheme is what scared seniors, number one. And number two, suggesting that Social Security should no longer be a federal program and returned to the states and unconstitutional is likewise frightening. Look, there are a lot of bright people who agree with you. And that's your view. I happen to have a different one. I think that Social Security is an essential program that we should change the way we're funding it. You called it a criminal... PERRY: You said if people did it in the private sector it would be called criminal. That's in your book. ROMNEY: Yeah, what I said was... (APPLAUSE) ROMNEY: Governor Perry you've got to quote me correctly. You said it's criminal. What I said was congress taking money out of the Social Security trust fund is like criminal and that is and it's wrong. BLITZER: Congressman Paul, let me expand this conversation. Do you agree with Governor Perry that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme? PAUL: Well, I agree that Social Security is broke. We spent all the money and it's on its last legs unless we do something. One bill that I had in congress never got passed was to prevent the congress from spending any of that money on the wars and all the nonsense that we do around the world. Now the other thing that I would like to see done is a transition. I think it's terrible that the Social Security system is in the -- the problems it has, but if people wouldn't have spent the money we would be OK. Now, what I would like to do is to allow all the young people to get out of Social Security and go on their own. Now, the big question is, is how would the funding occur? BLITZER: All right. Hold that thought for a minute, because I want Herman Cain to get involved. Are you with Governor Perry that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme? CAIN: I don't care what you call it, it's broken. And here's my solution. (APPLAUSE) CAIN: Start with optional personal retirement accounts. In 1981, the Galveston County employees, they opted out because that was a very short window of opportunity. They took it. Today, when people retire in Galveston County, Texas, they retire making at least 50 percent more than they would ever get out of Social Security. (APPLAUSE) Secondly, allow younger workers to have personal retirement accounts as an option. Now, to answer this gentleman's question, current seniors will not be affected. It's to give the option to the younger workers. The Galveston County model worked, and it also worked in the small country of Chile. Instead of giving it to the states, let's give it back to the workers. That's what personal retirement accounts will do. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Governor Huntsman, when it comes to reforming Social Security, is anything from your perspective off the table? HUNTSMAN: I don't think anything should be off the table except maybe some of the drama that's playing out here on this floor today. I mean, to hear these two go at it over here, it's almost incredible. You've got Governor Romney, who called it a fraud in his book ""No Apology."" I don't know if that was written by Kurt Cobain or not. And then you've got Governor Perry, who is calling this a Ponzi scheme. All I know, Wolf, is that we're frightening the American people who just want solutions. And this party isn't going to win in 2012 unless we get our act together and fix the problem. We all know that we've got entitlement problems, we've got Medicare, we've got Social -- the fixes are there. I mean, the Ryan plan is there, for heaven's sake. We've got the answers. We don't have leadership. That's the problem. BLITZER: Speaker Gingrich, would you raise the retirement age for Social Security recipients? GINGRICH: No, not necessarily, but let me start with -- I'm not particularly worried about Governor Perry and Governor Romney frightening the American people when President Obama scares them every single day. (APPLAUSE) GINGRICH: This is eating into my time. Let me just say to all of you -- BLITZER: Let me just pinpoint the question. What would you do to fix Social Security? GINGRICH: OK. But can I also expand for a second? Because that was not a rhetorical joke. President Obama twice said recently he couldn't guarantee delivering the checks to Social Security recipients. Now, why should young people who are 16 to 25 years old have politicians have the power for the rest of their life to threaten to take away their Social Security? (APPLAUSE) GINGRICH: Now, I just want to make two simple points about Social Security and how you save it. The first is, you get back to a full employment economy, and at four percent unemployment you have such a huge increase in funding, that you change every single out year (ph) of projection in a positive way. The second is you say precisely as several folks here have said it, if you are younger -- everybody who is older and wants to be totally protected, fine, no change. So don't let anybody lie to you, starting with the president. No change. But if you're younger and you would like a personal account, you would control instead of the politicians. And you know you'll have more money at the end of your lifetime if you control it than the politicians. Why shouldn't you have the right to choose? BLITZER: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Senator Santorum, when it comes to Social Security, are you with Governor Romney or Governor Perry? SANTORUM: Well, the question is who is with me? Because I've been out here talking about -- you want to talk about courage to tell the truth, Governor? I was out in 1994 running against a Democratic incumbent in a campaign managed by James Carville, and I went out and talked about Social Security reform. Why? Because I knew this day was coming. And I had the courage to go out and say Social Security is in trouble. And I told a group of young people at La Salle University that we needed to do something like raising the retirement age. They ran that on TV for three weeks prior to the election, in the second oldest per capita state in the country. And I still won the election. Why? Because the people of Pennsylvania wanted someone who had the courage to tell them the truth. (APPLAUSE) SANTORUM: And I had the courage to tell them the truth. And what I've done since I was in the United States Senate is every year I proposed -- I went, in fact, with Bill Clinton in 1997 on the first bipartisan Social Security town hall meeting, and I was the spokesperson, a Republican conservative from a blue state out there leading the charge on Social Security. You folks want someone with courage? I've got a track record of courage and a track record of concrete proposals on how to fix this, among some of the things that have been discussed here tonight. BLITZER: Senator, thank you. Let's go to another question. We have a question now from the audience. Go ahead. Identify yourself. DR. BRIDGET MELSON, PLEASANTON TEA PARTY: Hi. My name is Dr. Bridget Melson with the Pleasanton Tea Party. Good to be here. My question for you is, what is your plan to balance the budget and get this spending under control so that my children's share of the debt is erased without compromising my retired mother's already tenuous financial future? BLITZER: Good question. Let me ask Speaker Gingrich to respond, and I'll sort of paraphrase it. How do you do that? How do you protected seniors, balance the budget? So much of the budget goes to defense and entitlements like Social Security, Medicare. GINGRICH: But that's just a Washington mythology. And anybody who knows anything about the federal government knows that there's such an enormous volume of waste, that if you simply had a serious all-all effort to modernize the federal government, you would have hundreds of billions of dollars of savings falling off. Let me say, I helped balance the budget for four straight years. This is not a theory. Rick and I were working together on this. This is not a theory. You voted for it. So we can balance the federal budget. But let me start with -- all of you should go to Strong America Now, which is a group that believes if you modernize the federal government, you save $500 billion a year. Now, check and see whether the super committee of 12 in their august power is willing to sit down with that group and actually learn how to be smart rather than cheap, and actually modernize the federal government. One example, the federal government is such a bad manager of money, that somewhere between $70 billion and $120 billion a year in Medicare and Medicaid is paid to crooks. We wrote a book several years ago called ""Stop Paying the Crooks."" I thought it was pretty obvious even for Washington. So I would start to balance the budget by stop paying the crooks, not by cheating honest Americans. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Senator Santorum, staying on the issue of spending, budget deficits, you voted for the prescription drug benefits for seniors when you were in the United States Senate costing about $1 trillion. If you had to do it over again, you wouldn't vote for that, but if you were president of the United States, would you repeal prescription drug benefits for seniors under Medicare? SANTORUM: I think we have to keep a prescription drug component, but we have to pay for it. In other words, we have to have a program that is funded. Now, the reason that that program has actually worked well is it's come in 40 percent under budget because it's a program that uses private sector insurance, not government-run, one-size-fits-all health care. If we do that for the rest of Medicare, which is what the Ryan proposal suggests, and something that I proposed, again, years ago, had the courage to go out and lead on this issue, then we would be able to have a prescription drug program and we'd be able to have Medicare that you choose. The idea that unless we have a government-run, one-size-fits-all Medicare program, that that's throwing grandma off a cliff, is Washington think -- is people who think in Washington this president, who believes that they know better than you how to run your life and how to purchase your health care. I trust you, I trust the American people. That is the greatness of our country. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Thank you, Senator. Governor Perry, it was President Bush who pushed for prescription drug benefits for senior, not President Obama. It was President Bush who pushed for prescription drug benefits for seniors. The question to you: If you were president -- it's not a difficult question -- would you vote to eliminate, to repeal those prescription drug benefits for seniors under Medicare? PERRY: No. It's a $17 trillion hole that we have in our budget we've got to deal with. And I think that's the issue of, how do you find the savings and still deliver the services? For instance, in the state of Texas, we combined a substantial amount of our health and human services from 10 down to five agencies. We put an Office of Inspector General into place, and we saved over $5.3 billion, Newt, just by finding the waste and the fraud in Texas state government. I'm thinking there might be more waste and fraud in the federal government than even there is in the Texas government. BLITZER: But, Governor, just to be precise, if you were president, you wouldn't repeal prescription drug benefits for seniors under Medicare? PERRY: That's what I said when I started the conversation. BLITZER: OK. Just want to be precise on that, Governor. Governor Romney, what about you? ROMNEY: I wouldn't repeal it. I'd reform Medicare and reform Medicaid and reform Social Security to get them on a sustainable basis, not for current retirees, but for those in their 20s and 30s and early 50s. But the key to balancing the budget -- and we talk about all the waste in government and the inefficiency. And having spent 25 years in business, I know something about taking waste out of enterprises. I'd love to do that to the federal government. And there is massive waste. But we're not going to balance the budget just by pretending that all -- all we have to do is take out the waste. We're going to have to cut spending. And I'm in favor of cutting spending, capping federal spending as a percentage of GDP, at 20 percent or less, and having a balanced budget amendment. That's essential to rein in the scale of the federal government. And there's a second part to balancing the budget, and that's growing the economy again. And that's why I laid out a plan to restructure the foundation of America's economy to start creating jobs again so people are paying taxes, businesses are paying taxes, not because we're raising the rates, but because we're growing the economy. The right answer for America is to stop the growth of the federal government and to start the growth of the private sector. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Congressman Paul, what about you? Would you repeal it? PAUL: Well, we shouldn't have never started it. I voted against it. But that sure wouldn't be on my high list. I would find a lot of cuts a lot of other places. As a matter of fact, on Social Security, it is already being reformed, because the cost of living increases aren't there, so the value is going down. So, no, there's places we should cut. And we cut -- we spend -- and I'm not sure I can get anybody to agree with me on here -- on this panel, but we spend $1.5 trillion overseas in wars that we don't need to be in and we need to cut there... (APPLAUSE) ... and then put this money back into our economy here. And that is the only way to achieve it. Then it still wouldn't be enough in order to get some people out. What we need to do is cut the Department of Education, the Department of Energy, and all these departments, and get rid of them. (APPLAUSE) Then we can do it. BLITZER: We're going to get to national security. Don't worry. Congresswoman Bachmann, what about you? BACHMANN: I think that the principle has to change, because for years, politicians have run on the idea that government is going to buy people more stuff and that the federal government would be taking care of people's prescription drugs, their retirement, their health care, their housing, their food. We're the everybody else that's paying for the freight for all of these things. That's the principle that has to change, because we have to now recognize that, going forward... (APPLAUSE) ... this isn't going to work anymore. We have to be an ownership society, where individual responsibility, personal responsibility once again becomes the animating American principle. And we can't be ashamed of that. BLITZER: All right, we've got a lot more to discuss. We're only just beginning. I want to take a quick break. I want our viewers out there to know they can weigh in, they can respond. Go to Twitter, Facebook, cnn.com. We want to hear from you if you have questions for these eight Republican presidential candidates. You'll have an opportunity to get some questions to them. We're going to talk about jobs, jobs, jobs when we come back. (APPLAUSE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BLITZER: Welcome back to CNN Tea Party Republican presidential debate. We've got a question from Portsmouth, Virginia. Please identify yourself. Go ahead. QUESTION: Good evening. My name is Sandra Jones (ph) from Yorktown, Virginia. My question is, what would you do to get the economy moving forward? Do you have a plan? And, if so, what is it? BLITZER: All right, good question. Let's ask Governor Huntsman. The first thing you would do as president of the United States, knowing, of course, that President Obama today formally gave legislation to Congress with his jobs plan? HUNTSMAN: Let us recognize, first and foremost, that what we're seeing playing out in America is a human tragedy. We have millions and millions who are unemployed, millions beyond who are so dispirited they've completely given up trying to find a job. We've got moms and dads and families that have been economically shipwrecked. And it's a great American tragedy that we're watching play out. I have put forward a program that I want all of you to understand is basically patterned after what I did as governor. I think when you look at everybody on the stage here, all you have to do is say, where have they been and what have they done? First and foremost, I want to reform this tax code. I put forward a program that the Wall Street Journal has come out and endorsed. It basically calls for stripping out the loopholes and the deductions and lowering the rates for individuals, cleaning out corporate welfare and subsidies on the corporate side and lowering the rate, leaving us a whole lot more competitive for the 21st century. That's the first item of business I'd drop on the doorstep of Congress. Second is regulatory reform, because we cannot go forward with Obamacare. (APPLAUSE) We cannot go forward with Dodd-Frank, because businesses in this country are saying there's no predictability, there's no ability to see around the bend, we don't know what costs are going to be, we're not hiring and bringing new people on. Third, this country needs to wean itself from its heroin-like addiction to foreign oil. We need energy independence desperately in this country. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Thank you, Governor. Governor Perry, the president in his new plan has a lot of tax cuts, payroll tax cuts, middle-class tax cuts, tax credits for hiring veterans, tax credits for hiring long-term unemployed people. Are those things you would support? PERRY: And he's going to pay for them all with raising your taxes. That is the issue. He had $800 billion worth of stimulus in the first round of stimulus. It created zero jobs, $400-plus billion dollars in this package. And I can do the math on that one. Half of zero jobs is going to be zero jobs. (LAUGHTER) This president does not understand how to free up the small businessmen and women or, for that matter, Wall Street. You give people the opportunity to risk their capital by lowering the tax burden on them, by lowering the regulatory climate, and you will see an American economy that takes off like a rocket ship. And that's what we need to be focusing on in this country, freeing up the small businessmen and women to do what they know how to do, which is risk their capital and give them half a chance to have an opportunity to have a return on that investment, and they will go risk their capital. That's what the president of the United States needs to do: Quit the spending. Give clear regulatory relief and reform the tax code. BLITZER: So just to be precise, Governor, whenever the president supports tax cuts, that has to be balanced with spending cuts? PERRY: I would suggest to you that people are tired of spending money we don't have on programs we don't want. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Congresswoman Bachmann, I'm going to bring Mr. Cain in, in a moment, but the Bush tax cuts in 2001 and 2003, which went across the board, were not offset with spending cuts, and as a result, potentially, a lot of economists think, the deficit went up and up and up. BACHMANN: Well, there's a reason why the deficit went up and up and up. When you have a trillion dollars worth of spending that you don't pay for, it's going to go up. And now we're seeing again that the president wants to do more of the same. I was the leading voice in the wilderness of Washington all summer. I was one of the only people in Washington that said do not raise the debt ceiling. Don't give the president of the United States another $2.4 trillion blank check. You've got to draw the line in the sand somewhere and say no more out of control spending. The president wanted to borrow money from countries like China to pay it back for a stimulus. We've got $1.2 trillion already that's been earned by American countries overseas. If we have a 0 percent tax rate, Wolf, we can bring that 1.2 trillion -- it's called repatriation -- bring that in. You'd have 1.2 trillion flooded into the system, then pass the free trade agreements so that we can move the economy, permanently lower the tax code. I'm a federal tax lawyer. I know how to do that. Repeal Dodd-Frank, repeal Obamacare. It really isn't that tough if you try. It is easy to turn around this economy, just have the backbone to do it. BLITZER: Mr. Cain? CAIN: Yes. This economy is on life support. I don't want - we need a bold solution, not one that tinkers around the edges, not one that allows politicians to continue to pick winners and losers. I believe we throw out the entire tax code and put in my nine nine nine plan. nine nine nine. A 9 percent business flat tax, a 9 percent personal income tax and a 9 national sales tax. Now I've been told by some people, well, you can't get that done. I say why? Well, because you don't know how Washington works. Yes, I do. It doesn't. The American people are ready to do something bold. We need a bold solution in order to get this economy growing at the maximum rate. I agree with many of the others up here who say, you get the government out of the way. American entrepreneurship, American businesses, they will create the jobs if we provide some certainty. BLITZER: Governor Romney, you know Governor Perry as governor of Texas created more jobs in Texas than any other state. ROMNEY: Terrific state, no question about that. Some wonderful things that Texas has going for it that the nation could learn from. zero income tax. That's a pretty good thing. Right to work state. Republican legislature, Republican supreme court. By the way, a lot of oil as well. We're an energy rich nation. We're living like an energy poor nation. I spent my life in the private sector. I've competed with companies around the world. I've learned something about how it is that economies grow. It's not just simple wave a wand and everything gets better. No, you have to make some structural changes. The world has changed. What's happened over the last 20, 30 years is we've gone from a pay phone world to a smartphone world and President Obama keeps jamming quarters into the pay phone thinking things are going to get better. It's not connected, Mr. President. And if we're going to get this economy going, we've got seven, one, make our tax code competitive with the world. Two, get regulations to work to encourage enterprise. Three, to make sure we have trade policies that work for us not just for the other guys. Four is to have energy security in this country by developing our energy resources. Five so execute the rule of law, which is to stop the Boeing decision that the NLRB put in place. Six is to make sure that we have institutions that create fantastic human capital. And finally number seven is to balance the budget. People won't invest here unless they have confidence here. And that's what I'll do. BLITZER: And just to get back to the question. So does Governor Perry deserve any credit for all those jobs that were created in Texas? ROMNEY: Oh, sure. BLITZER: Go ahead and tell him how much credit he deserves. (LAUGHTER) ROMNEY: Well, look, I think Governor Perry would agree with me that if you're dealt four aces that doesn't make you necessarily a great poker player. And four aces -- and the four aces that are terrific aces are the ones the nation should learn from, the ones I described, zero income tax, low regulation, right to work state, oil in the ground and a Republican legislature. Those things are terrific. And by the way, there has been great growth in Texas. Under Ann Richards, job growth was under 2.5 percent a year, under George Bush was 3 percent a year, under Rick Perry it's been 1 percent a year. Those are all good numbers. Those are all good numbers. But Texas is a great state. And I'll tell you, if you think that the country is like Texas going swimmingly well, then somebody who has done that is just terrific. But if you think the the country needs a turnaround, that's what I do. BLITZER: All right. Governor Perry, you were dealt four aces. PERRY: Well, I was going to say Mitt you were doing pretty good until you got to talking poker. But the fact is the state of Texas has led the nation. While the current resident of the White House is overseeing the loss of 2.5 million jobs, Texas during my period of governor has created over a million jobs. And we did that during some pretty tough economic period. (APPLAUSE) PERRY: One of the things that's really important, one of the things that the Fed Reserve chairman said was the most powerful -- one of the most powerful things that happened, was tort reform that we passed in that state. And you want to talk about some powerful job creation? Tell the trial lawyers to get out of your state and to quit costing businessmen and women. (APPLAUSE) PERRY: That's what needs to happen in the states, and it's also what needs to happen at the federal level, passing federal tort reform at those federal levels. BLITZER: Congressman Paul, you're from Texas. Does your governor deserve all that credit? PAUL: Not quite. (LAUGHTER) PAUL: I'm a taxpayer there. My taxes have gone up. Our taxes have doubled since he's been in office. Our spending has gone up double. Our debt has gone up nearly triple. So, no. And 170,000 of the jobs were government jobs. So I would put a little damper on this, but I don't want to offend the governor, because he might raise my taxes or something. (APPLAUSE) PAUL: But I would like to mention something that we said earlier about a tax cut and can you -- how do you pay for a tax cut? I think that's the wrong principle, because when you give people their money back, it's their money. You don't have to pay for it. That means that the government owns all of our money if you look that way. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: All right. PAUL: So we have to cut the spending, and a good way to start, there's a little embassy we built over in Baghdad that cost us a billion dollars. It's bigger than the Vatican. That's what's bankrupting this country, and that's the easy place to cut. That's where we should be cutting. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Governor Perry, you have 30 seconds to tell Congressman Paul whether you're going to raise his taxes. PERRY: While I've been governor, we have cut taxes by $14 billion, 65 different pieces of legislation. You may not have seen them, Representative Paul, but the fact of the matter is, there are people coming to Texas for five years in a row, the number one destination. They're not coming because we're overtaxing them. They're coming to Texas because they know there's still a land of freedom in America, freedom from over-taxation, freedom from over- litigation and freedom from over-regulation, and it's called Texas. We need to do the same thing for America. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Let me bring Speaker Gingrich into this conversation. Jobs, jobs, jobs. All of us who covered you when you were Speaker -- and you worked with President Clinton at the time -- you compromised, he compromised, you got things done. There was a budget surplus for as far as the eye could see. If you were president, would you work with the Democrats, assuming they were the majority in the House or the Senate? Would you compromise with them on some of these gut issues? GINGRICH: Well, you know, after the last debate, when Governor Huntsman and Governor Perry and Governor Romney each explained how their state was the best at job creation, Brady Castis (ph), who works with me, went back and checked. In the four years I was Speaker, we created -- the American people, not me -- created more jobs in Utah than under Governor Huntsman, more jobs in Massachusetts than under Governor Romney, and more jobs in Texas than in the 11 years of Governor Perry. Now, I don't claim credit for that because it was done by investors and done -- in fact, Mitt, at that time, as the private sector, was part of the job creation. But I just want to point out, the American people create jobs, not government. OK? (APPLAUSE) GINGRICH: Now, Ronald Reagan -- when I was a very young congressman, Ronald Reagan taught me a great lesson if you have Democrat in charge. And that is to go to the American people on principle, have the American people educate their congressmen. He used to say, ""I try to turn up the light for the people so they will turn up the heat on Congress."" When we passed welfare reform, half the Democrats voted yes because they couldn't go home having voted no. And on a principle basis, I'd be glad to work with Democrats in any office, but I'd do it on principle, not on compromising principle. BLITZER: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: All right. We have a question via CNNPolitics.com. ""All of you profess to be pro-business candidates for president. Can you be pro-worker at the same time?"" Mr. Cain? CAIN: The answer is absolutely yes, because I was a worker before I was an executive and before I was a business owner. Absolutely. And when I ran the National Restaurant Association, it is a collection of small businesses. Godfather's Pizza is the same way, when I ran the region for Burger King. One restaurant is the basic fundamental business unit in this country. And so, yes, I know how to be pro-worker because I came from a pro-worker family. My mother was a domestic worker, my father was a barber, a janitor, and a chauffeur, all at the same time. I understand work because that's how I came up. So the answer is, absolutely yes. The two are not mutually exclusive, but what we need is the right leadership, starting with, are we working on the right problems? If we keep tinkering around the edges on the tax code or tinkering around the edges on Social Security, we're not going to solve the right problem. BLITZER: Thank you, Mr. Cain. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Governor Huntsman, you have experience in the business community, in government. Why would you be more effective in creating jobs than any of your rivals on this stage? HUNTSMAN: Well, let me just say about workers, this country needs more workers. Can we say that? This country needs more workers, and we're not going to get more workers until we actually have an economic plan led by someone who has actually done it before, presumably as a governor, to create the environment in which the private sector can then work its magic. That's how we're going to get from point A to point B. But let me just say that we have put forward a plan, Wolf. And I want people to take a serious look at this, because you can come up with a spin on everything -- any way to describe your plan, come up with fancy language, but I just want you to take a look at what we have done where we have been in terms of proposing job creation measures under tax reform in our state that is totally applicable to what this country needs: looking at regulatory reform; creating the most business-friendly environment in the entire United States; creating health care reform without a mandate. I know that everything's bigger in Texas, and Rick likes to talk that way. And I know all the smart people reside in Massachusetts. But let me just tell you, Utah, the great state of Utah, was number one in job creation at 5.9 percent during my years as governor. We were the best managed state in America. We were the best place in America for business. I'm the only person on this stage, Wolf, who can actually lay claim to all of that. And you know why it's important? It's because it's exactly what this country needs at this point in his history. BLITZER: All right. We're going to let everybody respond. We've got a lot more to talk about, including national security -- it's a critical issue -- taxes, Federal Reserve, health care, many more subjects coming up. Stay with us. Remember, go to Twitter or Facebook, CNNPolitics.com. We want to hear from you as well. Our special coverage of this historic CNN/Tea Party Republican presidential debate will continue after this. (APPLAUSE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BLITZER: Welcome back to the CNN/Tea Party presidential debate. We're here in Tampa. Let's go right to a question from the audience. Please give us your name. STEVE ROUTSZONG, GREATER GASTON COUNTY TEA PARTY: Good evening. I'm Steve Routszong with the Tea Party of Greater Gaston County, from Gastonia, North Carolina. My question tonight is: What is your position on the Federal Reserve? Should it indeed be audited and be held accountable by the American people? BLITZER: Senator Santorum? SANTORUM: I agree with an audit on the Federal Reserve. I believe that what we should do with the Fed is to make it a single charter instead of a dual charter. I think the second charter that was instituted that had it be responsible for increasing employment and dealing with that leads to a fundamental distrust among the American people that they are taking their eye off the ball, which is sound money. They should be a sound money Federal Reserve. That should be their single charter, and that is it. With respect to some of the questions that were asked in the last segment on the economy, I would just say this. Some people say that Barack Obama's economy is a disaster. My feeling is it would have to make a dramatic improvement just to be a disaster. The... (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) What we need to do is have a pro-growth plan that can pass the Congress with Democratic support and, as Newt mentioned, be able to rally the American people. What the American people want is a policy that's going to get people the opportunity to rise in society, to fill that great middle of America, and that is manufacturing jobs. That's why my plan takes the corporate tax, which is 35 percent, cuts it to zero, and says, if you manufacture in America, you aren't going to pay any taxes. We want you to come back here. We want you to have ""Made in America"" stamped on your -- your product. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Mr. Cain? CAIN: Yes. BLITZER: You were once with the Kansas City Federal Reserve. Should it be audited? CAIN: Yes, it can -- it should be audited. And, secondly, I believe that its focus needs to be narrowed. I don't believe in ending the Fed; I believe in fixing the Fed. For many, many decades, the Fed did its job when it was singularly focused on sound money. When we wake up in the morning, we expect 60 minutes to be in an hour. Now when we wake up, because of some of the actions of the current Fed, we don't know what the value of the dollar is going to be. In 1988, it took 1.2 dollars in order to be able to convert from Canadian to U.S. It is now totally reversed because of the current policies of the Fed. BLITZER: Thank you. Congresswoman Bachmann, you know that Governor Perry has suggested that Ben Bernanke, the head of the Federal Reserve, potentially should be tried for treason for what he's doing. (APPLAUSE) Do you agree? BACHMANN: Well, as president of the United States, I would not be reappointing Ben Bernanke, but I want to say this. During the bailout, the $700 billion bailout, I worked behind the scenes against the bailout, because one of the things that I saw from the Federal Reserve, the enabling act legislation is written so broadly that, quite literally, Congress has given the Federal Reserve almost unlimited power over the economy. That has to change. They can no longer have that power. Why? Because what we saw, with all of the $700 billion bailout, is that the Federal Reserve opened its discount window and was making loans to private American businesses. And not only that, they're making loans to foreign governments. This cannot be. The Federal Reserve has a lot to answer for. And that's why it's important that they're not only audited, but they have got be shrunk back down to such a tight leash that they're going to squeak. BLITZER: It's one thing to say you wouldn't reappoint him, Ben Bernanke... (APPLAUSE) ... to be head of the Federal Reserve. It's another thing -- do you agree or disagree with Governor Perry that potentially he's engaged in treason? BACHMANN: Well, that's for -- that's for Governor Perry to make that decision. My -- my opinion is, I would not reappoint Ben Bernanke. BLITZER: You stand by those remarks, Governor? PERRY: I -- I said that, if you are allowing the Federal Reserve to be used for political purposes, that it would be almost treasonous. I think that is a very clear statement of fact. (APPLAUSE) I am not a fan of the current chairman allowing that Federal Reserve to be used to cover up bad fiscal policy by this administration. And that, I will suggest to you, is what we have seen. It is a travesty that young people in America are seeing their dollars devalued in what -- we don't know if it was political or not because of the transparency issue. But I stand by this, that we need to have a Fed that is working towards sound monetary policy, that creates a strong dollar in America, and we do not have that today. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Governor Romney, is there anything you disagree with -- with -- with Governor Perry on that point? ROMNEY: Well, my own view is that, quite simply, that the Federal Reserve has a responsibility to preserve the value of our currency, to have a strong American currency, such that investors and people who are thinking about bringing enterprises to this country have confidence in the future of America and in our currency. People will not invest in this country and create jobs in this country for the American people if they don't have belief in our currency. Of course we should see what the Fed is doing. There should be some oversight to make sure that it's -- it's acting properly. But at the same time, we recognize that we need to have a Fed. Why -- why do I say that? Because if we don't have a Fed, who's going to run the currency? Congress? I'm not in favor of that. I'd rather have an agency that is being overseen rather than have the United States Congress try and manage our currency. BLITZER: All right. Let's take another question from the hall. Go ahead. And please identify yourself. QUESTION: Hi. My name is Tyler Hensley (ph). I'm from Napa, California. My -- well, first of all, thank you guys for coming out tonight. My question is, out of every dollar that I earn, how much do you think that I deserve to keep? BACHMANN: Oh, I love that question. I love that question. (APPLAUSE) (CROSSTALK) BLITZER: Governor Huntsman? HUNTSMAN: Well, I've come out with a tax program that basically simplifies, lowers, flattens the rate, why? Because I did it as governor in the state of Utah; I believe that that experience means something. And I look at people who are earning, you in the workplace, trying to make ends meet. You ought to be given a competitive tax code. We need to clear out the cobwebs. We need to clear out the deductions, the loopholes, the corporate welfare, and all the subsidies. And for you, you know, we leave it at 8 percent, 14 percent, 24 percent. Those are the three rates that I think would work on the individual income side. On the corporate side, I think we recognize the reality that a whole lot of companies can afford to have lobbyists and lawyers on Capitol Hill working their magic. Let's recognize the reality that they're all paying 35 percent. We need to lower that to 25 percent. So let's phase out the corporate subsidies and clean out the cobwebs and leave it more competitive for the 21st century. I can tell you, by doing that with our tax code -- and I know, because we did it in a state that took us to the number-one job creator in this country -- it will leave you and your generation a whole lot better off. But the thing that you all need to be worried about is the debt that is coming your way, because we have a cancer that is eating away at the core of this country called debt. And it's going to eat -- eat -- eat alive this country until your generation gets active in the 2012 election cycle and finds a leader who can address debt and growth. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Thank you, Governor. Speaker Gingrich, some of the biggest companies in the United States, the oil companies, they got -- I guess some would call government handouts in the form of tax breaks, tax exemptions, loopholes. They're making billions and billions of dollars. Is that fair? GINGRICH: You know, I thought for a second, you were going to refer to General Electric, which has paid no taxes. (APPLAUSE) You know, I -- I was -- I was astonished the other night to have the president there in the joint session with the head of G.E. sitting up there and the president talking about taking care of loopholes. And I thought to myself, doesn't he realize that every green tax credit is a loophole... (APPLAUSE) ... that everything he wants -- everything General Electric is doing is a loophole? Now, why did we get to breaks for ethanol, breaks for oil and gas, et cetera? We got to them because of this idea, which the young man just represented. If we make you -- if we make it possible for you to keep more of your own money, you will do more of it. We have a simple choice. We can depend on Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Venezuela, or we can encourage development in the United States of manufacturing, as Rick said. We can encourage development of oil and gas. We can do it by saying we're going to let you keep more of your money if you create more of what we want. I'm for an energy- independent America, and that means I favor people who create energy. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: But I just want to follow up, Mr. Speaker. If you eliminate some of those loopholes, those exemptions, whether for ExxonMobil or G.E. or some other companies, there are those who argue that is, in effect, a tax increase and it would violate a pledge that so many Republicans have made not to raise taxes. GINGRICH: Yes, a lot of people argue that. They're -- they're technically right, which is why I'm -- look, I'm cheerfully opposed to raising taxes. This government -- we have a problem of overspending. We don't have a problem of undertaxing. And I think that it would be good for us to say, we're not going to raise any -- which is why I'm also in favor of keeping the current tax cut for people who are working on Social Security and Medicare. I think trying to raise the tax on working Americans in the middle of the Obama depression is a destructive policy. So I don't want to have any tax increase at any level for anyone. I want to shrink government to fit income, not raise income to try to catch up with government. BLITZER: All right, let's go to Cincinnati. (APPLAUSE) We've got a question from Cincinnati. Go ahead. QUESTION: Hello. My question is, would any of you be willing to support the fair tax? BLITZER: Governor Romney? A fair tax basically is a national sales tax. ROMNEY: Yeah. Yeah. The -- the idea of a national sales tax or a consumption tax has a lot to go for it. One, it would make us more competitive globally, as we send products around the world, because under the provisions of the World Trade Organization, you can reimburse that to an exporter. We can't reimburse our taxes right now. It also would level the playing field in the country, making sure everybody is paying some part of their fair share. But the way the fair tax has been structured, it has a real problem and that is it lowers the burden on the very highest income folks and the very lowest and raises it on middle income people. And the people who have been hurt most by the Obama-economy are the middle class. And so my plan is to take the middle class individuals and dramatically reduce their taxes by the following measure. And that is for middle income Americans, no tax on interest, dividends or capital gains. Let people save their money as the way they think is best for them, for their kids, for their future, for their retirement. We're taxing too much, we're spending too much and middle income Americans need a break and I'll give it to them. BLITZER: All right. We have another question from Portsmouth, Virginia. Go ahead. QUESTION: My name is Linda Gunn (ph). I'm from Portsmouth, Virginia. I'm part of the Virginia Taxpayers Alliance. My question has to do with executive orders, under what circumstances should a president sign an executive order? And how frequently should such an order be signed? BLITZER: Congressman Paul. PAUL: The executive orders have been grossly abused by all administrations for a lot of years. If you can't -- some executive orders are legal. When the president executes proper function of the presidency like moving troops and other things, yes, it's done with an executive order. But the executive order should never be used to legislate. That is what is so bad. So the executive order should be taken under control. And I have made a promise that as president I would never use the executive order to legislate. BLITZER: Governor Perry, as you well know, you signed an executive order requiring little girls 11 and 12-year-old girls to get a vaccine to deal with a sexually transmitted disease that could lead to cervical cancer. Was that a mistake? PERRY: It was. And indeed, if I had it to do over again, I would have done it differently. I would have gone to the legislature, worked with them. But what was driving me was, obviously, making a difference about young people's lives. Cervical cancer is a horrible way to die. And I happen to think that what we were trying to do was to clearly send a message that we're going to give moms and dads the opportunity to make that decision with parental opt-out. Parental rights are very important in state of Texas. We do it on a long list of vaccines that are made, but on that particular issue, I will tell you that I made a mistake by not going to the legislature first. Let me address Ron Paul just a minute by saying I will use an executive order to get rid of as much of Obamacare as I can on day one. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Congresswoman Bachmann, do you have anything to say about what Governor Perry just said. You're a mom. BACHMANN: I'm a mom. And I'm a mom of three children. And to have innocent little 12-year-old girls be forced to have a government injection through an executive order is just flat out wrong. That should never be done. It's a violation of a liberty interest. That's -- little girls who have a negative reaction to this potentially dangerous drug don't get a mulligan. They don't get a do- over. The parents don't get a do-over. That's why I fought so hard in Washington, D.C., against President Obama and Obamacare. President Obama in a stunning, shocking level of power now just recently told all private insurance companies, you must offer the morning-after abortion pill, because I said so. And it must be free of charge. That same level coming through executive orders and through government dictates is wrong. And that's why again we have to have someone who is absolutely committed to the repeal of Obamacare and I am. I won't rest until it's appealed. BLITZER: Let's let Governor Perry respond. Was what you signed into law, that vaccine for 11 and 12-year-old girls, was that,as some of your critics have suggested, a mandate? PERRY: No, sir it wasn't. It was very clear. It had an opt- out. And at the end of the day, this was about trying to stop a cancer and giving the parental option to opt out of that. And at the end of the day, you may criticize me about the way that I went about it, but at the end of the day, I am always going to err on the side of life. And that's what this was really all about for me. BLITZER: Senator Santorum -- go ahead. BACHMANN: Can i ad to that, Wolf? Can I add to that? (CROSSTALK) BLITZER: Hold on a second. First Congresswoman Bachmann, then Senator Santorum. BACHMANN: I just wanted to add that we cannot forget that in the midst of this executive order there is a big drug company that made millions of dollars because of this mandate. We can't deny that... (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: What are you suggesting? BACHMANN: What I'm saying is that it's wrong for a drug company, because the governor's former chief of staff was the chief lobbyist for this drug company. The drug company gave thousands of dollars in political donations to the governor, and this is just flat-out wrong. The question is, is it about life, or was it about millions of dollars and potentially billions for a drug company? BLITZER: All right. I'll let Senator Santorum hold off for a second. You've got to response to that. PERRY: Yes, sir. The company was Merck, and it was a $5,000 contribution that I had received from them. I raise about $30 million. And if you're saying that I can be bought for $5,000, I'm offended. (APPLAUSE) BACHMANN: Well, I'm offended for all the little girls and the parents that didn't have a choice. That's what I'm offended for. (APPLAUSE) SANTORUM: I think we need to hear what Governor Perry's saying. He's saying that his policy was right. He believes that what he did was right. He thinks he went about it the wrong way. I believe your policy is wrong. Why -- ladies and gentlemen, why do we inoculate people with vaccines in public schools? Because we're afraid of those diseases being communicable between people at school. And therefore, to protect the rest of the people at school, we have vaccinations to protect those children. Unless Texas has a very progressive way of communicating diseases in their school by way of their curriculum, then there is no government purpose served for having little girls inoculated at the force and compulsion of the government. This is big government run amok. It is bad policy, and it should not have been done. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: I'm going to move on, Governor Perry, unless you want to say anything else. PERRY: Look, I think we made decisions in Texas. We put a $3 billion effort in to find the cure for cancer. There are a lot of different cancers out there. Texas, I think, day in and day out, is a place that protects life. I passed parental notification piece of legislation. I've been the most pro-life governor in the state of Texas. And what we were all about was trying to save young people's lives in Texas. SANTORUM: Then give the parents the opt-in, as opposed to -- teach them, let them opt in, but do not force them to have this inoculation. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: All right. Let's take a question from the audience. Give us your name please. QUESTION: I'm Caroline Taylor (ph). I'm from Orange Park, Florida, with the Peoples Tea Party. My question is, health insurance is expensive because health care is expensive. What is your plan to reduce the cost of health care so that our insurance premiums and other related costs can also be reduced? BLITZER: All right. Mr. Cain? CAIN: First, repeal Obamacare in its entirety. (APPLAUSE) SANTORUM: Amen. CAIN: Secondly, pass market-driven, patient-centered reforms such as, under the current code, deductibility of health insurance premiums regardless of who pays for it. But as you know, I want to throw that out and put in my 999 plan. Secondly, the other thing that we can do in order to help bring down the costs is pass loser pay laws. Doctors will tell you that one of their biggest expenses is medical liability insurance because of frivolous lawsuits. Secondly, restructure Medicare, another big cost that's passed on to us as consumers related to all the bureaucracy associated with that. Another market-driven idea, allow association health plans. When I ran the National Restaurant Association, which today has 14 million employees, we wanted to design a system for health insurance that was going to be customized for our industry. We could not do that. We need to be allowed to do that, and so should other organizations and other associations. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Thank you, Mr. Cain. Governor Romney, a lot of the Tea Party supporters here and around the country have a real serious problem with the health care mandate that you got through in Massachusetts. Is there anything you want to say to them to revise or amend? Do you stand by what you did? ROMNEY: Absolutely. And let me come back and just mention something that -- Herman Cain is right, and let's get back to getting the cost of health care down. I happen to think that's an enormous issue. And I agree with almost everything you said, Herman, but the reason health care is so expensive, I think you hit the nail on head. You said it's not just because of insurance, it's because of the cost of providing care. And one reason for that is the person who receives care in America generally doesn't care how much it costs, because once they've paid their deductible, it's free. And the provider, the more they do, the more they get paid. We have something that's not working like a market. It's working like a government utility. And so what we have to do is make sure that individuals have a concern and care about how much something costs. And for that to happen, health savings accounts. Give people a stake in what the cost of insurance is going to be, what the cost of it is going to be. Co-insurance, where people pay a share of the bill, that makes a difference. And with regards to Massachusetts care, I'm not running for governor. I'm running for president. And if I'm president, on day one I'll direct the secretary of Health and Human Services to grant a waiver from Obamacare to all 50 states. It's a problem that's bad law, it's not constitutional. I'll get rid of it. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: All right. Governor Perry, you're a firm believer in states' rights. Can a state like Massachusetts go ahead and pass health care reform, including mandates? Is that a good idea, if Massachusetts wants to do it? PERRY: Well, that's what Governor Romney wanted to do, so that's fine. But the fact of the matter is, that was the plan that President Obama has said himself was the model for Obamacare. And I think any of us who know that that piece of legislation will draw a line between the doctor/patient relationship, that will cost untold billions of dollars, is not right for this country. And frankly, I don't think it was right for Massachusetts when you look at what it's costing the people of Massachusetts today. But at the end of the day, that was their call. So, from a just purely states get to decide what they want to do, I agree with that. And in the state of Texas, we don't think that's the way we want to go. BLITZER: All right. BACHMANN: Wolf, can I -- BLITZER: I'm going to let you respond, but I want Governor Romney to respond first. ROMNEY: First, I'd be careful about trusting what President Obama says as to what the source was of his plan, number one. But number two, if you think what we did in Massachusetts and what President Obama did are the same, boy, take a closer look, because, number one, he raised taxes $500 billion, and helped slow down the U.S. economy by doing it. We didn't raise taxes. He cut Medicare by $500 billion. This is a Democrat president. The liberal, so to speak, cut Medicare. Not Republicans, the Democrat. We dealt with the people in our state that were uninsured, some nine percent. His bill deals with 100 percent of the people. He puts in place a panel that ultimately is going to tell people what kind of care they're going to have. We didn't do anything like that. What the president did was simply wrong. It is the wrong course for America. It is not what we did in Massachusetts. The people of Massachusetts favored our plan by three to one. And states can make their own choices. I'm happy to stand up for what he did. But I'll tell you one thing, what he did is wrong for America, and I'll stop it. BLITZER: Thank you, Governor. Before I get to Michele Bachmann, I want to just -- you're a physician, Ron Paul, so you're a doctor. You know something about this subject. Let me ask you this hypothetical question. A healthy 30-year-old young man has a good job, makes a good living, but decides, you know what? I'm not going to spend $200 or $300 a month for health insurance because I'm healthy, I don't need it. But something terrible happens, all of a sudden he needs it. Who's going to pay if he goes into a coma, for example? Who pays for that? PAUL: Well, in a society that you accept welfarism and socialism, he expects the government to take care of him. BLITZER: Well, what do you want? PAUL: But what he should do is whatever he wants to do, and assume responsibility for himself. My advice to him would have a major medical policy, but not be forced -- BLITZER: But he doesn't have that. He doesn't have it, and he needs intensive care for six months. Who pays? PAUL: That's what freedom is all about, taking your own risks. This whole idea that you have to prepare and take care of everybody -- (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: But Congressman, are you saying that society should just let him die? PAUL: No. I practiced medicine before we had Medicaid, in the early 1960s, when I got out of medical school. I practiced at Santa Rosa Hospital in San Antonio, and the churches took care of them. We never turned anybody away from the hospitals. (APPLAUSE) PAUL: And we've given up on this whole concept that we might take care of ourselves and assume responsibility for ourselves. Our neighbors, our friends, our churches would do it. This whole idea, that's the reason the cost is so high. The cost is so high because they dump it on the government, it becomes a bureaucracy. It becomes special interests. It kowtows to the insurance companies and the drug companies, and then on top of that, you have the inflation. The inflation devalues the dollar, we have lack of competition. PAUL: There's no competition in medicine. Everybody is protected by licensing. And we should actually legalize alternative health care, allow people to practice what they want. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Congresswoman Bachmann, go ahead and weigh in on this hypothetical 30-year-old who needs six months of intensive care, has no insurance. BACHMANN: Well, first of all, what I want to say, with all due respect to the governors, I've read this health care bill, I've been fighting this fight the last couple of years. BLITZER: Which health care bill? BACHMANN: President Obama's Obamacare bill. And waivers and executive orders won't cut it. If you could solve Obamacare with an executive order, any president could do it and any president could undo it. That's not -- not how it can be done. Plus, no state has the constitutional right to force a person as a condition of citizenship to buy a product or service against their will. It's unconstitutional... (APPLAUSE) ... whether it's the state government or whether it's the federal government. The only way to eradicate Obamacare is to pull it out by the root and branch to fully repeal it. It's the only way we're going to get rid of it. And this is why I'm running for the presidency of the United States, because 2012 is it. This is the election that's going to decide if we have socialized medicine in this country or not. This is it. Why? I just have to say this. It's because President Obama embedded $105,464,000,000 in Obamacare in post-dated checks to implement this bill. We are never going to get rid of it unless we have a president committed to getting rid of it. And if you believe that states can have it and that it's constitutional, you're not committed. If you've implemented this in your state, you're not committed. I'm committed to repealing Obamacare. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Thank you. There is much, much more in this Republican presidential debate, the CNN Tea Party debate. Stand by. We're taking another quick break. When we come back, national security, immigration, and a lot more. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BLITZER: I'm Wolf Blitzer in Tampa at the CNN Tea Party Republican presidential debate. Thousands of you are watching and commenting online on Twitter, Facebook, and cnn.com. We've seen the candidates strongly disagree on several issues already. When we come back, three especially bitter divides: the staggering cost of the war in Afghanistan; how to stop Iran from building a nuclear weapon; and illegal immigration. We'll be right back. (APPLAUSE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BLITZER: Welcome back to the CNN Tea Party Republican presidential debate. We're here in Tampa. But we're taking questions from across the country. Let's go to Cincinnati. Please identify yourself and ask the question. QUESTION: Yes, what -- what would you do -- what would you do to remove the illegal immigrants from our country? (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Senator Santorum, maybe 11 million, 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States. What would you do? SANTORUM: I've said this from the very beginning. What -- I'm the son of an Italian immigrant. I believe in immigration. I believe that immigration is an important part of the lifeblood of this country. But what we have is a problem of an unsecure border. Unlike Governor Perry, I believe we need to build more fence. I need -- I believe that we need to secure the border using technology and more personnel. And until we build that border, we should neither have storm troopers come in and throw people out of the country nor should we provide amnesty. What we should do is enforce the laws in this country with respect to employers, and we should secure the border. And then after the border is secured, then we can deal with the problem that are in this country. But I -- I think it's very important that we understand and we explain to folks that immigration is an important lifeblood of this country, something that I strongly support and something that we have to do legally if we're going to have -- have respect for the law. BLITZER: Governor Perry, he mentioned you, so go ahead. PERRY: Yes, sir. There's not anybody on this stage that's had to deal with the issue of border security more than I have, with 1,200 miles of -- of Texas and Mexico. And our federal government has been an abject failure at securing our border. (APPLAUSE) We've had to spend some $400 million of Texas taxpayer dollars to send Texas Ranger recon teams down there. Strategic fencing in the metropolitan areas absolutely has a role to play. But the idea that you're going to build a wall from Brownsville to El Paso and go left for another 800 miles to Tijuana is just not reality. What you have to have is boots on the ground. You've got to have 450 Border Patrol agents trained up, 1,500 National Guard troops. You've got to have the aviation assets in the air putting real-time information down to the law enforcement. We understand and know how to secure that border, but we can't do it alone. And the federal government has to step up and do what their constitutional duty is, and that is to secure the border with Mexico. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Let me just take this quick question from Twitter, and then I want to stay on this subject. What are the candidates doing to attract the Latino voters? Go ahead, Senator Santorum. SANTORUM: Well, I mean, what Governor Perry's done is he provided in-state tuition for -- for illegal immigrants. Maybe that was an attempt to attract the illegal vote -- I mean, the Latino voters. But you track Latino voters by talking about the importance of immigration in this country. You talk about the importance of -- as -- as Newt has talked about for many years, having English as the -- as the official language of this country. (APPLAUSE) And I say that... (APPLAUSE) I say that as, again, my -- my father and grandfather came to this country not speaking a word of English, but it was the greatest gift to my father to have to learn English so he could assimilate into this society. We're a melting pot, not a salad bowl. And we need to continue that tradition. BLITZER: Governor Perry, I'm going to move on to Governor Huntsman in a second, but you did sign legislation giving some illegal immigrants in Texas the opportunity to have in-state tuition at universities in Texas, explain what that... PERRY: In the state of Texas, if you've been in the state of Texas for three years, if you're working towards your college degree, and if you are working and pursuing citizenship in the state of Texas, you pay in-state tuition there. And the bottom line is it doesn't make any difference what the sound of your last name is. That is the American way. No matter how you got into that state, from the standpoint of your parents brought you there or what have you. And that's what we've done in the state of Texas. And I'm proud that we are having those individuals be contributing members of our society rather than telling them, you go be on the government dole. BLITZER: You heard some boos there. But go ahead, Congresswoman Bachmann, is that basically the DREAM Act that President Obama wants as well? BACHMANN: Yes, it's very similar. And I think that the American way is not to give taxpayer subsidized benefits to people who have broken our laws or who are here in the United States illegally. That is not the American way. Because the immigration system in the United States worked very, very well up until the mid-1960s when liberal members of Congress changed the immigration laws. What works is to have people come into the United States with a little bit of money in their pocket legally with sponsors so that if anything happens to them, they don't fall back on the taxpayers to take care of them. And then they also have to agree to learn the speak the English language, learn American history and our constitution. That's the American way. BLITZER: I'm going to bring Governor Huntsman here. But go ahead, Governor Perry. PERRY ; I'm not for the DREAM Act that they are talking about in Washington D.C. that is amnesty. What we did in the state of Texas was clearly a states right issue. And the legislature passed with only four dissenting votes in the House and the Senate to allow this to occur. We were clearly sending a message to young people, regardless of what the sound of their last name is, that we believe in you. That if you want to live in the state of Texas and you want to pursue citizenship, that we're going to allow you the opportunity to be contributing members in the state of Texas and not be a drag on our state. BLITZER: Hold on a second, Governor Huntsman, you also signed legislation in Utah that gave driving privileges to illegal immigrants. Was that a good idea? HUNTSMAN: Well, first of all, let me say for Rick to say that you can't secure the border I think is pretty much a treasonous comment. MALE: I didn't hear that. HUNTSMAN: Rick, we can secure the border. We can secure the border through means of fences, through technology, through the deployment of our National Guard troops, we can get it done. In fact, when the elected president of the United States, I would work with you and the other three border governors to ensure that through your law enforcement officials you can verify that that border is secure. But I will tell you before Wolf here directs a question, they were given a driver's license before and they were using that for identification purposes. And I thought that was wrong. Instead we issued a driver privilege card, which in our state allowed our economy to continue to function. And it said in very bold letters, not to be used for identification purposes. It was a pragmatic local government driven fix and it proved that the tenth amendment works. We believe in local fixes and solutions. BLITZER: All right. Governor Romney, do you have a problem with either what Governor Huntsman did in Utah or Governor Perry did in Texas? ROMNEY: yeah with both, actually. The question began by saying how do we attract Latino voters. And the answer is by telling them what they know in their heart, which is they or their ancestors did not come here for a handout. If they came here for a handout, they'd be voting for Democrats. They came here for opportunity and freedom. And that's what we represent. And that's why we'll win collecting support from Latinos across the country. With regards to illegal immigration, of course we build a fence and of course we do not give instate tuition credits to people who come here illegally. That only attracts people to come here and take advantage of America's great beneficence. And with regards to giving driver's licenses to people that are here illegally, that creates a patina of legal status. There are sanctuary cities in some parts of the country. One of the things I did in my state was to say, look, I'm going to get my state police authorized to be able to enforce immigration laws and make sure those people who we arrest are put in jail, to find out they're here illegally, we're going to get them out of here. We have to recognize that this is the party that believes in supporting the law. We're going to enforce the law. We're the party of opportunity, we're also the party of legal law abiding citizens. And that's something we're going to attract people of all backgrounds. PERRY: As I said it earlier, we basically had a decision to make. Are we going to give people an incentive to be contributing members of this society or are we going to tell them no, we're going to put you on the government dole? In the state of Texas, and this is a states right issue, if in Massachusetts you didn't want to do that or Utah you didn't want to do this, that's fine. But in the state of Texas where Mexico has a clear and a long relationship with this state, we decided it was in the best interest of those young people to give them the opportunity to go on to college and to have the opportunity. They're pursuing citizenship in this country rather than saying, you know, we're going to put you over here and put you on the government dole for the rest of your life. We don't think that was the right thing to do. And it's working. And it's working well in the state of Texas. BLITZER: I know you want to respond, too, because he said that what you did in Utah was a mistake giving driving privileges to illegal immigrants. HUNTSMAN: I think we can spend all night talking about where Mitt's been on all the issues of the day. And that would take forever. But let me just say that all the Latino voters, Hispanic voters want is opportunity, can we say that? The greatest thing that we can do for the people in this country is -- on illegal immigration is fix homeland security. I mean, when are we going to have an honest conversation in this country about the root causes. We can't process people. The H1B visa process is broken. We need to bring in brain power to this country to shore up our economic might. We need to bring in foreign capital to raise real estate prices as well. We need a fixed Department of Homeland Security. BLITZER: Thank you, governor. All right. Let's take a question from Phoenix. Go ahead, Phoenix. Give us your name. (APPLAUSE) QUESTION: The United States has an abundance of coal, oil, natural gas and uranium. The American people have been told for decades that energy independence is a top priority. What will you do in your first 100 days in office to assure the American people that energy independence will finally become reality. BLITZER: Mr. Cain? CAIN: The first thing that I would do in order to assure that we get on the road to energy independence, and I do believe that we can because we do have the natural resources to do so, we've got to remove some of those barriers out of the way that are being created by the federal government. I would start with an EPA that's gone wild. That's where we start. I would put together a regulatory reduction commission for every agency starting with the EPA. This regulatory reduction commission -- one of my guiding principles is if you want to solve a problem go to the source closest to the problem. So the people that I would appoint to that commission will be people who have been abused by the EPA. That would be the commission that would straighten out the regulatory burden. BLITZER: Let's take a question from Twitter. Do you plan to decrease defense spending to balance spending? Or do you believe high spending is essential to security? Speaker Gingrinch? GINGRICH: I think we are at the edge of an enormous crisis in national security. I think that we are greatly underestimating the threat to this country. And I think that the day after we celebrated the 10th anniversary of 9/11 we should be reminded exactly what is at stake if a foreign terrorist gets a nuclear weapon into this country. We have failed for a decade to deal with North Korea. We have failed for a decade to deal with Iran. The developments in Egypt and Turkey are much more dangerous than anybody is looking at in this country. And I think we need, frankly, to ask for a very serious national dialogue. I'd like to see both the House and Senate right now holding hearings on three levels of security. What do you do in Mexico where there's a civil war underway next door to us? What do you do in the Middle East where we have totally underestimated the scale of the threat? And what do you do about our national domestic industrial base which is crucial if we're going to be competitive with China? All three of those are a major threat to us. BLITZER: Congressman Paul. (APPLAUSE) PAUL: First thing I would like to do is make sure that you understand there's a difference between military spending and defense spending. I'm tired of all the militarism that we are involved in. And we're wasting this money in getting us involved. And I agree, we are still in danger, but most of the danger comes by our lack of wisdom on how we run our foreign policy. So I would say there's a lot of room to cut on the military, but not on the defense. You can slash the military spending. We don't need to be building airplanes that were used in World War II -- we're always fighting the last war. But we're under great threat, because we occupy so many countries. We're in 130 countries. We have 900 bases around the world. We're going broke. The purpose of al Qaeda was to attack us, invite us over there, where they can target us. And they have been doing it. They have more attacks against us and the American interests per month than occurred in all the years before 9/11, but we're there occupying their land. And if we think that we can do that and not have retaliation, we're kidding ourselves. We have to be honest with ourselves. What would we do if another country, say, China, did to us what we do to all those countries over there? (APPLAUSE) PAUL: So I would say a policy -- a foreign policy that takes care of our national defense, that we're willing to get along with people and trade with people, as the founders advised, there's no authority in the Constitution to be the policeman of the world, and no nation-building. Just remember, George Bush won the presidency on that platform in the year 2000. And I still think it's a good platform. BLITZER: All right. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Let me let Senator Santorum respond, because I know you strongly disagree. SANTORUM: On your Web site on 9/11, you had a blog post that basically blamed the United States for 9/11. On your Web site, yesterday, you said that it was our actions that brought about the actions of 9/11. Now, Congressman Paul, that is irresponsible. The president of the United States -- someone who is running for the president of the United States in the Republican Party should not be parroting what Osama bin Laden said on 9/11. (APPLAUSE) SANTORUM: We should have -- we are not being attacked and we were not attacked because of our actions. We were attacked, as Newt talked about, because we have a civilization that is antithetical to the civilization of the jihadists. And they want to kill us because of who we are and what we stand for. And we stand for American exceptionalism, we stand for freedom and opportunity for everybody around the world, and I am not ashamed to do that. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Thirty second, Mr. Paul. PAUL: As long as this country follows that idea, we're going to be under a lot of danger. This whole idea that the whole Muslim world is responsible for this, and they're attacking us because we're free and prosperous, that is just not true. Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda have been explicit -- they have been explicit, and they wrote and said that we attacked America because you had bases on our holy land in Saudi Arabia, you do not give Palestinians fair treatment, and you have been bombing -- (BOOING) PAUL: I didn't say that. I'm trying to get you to understand what the motive was behind the bombing, at the same time we had been bombing and killing hundreds of thousands of Iraqis for 10 years. Would you be annoyed? If you're not annoyed, then there's some problem. BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman. All right. We're going to say on this subject. We have a question from the audience. Go ahead. Please identify yourself. SAHAR HEKMATI, TEA PARTY EXPRESS: Hi. My name is Sahar Hekmati. I was brought here from Ronald Reagan. I am from Afghanistan. And my question to you is, as the next president of the United States, what will you do to secure safety and protection for the women and the children of Afghanistan from the radicals? (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Governor Huntsman? HUNTSMAN: We are 10 years into this war, Sahar. America has given its all in Afghanistan. We have families who have given the ultimate sacrifice. And it's to them that we offer our heartfelt salute and a deep sense of gratitude. But the time has come for us to get out of Afghanistan. (APPLAUSE) HUNTSMAN: We don't need 100,000 troops in Afghanistan nation- building at a time when this nation needs to be built. We are of no value to the rest of the world if our core is crumbling, which it is in this country. I like those days when Ronald Reagan -- you talked about -- when Ronald Reagan would ensure that the light of this country would shine brightly for liberty, democracy, human rights, and free markets. We're not shining like we used to shine. We need to shine again. And I'm here to tell you, Sahar, when we start shining again, it's going to help the women of Afghanistan, along with any other NGO work that can be done there and the collaborative efforts of great volunteer efforts here in the United States. We can get it done, but we have to make sure that the Afghan people increasingly take responsibility for their security going forward. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Very quickly, to Governor Perry, $2 billion a week, is that money well spent by U.S. taxpayers in Afghanistan? PERRY: Well, I agree with Governor Huntsman when we talk about it's time to bring our young men and women home and as soon and obviously as safely as we can. But it's also really important for us to continue to have a presence there. And I think the entire conversation about, how do we deliver our aid to those countries, and is it best spent with 100,000 military who have the target on their back in Afghanistan, I don't think so at this particular point in time. I think the best way for us to be able to impact that country is to make a transition to where that country's military is going to be taking care of their people, bring our young men and women home, and continue to help them build the infrastructure that we need, whether it's schools for young women like yourself or otherwise. BLITZER: Thank you, Governor. All right. We're going to take another quick break. When we come back, here's what we're going to do. You're going to get to know these candidates a little bit better. When we come back, what would they add to the White House if they were to move in? We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BLITZER: Eight Republican presidential candidates on the stage. You know, Americans are looking at you. They also want to know a little bit more about you. I'm going to start with Senator Santorum. I want to go down and get your thoughts on something you would bring to the White House if you were the next president of the United States. An example, President George H. W. Bush put in a horseshoe pit. President Clinton put in a jogging track. President Obama added a vegetable garden. Senator Santorum, if you're president, what would you bring to the White House? SANTORUM: Well, mine is pretty obvious. Karen and I have seven children, so we'd add a bedroom or -- and some beds to the White House. BLITZER: Speaker Gingrich? GINGRICH: Well, first of all, I would reduce the White House by kicking out all the White House czars the first day, creating a lot more space. (APPLAUSE) And then, because of Callista's interest, we'd have a lot more music, because of my granddaughter, Maggie, we'd have ballet, and because of my grandson, Robert, we'd have a very large chess set. So it'll all come together. BLITZER: Congressman Paul? PAUL: I'd bring a bushel basket full of common sense. And I would also bring a course in Austrian economics to teach the people... (APPLAUSE) ... the business cycle and why the Fed creates inflation and depressions and all our unemployment problems. BLITZER: Governor Perry? PERRY: It's simple. I'm going to bring the most beautiful, most thoughtful, incredible first lady that this country's ever seen, Anita. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Governor Romney? ROMNEY: You know, one of -- one of my heroes was a man who had an extraordinary turn of phrase. He once said about us, he said, you know, you can count on the Americans to get things right after they've exhausted all the alternatives. And now and then we've made a couple of mistakes. We're quite a nation. And this man, Winston Churchill, used to have his bust in the Oval Office. And if I'm president of the United States, it'll be there again. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Congressman Bachmann? BACHMANN: I would bring a copy of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States, the Bill of Rights, and that's it. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Mr. Cain? CAIN: I would bring a sense of humor to the White House, because America's too uptight. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: And Governor Huntsman? HUNTSMAN: And to play to that theme -- my wife's going to kill me for saying this -- but I would bring my -- as a 40-year motorcycle rider, I would bring my Harley-Davidson and my motocross bike. BLITZER: Ladies and gentlemen, the eight Republican presidential candidates. (APPLAUSE) And that's all the time we have. Ladies and gentlemen, please give a hand to our candidates for the Republican nomination for president of the United States. (APPLAUSE) We want to thank our partners, the Tea Party Express, and 150 Tea Party groups from around the country. Thanks also to our host, the Florida State Fairgrounds. Our next debate here on CNN, in Las Vegas, October 18th with the Western Republican Leadership Conference. We look forward to seeing the candidates and all of you there. The conversation continues online right now on Twitter, Facebook, and cnnpolitics.com. More coverage of this debate with ""Anderson Cooper 360"" right now."

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/09/kevin-mccarthy/will-every-american-get-tax-cut-house-gop-bill/	"The Republican tax bill ""lets every American keep more of what they earned."""	false	['Taxes']	https://www.cbsnews.com/	https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-house-majority-leader-kevin-mccarthy-on-face-the-nation-nov-5-2017/	2017/11/09	"EmailThe highly-anticipated tax overhaul bill was unveiled by House Republican leaders on Thursday . While proponents claim it reduces rates on the middle class and corporations, Democrats are labeling it a scam and saying the middle class will actually bear the brunt of increased rates to pay for cuts going to corporations and the wealthy.Â House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy joined ""Face the Nation"" Sunday to discuss the tax proposal.What follows is a transcript of the interview, which aired Sunday, Nov. 5, 2017, on ""Face the Nation.""JOHN DICKERSON: And we turn now to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. He joins us from Bakersfield, California. Mr. Majority Leader, we want to talk about the tax cut. The Congressional scorekeepers have weighed in and said that this will increase deficits by $1.5 trillion. Supporters, of course, say that there will be economic growth that will take care of that problem.But I was looking back at the claims made for the Bush tax cut in 2001, there was a Heritage study that said the debt would be gone entirely from those tax cuts. So, things sometimes don't turn out the way everybody hopes. Given that, and given this score of $1.5 trillion in the deficit, isn't this a huge gamble for all of the reasons that Republicans have long said about adding to the deficit and debt?REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY: No, and really, John, look at this, for decades the hard-working Americans have been ignored or forgotten from Washington, but not anymore. This Tax Cut and Jobs Act bill is going to be the start to changing that. Let me give you three points why.First, it lets every American keep more of what they earned. If you're single, the first $12,000 is tax free. If you're a couple, 24. That means the average family is going to save almost $1,200 more in their pocket. So, the first $55,000 a family of four earns will not be taxed at all.Second, what it does for small business. I created my first small business when I was 20. The lessons I learned, I was the first to work, I was the last to leave, and I was the last to be paid. They create more jobs than anything else. Lowering it to 25% is the lowest it's been since World War II.And now to your question, I was in the Oval Office just this week. This is going to make America competitive again. Broadcom came in there based upon our tax bill. This is a company who'd left America because the taxes came too high. They announced, because of the tax bill, they are moving back to America. That's $20 billion in revenue a year, but you know what's even more important? They put $3 billion every year into R&D and $6 billion into manufacturing. That's jobs, good paying jobs for America.JOHN DICKERSON: Right. So, those are the promises being made on behalf, but there's nevertheless the score from the people who do the accounting. They know about the economic effects here. They may not - they may not calculate them in every way you'd like, but there is a big risk here.We also will get to talk in a minute about whether everybody really does get a tax cut from this bill. But given how much Republicans have talked over the years about the dangerous effects of the debt and its downside on growth, the answers here are basically we've got to hope this turns out. Is there any mechanism to save the downside if things don't turn out as you would promise and hope that they would?REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY: Well, there's a philosophical difference in Washington. Democrats do want to charge more and spend more. Republicans want you to keep more of your money and spend less. One thing that Republicans have shown since they took a majority, when it comes to discretionary spending, we've actually cut spending.We know where the challenge is when it comes to entitlements. We've put those plans out there. We have to grow the economy and save the entitlements for the next generation by changing them to be actually prepared for the future. And you say these are studies, but think of this, Broadcom took an action to move their company back to America based on just the introduction of this bill. That is stronger than any study out there that jobs are coming.JOHN DICKERSON: Well, but the study that's out there is by the Congressional scorekeepers who will ultimately determine how this thing gets voted on and, and determine the rules of the Senate. But let me just finally, very quickly, often Republicans have said the federal government needs to balance its budget like a family does. Would a family balance its budget based on this kind of promise of the future? Would that be wise family budgeting?REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY: I think so because the one thing I will tell you is it's only Washington who thinks letting a family keep $1,200 is not a lot of money. Let them make the investment. And the one thing, if you're going to grow the economy, think about the last eight years.Always in America, we've averaged more than 3% growth, but the lowest of growth we've had in those last eight years. If you look back to Bill Clinton, his worst growth year is higher than the largest of Barack Obama's. Growing the economy is the key to getting us working back and helping us to be able to balance the budget.JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you, Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, said, ""At the end of the day, nobody in the middle class is going to get a tax increase."" Is that the case with the House legislation that is proposed? Everybody in the middle class will see no tax increase?REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY: Look, we are cutting rates. We're not raising rates. So, this is a tax cut. As I said--JOHN DICKERSON: Will everybody get one in the middle class?(CROSSTALK)REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY: Yes. It is a fact that the first $55,000 you earn for a family of four will not pay any tax. So, it is a tax cut for the middle class.JOHN DICKERSON: So there is - there is some discrepancy because there is some sunsetting of some of the provisions, including the Child Tax Credit, so that some of the analysis done here finds that, in fact, middle class families will end up paying more in years 2023 and 2024. So, is that math wrong or, or what's - why is there that discrepancy?REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY: Well, John, as you understand, we've made most everything permanent, but because of the rules of the Senate, we could not make those permanent as we go forward. But I will promise you this, as the growth comes in, those will be kept. They will not go away within the tax credit in the sixth and seventh year. That's exactly what Chairman Brady has said as well.JOHN DICKERSON: But why not guarantee that--REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY: You understand it better than most--JOHN DICKERSON: --in the legislation?REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY: --with knowing the rules.JOHN DICKERSON: Why not guarantee it in the legislation?REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY: Well, we know the rules - well the one thing we see, because of the rules of the Senate, for us to move forward within the sixth and seventh, but we know with the growth and you look at the studies coming in saying more than a trillion dollars, we will keep those in the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth, tenth year.JOHN DICKERSON: Of course, the rules of the Senate are there to keep fiscal responsibility and keep gimmicks from happening. Let me ask you though about the individual mandate. Some people have talked about getting rid of the individual mandate that's a part of Obamacare in this tax legislation. Would you support that?REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY: Well, I know people are talking about it. Currently, it is not in this bill. I know the Senate is looking at it. We will start marking up this bill in Ways and Means next week, and I look for having the bill on the floor the week after that. The Senate will come out with theirs shortly.JOHN DICKERSON: Would you like to see it happen now?REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY: We do not currently have it in there. Look, my focus is on tax. If the individual mandate goes, I would not be opposed to that, but I want to see this bill go forward so the American people can win and start keeping more of their own hard-earned money.JOHN DICKERSON: Finally, Mr. Majority Leader, the Speaker has said it would be naÃ¯ve to suggest that sexual harassment doesn't happen in Congress. Is there a sexual harassment problem in Congress?REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY: Well, we're a microcosm of society. We take this very serious. The House administration is holding hearings on this coming forward to look at if there's other rules. The Speaker and others, we put out a letter to every office to make sure they're taking training. My own office will be done with the training this month as well. There is no role for that inside the House, and we have to make sure that there are not problems inside the House as well.JOHN DICKERSON: All right, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, thanks so much for being with us. And we'll be back in one minute with our politics panel.Â© 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved."

Higgins pointed out the tax overhaul fails to pass the standard advanced by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, that there would be no tax cuts for the wealthy, and fails to garner the confidence of economists from Secretary Mnuchinâs own organization, Goldman Sachs.Â Higgins said, in part, âThis tax bill will produce, according to Goldman economists, no good growth in the American economy over the next five years. The reason why Goldman is relevant here is both the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Mnuchin, and the National Economic Advisor, Mr. Cohn, are both from Goldman. If you canât convince the organization, from which you came, [to] confirm what youâre saying, that is indicative, to me, of a bill that just doesnât balance out.

Is it legal?By Miriam Valverde on Thursday, March 1st, 2018 at 4:50 p.m.Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle is running to replace Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution)Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle vowed to kill any legislation that would benefit Delta Air Lines if the Atlanta-based company did not backtrack on its decision to end an agreement with the National Rifle Association to remain ""neutral"" in the national debate over gun control.The announcement came as the Georgia Legislature considered a broad tax bill that included a jet fuel tax exemption, which the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported could save Delta about $40 million a year.""I will kill any tax legislation that benefits @Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with @NRA. Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back,"" said Cagle, who serves as Senate president and is running for governor, in a tweet Feb. 26.I will kill any tax legislation that benefits @Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with @NRA . Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back.â Casey Cagle (@CaseyCagle) February 26, 2018Two days later, a state Senate committee stripped out the jet fuel perk from the broad tax bill. On March 1, the Senate passed a tax bill â without the jet fuel tax break â along a 44-10 vote . The House and Senate now have to agree on a final bill before it is sent to the governor.Cagleâs statement was a promise of future action and political stance, so we are not rating it on the Truth-O-Meter. But we wanted to look into it after seeing chatter wondering if it would be legal for Cagle to follow up on his threat.Experts told PolitiFact Georgia that thereâs room to argue it could become a First Amendment violation, but the fact that Delta did not already have the tax break makes the situation more nuanced.Michael J. Gerhardt, a constitutional law professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, pointed to the 2010 U.S. Supreme Court case Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission that said corporations also have First Amendment rights.""Generally, the government may not punish anyone, much less a single company, for expressing itself (or trying to control the expression of its values),"" Gerhardt said. ""If Georgia punishes the airline for expression Georgia does not like, that is a First Amendment violation.""Additionally, Gerhardt said it seems Georgia is ""trying to force or compel Delta to engage in an expressive association that Delta does not want to have.""Implementing a policy for a certain purpose can be a form of expression, and if the Georgia government took adverse action against Delta for its expression, it would be ""a distinctive sort of First Amendment violation,"" said Gregory Magarian, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis specializing in constitutional and First Amendment law.Deltaâs decision to cut ties with the NRA can be perceived as symbolic speech and possibly political speech, which are protected by the First Amendment, said Kathleen Burch, a law professor at Atlantaâs John Marshall Law School.And unless an entity is paid to speak on behalf of the government, it canât be forced to engage in speech it wouldnât engage in otherwise, Burch said.Whether Delta would have a strong legal case against Georgia is questionable, since it didnât have the tax exemption to begin with.Eugene Volokh, who teaches free speech law at the University of California Los Angeles School of Law, noted circumstances within and out of legal bounds.""Retaliating against a company based on its speech may be unconstitutional,"" Volokh said. ""But retaliating based on the companyâs commercial conduct, such as the termination of a discount, is constitutional.""Amid Deltaâs spat with Georgia, on Feb. 27 governors from New York and Virginia offered the airline a new home for its headquarters.""Hey @deltaâVirginia is for lovers and airline hubs. You're welcome here any time,"" tweeted Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam.""[emailÂ protected], if Georgia politicians disagree with your stand against gun violence, we invite you to move your headquarters to New York,"" tweeted New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.Randall Woodfin, mayor of Birmingham, Ala., also told Delta his city was open for business.""Hey @Delta . You know, in mathematics, Delta represents the change in something, e.g. ïºHQ. Letâs chat. #BHM,"" Woodfin tweeted Feb. 27.In a Feb. 28 interview with Fox Newsâ Fox & Friends,Â Cagle reaffirmed his disagreement with Deltaâs decision but also acknowledged the airlineâs importance to the state, calling it a ""family member.""""I think that obviously Delta is free to make any decision that they want to,"" Cagle said . ""And oftentimes you know families do get into squabbles, they are a family member here in Georgia.""Advertisement"

Nikki Haley. THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Here come the members of the Cabinet led by the Secretary of State. That's why you have the number one Cabinet, secretary, the Secretary of the Treasury Jacob Lew. Following, there's John Kerry. There's Jacob Lew.[21:00:00] Members of the Cabinet walking into the house of chamber right now to listen to the president's State of the Union Address.Once again we want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world. We're awaiting the President of the United States. He is about to deliver his last State of the Union Address. It comes in an awkward moment. 10 U.S. sailors, they are being held right now in Iran. The vice president and the secretary of state have told our Dana Bash they expect those 10 sailors to be released fairly soon.There's a bit of tension, Jake Tapper, as we await the release of these 10 American sailors. It's been an awkward moment clearly for the president and his address. Something they certainly did not want to have deal with on this important night.JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR: That's right, we see Secretary of State John Kerry on our screen there. He and the Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter learned about midafternoon that these 10 sailors had been picked up by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and were being held. So far the administration has said that they are not going to add any information about this in the State of the Union, because they anticipate that it will be a positive result.But let's pause, if we can, Wolf, and just talk about the momentous moment that this is the important moment, President Obama's last State of the Union Address. Vice President Biden for his part, his last State of the Union address, having probably attended almost every one, if not every one, since 1973, as a senator and then a vice president. This is truly the end of an era.The president has just over a year left in office. He's going to be talking about the nation he sees, not the nation is represented by the anxiety that we heard about, by so many candidates on the campaign trail, both Democrats and Republicans.BLITZER: He's going to try to look ahead, to, we're told, instead of a specific long list of proposals, that will be some, but the president wants to look ahead, what he sees for the country over the next 5, 10, even 20 years. It's going to be also a relatively optimistic assessment. He's going to go through the past seven years, where the country was when he took office a back on January 20th, 2009, and where it is today on economic issues and other related issues, including health care for millions of Americans. He's very proud of that achievement.TAPPER: I know you see with the white hair walking through shaking hands Denis McDonough, the White House Chief of Staff, the president's final and by all accounts favorite chief-of-staff, Obama's Obama, he's been called. There is only one member of the cabinet who is still serving in his original position. And that is the Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack.BLITZER: Yeah, he's been there since day one, he's still there right now, we saw him walk in just a little while ago. There's Ash Carter, the Secretary of Defense. He's certainly got a lot on his plate right now. He was with as you point out, he was with John Kerry earlier when they got word that 10 American sailors, nine men, one woman, were detained -- were being held in Iran together with two very small U.S. Navy Vessels. We're getting word from the vice President and the secretary of state. They expect the Iranians to release those 10 sailors very soon.Dana Bash is there in Statuary Hall, what are you seeing now, Dana?DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRSPONDENT: Wolf, you might have come to me with my back to you, and my apologies for that. But the reason is, because I'm looking down here and in years past, I've actually been able to see something pretty cool, I have to say, a totally nonpartisan thing, just to be witness to history at a moment like this, and that is the President of the United States lining up and waiting for the sergeant at arms to scream that are now familiar announcement ""Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States.""So, I'm watching for him, he should be back there any minute, but while we're doing this, just one kind of impression that I had in our longtime producer here there to watch, usually here in Statuary Hall, there's kind of an electricity, an anticipation, and it's different this year.To quote Donald Trump, its low energy, it just doesn't feel the same. You know, whether or not it is because it is his last, or because the situation here has become so incredibly partisan, it does feel different this time around.BLITZER: We'll await those words by Paul Irving the House sergeant at arms, who will be making that declaration as you point out, ""Mr. President -- Mr. Speaker -- excuse me -- the President of the United States.""Jake, you and I and Dana, and other reporters, we attended a breakfast this morning with Paul Ryan, the new Speaker of the House. And he was asked to describe how he saw the State of the Union. The president always says the State of the Union is strong, the State of the Union is excellent.[21:05:00] Whatever the president says, he doesn't necessarily believe that, does he?TAPPER: No, the president of the United States, whoever it is, almost always says strong, in second option might be quite strong, but Paul Ryan, Speaker of the House said he agreed with Donald Trump's assessment that the State of the Union is a mess. And that is one of the things that President Obama I believe in his speech this evening will be trying to rebut. Not just that sentiment, but any sort of national anxiety. He will be talking about hope.BLITZER: The president is about to be introduced by Paul Irving, the House sergeant at arms. Let's listen in.PAUL IRVING, HOUSE SERGEANT AT ARMS: Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Happy New Year. Happy New Year to you.BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PRESIDENT: Thank you. Good to see you. Happy New Year. Happy New Year. Good to see you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good to see you. We're going to get there. Happy New Year. Thank you. Great to see you. Happy New Year.OBAMA: Thank you. So nice to see you. How are you? Happy New Year. Great to see you. Good to see you.Good to see you. Happy New Year. Haven't seen you in a while. Happy New Year.BLITZER: He's about to go up on the podium, Jake, stand in front of the Speaker of the House, the Vice President of the United States, also the president of the U.S. Senate, and he'll be making his remarks. We're told his speech will be a little shorter than last year. We'll see how long it actually is. The president is been working they told very hard personally getting involved in drafting the speech.Jake, this is an important speech for the president, the last State of the Union Address. There he is with the vice president and the speaker. And there's the first lady.TAPPER: That's right, as President Obama saying he wants his team to be able to say they couldn't think of anything else that we didn't try to do. He wants to put it on and leave it all on the field, he says. And he says he's an energized to give this speech as he was the first time he delivered it.BLITZER: All right. Let's listen in.BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, my fellow Americans: tonight marks the eighth year that I've come here to report on the state of the Union. And for this final one, I'm going to try to make it a little shorter. (APPLAUSE) OBAMA: I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa.(LAUGHTER) I've been there. I'll be shaking hands afterwards if you want some tips. Now, I understand that because it's an election season, expectations for what we will achieve this year are low. But, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the constructive approach that you and other leaders took at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families. So I hope we can work together this year on some bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform, and helping... (APPLAUSE) ... and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse. (APPLAUSE) So who knows. We might surprise the cynics again.But tonight, I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead. Don't worry, I've got plenty, from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients. And I will keep pushing for progress on the work that I believe still needs to be done: fixing a broken immigration system... (APPLAUSE) ... protecting our kids from gun violence, equal pay for equal work, paid leave, raising the minimum wage. (APPLAUSE) All these things -- all these things still matter to hardworking families. They're still the right thing to do, and I won't let up until they get done. But for my final address to this chamber, I don't want to just talk about next year. I want to focus on the next five years, the next ten years and beyond. I want to focus on our future.We live in a time of extraordinary change -- change that's reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our planet, our place in the world. It's change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs, but also economic disruptions that strain working families. It promises education for girls in the most remote villages, but also connects terrorists, plotting an ocean away. It's change that can broaden opportunity, or widen inequality. And whether we like it or not, the pace of this change will only accelerate. America has been through big changes before -- wars and depression, the influx of new immigrants, workers fighting for a fair deal, movements to expand civil rights. Each time, there have been those who told us to fear the future, who claimed we could slam the brakes on change, who promised to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control. And each time, we overcame those fears. We did not, in the words of Lincoln, adhere to the dogmas of the quiet past. Instead we thought anew and acted anew. We made change work for us, always extending America's promise outward, to the next frontier, to more people. And because we did, because we saw opportunity where others saw peril, we emerged stronger and better than before.What was true then can be true now. Our unique strengths as a nation -- our optimism and work ethic, our spirit of discovery, our diversity, our commitment to rule of law -- these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come.In fact, it's in that spirit that we have made the progress these past seven years. That's how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations. (APPLAUSE)That's how we reformed our health care system and reinvented our energy sector.(APPLAUSE)That's how -- that's how we -- that's how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops coming home and our veterans. (APPLAUSE)That's how we -- that's -- that's how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we love.(APPLAUSE)But such progress is not inevitable. It's the result of choices we make together. And we face such choices right now. Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation, turning against each other as a people? Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are, in what we stand for, and the incredible things we can do together? So let's talk about the future, and four big questions that I believe we as a country have to answer, regardless of who the next president is or who controls the next Congress. First, how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy?(APPLAUSE)Second, how do we make technology work for us, and not against us, especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change?(APPLAUSE)Third, how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman?(APPLAUSE)And finally, how can we make our politics reflect what's best in us, and not what's worst?(APPLAUSE)Let me start with the economy and a basic fact. The United States of America, right now, has the strongest, most durable economy in the world. (APPLAUSE)We're in the middle of the longest streak of private-sector job creation in history. (APPLAUSE)OBAMA: More than 14 million new jobs, the strongest two years of job growth since the 1990s, an unemployment rate cut in half. Our auto industry just had its best year ever. (APPLAUSE)That's just part of a manufacturing surge that's created nearly 900,000 new jobs in the past six years. And we've done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters. (APPLAUSE)Anyone claiming that America's economy is in decline is peddling fiction. Now...(APPLAUSE)What is true -- and the reason that a lot of Americans feel anxious -- is that the economy has been changing in profound ways, changes that started long before the Great Recession hit, changes that have not let up. Today, technology doesn't just replace jobs on the assembly line, but any job where work can be automated. Companies in a global economy can locate anywhere, and they face tougher competition. As a result, workers have less leverage for a raise. Companies have less loyalty to their communities. And more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top. All these trends have squeezed workers, even when they have jobs, even when the economy is growing. It's made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty, harder for young people to start their careers, tougher for workers to retire when they want to. And although none of these trends are unique to America, they do offend our uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot. For the past seven years, our goal has been a growing economy that also works better for everybody. We've made progress, but we need to make more. And despite all the political arguments that we've had these past few years, there are actually some areas where Americans broadly agree. We agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good-paying job. The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start, and together, we've increased early childhood education, lifted high school graduation rates to new highs, boosted graduates in fields like engineering. In the coming years, we should build on that progress, by providing Pre-K for all and offering every student...(APPLAUSE)... offering every student the hands-on computer science and math classes that make them job-ready on day one. We should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids. (APPLAUSE)And -- and we have to make college affordable for every American. (APPLAUSE)No hardworking student should be stuck in the red. We've already reduced student loan payments by -- to 10 percent of a borrower's income. And that's good. But now we've actually got to cut the cost of college. (APPLAUSE)Providing two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that, and I'm going to keep fighting to get that started this year. It's the right thing to do. (APPLAUSE)But a great education isn't all we need in this new economy. We also need benefits, and protections that provide a basic measure of security. It's not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job, in the same place with a health, and a retirement package for 30 years are sitting in this chamber. For everyone else, especially folks in their 40's and 50's, saving for retirement, or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher. Americans understand that at some point in their careers, in this new economy, they may have to retool, they may have to retrain, but they shouldn't loose what they've already worked so hard to build in the process. That's why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever, we shouldn't weaken them, we should strengthen them. (APPLAUSE)And for American short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today. That, by the way, is what the Affordable Care Act is all about. It's about filling the gaps in employer based care so that when you lose a job, or you go back to school, or you strike out and launch that new business you'll still have coverage. Nearly 18 million people have gained coverage so far, and in the process...(APPLAUSE) In the process health care inflation has slowed, our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law. Now, I'm guessing we won't agree on health care anytime soon. (APPLAUSE)A little applause right there.(LAUGHTER) Just a guess.But there should be other ways parties can work together improve economic security. Say a hardworking American loses his job, we shouldn't just make sure he can get unemployment insurance; we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that's ready to hire him. If that new job doesn't pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills. And even if he's going from job to job, he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him. That's the way we make the new economy work better for everybody. I also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty. America is about giving everybody willing to work a chance, a hand up, and I'd welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers who don't have children.(APPLAUSE) But there are some areas where we just have to be honest. It has been more difficult to find agreement over the last seven years, and a lot of them fall under the category of what role the government should play in making sure the system's not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations. (APPLAUSE)And it's an honest disagreement. And, the American people have a choice to make.I believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy. I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed, there is red tape that needs to be cut. (APPLAUSE)There you go. Yes.(APPLAUSE)See?But after years of record corporate profits, working families won't get more opportunity or bigger paychecks just by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at everybody else's expense. (APPLAUSE) Middle-class families are not going to feel more secure because we allowed attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered. Food Stamp recipients did not cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did. (APPLAUSE) Immigrants aren't the principal reason wages haven't gone up. Those decisions are made in the boardrooms that all too often put quarterly earnings over long-term returns. It's sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts. (APPLAUSE)The point is, I believe, that in this new economy, workers and start- ups and small businesses need more of a voice, not less. The rules should work for them. And... (APPLAUSE) ... I'm not alone in this. This year, I plan to lift up the many businesses who've figured out that doing right by their workers or their customers or their communities ends up being good for their shareholders... (APPLAUSE) ... and I want to spread those best practices across America. That's part of a brighter future. In fact, it turns out many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative. And this brings me to the second big question we as a country have to answer: how do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges?Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn't deny Sputnik was up there. (LAUGHTER) We didn't argue about the science, or shrink our research and development budget. We built a space program almost overnight, and twelve years later, we were walking on the moon.(APPLAUSE)Now, that spirit of discovery is in our DNA. America is Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver. America is Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride. America is every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley racing to shape a better future. (APPLAUSE) That's who we are, and over the past seven years, we've nurtured that spirit. We've protected an open Internet, and taken bold new steps to get more students and low-income Americans online. (APPLAUSE) We've launched next-generation manufacturing hubs and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day. But we can do so much more. You know, last year, Vice President Biden said that, with a new moon- shot, America can cure cancer. Last month, he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources that they've had in over a decade. (APPLAUSE) Well, so -- so tonight, I'm announcing a new national effort to get it done. And because he's gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past 40 years, I'm putting Joe in charge of mission control. (APPLAUSE) For the loved ones we've all lost, for the families that we can still save, let's make America the country that cures cancer once and for all. What do you think? Let's make it happen.(APPLAUSE) And medical research is critical. We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources. (APPLAUSE)Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it. (LAUGHTER) OBAMA: You will be pretty lonely because you'll be debating our military, most of America's business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world who agree it's a problem and intend to solve it.(APPLAUSE)But even if -- even if the planet wasn't at stake, even if 2014 wasn't the warmest year on record until 2015 turned out even hotter -- why would we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future?(APPLAUSE)Listen, seven years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history. Here are the results. In fields from Iowa to Texas, wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power. On rooftops from Arizona to New York, solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills and employs more Americans than coal -- in jobs that pay better than average. We're taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy -- something, by the way, that environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support. And meanwhile, we've cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly 60 percent and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth.(APPLAUSE)Gas under $2 a gallon ain't bad either.(LAUGHTER)Now we've got to accelerate the transition away from old, dirtier energy sources. Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future, especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels. We do them no favor when we don't show them where the trends are going. And that's why I'm going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet. And that way, we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21st century transportation system.(APPLAUSE) Now, none of this is going to happen overnight, and yes, there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo. But the jobs we'll create, the money we'll save, the planet we'll preserve, that is the kind of future our kids and our grandkids deserve. And it's within our grasp. Now, climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world, and that's why the third big question that we have to answer together is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation- build everywhere there's a problem.I told you earlier all the talk of America's economic decline is political hot air. Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker. Let me tell you something. The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth, period. Period.(APPLAUSE)It's not even close. It's not even close. It's not even close. We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined. (APPLAUSE)Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world. (APPLAUSE)No nation attacks us directly or our allies because they know that's the path to ruin. Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office, and when it comes to every important international issue, people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead. They call us. (APPLAUSE)So I think it's useful to level set here, because when we don't, we don't make good decisions. Now, as someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know this is a dangerous time. But that's not primarily because of some looming superpower out there, and it's certainly not because of diminished American strength. In today's world, we're threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states. The Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation, rooted in conflicts that date back millennia. Economic headwinds are blowing in from a Chinese economy that is in significant transition. Even as their economy severely contracts, Russia is pouring resources in to prop up Ukraine and Syria, client states that they saw slipping away from their orbit. And the international system we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality. It's up to us to help, the United States of America, to help remake that system. And to do that well, it means that we've got to set priorities. Priority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks. (APPLAUSE)Both Al Qaida and now ISIL pose a direct threat to our people, because in today's world, even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life, including their own, can do a lot of damage. They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country; their actions undermine and destabilize our allies. We have to take them out.But as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands. Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages, they pose an enormous danger to civilians, they have to be stopped, but they do not threaten our national existence. That is the story ISIL wants to tell; that's the kind of propaganda they use to recruit. We don't need to build them up to show that we're serious, and we sure don't need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is somehow representative of one of the world's largest religions. (APPLAUSE)We just need to call them what they are: killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out, hunted down, and destroyed. (APPLAUSE)And that's exactly what we're doing. For more than a year, America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL's financing, disrupt their plots, stop the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamp out their vicious ideology. With nearly 10,000 air strikes, we are taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, their vicious ideology. With nearly 10,000 air strikes, we're taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, their weapons. We're training, arming and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria. If this Congress is serious about winning this war and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, authorize the use of military force against ISIL. Take a vote. (APPLAUSE)Take a vote. But the American people should know that, with or without Congressional action, ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them. If you doubt America's commitment -- or mine -- to see that justice is done, just ask Osama bin Laden. (APPLAUSE)Ask -- ask the leader of Al Qaida in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell. When you come after Americans, we go after you. And it may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limits. (APPLAUSE)Our foreign policy has to be focused on the threat from ISIL and Al Qaida, but it can't stop there. For even without ISIL, even without Al Qaida, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world -- in the Middle East, in Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan, in parts of Central America and Africa and Asia. Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks. Others will just fall victim to ethnic conflict or famine, feeding the next wave of refugees. The world will look to us to help solve these problems, and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians. That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn't pass muster on the world stage. We also can't try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis... (APPLAUSE) ... even if it's done with the best of intentions. That's not leadership; that's a recipe for quagmire, spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately will weaken us. It's the lesson of Vietnam. It's the lesson of Iraq, and we should have learned it by now. (APPLAUSE)Fortunately, there is a smarter approach, a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power. It says America will always act, alone if necessary, to protect our people and our allies, but on issues of global concern, we will mobilize the world to work with us, and make sure other countries pull their own weight. That's our approach to conflicts like Syria, where we're partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace. That's why we built a global coalition, with sanctions and principled diplomacy, to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. And as we speak, Iran has rolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and the world has avoided another war. (APPLAUSE)That's how -- that's how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa. (APPLAUSE) Our military, our doctors, our development workers -- they were heroic. They set up the platform that then allowed other countries to join in behind us and stamp out that epidemic. Hundreds of thousands -- maybe a couple million lives were saved. That's how we forged a trans pacific partnership to open markets, and protect workers and the environment, and advance American leadership in Asia. It cuts 18,000 taxes on products made in America which will then support more good jobs here in America. With TPP, China does not set the rules in that region, we do. We want to show our strength in this new century? Approve this agreement, give us the tools to enforce it. It's the right thing to do.(APPLAUSE)Let me give you another example.Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy, it set us back in Latin America. That's why we restored diplomatic relations, opened the door to travel and commerce, positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people.(APPLAUSE)So, if you want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere, recognize that the Cold War is over. Lift the embargo.(APPLAUSE)The point is American leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world, except when we kill terrorists; or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling. Leadership means a wise application of military power, and rallying the world behind causes that are right. It means seeing our foreign assistance as part of our national security, not something separate, not charity. When we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change, yes, that helps vulnerable countries, but it also protects our kids. When we help Ukraine defend its democracy, or Colombia resolve a decades-long war, that strengthens the international order we depend on. When we help African countries feed their people and care for the sick... (APPLAUSE)It's the right thing to do, and it prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores. Now right now, we are on track to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS, that's within our grasp, and we have the chance to accomplish the same thing with malaria, something I'll be pushing this Congress to fund this year.That's American strength. That's American leadership. And that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example. That is why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo. It's expensive, it's unnecessary, and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies. There's a better way.(APPLAUSE)And that's why we need to reject any politics -- any politics that targets people because of race or religion.(APPLAUSE)Let me just say this. This isn't a matter of political correctness. This is a matter of understanding just what it is that makes us strong. The world respects us not just for our arsenal, it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith. His Holiness, Pope Francis, told this body from the very spot I'm standing on tonight that ""to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place."" When politicians insult Muslims, whether abroad, or fellow citizens, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid is called names, that doesn't make us safer. That's not telling it what -- telling it like it is, it's just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. (APPLAUSE)It makes it harder to achieve our goals. It betrays who we are as a country. ""We the People."" Our Constitution begins with those three simple words, words we've come to recognize mean all the people, not just some. Words that insist we rise and fall together, that that's how we might perfect our union. And that brings me to the fourth, and maybe most important thing that I want to say tonight. The future we want, all of us want -- opportunity and security for our families, a rising standard of living, a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids -- all that is within our reach. But it will only happen if we work together. It will only happen if we can have rational, constructive debates. It will only happen if we fix our politics.A better politics doesn't mean we have to agree on everything. This is a big country, different regions, different attitudes, different interests. That's one of our strengths, too. Our Founders distributed power between states and branches of government, and expected us to argue, just as they did, fiercely, over the size and shape of government, over commerce and foreign relations, over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security.But democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens. It doesn't -- it doesn't work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice, it doesn't work if we think that our political opponents are unpatriotic or trying to weaken America. Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise or when even basic facts are contested or when we listen only to those who agree with us. Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get all the attention. And most of all, democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesn't matter; that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some special interest. Too many Americans feel that way right now. It's one of the few regrets of my presidency -- that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better. I have no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide, and I guarantee I'll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office.But my fellow Americans, this cannot be my task -- or any president's -- alone. There are a whole lot of folks in this chamber -- good people -- who would like to see more cooperation, would like to see a more elevated debate in Washington but feel trapped by the imperatives of getting elected, by the noise coming out of your base. I know; you've told me. It's the worst-kept secret in Washington. And a lot of you aren't enjoying being trapped in that kind of rancor. But that means if we want a better politics -- and I'm addressing the American people now -- if we want a better politics, it's not enough just to change a congressman or change a senator or even change a president. We have to change the system to reflect our better selves. But that means if we want a better politics -- and I'm addressing the American people now -- if we want a better politics, it's not enough just to change a congressman or change a senator or even change a president. We have to change the system to reflect our better selves.I think we've got to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters and not the other way around. (APPLAUSE)Let a bipartisan group do it. (APPLAUSE)I believe we've got to reduce the influence of money in our politics, so that a handful of families or hidden interests can't bankroll our elections.(APPLAUSE)And if our existing approach to campaign finance reform can't pass muster in the courts, we need to work together to find a real solution, because it's a problem. And most of you don't like raising money. I know. I've done it.We've got to make it easier to vote, not harder. We need to modernize it for the way we live now. (APPLAUSE)This is America. We want to make it easier for people to participate. And over the course of this year, I intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do just that. But I can't do these things on my own. Changes in our political process -- in not just who gets elected, but how they get elected -- that will only happen when the American people demand it. It depends on you. That's what's meant by a government of, by, and for the people. What I'm suggesting is hard. It's a lot easier to be cynical, to accept that change is not possible, and politics is hopeless, and the problem is, all the folks who are elected don't care, and to believe that our voices and our actions don't matter. But if we give up now, then we forsake a better future. Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war, or allow another economic disaster, or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought, even died, to secure. And then, as frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall back into our respective tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don't look like us, or pray like us, or vote like we do, or share the same background. We can't afford to go down that path. It won't deliver the economy we want. It will not produce the security we want. But most of all, it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world. So, my fellow Americans, whatever you may believe, whether you prefer one party or no party, whether you supported my agenda or fought as hard as you could against it, our collective futures depends on your willingness to uphold your duties as a citizen, to vote, to speak out, to stand up for others, especially the weak, especially the vulnerable, knowing that each of us is only here because somebody somewhere stood up for us. (APPLAUSE)We need every American to stay active in our public life and not just during election time so that our public life reflects the goodness and the decency that I see in the American people every single day. It is not easy. Our brand of democracy is hard. But I can promise that, a little over a year from now, when I no longer hold this office, I will be right there with you as a citizen, inspired by those voices of fairness and vision, of grit and good humor and kindness, that have helped America travel so far. Voices that help us see ourselves not first and foremost as black or white or Asian or Latino; not as gay or straight, immigrant or native born; not Democrat or Republican; but as Americans first, bound by a common creed. Voices Dr. King believed would have the final word -- voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love. And they're out there, those voices. They don't get a lot of attention. They don't seek a lot of fanfare, but they're busy doing the work this country needs doing. I see them everywhere I travel in this incredible country of ours. I see you, the American people. And in your daily acts of citizenship, I see our future unfolding. I see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open, and the boss who pays him higher wages instead of laying him off. I see it in the Dreamer who stays up late at night to finish her science project, and the teacher who comes in early, maybe with some extra supplies that she bought, because she knows that that young girl might someday cure a disease. I see it in the American who's served his time, made bad mistakes as a child, but now is dreaming of starting over, and I see it in the business owner who gives him that second chance; the protester determined to prove that justice matters; and the young cop walking the beat, treating everybody with respect, doing the brave, quiet work of keeping us safe. (APPLAUSE)I see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers, the nurse who tends to him until he can run a marathon, the community that lines up to cheer him on. It's the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is, and the father whose love for that son overrides everything he's been taught. (APPLAUSE) I see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to; the new citizen who casts his vote for the first time; the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count, because each of them, in different ways, know how much that precious right is worth. That's the America I know. That's the country we love. Clear- eyed, big-hearted, undaunted by challenge, optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word. That's what makes me so hopeful about our future. (APPLAUSE) I believe in change because I believe in you, the American people. And that's why I stand here, as confident as I have ever been, that the state of our Union is strong. (APPLAUSE)Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. BLITZER: A very, very forceful speech by the president hitting so many issues clearly designed to try to solidify his legacy. He was blunt and some not so subtle. Very tough criticism of republican presidential candidates on several very sensitive issues. Jake Tapper, this was a speech that the president wants the American public to remember. TAPPER: This is the book end in the film of Obama. This is the end speech. This is the one that you run at the very end after you started the movie, the drama with those early-day speeches perhaps the one from the 2004 democratic convention when he was first introduced to the the people. [22:15:11] It was a very forceful defense of his legacy, an instruction or lecturing or fact checking from I'm sure his point of view, talking about how the United States of America is the strongest, most powerful nation in the country -- in the world. How we have the strongest, most durable economy in the world. And in many ways, a direct repudiation of some of the language we're hearing, some of the rhetoric we're hearing on the campaign trail from republicans. You heard allusions to remarks Ted Cruz made about carpet bombing civilians in President Obama's characterization, how you need more than tough talk that doesn't wash. You heard a lot of revenues to Donald Trump and the president's characterization of a demonizing, going after the people based on their religion and their race. There was even a shot or two at other candidates on the campaign trail like Chris Christie, his reference to the fight against ISIS being World War III. So, a strong defense of himself, couched in an optimistic way talking about the way he looked at the world, and also, a very harsh judgment at some of the language and some of the reaction he has heard to his presidency from republicans on the campaign trail, Wolf. BLITZER: He spoke for almost exactly one hour. Dana Bash, you listened to every word. He did acknowledged and hears to the very end that one of the few regrets of his presidency was the rancor and suspicion between the parties here in Washington has gotten worse instead of better during these past seven years. BASH: That was one of the most fascinating and telling moments from my perspective, of the entire speech. I have watched the Obama presidency from the perch of Capitol Hill and watched what everybody thought would be potentially a new era in Washington back seven years ago, when he came in, unravel slowly but surely and as he said gotten worse. First of all, just on a personal level, you don't hear this president talk about regrets very much, especially in such a forum like this, but also, because he's right that things got worse. I will give you a little bit of a reality check having witnessed it and sort of been a part of it for the past seven years, it won't both ways. I think the irony is the fact that the president started out with a super majority of democrats in the Senate and a majority in the House, the entire democratic control, almost at the end of the day, hurt him because he didn't have to reach out to republicans. He was too worried about his own party and then things sort of went downhill with politically at least with of course him pushing his health care bill. So, there's no question he is right. Things are very -- are much worse. And if you go back in time and think about as, you know, we heard the hope and change when he came in here it is ironic and certainly not worthy that he admitted that it is a regret. BLITZER: Anderson, now earlier today, the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, like Donald Trump said that the state of the economy is a mess, the State of the Union right now -- the State of the Union, the president says is strong. ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: And not only that that he trumpeted the unemployment numbers, comparing it to what it was that he inherited when he took office. I want to bring in our analyst, chief national correspondent, John King, political commentator, Michael Smerconish, chief political analyst, Gloria Borger, and senior political commentator and former Obama senior advisor, David Axelrod. David, let's start with you. And I think for a lot of people who voted for this president, perhaps, what they heard tonight harkens back to what they heard back in 2008 on the campaign trail. DAVID AXELROD, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Now this was pure Obama. I mean, really what he was saying is that we live in times of great change. We are a strong resilient country, we can either embrace that change and adapt to it and grab it and make it an opportunity or we can allow it to be used to tear us apart. And that's really the essence of -- he is a -- we are talking about a transformational president. He is a president in a time of change, and we've seen. We need to go backwards and resort to tribalism and fight with each other or we can move forward with confidence. He was urging that second course. COOPER: And as Jake said, I mean, definitely commenting on a lot of the rhetoric we're hearing on the republican side. GLORIA BORGER, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST: Right. Absolutely. Taking on Donald Trump, taking on Ted Cruz on the issue of the called to carpet bomb civilians, that was that he referenced to Cruz.I think this was a Barack Obama's version of his view of American exceptionalism. He's always been criticized by republicans for not believing that America is exceptional. And tonight, he made the case about why America is exceptional as he also set the agenda for the next democratic nominee. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I never really understood that because I don't know anybody...BORGER: Right.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ... anybody who believes more deeply in America. He believes that he's lived it. [22:15:00] BORGER: But here's the thing about Obama, he is not going to be president any more. But this was a speech for the next democratic president. Because his legacy depends on a democratic president getting elected. Because if there is no democratic president, all those executive orders go away. Obamacare can be undone. And he understands that and I think this was sort of taking it a step to the future and saying this is the course for you, and in it, I must say, it sounded a little bit like he was channeling Bernie Sanders on economic policy. A very political speech. The language wasn't terribly harsh but it takes down to Gloria's note, definitely going after Donald Trump several times, going after Ted Cruz, specifically Chris Christie, more broadly, going after the republicans on just economics. He said they're wrong, what they're selling you is fiction. On climate change, keep denying it if you want but you are wrong. The leadership in the world and the things he has done on the global stage, he says they are wrong and essentially, you know, reject them. That is what the president was saying, without saying it, so why do I, is reject them. Here's my big question, can he change minds at this point in his presidency? I post the question because he's been under water in his approval ratings for 29 months now on average. But no question this will rally the democrats. And he was essentially telling the country to elect a democrat. He didn't name them. But elect the -- but can he -- can he breakthrough at this moment or not only because his standing is down because the clock is ticking on him when you're left, but because the campaign to replace him so is competitive, is so exciting, is so interesting and is getting so much of the attention. And we will tomorrow afternoon. We're talking about the latest poll in Iowa and New Hampshire.(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Or they change that...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Or was he speaking to the emerging American majority that elected him twice by significant margins? I think that's what he was leading.BORGER: Well, I think to me...(CROSSTALK)COOPER: Michael, how do you think America heard this? MICHAEL SMERCONISH, CNN HOST, ""SMERCONISH"": I think the most important part of his speech; first of all, I like the approach instead of just rattling off a laundry list. And he did get most of the things and that you would hear in the laundry list. I like drilling down on several big picture items. The one line that sums it up for me, public life withers when only the most extreme voices get attention. I was so pleased that he addressed fixing the political system as his fourth point. Because without doing that, frankly, nothing else matters. BORGER: You know, I think that the president really understands, to John's point about changing people's minds. This is not going to be a persuasion election. This is going to be a mobilization election. Nobody's minds going to get changed any more. But what the president is trying to do is say you people who support -- who supported my coalition for the next democratic nominee, you have to be there. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't want to be poly-annaish about this, but honestly, I think he was speaking beyond the election. He was saying these are the challenges that are going to define our future and we need to meet them with confidence, we need to embrace change, we need to re-knit together our American community. BORGER: Fix this. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We need to face and we need to revitalize our democracy. COOPER: Let's also bring Paul Begala, Van Jones, and Mike Rogers, just to get your quick feedback on what you think. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This was Obama at his best. You had the 2008 idealism, plus, the 2012 fighting spirit. And those two things to get a baffle in, you know, Obama is at his best. I thought it was so important that he stood with the Muslims. I thought it was so important that he chastised republicans for putting America down and building ISIL up. He said like, you don't have to build them up, just take them out. And I thought that was very, very good. I also thought he snuck something in there that could prove very, very important. He gave an olive branch to Paul Ryan for reaching out to the poor. Now remember, Paul Ryan said that makers versus takers. And he said the -- you have makers in the country and you have takers. You know, talking about poor people on welfare. Paul Ryan apologized for that, didn't get credit for it. And Paul Ryan is reaching out for poor people, and this president reached back. That is a big deal. That plus criminal justice which Paul Ryan was worked on he might have a path way through. That was important tonight. COOPER: And obviously, we're going to be hearing from the republican side, the republican response. So, this is Amanda Carpenter from spokesperson of Ted Cruz, what did you hear tonight? AMANDA CARPENTER, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, looking at the arc of Obama's presidency when he came into office in 2009 with the super majority in Congress, and now when you listen to the applause that is so much quieter because they are so -- there is fewer democrats in the chamber.And so, looking at what -- where he has left the Democratic Party as a whole, he lost the Senate, he lost the House. They lost a dozen governor seats. He's lost hundreds of states -- seats from the state legislature, what does the Democratic Party become? Right now it's fighting to be led by, you know, a socialist from Vermont, and Paul may hate this, but a former president's wife. They are in shambles and I don't think Obama can pick up the pieces. He's broken the White House for the democrat, and I don't think he'll get that.(CROSSTALK) COOPER: Also a former senator. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think Hillary Clinton is more than.CARPENTER: Well.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Reasonable accomplished.CARPENTER: Well, I have to say that's the...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have to be a fan of his husband, too. He seems like a nice guy.COOPER: Paul, what did you think? PAUL BEGALA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I thought it was a terrific speech first. I will quiver a little bit. Axel is probably right and I'm wrong. He is looking directly at the election. [22:20:03] And I think while, yes, you can see this about Ted Cruz and this about Chris Christie. This is a rejection of 'Trumpism.' He referred to the very top of the speech to political hot air and anyone he said claiming that America's economy is in decline is peddling fiction, and he went through each one of this. Whether it was climate change, whether there was a notion that...(CROSSTALK) COOPER: In fact, let's play -- let's play that sound bite and then we'll continue with Paul.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: I told you earlier all the talk of America's economic decline is political hot air. Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker. Let me tell you something, the United States of America is the most powerful nation on earth, period. Period.(APPLAUSE)OBAMA: Period. It's not even close. It's not even close.(APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) BEGALA: That is a heat-seeking missile right at Donald J. Trump.COOPER: Yes.BEGALA: OK? And what I loved about it as a speechwriter is in tone and temperament was also a rejection, it was very strong, but it was bombastic, it wasn't insulting. He did reach out to the other side especially to Speaker Ryan. So, I couldn't be happier, I know Amanda thinks that my party is decimated. My party can run on this. My party will win.CARPENTER: Well, I will say because...(CROSSTALK)COOPER: Sir, regardless, did you hear him reaching out? MIKE ROGERS, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY COMMENTATOR: Listen, I thought it was a great speech. The rhetoric is good. This was a great speech for 2009 for Barack Obama. He's had seven years. He proposed nothing. He is living in fantasy land when he tells you things that if you are in a union bar in Michigan right now, they don't believe a word that he just said because they're living that economic picture in their lives. BEGALA: They have jobs in that union bar because he saved the auto industry and the republicans tried to stop him. I'm sorry, Mike. But, come on, you have to give the guys a credit. He saved the autos...(CROSSTALK) ROGERS: No. Listen, you are absolutely living in fantasy land. There has been no median wage increase. And 94 million Americans have opted out of the work force. Their cost on health care have gone up. And what they're feeling -- what you're seeing is Americans rejecting even the institutions of government. So, this isn't just about Trump or it's not Cruz or any republican candidate and, by the way, this irks me when he does -- this is typical Obama. He says, you know, we have to reject the division of politics and al of that great rhetoric, and then he goes on to go after republicans because they disagree with his positions. I think this is exactly the problem. I saw more of the same. I think you're going to see a more emboldened American populous because they are living the economics of America that they don't align with right and that's democrats, too. VAN JONES, CNN POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR: But hold on to one second. Let's just be clear. Romney said in 2012, Obama is terrible. If you elect me I will give you 6 percent unemployment. We have 5 percent unemployment. My good friend, Newt Gingrich said, Obama is terrible. Elect me I'll give you $3 gas. We have $2 gas which he opposed. (CROSSTALK)BEGALA: It was opposed.JONES: No, he didn't. Listen, why do we have cheap gas? He provided over the shale revolution increasing supply and energy efficiency pulling down demand. Obama...(CROSSTALK)COOPER: Luckily we are on the last two hours to the business to the business, a lot to discuss. But we do have the republican response so we want to go to, Wolf... BLITZER: Hear the republican response now from Nikki Haley, the Governor of South Carolina. She is coming to our own, Jake. TAPPER: That's right. A two-term Governor of South Carolina and she really had the national stage and an opportunity when she made the decision and the announcement to bring down the Confederate Flag from the South Carolina Capitol. It was a moment that the whole nation was watching and emotion -- and the moment that republican officials in Washington really paid a lot of attention.. BLITZER: She's been the governor since 2011. She's got a lot of potential republicans say, including maybe a vice presidential nominee. Let's listen.GOV. NIKKI HALEY (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: Good evening. I'm Nikki Haley, Governor of the great state of South Carolina.I'm speaking tonight from Columbia, our state's capital city. Much like America as a whole, our state has a rich and complicated history, one that proves the idea that each day can be better than the last. In just a minute, I'm going to talk about a vision of a brighter American future. But first, I want to say a few words about President Obama who just gave his final State of the Union address.Barack Obama's election as president seven years ago broke historic barriers and inspired millions of Americans. As he did when he first ran for office, tonight, President Obama spoke eloquently about grand things. He's at his best when he does that.Unfortunately, the president's record has often fallen far short of his soaring words. As he enters his final year in office, many Americans are still feeling the squeeze of an economy too weak to raise income levels. We're feeling a crushing national debt, a health care plan that has made insurance less affordable and doctors less available, and chaotic unrest in many of our cities. Even worse, we are facing the most dangerous terrorist threat our nation has seen since September 11th, and this president appears unwilling or unable to deal with it.Soon the Obama presidency will end, and America will have the chance to turn in a new direction. That direction is what I want to talk about tonight. At the outset, I'll say this. You've paid attention to what has been happening in Washington, and you're not naive. Neither am I. I see what you see, and many of your frustrations are my frustrations. A frustration with a government that has grown day after day, year after year, yet doesn't serve us any better. A frustration with the same endless conversations we hear over and over again. A frustration with promises made and never kept.We need to be honest with each other and with ourselves. While Democrats in Washington bear much responsibility for the problems facing America today, they do not bear it alone. There is more than enough blame to go around.We as Republicans need to own that truth. We need to recognize our contributions to the erosion of the public trust in America's leadership. We need to accept that we've played a role in how and why our government is broken. And then we need to fix it.The foundation that has made America that last best hope on Earth hasn't gone anywhere, it still exists. It's up to us to return to it. For me, that starts right where it always has. I am the proud daughter of Indian immigrants who reminded my brothers, my sister and me every day how blessed we were to live in this country. Growing up in the rural south, my family didn't look like our neighbors, and we didn't have much. There were times that were tough, but we had each other and we had the opportunity to do anything, to be anything, as long as we were willing to work for it.My story is really not much different from millions of other Americans. Immigrants have been coming to our shores for generations to live the dream that is America. They wanted better for their children than for themselves. That remains the dream of all of us, and in this country we have seen time and again that that dream is achievable.Today, we live in a time of threats like few others in recent memory. During anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation.No one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country. At the same time, that does not mean we just flat out open our borders. We can't do that. We cannot continue to allow immigrants to come here illegally, and in this age of terrorism, we must not let in refugees whose intentions cannot be determined.We must fix our broken immigration system. That means stopping illegal immigration and it means welcoming properly vetted legal immigrants, regardless of their race or religion, just like we have for centuries.I have no doubt that if we act with proper focus, we can protect our borders, our sovereignty and our citizens, all while remaining true to America's noblest legacies. This past summer, South Carolina was dealt a tragic blow. On an otherwise ordinary Wednesday evening in June, at the historic Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston, 12 faithful men and women, young and old, went to Bible study. That night, someone new joined them. He didn't look like them, didn't act like them, didn't sound like them. They didn't throw him out, they didn't call the police. Instead, they pulled up a chair and prayed with him for an hour. We lost nine incredible souls that night. What happened after the tragedy is worth pausing to think about.Our state was struck with shock, pain and fear, but our people would not allow hate to win. We didn't have violence, we had vigils. We didn't have riots, we had hugs. We didn't turn against each other's race or religion, we turned toward God, and to the values that have long made our country the freest and greatest in the world.We removed a symbol that was being used to divide us, and we found a strength that united us against a domestic terrorist and the hate that filled him. There's an important lesson in this. In many parts of society today, whether in popular culture, academia, the media, or politics, there's a tendency to falsely equate noise with results. Some people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference. That's just not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume. When the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying. And that can make a world of difference. Of course, that doesn't mean we won't have strong disagreements. We will. And as we usher in this new era, Republicans will stand up for our beliefs. If we held the White House, taxes would be lower for working families, and we'd put the brakes on runaway spending and debt. We would encourage American innovation and success instead of demonizing them, so our economy would truly soar and good jobs would be available across our country. We would reform education so it worked best for students, parents and teachers, not Washington bureaucrats and union bosses. We would end a disastrous health care program, and replace it with reforms that lowered costs and actually let you keep your doctor. We would respect differences in modern families, but we would also insist on respect for religious liberty as a cornerstone of our democracy. We would recognize the importance of the separation of powers and honor the Constitution in its entirety. And yes, that includes the Second and Tenth Amendments. We would make international agreements that were celebrated in Israel and protested in Iran, not the other way around. And rather than just thanking our brave men and women in uniform, we would actually strengthen our military, so both our friends and our enemies would know that America seeks peace, but when we fight wars, we win them. We have big decisions to make. Our country is being tested. But we've been tested in the past, and our people have always risen to the challenge. We have all the guidance we need to be safe and successful. Our forefathers paved the way for us. Let's take their values, and their strengths, and rededicate ourselves to doing whatever it takes to keep America the greatest country in the history of man -- and woman. Thank you, good night, and God bless. BLITZER: Nikki Haley, the Governor of South Carolina with the republican response. Jake, there were several lines in there that seem to be at least indirect criticism of republican presidential front runner Donald Trump. TAPPER: That's right. There were two shadows over the State of the Union this evening. One is those 10 American sailors being held captive by Iran right now. They have not been mentioned by either President Obama or the republican responder, Governor Nikki Haley. The other, of course, is the republican race and Donald Trump specifically. We heard lots of veiled references to Donald Trump and his rhetoric from President Obama. And then, Nikki Haley, a fellow republican, referring to the siren call of the angriest voices and how we must resist that temptation. We should remember, Nikki Haley, last month, gave one of the most forceful denunciations we've heard of Donald Trump's proposed to ban on Muslims entering the country that we heard from anyone much less a republican calling it an embarrassment, un-American, unconstitutional, and just plain wrong. Keep in mind, republican officials here in D.C. heard that and picked her to give the address. BLITZER: The president didn't mention Donald Trump by name but the reference was clear. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: Democracy grinds to a halt without willingness to compromise. Or when even basic facts are contested. Or when we listen only to those who agree with us. Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get all the attention. And most of all, democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesn't matter that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some special interest. Too many Americans feel that way right now. (END VIDEO CLIP)BLITZER: So, it's clear the president, he certainly is irritated by what he is hearing from these republican presidential candidates especially Donald Trump. [22:35:02] TAPPER: Yes. Although when you heard President Obama talk about the people who feel that they don't have a voice, who feel like the decades dunked against them. That's also one of the reasons for Donald Trump's popularity right now. That's one of the reasons why people are coming to his rallies, they feel that he speaks for them and the republican leadership in Congress and other republican candidates do not. So, in some ways, President Obama was condemning and also diagnosing Donald Trump's rise. BLITZER: He outlined specific strategies that he has in mind in dealing with national security. But as you point out, he did not specifically mention those 10 U.S. sailors who are currently being held by Iran. TAPPER: That's right. Even though, Paul Ryan, the House Speaker, called for him basically in a statement before the State of the Union address, called for him to give an update to the American people about it, about this status, the president did not. We're told by a senior White House official that's because they feel that the situation is in hand. And the sailors will be returned and are being treated well. So, they didn't want to highlight that. National security was an area of the speech where I thought President Obama -- first of all, he was making a very strong defense of the Obama doctrine, if you will, which is still this wariness to involve the United States in the affairs of other countries, saying that it's a recipe for quagmire sometimes even if there are good intentions. That's the lesson of the atonement (ph) ultimately it weakens us. He was defending in action in places like Syria. And yet, in another moment, when he was talking about ISIS, Wolf, and he kind of belittled them, I wouldn't say -- it was basically the definition of the word smattering of applause was heard in the room, not a lot of strong applause for him when he was talking about that these are some thugs in trucks we shouldn't glorify. BLITZER: It's not every day you hear a President of the United States in a State of the Union address confess, regrets, deep regrets, mistakes that were made over the past several years. TAPPER: No, not at all. But he was defending, I think it's fair to say, the -- his refusal to send combat ground troops, although there obviously are boots on the ground in Iraq, refusal to send them. BLITZER: Listen to this. This is the president very, very candid, very blunt.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: It's one of the few regrets of my presidency that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better. I have no doubt. A president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide. And I guarantee I'll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office.(END VIDEO CLIP) BLITZER: He is promising he is going to try to work harder in his final year in office to bridge that gap, work with the republicans to get some more accomplished. TAPPER: And one of the moments we've heard about from republicans in some areas where there might be room for discussion and bipartisan work, making college more affordable, you saw President Obama extends the all of the branch that Van Jones pointed out of talking about poverty lifting people out of poverty. One of the most popular moments of the night was when he talked about basically he compared trying to cure cancer to when John F. Kennedy set his sights on the moon and said that Joe Biden would be in charge of mission control. That was a stirring moment given the vice president's loss of his son. BLITZER: Let's play that clip right now. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: Last year, Vice President Biden said that with a new moon shot, America can cure cancer. Last month, he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources that they've had in over a decade.(APPLAUSE)OBAMA: So, tonight, I'm announcing a new national effort to get it done. And because he's gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past 40 years, I'm putting Joe in charge of mission control. (APPLAUSE)OBAMA: For the loved ones we've all lost. For the families that we can still save, let's make America the country that cures cancer once and for all. What do you say, Joe? Let's make it happen.(APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)BLITZER: A very emotional moment as all of our viewers does. He lost his son, Beau Biden to cancer not that long ago. TAPPER: Beau Biden was a great guy. You saw in the audience there standing and applauding not just democrats, but one of the rare moments where you saw people like the House majority whip, a republican, Steve Scalise, the house majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, both republicans standing and applauding, giving the president a standing ovation. [22:40:08] BLITZER: Yes. Joe Biden has got a mission in the next year. We'll see what he does. All right, Anderson, back to you. COOPER: Wolf and Jake, thank you. I'm wondering from our panelists was it a good night for Donald Trump? I mean, the fact that you have President Obama criticizing him and Nikki Haley for his supporters is that elevating Donald Trump? ROGERS: Yes. This is exactly what Mr. Trump wants, too. He is -- everybody in the Republican Party disapproves of the president. OK. The Trump voters hate it. So, when the president singles him out that's great for Mr. Trump that suggests that perhaps he is authentic to his face, right? Which is just to stole an art here even though you're in Republican Party.But then, Nikki Haley, he can say, Trump will say if he hadn't by now, he's going to tweet it, to see the establishment is out to get me. Somehow, an Indian -- a child of Indian immigrants is now GOP the establishment. But God bless her. I think Trump is going to say it. The establishment is out to get me. Obama is out to get me, it's just you and me that can follow...(CROSSTALK)COOPER: Amanda, your take. CARPENTER: Yes. I think it was a mistake for Nikki Haley to kind of, you know, sub-tweet Donald Trump on giving a response to State of the Union. We have to quit the self-loathing among the Republican Party. That is seems we'd evidenced at. We have a loud party; we have a lot of differing views. We should be welcoming as many people as we can, and the fact that Donald Trump is addressing the anger that you know, President Obama wants to believe doesn't exist, we have to stop saying that that republican...(CROSSTALK)ROGERS: Republicans hate their party and democrats love their party. This is a difference in our country. Democrats love their party and they love their president.SMERCONISH: Oh, my gosh. This is so nice. JONES: I thought Nikki Haley did something extraordinarily important for the country. She showed you could be a very tough conservative, a very strong conservative, a very, frankly, proud conservative but you don't have to be mean to people. And I think she was calling her party up. She wasn't calling Trump out as much I think is calling her party up. And that's important tonight.SMERCONISH: I think it is stunning, though, that you have the President of the United States and in the rebuttal speech delivered by a member of the opposition party both, I think, trashing the republican front runner and I'll bet much to the delight of both sides of the aisle. That's the point, where is the support for Trump within the well of the Congress? Was there anybody sitting they are saying, oh, my God, this is terrible. The president is going after Trump, I doubt it. BORGER: Nowhere. But I think she went intentionally rogue. I mean, this is not a speech that was vetted by -- you know, that wasn't vetted. Republicans vetted this speech. And when she said we need to own the truth that we, as republicans, are partly responsible for the dysfunction in Washington that was kind of...(CROSSTALK) ROGERS: So, I don't think... BORGER: .... a big moment for her, though. ROGERS: ... I don't think, well, I would -- that was -- it was remarkable. But I don't think it was going rogue. I don't think you can say they looked at her speech.(CROSSTALK)BORGER: You can (Inaudible) but you agree with her.ROGERS: I think they chose a governor, obviously a minority but also a governor from outside of Washington.BORGER: Right.ROGERS: Because they understand how much loathing there is for this town generally and particularly in their party and they want to cleanse themselves of the stench of this town. BORGER: So, she said...KING: She is a governor who was speaking, though, for the republican establishment tonight. She may not be one of these members. BORGER: Yes.KING: But when you get that role you were speaking for the establishment. She is also the governor of the state that comes third in the presidential nominating process. The republican establishment wants to keep Donald Trump at 30 percent. Because they are hoping by the time they get to South Carolina then there is only three or four candidates left and 30 percent can't win. Thirty percent can win Iowa, 30 percent can win New Hampshire with 12 people in the race. The republican establishment is hoping that when you get to South Carolina and Nevada and beyond, then you've got a four or five candidate race. And Donald -- if you keep Donald Trump at 30 percent or below then they hope they can beat him. The question is who is the other candidate? We assume Ted Cruz will be there. Who is going to be this main stream republican at that point? Because at the moment, the closest it's Rubio, maybe in Iowa, it's Christie or Rubio or Kasich in New Hampshire, we don't know how all...(CROSSTALK) ROGERS: And if New Hampshire doesn't answer that question you won't get the reduction of the field that you need to not...(CROSSTALK)COOPER: Senator...BORGER: I think she is kind of... ROGERS: I think we're missing one important point here. Donald Trump is appealing as much to democrats as he is to republicans. And anybody that misses this point by missing the folks on the street who are drawn to his campaign. He's got this whole group of democrats for Trump, it's an economic issue. There will be a republican candidate who can speak to these economic issues in a way that doesn't offend average Americans - I think Nikki Haley proved that point tonight - that that's where you're going to see the strength of this Republican Party. But some notion that this is the Republican Party imploding on itself. This is a Republican Party attracting democrats, independents, Reagan democrats to a message that says this town is broken. The institutions of government are broken. The economy is broken.So, when the president comes up and says, hey, everything is fine. Don't worry about it. Oh, buy the way, I want everyone to get along. I didn't say that the last seven years, but this last year, I want everyone to get along. And by the way, then he attacks republicans...(CROSSTALK)BORGER: Are you talking about...ROGERS: ... shows, whole -- you bet. You want... BORGER: Are you talking about independents or are you talking about democrats? [22:44:59] ROGERS: ... when the stand -- when the polls are out -- this is fascinating. I'm not for any candidate. I'm just telling you when you look at the polls and you talk to folks who are actually working Americans back where -- or district like I come from in Michigan, which is a working class district, they're saying, you know what, this Trump makes sense to me. Nothing seems to be working. JONES: Both political parties -- Mike, both parties - I agree with you - need to be worried because the populist on both sides are much stronger than I think any of the establishment folks and either party want to acknowledge. There is real pain out there, there is real fear out there and these other voices are calling people for it. But I think it's important. I think a star was born tonight. I think Nikki Haley probably gave -- I think Obama gave his best State of the Union; she may have given one of the best responses to a State of the Union, period. I think that's important to note.(CROSSTALK) ROGERS: But the notion...JONES: You need to listen to a lot more republicans. SMERCONISH: You're going to find that she is in the mainstream of the Republican Party. JONES: But she did it beautifully.ROGERS: Right. But the notion that...JONES: She did it beautifully. ROGERS: The notion that Trump is appealing to democrats is myth, not math. Trump, he has a higher negative among democrats than various forms of syphilis. That's why I want him to be the republican nominee. OK?JONES: That may be true but...(CROSSTALK)ROGERS: Hang on. COOPER: How many forms of syphilis are there? That sounds familiar. SMERCONSIH: Are you saying that most democrats on syphilis? My goodness. ROGERS: I just want to make love not war. OK. You guys can't do either. AXELROD: These general election numbers are -- these general election numbers are disastrous. So, I mean, we have...(CROSSTALK) JONES: They're better...AXELROD: But, Van, I must say if -- I found her speech moving as well. But if you and I found her speech moving I don't know how it's going to play in the main stream of the Republican Party. COOPER: She is in the main stream of the Republican Party, though. This notion that she is not...(CROSSTALK)AXELROD: Mike, when is that party going to show itself? ROGERS: She did something very important. COOPER: The reason we call the majority legislatures and governors -- that's the majority of these republicans around the country.ROGERS: We're talking about the -- we're talking about the presidential race. COOPER: And they are governing. KING: Amanda, eager for your view being a Cruz republican. CARPENTER: I'm a conservative republican. I think that Nikki Haley did a beautiful job. I am a little bit irritated with the self- loathing that came out. I do not think that she had to critique Donald Trump. I do not think that she had to make the GOP take responsibility for the dysfunction in Congress. She had a primetime platform. I want to see a robust happy defense of conservative values. COOPER: Let's just hold on one second. Dana Bash is standing by with Senator Sanders. Let's go to her. Dana? BASH: Thanks, Anderson. Senator, thank you very much for joining me.SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, (I-VT) DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: My pleasure.BASH: I appreciate it. We watched you during the speech. What did you think; were you happy with the president's message? SANDERS: I thought it was an excellent speech. I think the president talked about the fact that we can utilize the changing world in a way that benefits all of us and that we should not be afraid of change. And one of the points that he made which moved me very much, is that a time of massive income and wealth and inequality when so many people believe their voices and their ideas no longer matter. What he said, get involved in the political process no matter what your point of views. Don't allow billionaires and large corporations to be able to make all of the decisions. I thought that was important. BASH: We heard that we thought maybe you would like that part of the speech. During the president's speech while you were in the chamber, Hillary Clinton released an ad that it ran digitally and initially it's going to run in Iowa and New Hampshire starting tomorrow, specifically on guns. I want you to take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: An average of 90 people are killed by guns in this country every single day. It has to stop. President Obama wants to make universal background checks the law of the land and he wants to make sure gun manufacturers can finally be held accountable when their guns are used to kill our children. It's time to pick a side. Either we stand with the gun lobby or we join the president and stand up to them. I'm with him. Please join us. I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message.(END VIDEO CLIP) BASH: Now the reason we wanted to play that for you isn't just because it happened during the speech, but is because it's not so subtle attempt to get the voters -- to get the voters to say, pick a side, meaning her side, and not your side on an issue that she has been hitting you on. SANDERS: Let me just say this, first of all, I stand with the president on gun issues. The idea of expanding instant background checks, the idea of making sure that people who have criminal backgrounds or mentally unstable should not have guns is something I have believed in all our lives. Now, we're going to run an ad ourselves and that ad is going to say, you know what, when millions of seniors are trying to get by on $11, $12,000 a year social security, disabled vets are struggling, maybe we should raise social security benefits by lifting the cap on taxable income. So, we look forward to Secretary Clinton coming on board with that issue so that millions of seniors can live in dignity. BASH: So, we will ask here about that. Sticking on the issue of guns, I want you to clear something up if you don't mind. In 2005, we heard about a lot of discussion about your vote to shield gun manufactory -- gun manufactures, rather, from liability. In the past few days, you have said that you would...(CROSSTALK) [22:50:02] SANDERS: Well, for the last several months, I have said that I'm willing to relook that piece of legislation. BASH: Right. OK.SANDERS: That it's a long build. There are things in it that are good, there are things in it and bad. BASH: Right. But then yesterday, at the black and brown forum in Iowa, you said the vote wasn't a mistake. So, can you square those two things? It sounds like a contradict.SANDERS: Well, no, no, Dana. There are votes that have a lot of things in it. And there were some parts of that bill that are right, some parts of the bill that are wrong. And I am, as I said several months ago, willing to relook that. But I think it's important as the issue of guns are. And the fact that we have so many gun deaths, we also have to focus on other issues. And that includes the disappearance of the American middle class, a corrupt campaign finance system where candidates like Secretary Clinton have PACs that are bringing in huge amount of money from very wealthy and powerful special interests, and the fact that we have got to demand that the wealthiest people in this country start paying their fair share of taxes. BASH: Absolutely. But I just want to confirm because I do understand how legislation works. What you are -- what you are saying is that the broad piece of legislation which included shielding you were OK with that but not the issue. SANDERS: I have cast over 10,000 votes in my life. Very often pieces of legislation are complicated. There are good things in it, there are bad things in it. In this legislation there was something that I thought made sense, there are things in it that I think do not make sense. BASH: So, was the -- was the liability...(CROSSTALK)SANDERS: I said several months ago that I was rethinking that legislation and I think that that's what -- now Secretary Clinton obviously now feels herself in trouble. We started this campaign at 2 percent in the polls, some polls now have us winning in Iowa and New Hampshire. So, I think, you know, that it's fine that she wants to pick on this issue. I'm going to read -- you know, as I said, we are going to -- I said several months ago, we are going to work on changing that legislation, but you know what, there are one or two other issues that impact the American people. BASH: One that you've been talking about is health care.SANDERS: Right.BASH: The universal effectively, Medicare for all of us is what you call it. It wasn't just Hillary Clinton but actually her daughter...SANDERS: Her daughter.BASH: ... Chelsea Clinton went on the campaign trail and went after you directly by name. I want you to listen to this and then react.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHELSEA CLINTON, HILLARY CLINTON'S DAUGHTER: Because I don't want to live in a country that has an unequal health care system again. So, I don't want to empower republican governors to take away Medicaid to take away health insurance for low income and middle income working Americans. And I think very much that's what Senator Sanders plan would do.(END VIDEO CLIP) SANDERS: Well, unfortunately, I have to say as much as I admire Chelsea, she didn't read the plan. What Chelsea should know is that we are the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right. And yet, we end up spending far, far more per capita on health cap, as do the people of any other nation. Now what my plan would do is not only provide health care to all, it would save middle class families thousands of dollars and where she is absolutely wrong. This is a plan that works in 50 states in this country, whether you have conservative republicans or progressive democrats. It's a national program in 50 states. Governors cannot with -- deny the people in their states. BASH: So, when she and Hillary Clinton argue that you are going to turn over people's health care to republican governors are going to take away, she's flatten wrong? SANDERS: Yes. Flatten wrong. This is a program for 50 states. We want states to play a roll, but if states they don't go forward in the legislation that we introduce, then the federal government will provide the plan. BASH: Now your plan would cost a lot of money with equivalent with the -- with the -- they are at $15 trillion. SANDERS: Hold it. BASH: Go ahead.SANDERS: My plan will save thousands of dollars for every middle class family in this country. Save thousands of dollars. Because right now we pay far more per capita for health care than do the people of any other country. What has to be understood is when you move toward a Medicare for all - you're familiar with Medicare - it works very well for seniors. I think it should work for all people. And when we move to a Medicare for all system people are no longer going to have to pay private health -- private insurance companies. They're not going to have to pay premiums. In the long run, families will save substantial sums of money. BASH: You told me a couple of weeks ago that you are going to release your tax plan on this issue, this is part of your tax plan before people go to the caucuses in Iowa. That's less than three weeks away, is that still coming? SANDERS: Absolutely. If I said we're going to do it that's what we're going to do. BASH: OK.SANDERS: And what our tax plan will be is to say loudly and clearly that a time of massive income and wealth inequality, the wealthiest people and the largest corporations will start paying their fair share of taxes. BASH: OK. Another interview that was on CNN was my colleagues, Gloria Borger, she talked to Joe Biden who talked about Hillary Clinton and on the issue of income inequality. I want you to listen to that as well.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: Well, it's -- but it's relatively new for Hillary to talk about that. Hillary's focus has been on other things up until now and that's been Bernie -- no one questions Bernie's authenticity on those issues. (END VIDEO CLIP)[22:55:09] BASH: Is he right? Is Hillary Clinton late to the game on income inequality? SANDERS: I think, you know, Joe Biden and I both share and understanding that there is something fundamentally wrong when 20 wealthiest people in this country own more wealth than the bottom of 50 percent. Joe and I have been working on this issue for many, many years. I think it is fair to say that Hillary Clinton is new to this issue. BASH: Senator, thank you very much. I appreciate your time. Good to see you.SANDERS: Thank you. Back to you, Wolf and Anderson. BLITZER: Thanks very much, Dana. You know, Jake, he is very, very right, Bernie Sanders, when he says recent polls have shown that he is actually ahead of Hillary Clinton among the democrats, not only in New Hampshire but in Iowa as well. TAPPER: Not only that, but he's gaining nationally. A New York Times poll released today, CBS News-New York Times had them within I think five or six points of each other nationally which is a stunning turn of events given how commanding her national lead has been and how long she has been in public life. Bernie Sanders, still a relatively a fresh face on the -- on the national scene. His age notwithstanding. She really faces a tough challenge from him which is why you see her really going after him on this issue of guns. It's one of the only issues if not the only issue, where she actually can outflank him on the left on everything else she is more moderate to conservative than he is in terms of democratic policy. BLITZER: What did you think of Joe Biden's comments to Gloria about Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders? Because certainly those were -- I would assume irritating a bit to Hillary Clinton. TAPPER: Well, I think that the vice president has complicated feelings about the presidential race. He made it very clear. He thinks he would be a better president than anybody else running. He also doesn't see a path to the nomination for him because of Hillary Clinton. And I think that, look, there was a story that Maureen Dowd wrote in which Beau Biden, his now late son, was talking about the superiority of Biden values versus Clinton values. I think that sometimes he can't help himself. I think that he genuinely feels that Bernie Sanders is more sincere and has been more active in talking about wealth inequality than Hillary Clinton. But I think he also likes to zing her a little bit, because I think he feels that he would be a better president than she is and a better nominee. BLITZER: So many of Bernie Sanders supporters have said to me in recent days that they think that Bernie Sanders can do to Hillary Clinton what then Senator Barack Obama did to Hillary Clinton in 2008 capture the democratic presidential nomination. TAPPER: Well, you know what, it's so interesting is that it's similar in a lot of ways. The challenges posed by Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders. I think Barack Obama is much more unique politician than anyone else in the democratic field in the last 10 years. But that said, in terms of the way that the Clinton campaign didn't initially take Barack Obama's challenge as seriously as they should have. I think there is that same attitude towards Bernie Sanders. And I also think she is out there repeating the same arguments in some cases that were made by her and her campaign against Barack Obama, against Bernie Sanders, which is this argument about electability.And to be quite candid, the people in Iowa and New Hampshire, the democratic voters there, many you have them remember that, remember that she said he can't win. She said that about Barack Obama very strongly. They said it off the record, too. They really thought there was no way Barack Obama could ever be elected president. And to make that same statement about Bernie Sanders, even though they are very different candidates, Obama and Sanders, I think that might be a little bit troublesome. BLITZER: He's a self-avowed socialist, too. Seventy four years old, but you got to admit, he has done amazing so far. TAPPER: Well, he's been really good at capturing the hearts and minds of the democratic base. Liberals, progressives, young people, talking about teh issues that affect them day-to-day, their daily life, and frankly also, he is, as I said, a fresh face they don't necessarily know of him a lot of them, the way that they've known Hillary Clinton. She's been in public life since 1991. And while he has been in office for that long, if not longer, it's been a much less profile, a much lower profile type of situation. So, he is new and fresh, 74 years old, notwithstanding. BLITZER: Yes. It's hard to believe. And people didn't take him seriously at the beginning. But he has really, really stepped up over these past five, six months that his campaign is going on and he is doing remarkably well. Can she -- let's say hypothetically, she loses the Iowa caucuses, the New Hampshire primary, and then they move to South Carolina and Nevada and elsewhere, can she come back after two losses like that? TAPPER: Of course she can. And one of the reasons in that all of the negative stuff that voters know about Hillary Clinton, they don't know negative stuff about Bernie Sanders.[23:00:05] BLITZER: All right. Hold on for a moment. Jim Sciutto, our chief national security correspondent is here. You've got breaking news, what have you learn?"
